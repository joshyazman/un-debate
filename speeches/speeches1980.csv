"1",10,"AFG",35,1980,"ï»¿ Mr. President  allow me  on behalf of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan  to congratulate Mr. von Wechmar on his election to the high office of the presidency of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. We hope that under his chairmanship the current session will make a notable contribution to the cause of strengthening international peace and security. We should like to assure him that the Afghan delegation will fully cooperate with him and help him in every way to discharge his duties.113.	May we also express our appreciation to his predecessor  the prominent Tanzanian statesman and diplomat  Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim  for his skilful conduct of the deliberations of the last few sessions of the General Assembly.114.	We should like to pay a tribute to the Secretary General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  for his tireless efforts to make the United Nations more efficient in maintaining peace and security.115.	Permit me at the very beginning of my statement heartily to congratulate the delegations of the Republic of Zimbabwe and of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines on the admission of their newly born States to the United Nations. Their accession to independence is one more step towards the complete and final elimination of the obnoxious system of colonialism.116.	This session of the General Assembly has begun its deliberations at a time when the international situation is not as good as one would wish it to be. Certain quarters are desperately trying to reverse the course of world developments  to quell those healthy trends in international life which became known as detente or the relaxation of international tension and to bring the world back to the ill-famed time of the cold war.117.	The present international situation is characterized by an acute struggle between the forces coming out in defence of peace  strict respect for the rights of peoples and the lessening of international tension and those forces which propagate and practise violence  oppression  militarism and aggression.118.	Dangerous trends in world politics are visible enough and  unless they are stopped  the world could be brought to the brink of war. The main source of danger to world peace is the reckless and irresponsible policy of United States imperialism and the Beijing hegemonists. Seeking military supremacy over the socialist countries  the United States is stepping up the arms race  pressuring its allies into following the same course and trying to avoid the settlement of outstanding problems and disputes by peaceful means of negotiation.119.	Particularly worrisome are certain of the latest trends in the policy of the United States  namely the concept of a so-called limited nuclear war expounded by the Pentagon in the United States Presidential Directive. That concept is designed to blur the distinction between conventional and nuclear conflict and it may create fatal illusions.120.	Afghanistan is an Asian country and as such follows with concern the development of events on the great continent of Asia. On the one hand  the characteristic feature of political life in Asia is the strengthening of the will and determination of the peoples of the continent for peace and peaceful cc operation  for social progress and the consolidation of national sovereignty. On the other hand  one can see the dangerous activities of forces which are hostile to the course of freedom of the Asian peoples. Imperialists and Chinese hegemonists are seriously aggravating and complicating the situation in Asia.121.	Peace and security in Asia are threatened by continuing Israeli aggression against the Arab nations under the cover of separate deals supported by United States imperialism and by the fact that the Palestinian Arabs continue to be deprived of their national rights  including their rights to return to their homeland and to establish an independent sovereign national State.122.	Peace and security in Asia are threatened by an unprecedented build-up of United States military and naval forces in the Arabian Sea  the Gulf and the Red Sea. In recent months the United States has concentrated in those areas more than 30 naval vessels  including some aircraft carrier groups  several thousand Marines and hundreds of military aircraft. United States imperialism has already tried to use those forces to commit an act of outright aggression against the Islamic Republic of Iran.123.	Peace and security in Asia are threatened by the attempts of the Beijing hegemonists and United States imperialists to destabilize the situation in IndoChina  for which purpose they stage military provocations on the Sino Vietnamese border and provocative actions by the remnants of the Pol Pot bands against the People's Republic of Kampuchea.124.	Those are the real sources of tension and instability in Asia. The Democratic Republic of Afghanistan  together with all other peace-loving Asian countries  comes out in favour of normalization and the establishment of good neighbourly relations throughout the continent of Asia and for the elimination by peaceful means of hotbeds of tension and military conflicts.125.	The position of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan on a peaceful settlement in the Middle East is well known. It was recently spelled out in detail at the emergency special session of the General Assembly  devoted to the Palestinian question. 126.	Afghanistan resolutely condemns the separate behind the scenes deals between the Egyptian President and the Israeli Zionist clique. The capitulatory course of Sadat's regime and its separate treaty with Zionists have blocked the way to a just and lasting peace in the Middle East. Great damage has thus been done to the cause of the national independence of Arab and African peoples and  in the first place  to the just struggle of the Arab people of Palestine for their freedom and the restoration of their inalienable national rights.127.	A just and lasting peace in the Middle East can be established only on the following foundations: there must be complete and unconditional withdrawal of all Israeli troops from all the Arab territories occupied by Israel in 1967  including Jerusalem  and the elimination of all the consequences of the Israeli aggression; there must also be realization of the inalienable legitimate national rights of the Arab people of Palestine and  first of all  of their right to self-determination  including the establishment of their own independent and sovereign State and the recognition of the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the Arab people of Palestine  along with the participation of the PLO in all the stages of the Middle East settlement. The world community should demand strict implementation of resolution ES7/2 adopted by the General Assembly at its seventh emergency special session  devoted to Palestine  which reaffirmed the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian Arabs and demanded the complete and unconditional withdrawal of the Israeli troops from all the occupied Arab lands  to start before 15 November 1980.128.	Israeli aggression in the south of Lebanon  the victims of which are the civilian population and Palestinian refugees  must cease: longsuffering southern Lebanon should be protected from Israeli aggressors. The continued interference of Zionists in the internal affairs of the Lebanon  their attempts to split the country and to annex its southern part  should be resolutely condemned and effectively prevented.129.	The people and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan reject with indignation the decision of the Tel Aviv Knesset declaring Jerusalem to be the eternal and indivisible capital of Israel. It is a flagrant violation of all the relevant resolutions of the United Nations  including the resolution approved by the recent emergency special session on the Palestinian question. The outright and blatant annexation by Israel of a city most sacred to all Moslems and followers of other faiths cannot leave silent or indifferent any Moslems or any peace-loving people throughout the world.130.	The Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan is of the opinion that the Security Council should without further delay take the most effective measures  including the sanctions provided for in Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations  in order to prevent Israel from moving its capital to Jerusalem. The restoration of the Holy City of Jerusalem to Arab sovereignty is an indispensable condition for a durable peace in the Middle East. All those who try to block such a decision of the Security Council by misusing their right of veto will deeply hurt the feelings and sentiments of hundreds of millions of Moslems and be held responsible for all the consequences of such an act.131.	The Democratic Republic of Afghanistan condemns the unprecedented military and naval build-up of the United States in the Indian Ocean  the Arabian Sea  the Gulf and the Red Sea  which has been continuing for more than a year now. We expires our concern over the feverish activity of the Pentagon aimed at the expansion of the existing United States bases in those areas  particularly the base on Diego Garcia  and the establishment of new ones. The agreements to this effect recently concluded between the United States and Oman  Somalia  Egypt and Kenya are causing concern to the other countries of the area and all peace-loving peoples of Asia. These moves create a direct threat of armed interference in the internal affairs of the oil rich countries of the Middle East  the Gulf area and the Indian Ocean region.132.	The American military and naval build up in the Indian Ocean  the Arabian Sea  the Gulf and the Red Sea runs counter to the numerous decisions of the United Nations  the OAU and the nonaligned movement relating to the transformation of the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace. It is very important  therefore  to facilitate concrete measures aimed at reaching this goal. Afghanistan for its part is ready to cooperate actively in this with other countries of the area and will take part in the international Conference on the Indian Ocean  to be held at Colombo in 1981 within the United Nations framework.133.	The Democratic Republic of Afghanistan is following with concern the events in Southeast Asia. The Afghan people resolutely condemn the armed provocations of Chinese hegemonists against the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  the Lao People's Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of Kampuchea. We wholeheartedly support the constructive proposals concerning the settlement of the situation in Southeast Asia put forward by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Viet Nam  Laos and Kampuchea. The three States have expressed their readiness to sign with Thailand bilateral or multilateral treaties of nonaggression  non-interference in each other's internal affairs and refusal to allow anybody to use their territory as a base against the other contracting parties. We welcome other initiatives of the three Indo-China States aimed at creating a zone of peace and stability in Southeast Asia.134.	Democratic Republic of Afghanistan condemns the continuing illegal presence in the United Nations of the Pol Pot henchmen. We demand the restoration of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of Kampuchea in the United Nations. Only the People's Revolutionary Council of Kampuchea  which enjoys the support of all the Kampuchean people and exercises complete control over the country  has the right to represent Kampuchea in the world arena  the United Nations and other international bodies.135.	Imperialist and hegemonist quarters try to cover up their aggressive schemes in Asia by making a great hue and cry about events in Afghanistan and around it. But it must be clear to any impartial observer that Afghanistan and the Afghan people do not constitute any threat to anyone.136.	Having launched their national democratic anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolution in April 1978  the people of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan are engaged in the creative labour of eliminating the vestiges of the outdated feudal system and building a new society free from exploitation of man by man. This course was chosen by the Afghan people of their own free will and they will defend their freedom  independence  national dignity and honour to the last drop of their blood.137.	As a nonaligned country  Afghanistan steadfastly pursues a policy of peace  friendship and cooperation with all countries willing to reciprocate. Article 12 of the Fundamental Principles of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistanâthe provisional constitution of the country reads as follows:""The Democratic Republic of Afghanistan  a peace loving country  will make serious efforts to protect and strengthen friendly relations with other countries  especially the neighbouring nations and all Moslem countries and States  on the basis of mutual respect for one another's national independence  national sovereignty  territorial integrity and non-interference in one another's internal affairs.""138.	Babrak Karmal  Secretary General of the Central Committee of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan  President of the Revolutionary Council and Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan said recently:""Afghanistan is a steadfast advocate of peace and friendship among various independent nations... and aspires to peaceful settlement of misunderstandings and problems among nations and States of the region and of the world.""139.	We regret to say that these peaceful aspirations of the Afghan people have not been reciprocated in certain quarters. Since the very beginning of the April revolution  imperialism  Chinese hegemonism and some reactionary regimes of the area have been engaged in hostile activities against Afghanistan. They help in every possible way the counterrevolutionary gangs which have taken refuge in the neighbouring countries; they supply them with modern weapons and military hardware; they send their instructors to train armed bandits  who daily intrude into the territory of Afghanistan  kill innocent people  including women  children and the elderly  burn schools and hospitals and murder teachers and doctors.140.	Unfortunately  all these hostile activities emanating from the territories of the neighbouring countries are conducted with the connivance and even tacit support and encouragement of the authorities of these countries.141.	The Afghan people and army  under the leadership of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan  could easily suppress the resistance of the counterrevolution  if it were not for the broad and active support of these forces by imperialism  especially United States imperialism  Chinese hegemonists and some reactionary Islamic regimes. Because of this support  the scope and intensity of foreign aggression and other forms of interference in the internal affairs of Afghanistan have been continuously increasing.142.	Armed aggression from the outside and other forms of foreign interference reached such proportions that the Revolutionary Council of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan had to ask the Soviet Union to send a limited contingent of troops to render assistance to the Afghan army in repelling outside aggression. This contingent was dispatched to Afghanistan upon the request of the Revolutionary Council and on the basis of the existing and valid Afghan Soviet Treaty of Friendship  Good Neighbourliness and Cooperation of 5 December 1978  and in accordance with Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations to help Afghan armed forces to defend the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan.143.	The hostile activities from the territories of Pakistan and Iran notwithstanding  the Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan has on many occasions expressed its willingness and sincere desire to have normal  friendly relations with its neighbours. The peoples of Afghanistan  Iran and Pakistan have centuries old traditional  historical  cultural and economic ties with common roots and a common heritage. There is nothing to divide them; they may happily live in peace and friendship. It is only the imperialists that try to divide us so as to rule in our part of the world.144.	On 14 May of this year we put forward an elaborate programme for the political settlement of the situation that has developed around Afghanistan and the normalization of relations with Iran and Pakistan by peaceful means  by direct bilateral negotiations. The objective of such a political settlement should be guaranteed complete termination and non- resumption of all acts of armed aggression against Afghanistan and other forms of interference from the outside directed against the Government and people of Afghanistan. Negotiations on political settlement and normalization of relations with Pakistan and Iran can be held only on the basis of strict respect for the sovereignty and sovereign rights of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan.145.	The question of the withdrawal of the limited Soviet military contingent from Afghanistan should be resolved within the context of a political settlement. The cessation and guaranteed non-recurrence of military incursions and all other forms of interference in the internal affairs of Afghanistan would eliminate the reasons which prompted Afghanistan to request the Soviet Union to send that contingent into its territory.146.	The constructive peaceful proposals of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan to that effect were widely acclaimed by progressive and peace-loving forces all over the world. They were positively assessed by the realistic and sober-minded statesmen in some Western countries. Now it is up to the Governments at Teheran and Islamabad to respond to those proposals.147.	The taking of practical steps in the direction of political settlement around Afghanistan and the improvement of the situation in that area have been facilitated by the withdrawal from Afghanistan  by agreement with the Afghan Government  of those Soviet troops the presence of which was no longer necessary given the conditions of continuing stabilization of the situation in the country. That stabilization is the result of serious defeats sustained by the counterrevolutionary bands sent in from the outside.148.	We are ready to sit down at the negotiating table as soon as Pakistan and Iran are ready to do so. But it goes without saying that the conduct of negotiations should not be accompanied by the continuance of hostile activities against Afghanistan from their territories.149.	We are well aware that all sorts of obstacles in the way to such settlement are being created by the United States as well as by the Chinese hegemonists  who for these purposes use the ruling circles of Pakistan and some reactionary circles in Iran.150.	But we are quite confident that the trend towards political settlement will eventually prevail  and that that will have a positive effect on the situation in the area and improve the political climate in the world as a whole.151.	Afghanistan  having friendly relations with Iraq  and being a neighbour of Iran  is following with deep concern the armed conflict between those two countries. We sincerely hope that the Governments of Iraq and Iran will desist from steps that may cause the situation to worsen still further  and that they will find peaceful ways and means of resolving their dispute.152.	That is the position of principle of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan on the issue of the elimination of hotbeds of tension in Asia in general and around Afghanistan in particular. We are grateful to all friendly countries  and to Cuba and India in particular  that have made sincere efforts to use their good offices to facilitate a peaceful political settlement of the situation in the region.153.	It is a plain truth that durable peace and the irreversible process of detente are inconceivable unless effective measures are taken to curb the arms race and to start effective disarmament. It is a sad comment that more than $400 billion is spent annually on armaments while hundreds of millions of people go hungry and the gap between developing and developed countries is increasing at an alarming rate.154.	It must be noted though that  thanks to the relentless efforts of the socialist and other peace-loving countries and in spite of the stubborn resistance of those in imperialist and hegemonistic quarters  it has been possible to make some tangible advance in certain directions towards stopping the arms race.155.	But many important problems on which mankind's peaceful future and progress depend have not yet been resolved  especially in the field of ending the arms race  which continues to intensify  thus increasingly threatening the process of detente  peace and the security of peoples.156.	Therefore Afghanistan wholeheartedly supports the initiatives and proposals put forward last May by the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty  in particular the proposal to hold in the near future  at the highest level  a meeting of leaders of States of all the regions of the world. Afghanistan agrees that such a meeting should concentrate on key issues of international life and chart ways to eliminate pockets of international tension and to prevent the outbreak of war.157.	Of great significance would be the entry into force of the SALT II treaty  ratification of which continues to be delayed by the United States. Very important also are negotiations on limiting medium range missile systems in Europe  simultaneously and in organic interrelation with the United States forward based nuclear systems.158.	There are a number of vitally important items on the agenda of the current session directly related to disarmament and the curbing of the nuclear arms race. My delegation would like to comment briefly on them.159.	It goes without saying that a major goal of the United Nations should be to facilitate termination of the arms race and gradual transition to arms reduction. Of paramount importance is termination of the nuclear arms race  which constitutes a threat to the very existence of mankind.160.	There is a good basis for negotiations on stopping the nuclear arms race and on disarmamentâthat is  the realistic set of proposals put forward by the USSR and other socialist countries  which embrace practically every aspect of this problem. Among them is a proposal to hold negotiations with the participation of all nuclear Powers and some non-nuclear States on the cessation of the production of nuclear weapons of all types and the gradual reduction of their stockpiles until they are completely liquidated. It is logical that simultaneously appropriate international legal guarantees of the security of States be worked out. An important step in that direction would be a treaty on the non-use of force in international relations.161.	Year after year the United Nations General Assembly has kept approving a resolution on the urgent need for the cessation of the testing of nuclear weapons  calling upon nuclear weapon States to expedite the conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. We highly appreciate the constructive flexible position of the Soviet Union on this issue and call upon other participants in the negotiations to be as flexible in order to reach an agreement on this vitally important issue as soon as possible.162.	In the context of curbing the nuclear arms race  it is urgent to strengthen still further the regime of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Although 112 States have acceded to that Treaty  it is very important to make it truly universal. We are still far from that goal  for there are now 154 States Members of the United Nations  to say nothing of States non-members.163.	The delegation of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan expresses great concernâand we are confident that this concern is shared by the world communityâover the attempts of Israel and South Africa to get access to nuclear weapon technology. At this session the General Assembly should consider the experts' report on this issue  and stringent measures should be taken to prevent such an eventuality.164.	The cause of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons would be considerably advanced if two important steps were taken: namely  the conclusion of an international convention on the strengthening of security guarantees for non-nuclear States and an agreement on the non-stationing of nuclear weapons in the territories of States where there are no such weapons at present.165.	Non-proliferation of nuclear weapons can also be promoted by the creation of nuclear weapon free zones in various parts of the world: in Southeast Asia  Africa  the Middle East  and Latin America. The Democratic Republic of Afghanistan strongly supports that idea and is in favour of practical measures in that direction.166.	We follow with concern the reports on the attempts by Pakistan to gain access to nuclear weapon technology. Should this happen  it may aggravate the tension in the area still further.167.	Apart from nuclear weapons  there are other sophisticated weapons of highly destructive and lethal power. The delegation of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan notes with regret the rather slow progress in the Soviet American negotiations aimed at outlawing chemical weapons: that is mainly the result of the position of the United States delegation. We hope that the current session will approve a resolution helping to solve this question.168.	This session  in our view  should facilitate practical steps for reaching an agreement on the prohibition of the development and production of new types of weapons of mass destruction and new systems of such weapons  as well as give an additional impetus to the negotiations on banning radiological weapons and highly inhumane neutron weapons.169.	Afghanistan supports steps aimed at banning new types of conventional arms having a great destructive potential  in particular an agreement by the permanent members of the Security Council and their allies to renounce the build-up of their armed forces and conventional arms.170.	It is the firm view of the Afghan delegation that the measures to which I have referred  aimed at curbing the race in conventional and nuclear weapons  should become an integral part of the programme of action of the second Disarmament Decade. An important role could be played in this respect by the second special session of the General Assembly on disarmament  scheduled for 1982  and the World Disarmament Conference. In our view  the World Disarmament Conference has to be convened soon after the special session. We hope that the 1980s will be a decade of substantial progress on the way to guaranteeing lasting peace and security in the world.171.	In the present complicated world situation  no effort should be spared to defuse the tension  to improve the international situation and to arrest the adverse course of developments. It is in that context that we welcome the proposal of the Soviet Union to include in the agenda of this session the item entitled ""Urgent measures for reducing the danger of war"".172.	The measures to this effect provided for in the Soviet draft resolution  when implemented  will ease the burden of military expenditures of States  strengthen the regime of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and create favourable conditions for a breakthrough in the field of curbing the arms race and disarmament. The Afghan delegation is therefore willing to support this draft resolution.173.	We also support the proposal of the USSR aimed at ensuring greater care and concern by States for the conservation of the earth's nature. Today  Mother Nature is primarily a victim of the arms race  and the most effective way to protect her is to curb the arms race  particularly the nuclear arms race.174.	The Democratic Republic of Afghanistan belongs to the nonaligned movement  which is a considerable positive factor in present-day international politics. Within the non-aligned movement  the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan  together with other progressive nonaligned countries  struggles for the strengthening of peace and international security  the implementation of disarmament  the creation of zones of peace  the liquidation of foreign military bases on the territories of others  for the inadmissibility of any outside interference in the internal affairs of States and the creation of a new international economic order on a just and democratic basis.175.	Twenty years have passed since the adoption by the United Nations of the historic Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. The face of the world has changed radically during those 20 years. More than 100 countries have acceded to independence since then  and the United Nations membership has increased accordingly. The colonial system is practically dead  but not yet buried; there are still vestiges of colonialism and racism in some parts of the world. The ugly face of neo-colonialism still exists as well. The abhorrent and inhuman regime of apartheid still survives in South Africa.176.	The best way for this Assembly to mark the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples is to take effective and resolute measures to do away completely and irrevocably with the last vestiges of colonialism  neo-colonialism  racism and apartheid. The best way to do that is to extend all possible assistance to all the peoples and their national liberation movements that are still fighting against these evils for their freedom  self-determination and independence  for their dignity and honour.177.	We stand side by side with our African brothers  and we support the heroic people of Namibia who  under the leadership of SWAPO  are fighting against the South African occupation force for their freedom  self-determination and independence.178.	We express our solidarity with the people of South Africa who are waging a valiant struggle against the brutal apartheid regime of Pretoria. Effective decisions aimed at the further economic  political and diplomatic isolation of that regime and of those countries which support it must be taken at this session.179.	The Democratic Republic of Afghanistan supports the struggle of the people of Western Sahara  under the leadership of the POLISARIO Front  for self-determination and independence.180.	Afghanistan condemns the brutal repression of the people of South Korea by the despotic Seoul regime and the continuing occupation of South Korea by United States troops. The Democratic Republic of Afghanistan supports the just and persistent efforts of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea aimed at the peaceful and democratic reunification of Korea.181.	The General Assembly  in our view  should denounce the attempts by the United States to annex the territory of Micronesia under various pretexts and thus to deprive the Micronesian people of their legitimate right to self-determination and independence. Such a step would be a violation of Article 76 of the Charter of the United Nations.182.	We express our solidarity with the peoples of Latin America and the Caribbean in their struggle against imperialist intrigues and attempts to destabilize the situation in some countries of that area. Our sympathy goes to the peoples of Chile  Bolivia and El Salvador who are fighting the military dictatorships in those countries. We denounce those quarters which give military and financial support to these reactionary and brutally repressive regimes.183.	Afghanistan invariably and consistently advocates the maintenance of the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus and strict respect for its policy of nonalignment. A realistic and viable settlement of the Cyprus problem should provide for the withdrawal of foreign troops from the island and the removal of all foreign military bases. A just and lasting solution of this problem is possible only on the basis and within the framework of the relevant decisions of the United Nations.184.	The vestiges of neo-colonialist exploitation are felt most of all in the sphere of international economic relations. The iron grip of the transnational corporations on the economy of the developing countries and the selfish  greedy economic policies and discriminatory protectionist measures of the developed capitalist countries are the main obstacles in the way of the economic growth and development of the majority of countries of Asia  Africa  Latin America and the Caribbean. We regret that the imperialist countries have not shown the desired response and political will vis-Ã -vis the proposals and suggestions put forward at the recent eleventh special session of the General Assembly  devoted to the economic development decade. In order to break the resistance and opposition of imperialist monopolies to the establishment of new  equitable and just economic relations based on truly democratic principles  unity is needed between the developing countries  the socialist countries and all progressive forces of the world.185.	Afghanistan considers the United Nations to be an indispensable instrument for maintaining international peace and security  and we shall continue our efforts towards enhancing its effectiveness on the basis of strict observance of the Charter and a further strengthening of its role in responding effectively and promptly to situations which tend to threaten world peace and security.186.	In concluding my statement  I should like to express the hope of my delegation that the first General Assembly session of the 1980s will make a tangible and positive contribution to the solution of outstanding acute world problems and will make the world a safer and better place to live in.187.	I assure members that Afghanistan will spare no effort to bring the world nearer to a lasting peace; to put a reliable  ironclad barrier in the way of those who would like to drag mankind into a new confrontation; to preserve detente; and to save present and succeeding generations from the scourge of war."
"2",49,"AGO",35,1980,"ï»¿282.	I wish to begin by conveying to the President  on behalf of the People's Republic of Angola  our warm congratulations upon his election to the presidency of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. This significant choice is undoubtedly a recognition of his distinguished personal and diplomatic qualities and merits. We wish him the greatest possible success in the exercise of his difficult task.283.	I should also like to convey to Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim our deep appreciation for his brilliant performance as President of the thirty-fourth session and reaffirm to him our pride at the farsighted and dignified manner in which he performed his task  thus enhancing the prestige not only of the United Republic of Tanzania but  above all  of the African continent.284.	Furthermore  we wish to express to the Secretary General of the United Nations  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  our most profound gratitude for his tireless efforts to find the most just and appropriate solutions to the serious problems confronting the international community and pay him a tribute for his perseverance and his courage in the many contacts undertaken with those who feel directly concerned in the delicate situation prevailing in southern Africa.285.	At this time  as the thirty-fifth session is beginning its work  the world is in an extremely complicated  delicate and dangerous situation because there is considerable aggravation of direct confrontations between numerous peoples and those who support imperialism  neo-colonialism  colonialism  expansionism  Zionism  apartheid and the exploitation of man by man.286.	Two years ago  from this very rostrum we declared that the disturbing situation at that time might get even worse and deteriorate indefinitely as long as the Governments of certain Western Powers well known to us failed strictly to respect the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the Charter of the OAU and the principles of nonalignment; as long as they continued to foment colonial wars and to perpetrate acts of aggression of all kinds  directly or indirectly  against independent States; as long as they continued to proliferate plots against the sovereignty and security of States; as long as they continued their economic pillage of the underdeveloped countries and persisted in preventing a gradual reduction of the gap that is ceaselessly growing between the affluent or developed countries and the poor or underdeveloped countries; as long as they imposed military bases in the farthest corners of the globe  bases generally maintained against the will of the peoples concerned; as long as they persisted in thwarting the serious efforts of the socialist and progressive and democratic forces to bring about detente  general and complete disarmament and a comprehensive ban on the manufacture and use of weapons of mass destruction  particularly nuclear weapons  including the neutron bomb; as long as they failed to comply with resolutions adopted by international bodies that clearly stipulated that it was imperative to make the Indian Ocean an effective zone of peace; as long as they continued to devote astronomical sums to the arms race instead of judiciously setting aside those same sums for the economic and social development of the developing countries; and as long as they strove to thwart the establishment of a new international economic order in spite of the principles already enunciated by the nonaligned movement.287.	Today we note with the gravest concern that those positions remain unchanged and that consequently there must be coherent unity of action against those who alone are responsibleâthat is  the Western Governments and their alliesâfor the growing tragedy of all human beings subjected to exploitation  oppression and injustice.288.	Thus  it is time for the millions of human beings still without freedom or the right to choose their own future to be able to avail themselves of ways and means of fighting servitude  humiliation  tyranny  poverty  hunger  ignorance and disease.289.	It is time for all developing peoples to take resolute action in the fight against imperialism  colonialism  neo-colonialism  zionism  expansionism  apartheid and the exploitation of man by man so as to be able freely to choose their economic  political  social and cultural systems free from intimidation or pressure. It is time for them to take into their own hands their own natural resources and to exploit them for their own benefit and not for the benefit of multinational corporations. It is time for them flatly to reject all forms of subordination and dependence on any Power and all interference and all pressure  be it political  economic or military. It is time for them to demand  in combined and concerted fashion  the dismantling of foreign military bases on the territories of their countries which have been established against their will. It is time for them to make an effective contribution to the safeguarding of international peace and security and the easing of international tension. It is time for them to make a further effort to find effective means of mobilizing their human  financial  organizational and technological resources  thus laying a solid foundation for mutual economic cooperation in the raw materials field and in trade  transport  industry  agriculture  fisheries  health  insurance and so on.290.	In a word  it is timeâand perhaps all that is necessary is for all the nonaligned countries without exception decisively to put into effect the final Declaration and the Programme of Action for economic cooperation approved at the historic Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-aligned Countries  held at Havana  from 3 to 9 September 197924 for the serious problems besetting the world today to be properly resolved. That is our hope and our conviction.291.	Permit us to dwell at rather greater length on the problems of detente  disarmament  the nuclear threat and the arms race  because these are the major concerns of the countries that love peace and justice. Once again we are obliged to repeat ourselves. Considerable and praiseworthy efforts have been made  particularly by the socialist countries  to bring about detente and disarmament  to stave off the nuclear threat and to halt the arms race. If detente  which is so ardently desired  is to be meaningful and effective it is indispensable for it to lead to the eliminate f all sources of tension and the halting of aggression  for interference and the political and economic exploitation of the weakest countries  as well as to the adoption of serious and concrete measures by all in the field of disarmament.292.	In so far as concerns general and complete disarmament  it is imperative for negotiations to continue towards the establishment of treaties or conventions designed to save mankind from the disastrous consequences of an unbridled arms race as well as major or minor wars. Once and for all  all nuclear Powers in particular must undertake to embark upon the gradual destruction of their arsenals of nuclear weapons and to adhere to and respect the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.293.	We all know that the international situation is one of extreme tension. Over and above the factors I have mentioned  we must bear in mind the escalation of the cold war started by the United States Administration following the important victories won by the struggling peoples which have frustrated its shameful policy of domination and exploitation. Many threats of aggression  of military intervention  of economic sanctions were then forthcoming from the imperialist Powers.294.	That climate of tension was to encourage a certain number of States to engage in an arms race  which is something that has always been of benefit to the Governments of imperialist Powers because of the fabulous profits they earn through their military consortia; and  apart from that  it served certain electoral interests  particularly in the United States of America.295.	Within the same context  certain representatives of Western Powers have frequently donned the mantle of champions of human rights  but that has always been a matter of opportunism  transient interests or the needs of their constituents.296.	If  from the point of view of credibility  the words they have uttered reflect a coherent attitude of action and determination on the part of their Governments to defend human rights  we would venture formally to call upon them to render every kind of assistance to the Namibian peoples and to the South Africans  the Sahraoui  the Palestinians  the Mauberes of East Timor  the Chileans  the Uruguayans  the Salvadorians  the Kampucheans and the Puerto Ricans  as well as all other fighting against tyranny  oppression  exploitation  social injustice and racial discrimination; and we would call upon them at the same time to denounce the regimes that are oppressing those peoples; to lift the economic blockade imposed upon Cuba and denounce the pressure exerted on and the threats uttered against the Cuban revolution; to halt all economic and military support for dictatorial racist and Fascist regimes; and to reduce  considerably and steadily  their military budgets and thus to help the peoples of the underdeveloped countries to combat famine  poverty  disease  illiteracy  unemployment and so on.297.	In reviewing the situation that prevails in the African continent  we note with regret that one of the fundamental objectives of the OAU has not yet been achievedâthe total liberation of Africa.298.	Who is to blame for this? Not the OAU. Once again  the responsibility lies with the imperialist Powers  inasmuch as they are pursuing their aggressive policy to perpetuate or extend their domination and exploitation of the African nations and to destabilize States that oppose their plans. In the context of southern Africa  one people  that of Zimbabwe  has also just seized its independence after a fierce armed struggle. Today  Zimbabwe is a sovereign State  a member of the OAU  of the United Nations and of the nonaligned movement. The People's Republic of Angola rejoices at this happy event and reiterates its congratulations to the people and leaders of Zimbabwe  who have fought so valiantly and have thwarted all manoeuvres designed to set up a puppet regime.299.	In the same region another people  that of Namibia  is awaiting the historic moment when it will regain its inalienable right to freedom and independence within the territorial integrity of its own country.300.	During the last 20 years  numerous relevant resolutions have been adopted by various international bodies recognizing  on the one hand  the right of the Namibian people to self-determination and independence and  on the other hand  denouncing or condemning the illegal occupation of Namibia by the criminal South African regime  with its shameful system of apartheid  which is an intolerable and flagrant violation of human rights and the rights of peoples  its unacceptable arrogance and scorn for the international community and its organizations  and the lavish support afforded by certain Western Powers.301.	Ever since the establishment of the United Nations Council for Namibia in May 1967 as the legal Administering Authority of Namibia until its independence and as the decision-making organ of the United Nations for that Territory  the Pretoria regime and its accomplices have striven to obstruct the fulfilment of the Council's mandate and have arranged a series of manoeuvres designed to delay for as long as possible the inevitable independence of Namibia. Throughout all these years  the Namibian people  under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO]  it sole and legitimate representative  has been carrying on an armed struggle for national liberation and has achieved considerable success.302.	What is the situation today? If  on the one hand  the United Nations  and particularly its Secretary General  the OAU  and particularly the frontline countries and the nonaligned countries  as international organizations  have bent every effort to finding a just solution to the Namibian problem  on the other hand  the racist and Fascist Pretoria regime  which not only enjoys the support of certain Western Powers and Israel in the economic  military and nuclear fields  but which also  and consequently  takes advantage of their lack of determination  their selfishness and their hypocrisy  has continued insolently to defy the international community  to be intolerably rude and arrogant towards the Secretary General of the United Nations  to intensify its criminal aggression against countries bordering on Namibia  in particular the People's Republic of Angola  and to set up a so-called Ministerial Council  loyal to it  in order to keep SWAPO out of the process of independence.303.	Since the efforts of all of us seem to be directed more clearly towards the search for a negotiated settlement of the Namibian question under the auspices of the United Nations  we must necessarily and unambiguously give all the necessary support to the Secretary General so that he may have every possibility of ensuring the earliest possible implementation of the plan established by the United Nations in Security Council resolution 435 (1978).304.	However  if the South African regime  by its stubbornness  frustrates the solution of the Namibian question by means of negotiations  that will mean the choice of war  and as a consequence that regime and certain Western Powers will bear the very heavy responsibility for the disastrous consequences of such a choice. Whatever the circumstances  our support for SWAPO will be unswerving.305.	Allow me to remind this Assembly that the material damage to the People's Republic of Angola caused by the invasion by South African armed forces in 1975 and 1976 has been evaluated at $6.7 billion  as was pointed out by the present Head of State of Angola in his first address at this rostrum in December 1976  speaking as the Minister for Foreign Affairs. On that occasion  he proposed for the consideration of the United Nations General Assembly the creation of an international fund for national reconstruction of some $300 million  but this was not given the slightest attention by the international community. I would also venture to add that the material damage from 1978 to the present day has been estimated to amount to $200 million. With rare exceptions  international solidarity in our regard has amounted to only indifference or inaction.306.	The People's Republic of Angola reaffirms its determination to cooperate closely with the United Nations Secretary General to ensure that the parties to the conflict  namely  the South African regime and SWAPO  resolutely undertake to seek a negotiated solution to the Namibian question.307.	The firm and hard line we have taken may seem surprising  but it is difficult  if not impossible  for us to translate into diplomatic language the feelings of genuine revulsion of the heroic people of Angola in the face of the enormous sacrifices it has already made and the extremely high price it is still paying  almost alone  in thousands of human lives lost and in material damage  in order to fulfil its international duty and to comply with the relevant resolutions of international bodies with regard to Namibia  that the people of Namibia may also become free and independent.308.	In South Africa  as everyone knows  the internal situation is gradually getting worse  thanks to the persistent fight being waged by the numerous and valiant militants of the African National Congress against the last bastion of imperialism in the African continent. At the same time  the internal contradictions of the apartheid regime are becoming aggravated because of this very struggle for national liberation. What we need then is concrete and growing solidarity with the valiant fighters of the African National Congress.309.	In Western Sahara  the heroic Sahraoui people under the leadership of the POLISARIO Front  its sole and lawful representative is continuing its relentless struggle against Moroccan occupation to recover its inalienable right to self-determination  independence and national sovereignty. The recognition of the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic by a considerable number of countries  especially African countries  makes it abundantly clear that final victory is near.310.	Thus it is with justified hope that we await  within the framework of the OAU and in cooperation with the United Nations  through the Ad Hoc Committee of Heads of State and Government on Western Sahara  the necessary political solution following the recent deliberations held by that Committee  which met at Freetown from 9 to 12 September this year . The Sahraoui people will triumph. The considerable success won both in the military field and in the diplomatic field justifies this assurance of ours.311.	We should not like to leave the African continent without referring  however briefly  to the tragedy which has afflicted the people of Chad as a consequence of numerous instances of foreign intervention. We appeal to the international community to provide urgent financial and humanitarian assistance to the Government of National Union  either directly or through the OAU  and also to neighbouring countries which have given shelter to thousands of refugees  thus enabling the people of Chad themselves to solve their own problems.312.	In the Asian and Latin American continents  we find a proliferation of sources of tension fomented essentially by North American imperialism.313.	With regard to the development of the situation in the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan  it is our belief that the concrete proposals contained in the statement of its Government made on 15 May 1980 provide a valid means of seeking the necessary solution  that is to say a negotiated political solution. The taking into account of these points by the neighbouring countries  namely  Pakistan and Iran  pursuant to the principle of the settlement of disputes by peaceful means  would make it possible to normalize relations among the three nonaligned countries and to promote a climate of harmony and stability in the area.314.	For its part  the valiant people of the People's Republic of Kampuchea has since last year scored some very important and indisputable successes in the consolidation of its revolutionary process and control over its territory  as well as in the fields of agriculture  education and health care. The circulation of the new national currency is also a significant step for the economy of the country. The gradual recovery from the shock caused to the Kampuchean people by the murder of 3 million of its people  its compatriots  committed by the criminal regime that was overthrown  deserves all our admiration  which we wish to convey to the leaders of the People's Republic of Kampuchea.315.	It is  however  regrettable and unthinkable that the legitimate representatives of the Kampuchean people should still not be occupying their proper place in all international bodies and that in the meantime we  the nonaligned countries  have not been able to gain the endorsement at the United Nations of the decision taken at Havana at the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-aligned Countries  namely  to keep the seat empty until it has been determined to which of the two parties that empty seat belongs. Sooner or later  justice will be done.316.	In spite of the persistent efforts of the heroic Korean people to reunify their country by peaceful means and without any outside interference in their internal affairs  it is with indignation that we note the continuation of imperialist manoeuvring aimed at establishing two Koreas. We demand the unconditional withdrawal of foreign troops stationed in the southern part of Korea  the replacement of the Armistice Agreement  by a long-term peace agreement and the dismantling of the military bases that exist there so as to enable the whole Korean people to bring to fruition the three principles essential to their future: independence  peaceful reunification and broad national unity.317.	With regard to the situation prevailing in East Timor  it is deplorable and unacceptable that foreign troops belonging to a member of the nonaligned movement should have continued to occupy part of the territoryâthe capital  as a matter of factâof the Democratic Republic of East Timor ever since the proclamation of its independence in 1975 following the withdrawal of the former administering Power  without the legal and political status of the territory having been established. For five years the people of East Timor  under the leadership of their lawful representative  FRETILIN have been waging an armed struggle to recover national sovereignty and territorial integrity  although in extremely difficult circumstances marked by a lack of external logistic bases  a lack of replacements of heavy weaponry and modern antiaircraft weapons  a lack of financial assistance and the incomprehensible inaction of the progressive community.318.	In order to prove  should proof be needed  the gradual development of the armed struggle of the Maubere people against the Indonesian military occupation  it is sufficient to refer  by way of example  to a large-scale attack carried out by 300 FRETILIN fighters on the night of 10 to 11 June 1980 at Dili  the capital of the country. In six hours of fighting  the television station was damaged and two military barracks were taken by storm and occupied for several hours. Three days later  the Indonesian leaders landed at Dili 40 tanks and a large contingent of marines and commandos.319.	East Timor is obviously a problem of decolonization. Like the Palestinian and Namibian peoples  the Maubere people are still prevented from exercising their right to independence because of Indonesian military occupation  in spite of the resolutions adopted by organs of the United Nations and by the nonaligned movement.320.	A few days ago the Portuguese Government decided to shoulder once again its obligations and responsibilities with regard to East Timor  and it formally reaffirmed the right of the people of that country to self-determination. We would venture to hope that the Portuguese Government will undertake effectively and with determination and courage to make every effort to put an end to the Indonesian military occupation and to ensure the transfer of power to the people of the Democratic Republic of East Timor. There is no other way. It is now the duty of all countries and all international organizations which identify with the struggle of peoples to render every kind of assistance to the people of East Timor.321.	In the Middle East  the data of the problem remain unchanged  although the consequences are becoming ever more serious for the Arab peoples. As long as the legitimate rights of the Arab people of Palestine to recover its country  usurped by Israel  and to establish an independent State are not duly recognized by everyone  as long as Israel does not withdraw from all the occupied Arab territories  as long as it continues its criminal raids and its acts of aggression against Lebanon  as long as it continues to establish settlements in the occupied Palestinian or Arab territories  as long as the United States of America in particular continues to support Israel in all possible ways in its annexationist ambitions  as long as the city of Jerusalem is not restored in its entirety to the Arab nation  as long as the so-called Camp David accords and the Egypt Israel peace Treaty represent a partial and separate commitment which fails to take into account the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people and is consequently a flagrant violation of the resolutions adopted by various international bodies  there will never be a just and lasting peace. However  we are convinced that the solution of the Palestinian question and of the Middle East problem lies fundamentally in the hands of the Arab countries if they jointly make up their minds to make use of all the advantages at their disposal against all those who support Israel.322.	We reaffirm our unswerving support for the Palestinian people and its sole legitimate representative  the PLO.323.	We should also like to take this opportunity to express our unswerving support for the people and the Government of the Republic of Cyprus in their just struggle to safeguard their independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity  unity and nonalignment.324.	In Latin America  substantial and positive changes have taken place thanks to the valiant struggle being waged by its peoples. The Cuban revolution has been firmly consolidated and constitutes an undeniable source of inspiration for all struggling peoples  in spite of the economic blockade imposed by the American imperialists and the unjustifiable maintenance of the naval base at Guantanamo. It is time to put an end to these constant threats and acts of aggression against Cuba.325.	The revolutionary process in Nicaragua is proceeding towards the building of a future in keeping with the interests of the Nicaraguan people and we rejoice at their brilliant successes in national reconstruction.326.	We warmly welcome the victories won by the people of San Salvador and by its vanguard organization  the Revolutionary Democratic Front  as well as those of the Puerto Rican and Chilean peoples in their struggle against imperialism and its agents so that power may be transferred to those peoples and they may freely choose their own future. We denounce vigorously the manoeuvres of North American imperialism aimed at destabilizing regimes in power  particularly in Jamaica  Grenada  Guyana and Panama  and we reaffirm our militant solidarity with them in their struggle against these neo-colonialist designs.327.	What else remains to be said  without repeating ourselves  about the grave economic crisis of the capitalist system or the urgent need to establish a new international economic order?328.	We venture to deplore the fact that  following the awakening of Africa to economic questions which marked the second extraordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU held at Lagos on 28 and 29 April 1980  the Plan of Action adopted  there was not accorded the slightest consideration by the delegationsâeven the African delegationsâwhich participated in the eleventh special session of the General Assembly  on global economic questions  held recently at United Nations Headquarters.329.	Nevertheless  we hope that in the future we shall be better able to defend the economic interests of the African peoples or help them prevail.330.	The Angolan people is preparing enthusiastically for the celebration of the fifth anniversary of the proclamation of the People's Republic of Angola.331.	During those five years  considerable results have been achieved in the consolidation of the Angolan revolutionary process  in the establishment of Party structures over the whole of the country  in the strengthening of national unity and defence and in laying the foundations of a socialist society. At present  the Angolan people  faithful to the teachings of the immortal guide of the Angolan revolution and founder of the nation and of the MPLA  Workers' Party  the late President Agostinho Neto  and under the farsighted leadership of Comrade Jose Eduardo Dos Santos  President of the MPL A Workers' Party  President of the Republic and Commander-in-chief of the armed forces  are totally involved in the preparation of the first special Party congress and in the electoral process in all the provinces of future members of the People's Assembly  which is an emanation of the power of the people which will come into being shortly.332.	At the same time  considerable efforts have been made in the fields of education  agriculture  industry  health  fisheries  transport and construction  which hold considerable promise for the economic and social development of the People's Republic of Angola.333.	What we hope for is to be left in peace  with respect for our own wishes  so that we may better meet the aspirations of the Angolan people and thus make a valuable contribution to world peace and security.334.	The struggle continues. Victory is certain."
"3",96,"ALB",35,1980,"ï»¿Mr. President  first of all  I should like  on behalf of the delegation of the People's Socialist Republic of Albania  to convey to you our greetings and best wishes on your election to the high office of President of this Assembly.93.	At the same time  I should like  on behalf of the Albanian Government  to welcome the Republic of Zimbabwe to membership of the United Nations and to express our best wishes for the progress and happiness of the friendly people of that country who  through bloodshed and sacrifice  won their freedom and national independence. We also welcome the admission to the Organization of the free and independent State of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.94.	The course of events during the period which has elapsed since the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly corroborates the fact that the military  economic and ideological aggression and expansion of the imperialist Powers and the constant intensification of the inhuman and neo-colonialist oppression and exploitation of various peoples and countries have always been an integral part of the hostile policy and strategy of imperialism in its fight against peoples and revolution. This dangerous expansionist and hegemonistic activity by the imperialist superpowers and their military blocs has created throughout the world a very serious and explosive situation and has more than ever before endangered the freedom and independence of peoples as well as international peace and security.95.	The capitalist revisionist world is in the grip of a serious economic  political  military  ideological and moral crisis. From within it is being eroded by very acute contradictions. Unable any longer to dominate through the old forms of exploitation and oppression  the international bourgeoisie is ever more overtly bringing the most reactionary forces into play and  in various countries  it is moving in the direction of fascism. The economic and financial crisis is becoming even more acute and has taken on unprecedented proportions. Inflation  skyrocketing prices  the constant increase in unemployment  the serious energy crisis and other harmful phenomena of a similar nature show the major proportions which this crisis has assumed. These phenomena are based on a huge and ever-growing avalanche which very seriously affects the broad working masses.96.	The capitalist revisionist bourgeoisie is striving to shift the heavy burden of this economic crisis on to the shoulders of the proletariat and the other peoples and countries  especially in Asia  Africa and Latin America  where it has undertaken a true crusade of neo-colonialist expansion  plunder and exploitation.97.	As clearly emerged also at the eleventh special session of the General Assembly  on economic questions  the peoples and the developing countries in various regions of the world are experiencing more and more the grave consequences of this unrestrained economic aggression. Through their so-called aid and credits  through their so-called technical cooperation  through the existing neo-colonialist exploitative system of exchange imbalance and discrimination in economic and trade relations  the superpowers and the other imperialist Powers are striving to step up the plunder and exploitation of these peoples and countries and hinder their efforts to place their natural wealth and resources under their own control and national sovereignty and to crush the struggle they are waging to consolidate their economic and political independence for their free and independent development.98.	Just as in the past  the Albanian people and Government express their full solidarity with the struggle and the efforts being waged by the developing countries of Africa  Asia and Latin America radically to change the inequalities existing in world economic and trade relations  to put an end to the neo-colonialist plunder and exploitation by the imperialist Powers and to forge ahead independently on the road to their all-round development and progress.99.	The fierce rivalry between the two imperialist superpowers  the United States of America and the Soviet Union  not to exclude social imperialist China and the other imperialist Powersâtheir deals and machinations to monopolize markets and to preserve and extend their respective zones of influence  elbowing one another out of those areas where their presence and influence have been shakenâhas intensified and taken on serious new and still greater proportions. Examples of that are threats b' the United States of America and its overt preparations for interference in Iran and the further intensification of the aggressive policy and activity of the social imperialist Soviet Union and its expansion towards the oil rich regions and surrounding waterways. One of the most concrete and overt steps of this hegemonistic policy was the Fascist aggression by the Soviet social imperialists against Afghanistan and the military occupation of that sovereign country.100.	At the same time  we notice a new escalation of the political  diplomatic and military activity by the United States of America and the other imperialist Powers in the Middle East and neighbouring areas  where a very tense situation and a psychosis of war have been created. This finds expression in the unprecedented growth of the military establishments  navies and armaments of the superpowers  the so-called rapid deployment force near the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean and the intensification of blackmail  threats  pressure and the blockade against Iran. Concurrently  both the United States of America and the Soviet Union have increased their diplomatic efforts and pressure to procure air and naval bases in various countries of that region and consolidate their presence and influence in them. In this bitter struggle and rivalry between the two imperialist superpowers for zones of influence  the United States of America for its part has brought into play the new aggressive alliance it has formed with the Chinese social imperialism and the other reactionary forces of the Asian continent. Hence a very dangerous and explosive situation has been created in that continent and  in particular  in the IndoChinese region.101.	In Europe  too  we witness an ever greater number of turbulent elements fraught with threats and the danger of war. The two imperialist superpowers have intensified the arms race to the limit and bolstered the striking power of their aggressive blocsâthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] and the Warsaw Treatyâin whose member countries have been stationed today in a state of permanent alert military forces three to four times greater than those present there on the eve of the Second World War. The new plans for increasing military budgets and deploying the most sophisticated American nuclear weapons in NATO countries  the development of new Soviet nuclear weapons and modern warplanes and the concentration of navies  military bases  stockpiles of weapons  tanks and missile units  as well as the ""rapid deployment force"" near possible areas of military confrontation that are the targets of the expansionist aims of the superpowers are certainly factors which directly influence the deterioration of the situation in Europe and have seriously endangered the freedom and the independence of European peoples.102.	One of the fundamental features of the situation today in the European continent is the constant sharpening of contradictions and disagreements between the two superpowers and their partners in their respective alliances over a number of important economic and political questions. Hence the United States of America and the Soviet Union are trying to alleviate and eliminate numerous disagreements and to neutralize the centrifugal tendencies in their alliances so as to strengthen their control and diktat over them and force their allies to support their aggressive policies and activities in various regions of the world. The United States of America is requesting solidarity from the Western European countries and asking them to follow it in its aggressive activities  pressure and blockade against Iran  in the Middle East  and in its sanctions against the Soviet Union because of its occupation of Afghanistan. The Soviet Union orders its allies to support the aggression in Afghanistan as well as its policy of ""detente"" with the West.103.	At the same time  the two superpowers have undertaken a series of endeavours  with each resorting to every means to widen the division in the alliances of its rival. Thus  while the Soviet social imperialists are striving to exploit in their own interests the disagreements that have emerged between the United States of America and some Western European countries  United States imperialism and its European allies are doing their utmost to weaken the links between the countries of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union and the former's dependence on the latter and also to increase their own influence on them. A clear example of this is the active role the West has played in the development of recent events in Poland  which are a consequence of the counterrevolutionary line approved by the Twentieth Congress of the Soviet revisionist party and of the policy being pursued by the Soviet Union towards its allies to keep them under its domination  and a typical expression of the ever greater rottenness of the revisionist world.104.	In other areas of Europe  the United States of America is exerting pressure on some allied countries to make them accept its conditions in connection with agreements on new military bases  surveillance stations and forces it wants to station in the territories of those countries  while the Soviet Union is dispatching new forces and weapons and building airports and stockpiles of weapons in the territories of countries members of the Warsaw Treaty.105.	These dangerous activities of the two imperialist superpowers are also seen today in the Balkans in their attempts to intimidate and demoralize the Balkan peoples. While engaging in blackmail and threats of aggression  they keep alive  and strive to aggravate  the disagreements and feuds among the Balkan countries. At certain given times  the superpowers stir up war psychosis and make open threats of interference and aggression.106.	In its relations with neighbouring States  the People's Socialist Republic of Albania  as an independent and peace loving State  has always consistently pursued a policy of good neighbourliness. On this basis it has taken and is taking concrete steps for the normal  always positive  development of bilateral relations in various fields of common interest. As we have stated in the past  and as we wish to reiterate  no evil will ever come to neighbouring peoples from the territory of Albania. The Albanian Government holds the view that the interests of the Balkan peoples and peace and genuine security in the region require that the Balkan States should not be involved in the dangerous intrigues and schemes of the imperialist superpowers. The Balkan peoples should be left free to live in peace and friendship with one another.107.	In order to justify their war preparations and their frenzied arms race  and the efforts of each of them to attain superiority over the other  the two imperialist superpowers have recently further intensified their intimidating and befuddling uproar about the dangers deriving from the rupture of the balance of forces and from their confrontation. This is the aim of the clamorous announcement of the new nuclear strategy elaborated by United States Administration ""hawks"" and the threatening statements made by the Soviet social imperialists about the measures they would take to offset this new development in the Soviet United States rivalry.108.	Both sides ceaselessly repeat to one another that they will permit no concession which destroys the balance of forces. On this pretext they increase their military budgets and publicly announce plans and projects for the production of new nuclear weapons and delivery systems. Exerting heavy pressure and using massive blackmail against various peoples and countries  they try to impose on them the notion that in order to preserve the balance between the United States of America and the Soviet Union and to avoid a direct United States-Soviet confrontation  sovereign States must make concessions to them and submit to their diktat  their control and their domination.109.	In his work ""Eurocommunism is Anticommunism""  the leader of the Albanian people  Comrade Enver Hoxha  said that""The argument about the balance between big Powers as a factor in or means of safeguarding peace is an old imperialist slogan with which the worldâand Europe especiallyâis very well acquainted. It has always been used to justify the hegemonist policy of the big imperialist Powers and the right which they claim for themselves to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries and to dominate them.""110.	The superpowers seek to solve any difficulty in their relations at the expense of the peoples. They always fail to reconcile their rivalry and cooperation and they exploit any breakdown in the balance to intimidate the peoples  to disarm them psychologically and thus more easily to attack and occupy them militarily. In this context  they create serious and complicated situations in various countries and zones  instigate crises  tensions and hotbeds of conflict and undertake acts of aggression and local wars  thus gravely jeopardizing the sovereignty  freedom and independence of the peoples and general peace and security.111.	Hand in hand with all this openly aggressive activity and with the plots and behind the scenes manoeuvres they devise daily against the peoples  the American imperialists and the Soviet social imperialists  while increasing their own military budgets  building up and improving their armaments and unscrupulously threatening and occupying other territories and countries  are talking and making a great fuss about disarmament and ""detente""  and are proposing new conferences on disarmament and so forth. While menacing the Iranian people and the other peoples of the world with aggression  that the United States affirms its alleged good will with regard to the solution of the Middle East problem. For its part  the Soviet Union is making every effort to cover up its new aggression against Afghanistan with worries about ""detente"" and with ""pledges"" on the attainment of European security at the Madrid Conferenceâuntil it plunges in against another Afghanistan.112.	But  whatever the efforts of their ideologists and politicians to disguise themselves by displaying pacifist slogans and holding various conferences convened for demagogic purposes  the two imperialist superpowersâthe United States of America and the Soviet Unionâhave been and remain the two greatest enemies of the freedom and independence of the peoples  of sovereign  freedom loving States and of peace and international security. Experience has shown that in certain situations  when their interests are at stake  the two imperialist superpowers  irrespective of their rivalry and their bitter struggle for hegemony and the domination of the world  find common points when it is a question of fighting against the peoples and the revolution. They do their utmost to suppress all forms of people's resistance  all efforts by freedom loving and sovereign countries against control  diktat  domination and neo-colonialist oppression.113.	Despite the great economic and military potential which the two superpowers have put at the service of their policy of world domination and hegemony  despite their threats and their blackmail  their aggression and their fraudulent plots  despite the incalculable arsenals of their agents  spies and followers  they are not in a position to obstruct the course of events or to find stability in their fight to establish their hegemony over the peoples.114.	The combined strength of the enemies of the peoples is powerful and considerable  but the strength of the peoples is colossal. The development of events fully corroborates this undeniable fact. The year that has passed since the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly testifies to the fact that the freedom loving and peace-loving peoples in various regions of the world are increasingly committed to revolutionary and national liberation struggles against oppression and domination  against aggression and interference by the imperialist superpowers  against violence and exploitation by local forces of reaction. This is seen in the victories of the valiant Iranian people and its determination constantly to carry forward the democratic and anti-imperialist revolution. It is seen in the resolute struggle of the Afghan people against the Soviet social imperialist aggressors  in the resistance and heroic struggle of the Palestinian and other Arab peoples against imperialist Zionist aggression  in the great victory of the Zimbabwe people and in the struggle of the peoples of Namibia and Azania and other African peoples against racism and neo-colonialism and for national liberation. In many countries of Latin America  the proletariat and the other working masses have risen and are shedding their blood in fierce clashes with the Fascist juntas for genuine freedom and democracy and to throw off the double yoke of the financial oligarchy of local feudal lords and monopoly capital from the United States.115.	Today we are witnessing the great surge of the people's revolutionary revolt of the broad masses of the Moslem peoples  in Iran  the Arab countries and other Islamic countries. These peoples  who in the past had been left in darkness and great backwardness by the colonizers and oppressive regimes but always preserved their militant spirit and traditions and freedom loving and progressive feelings  have risen against savage oppression and exploitation and imperialist interference and aggression. Despite the efforts of the international bourgeoisie to denigrate the powerful movement of the Moslem peoples and its struggles and uprisings  which it calls retrogressive and a manifestation of religious fanaticism  progressive mankind and peoples that love freedom and peace appreciate them for their true worth as an important contribution to the great anti-imperialist struggle of peoples.116.	The anti-imperialist  anti-American and anti-feudal revolt of the Iranian people and its heroic resistance to the pressure and blockade by American imperialism and the intrigues and plots of the Soviet and Chinese social imperialists  and the current struggle of the Afghan people against Soviet aggression  constitute positive examples which inspire the peoples oppressed by and dependent on neo-colonialism to rise in struggle and put an end to foreign oppression. At the same time they constitute a powerful blow to world imperialism and a profound disturbance of its economic basis and aims for hegemony and domination in the world.117.	In the Middle East  despite the intensification of the aggressive activity of the Israeli Zionists and the anti-Palestinian and anti-Arab plots by the superpowers  the struggle and resistance of the Palestinian people and their Arab brothers against their imperialist Zionist enemies are resolutely continuing. At present the imperialist super Powersâthe United States  the Soviet Union and Chinaâ and Israel and Arab reactionary forces are making every effort and resorting to every means to incite disagreements and feuds among Arab peoples and countries in the Middle East in order to create ever more obstacles to the efforts they are making to unite their ranks and mobilize their own forces and energies in their common struggle against imperialist aggression and interference in that region of the world.118.	The anti-Arab and anti-Palestinian Camp David plot continues to be put into practice. American imperialism today is doing its utmost to strengthen it further  to drag other Arab countries into its suffocating maelstrom and increasingly to tighten the noose around the neck of the Palestinian movement. Meanwhile  the United States has incited Israeli Zionism to intensify its acts of violence and terror against the broad masses of Palestinians in the occupied territories and its overt activity of aggression and war against the neighbouring Arab countries. Clear evidence of this is the constant aggressive acts against Lebanon and the Fascist acts of genocide which are being carried out ever more forcefully against the Palestinians. The decision of the Israeli parliament to proclaim Jerusalem the eternal capital of Israel is another arrogant act on its part which clearly demonstrates the consequences of the overall aid and support it receives from American imperialism in its overt aggressive and annexationist policy and activity.119.	This new annexationist step by the Israeli Zionists has rightfully been condemned forcefully and resolutely by the Arab peoples and by international public opinion as a whole. It clearly reveals the plans and aims of zionism for the perpetuation of the occupation of Arab territories as a logical continuation of the old efforts directed towards the creation of a ""greater Israel"". No doubt it is also an inseparable part of the massive Camp David plot  which had and has only one aimâto preserve the occupation of the Arab territories  liquidate the Palestinian resistance and preserve and strengthen the presence and domination of the United States in the Middle East.120.	The Palestinian people and the other Arab peoples do not allow themselves to be deceived by the promises and pledges of Washington about the efforts it will allegedly make after the presidential elections to bring peace and security to them. They are deceived even less by the manoeuvres of the Soviet social imperialists  who  masquerading as the ally of the Arab peoples and countries  are striving to extend their influence in that region.121.	The Albanian people and its Government vigorously support the just and heroic struggle of the Palestinian people for the restoration of its legitimate rights and the movementof the Arab peoples to liberate the occupied territories and to put an end both to Zionist imperialist aggression and to the interference and intrigues of the superpowers. We are convinced that this will be achieved only through the determined armed struggle of the Palestinian people and the other Arab peoples  through their common efforts and militant unity among themselves and with the other peoples who love peace and freedom.122.	The Government of the People's Socialist Republic of Albania and the Albanian people have always vigorously condemned the aggressive and hegemonistic policy and the interferences and plots of the imperialist superpowersâthe United States  the Soviet Union and Chinaâin the region of IndoChina  as a result of which the freedom loving peoples of that region  particularly the Cambodian people  continue to be the victims of much suffering and privation. The situation in that region remains very grave and explosive. The threats by social imperialist China to teach Viet Nam a ""second lesson"" and all the political and diplomatic machinations of the imperialist superpowers in Southeast Asia are fraught with grave consequences for freedom and security in that region.123.	As always  the People's Socialist Republic of Albania and the Albanian people support the right of each people in that region to live free and independent and to solve their problems themselves without any foreign interference  whatever its origin.124.	We also support the full realization of the legitimate aspirations of the Korean people for the independent reunification of their country and their struggle to put an end to the military occupation of South Korea by the United States and the local oppressive regime  which is a tool of United States imperialism.125.	The Albanian people and Government strongly support the just anti-imperialist and anti- colonialist struggle of the African peoples and of the revolutionaries and democratic patriots for freedom and national independence and to guarantee their independent political  economic and social development.126.	At present  the peoples of Africa are waging a fierce struggle against the neo-colonialist Powers  and especially the two superpowers  which are feverishly vying with each other to exploit the great riches and the raw materials of the African continent and to encircle their spheres of influence with military bases and armed forces.127.	Despite the efforts and refined methods of the imperialist Powers to create ever more difficult situations for the African peoples and countries and set them against one another while preventing them from joining their efforts for national independence and identity  the struggle of the peoples of that continent against colonialism and neo-colonialism is constantly mounting and is scoring one success after another.128.	An important victory in this direction is the proclamation of the independence and creation of the new and free State of Zimbabwe  a direct result of the long struggle over many years of the freedom loving people of Zimbabwe  who through sacrifices and fighting arms in hand smashed the hated racist domination  the savage oppression and violence of genocide and apartheid.129.	This victory of the African people of Zimbabwe is another example and offers encouragement for the struggle being waged by their African brothers of Namibia and Azania against the racist regime of apartheid in South Africa and foreign neo-colonialist oppression and exploitation.130.	The People's Socialist Republic of Albania has always pursued a just  principled and fully independent foreign policy which corresponds to the safeguarding of the lofty interests of our socialist homeland as well as to the cause of freedom and independence of the peoples. The Albanian people and its Government have always been in solidarity with and have resolutely supported the peoples that are fighting for liberation  freedom and national independence and for social progress. They have fought and will fight to expose the enemies of the peoples and their policies and activities of aggression  oppression and exploitation everywhere in the world.131.	In its international relations  socialist Albania has always been guided by the desire to live in peace and friendship with other peoples and countries and  in conformity with this  it has maintained and maintains relations with an ever growing number of States. It has stood and stands for the expansion of trade  cultural and other relations in fields of mutual interest with various States  loyally adhering to well-known international norms governing the relations among sovereign States.132.	At this session also  the delegation of the People's Socialist Republic of Albania will not fail to make its modest contribution to the discussion of the questions facing the General Assembly."
"4",164,"ARE",35,1980,"ï»¿Permit me at the outset  sir  to extend to you on behalf of the delegation of the United Arab Emirates sincere congratulations on your election to the presidency of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. I am confident that your broad knowledge and experience of international affairs will enable you to conduct the proceedings of this session in such a way as to ensure that it achieves the desired goals.124.	It is my pleasure also to express gratitude to your predecessor  Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim  for the valuable efforts he made in conducting the proceedings of the thirty- fourth session of the General Assembly and the special sessions that followed it.125.	I should like also to express thanks to the Secretary- General for his continued efforts to enhance the effectiveness of the Organization and to strengthen its role in solving current international problems.126.	At the eleventh special session my country welcomed with great pleasure the admission of the Republic of Zimbabwe to membership of the Organization. Today I should like to welcome the admission of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to membership.127.	Since the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly the world has continued to suffer from crises resulting from situations of instability and periodic upheavals that afflict the international scene in all political  economic and social spheres. This year has witnessed more violations of the Charter  such as foreign interference in the internal affairs of other States  the continuation of international violence and the denial to many peoples of their basic freedoms.128.	In the circumstances  the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly presents us with an opportunity to exert more effective efforts with a view to achieving comprehensive solutions to those problems in order to change the bleak picture of our contemporary world.129.	While most of the peoples of the world have attained their political freedom  many of them continue to be economically dependent  which has precluded their achieving independent self-sustained development and this in turn has robbed their political independence of any economic content. In the present circumstances it is no longer possible to accept the doctrine that the economic and social development of the developing countries is a by-product of the economic activity that takes place in the international economic framework as a whole. Such activity should greatly enhance the ability of the developing countries to achieve self-sustained development rather than development based on dependence.130.	The world is increasingly convinced of the necessity of establishing a new international economic order rectifying the defects of the present order.131.	The present world economic order represents inequality in international relations. The gap between the industrialized countries and the developing countries continues to grow wide instead of narrowing. We believe that the main factor contributing to the widening of the gap is the structure of world economic relations  a structure that consolidates inequality and therefore ensures advantages for the developed industrialized countries at the expense of the developing nations representing the vast majority of mankind.132.	The United Nations has recognized that international peace and security will not prevail except with economic and social justice. Since the sixth special session  that recognition has been translated into the adoption of a set of resolutions embodied in the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order and the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States  and other resolutions aiming at rectification of the present international economic system. As a supplementary measure  the eleventh special session of the General Assembly was convened to evaluate the progress made in the implementation of those resolutions and to adopt a strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade.133.	Mankind's hopes had been pinned on the success of that session in attaining the goals set for it. Those hopes were  however  dampened by the failure of the efforts made in the field of international negotiations as a result of the intransigence of certain industrialized nations. The failure of the session led to the loss of an historic opportunity for the world community to rectify the present situation  despite the efforts exerted by specialized committees and working groups.134.	Even so  we are still hopeful that those nations will review their positions and make it possible to start anew world economic negotiations to enhance economic cooperation among all nations on the basis of equality and common interests  for the growth of their economies requires economic co-operation on a basis of equality with the third world countries.135.	While those efforts are floundering  the world economy continues to be afflicted by a series of problems that require urgent solution. Inflation represents a serious international phenomenon. Although its origin is associated with the economies of the developed countries  its consequences adversely affect the rest of the world  especially the developing countries. While we recognize that no method should be imposed upon the industrialized countries for remedying that phenomenon which lies within their competence  international action should be taken to check inflation and prevent its transfer to the developing countries.136.	The subject of energy  and in particular oil  is of a distinct and special nature and has great bearing on the world economy. Consequently  the oil-exporting countries  and in particular the Arab countries  have been subjected to an unjustified attack by certain circles which allege that those countries are mainly responsible for the economic problems. Such a view lacks objectivity for it looks at the subject from only one aspect. I should like to emphasize once again in this international forum that my country  as an oil producer  has done all it can to bring about the stability of the world economic situation.137.	We are fully convinced of the importance of the central role played by oil in the world economy. We have translated that conviction into a responsible commitment that is manifested in our production of oil at a rate that is much higher than suits our actual needs. This represents a sacrifice on our part for the sake of the stability of the world economy. It was met  however  by wastage in consumption by the industrialized nations  which made oil a scarce commodity  the price of which is controlled by foreign companies. Those companies in turn increased their profits many times and consequently the profits of their Governments and necessarily forced the oil-producing countries to adopt protective measures. We expect others similarly to adopt responsible and rational measures to reduce oil consumption and promote research into alternative sources of energy. Such efforts will complement ours in solving this grave problem.138.	The world has recently witnessed certain actions that threaten international peace  such as the failure of certain countries to respect others and their interference in the internal affairs of those other countries  thus preventing them from freely exercising their right to self-determination.139.	The principle of respect for the sovereignty and independence of States is  in our opinion  the most important principle for whose protection the United Nations has been established. It is therefore incumbent on all States to respect and enhance that principle by ceasing to interfere in the affairs of others.140.	- We consider the events in certain regions  particularly in Afghanistan  as a violation of the spirit of the Charter and of the principles of non-alignment  which reject all forms of foreign interference regardless of their origin or causes. Thus we demand that foreign forces withdraw from Afghan territory and leave the Afghan people to determine their own destiny.141.	The arms race is a cause of concern to us because of the real danger it poses to international peace and security. The arms race has reached such alarming proportions that it threatens the destruction of our human civilization. It is apparent to everybody how closely it is interrelated with international developments and the world economy. The arms race has exhausted vast sums of money that should have been devoted to international development. It has also contributed to the worsening of world inflation. Studies indicate that the arms race will consume an estimated $500 billion next year  a sum which could undoubtedly be used for the eradication of underdevelopment  disease  hunger and the ills that continue to beset many regions of the world. Such sums could be allotted to development at an international level.142.	In view of these facts  it becomes necessary to encourage international efforts aimed at reducing the arms race. In that context my delegation expresses its deep regret at the lack of full commitment towards implementing the international strategy in the field of disarmament  which was adopted by the General Assembly at its tenth special session  devoted to disarmament.143.	All States  and in particular the super-Powers  are required today to translate their recognition of the dangers of the arms race into concrete action that would contribute to the success of the international efforts made in this regard. There is still an opportunity for all States to do more through the Second Disarmament Decade  which starts this year  in order to uphold the Spirit of the strategy aimed at controlling the arms race. We hope that by the time the next special session  scheduled for 1982  is convened all nations will have committed themselves to the objectives of that strategy.144.	My delegation views with concern the increasing military presence of the super-Powers in the Indian Ocean region  which endangers the security and safety of that region. We join with the rest of the Indian Ocean States and all peace-loving countries in their appeal to keep that region free from military presence and to preserve it as a zone of peace. On those grounds my country welcomed the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace which was adopted by the Assembly in 1971. We are quite willing to co-operate towards the success of the Conference on the Indian Ocean  which is scheduled for 1981  for the implementation and effectiveness of the Declaration.145.	The Gulf region is confronted with increasing foreign threats of intervention in its affairs on the pretext of protection. That is contrary to the principle of the sovereignty of States over their territories. It is therefore incumbent upon all States to refrain from threatening to intervene  since such action will not serve international peace and security.146.	My country considers the safety and security of the Gulf to be a regional responsibility that belongs to the Gulf States alone. We view with the utmost concern the recent events opposing two Islamic States  namely Iraq and Iran  against each other. We hope that the efforts of the President of Pakistan will be successful in bringing about a cease-fire. We appreciate the fact that Iraq has announced a cease-fire in response to an appeal addressed to it by the Islamic Conference. We hope that our brothers in the Islamic Republic of Iran will also heed that appeal. We hope that those endeavours will lead to a peaceful settlement of the outstanding problems between them  thus putting an end to bloodshed and the waste of resources.147.	With regard to the question of Cyprus  although tension and conflict between the two communities continue  there is a ray of hope indicating a possibility of success for the international efforts aimed at seeking an end to that conflict.' I refer to the agreement by both communities to resume negotiations  an agreement we welcome and applaud. My country supports those efforts aimed at a speedy solution of the question of Cyprus which will ensure its territorial integrity and non-alignment.148.	International efforts concerning the law of the sea have made promising progress  manifested in the great achievements of the ninth session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  held at Geneva. We hope that that will expedite the signing of an international convention which would establish a new system governing the use and exploitation of the seas and oceans in a just and equitable manner.149.	Southern Africa is experiencing a violation of the most basic human rights. Indigenous Africans are still being subjected to occupation and various kinds of racial discrimination practised by the South African minority regime.150.	The struggle of the people of Zimbabweâwhich was crowned with independence and freedomârepresents a true symbol of the African people's struggle. Its victory will encourage other peoples to intensify their struggle to achieve their rights.151.	The racist regime of South Africa continues to apply the policy of apartheid against the indigenous population in contravention of the spirit of the Charter. It is also subjecting the Territory of Namibia to an illegal occupation  in defiance of the will of the international community  and still places obstacles in the way of the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). The South African regime does not stop at that  but continues as well to commit aggression against neighbouring African States  causing substantial damage.152.	In view of this situation the Organization has the responsibility to respond firmly to such aggression and violations by imposing the sanctions prescribed in Chapter VII of the Charter. My country has continuously expressed its solidarity with the peoples of southern Africa and has rendered its full support to the liberation movements in that region. We condemn the actions of South Africa and reiterate our support for the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO]  the legitimate representative of the Namibian people. We call upon all States to refrain from aiding that regime  so that the Organization may be enabled to eradicate all manifestations of oppression in that part of the world.153.	I shall address myself now to a region which has been afflicted with the most complicated problem facing our contemporary world. The Middle East region undoubtedly represents a major hotbed of insecurity and instability because of the acts of aggression committed by Israel. This aggression is reflected in Israel's occupation of Palestine and the territories of several Arab States  the denial to the Palestinian people of its right to self-determination in its own territory and the repeated aggression committed against Lebanon.154.	These acts constitute a glaring violation of the basic rules of international law and of the Charter  which proscribe the occupation of the territories of other peoples by force. The United Nations has in numerous resolutions called upon Israel to cease its acts of aggression  to withdraw from the occupied Arab territories and to grant the Palestinian people an opportunity to determine their own destiny. These resolutions have not been implemented because of Israeli intransigence supported by certain States  in particular the United States of America. Furthermore  Israel continues to establish settlements in the occupied Arab territories for the purpose of annexing them under false pretexts and pronouncements made by its leaders. It continues also to violate the sanctity of Lebanese territory.155.	The latest action undertaken by Israel was its annexation of Jerusalem  declared the so-called eternal capital of Israel. The international community  in Security Council resolution 478 (1980)  condemned that act and called upon all States to remove their embassies from the Holy City. I should like here to express my country's gratitude and appreciation to those States which responded positively to that resolution.156.	We have previously expressed our interest in the declaration on the situation in the Middle East issued on 13 June 1980 at Venice by the heads of State and Government and the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the member States of the European Community. We had hoped that it would signify a new approach in those countries' perception of the nature of the problem. Although subsequent developments have  unfortunately  taken a different course  we are confident that the correction of that perception will enable the Community to play a role in solving the problem commensurate with its international standing.157.	Certain attempts have been made outside the framework of the United Nations purporting to resolve the situation in the Middle East. We consider that any efforts made concerning this question must be made within the framework of the Organization. The United Arab Emirates  therefore  continues to reject the Camp David agreements as a framework for the solution of the problem  since they ignore the vital and basic issues  including the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and the recognition of the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO] as the sole legitimate representative of that people.158.	We believe that the cornerstone of any solution to the Middle East problem must include the total and unconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces from all the occupied Arab territories  including the city of Jerusalem  and the recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to self- determination and to the establishment of an independent State in Palestine. We call upon all peace-loving States to express their solidarity with the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples in their resistance to and struggle against Israeli acts of aggression. We also call upon the United States of America to refrain from supporting Israeli aggression.159.	The continued aggression committed against Lebanon shows the expansionist designs of Israel and its determination to occupy the territory of other countries by force. This calls for the international community to undertake the necessary action to put an end to such aggression.160.	The non-compliance with United Nations resolutions and such acts of aggression constitute dangerous phenomena in the context of the policy pursued by Israel in the Middle East. The United Nations is called upon to put an end to such practices. It should resort to preventive measures by applying against Israel  the aggressor State  the sanctions provided for in Chapter VII of the Charter. Such action will restore dignity and respect to the Organization."
"5",211,"ARG",35,1980,"ï»¿Mr. President  I should like to begin my statement by congratulating you most sincerely on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its thirty-fifth session. This Assembly's good judgement in choosing you as its President will undoubtedly be rewarded by success in the tasks stemming from our heavy agenda and  in particular  in reinforcing the aims of the United Nations Charter concerning peace  security and progress for ail peoples. The Federal Republic of Germany  your noble country of origin  is a nation with which the Argentine Republic maintains firm relations of friendship and cooperation. We also congratulate the Federal Republic on the honour conferred upon it by your presidency of this Assembly.31.	It is equally appropriate to recall the distinguished services rendered by Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim  who carried out brilliantly and effectively the tasks of the presidency of the thirty-fourth session and the subsequent special sessions of the General Assembly.32.	Just as in 1979 the United Nations rejoiced in the admission of Saint Lucia as a new Member of the Organization  on this occasion we wish to reiterate the welcome we gave during the eleventh special session of the General Assembly to Zimbabwe  its Government and its people and to extend to them our best wishes for peace and prosperity.33.	Similarly  we also wish to express our warmest esteem for Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  the American country which has just been welcomed as a full Member of our Organization  and we are confident that it will make a constructive contribution to the task of consolidating international peace and security.34.	The threats to international peace and security that existed a year ago have not disappeared; indeed  they have increased.35.	In January this year  at the sixth emergency special session of the General Assembly  the Organization had the opportunity to review the situation on the Asian continent. The great majority of countriesâamong them the Argentine Republicâexpressed their opposition to any act implying violation of the political rights of States and  hence  of the Charter of the United Nations  which must be adhered to equally by all Members without exception.36.	In fact  those situations have been created within an international context which continues to be ruled by the ambitions and tensions prevailing among the superpowers. Their power appears to be used for no other purpose than their own self perpetuation and aggrandizement  at times at the expense of the rights of other States and the opportunities of the rest of the nations which constitute the great majority of the world's population.37.	The present international political outlook is such that the developing countries appear justified in their efforts zealously to defend their sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity  protect the authority of this Organization and assert their right to contribute actively to the solution of international problems and participate as equals in initiatives aimed at the economic  social and political advancement of peoplesâand I stress ""as equals"".38.	As can be seen  the international situation confronting us today differs greatly from that which could have been hoped for until very recently  when we believed that we were advancing firmly on the road to international detente and cooperation.39.	Therefore it is necessary  for the nations whose vocation is freedom  to reject from the outset any attempt to impose on us a confrontation in which neither the interests nor the wishes of our peoples are at stake.40.	At the same time  it is essential that all nations  especially the two great Powers  refrain from infringing the principles of non-interference and non-intervention in the internal affairs of States. These basic principles of international relations must not be ignored by any nation or any intergovernmental organization  whatever the motive or pretext.41.	Only unrestricted adherence to these principles will ensure lasting understanding and real cooperation among States. The ineffective paternalism of those seeking to impose their judgement on the sovereign will of other peoples leads to a rarefied international atmosphere which impairs efforts to bring about peace and development.42.	We note with great concern the present escalation of tension and warlike activities between Iran and Iraq  which might have serious consequences and endanger peace in the area and even beyond. We therefore associate ourselves with the timely appeal made recently by the Secretary General to the parties concerned and we are confident that they will reach an understanding which will preserve peace in the area. Similarly  we support the appeal made by the President of the Security Council on behalf of the Council members for the cessation of any armed or other action that might ex acerbate the present dangerous situation and for the solution of their dispute by peaceful means.43.	The competition between the superpowers is most clearly evident in the arms race. In this area there have been alarming signs during the period since the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly. Not only has the process of ratification of the SALT II agreement been suspended but there seems little prospect of an early beginning of negotiations on a future SALT III agreement.44.	The trend thus indicated is therefore negative and denotes the readiness of those States with the most and the most sophisticated nuclear weapons to continue to exercise a sort of guardianship over the rest of the world by means of nuclear terror.45.	The reasonable level of legitimate defence of the superpowers was greatly exceeded long ago. Furthermore  they have encroached on the security of all States  without offering any guarantees other than the goodwill of a few or the dubious security offered by complex electronic devicesâ which are in fact as fallible as their operators.46.	If the decade that has just started is to be sincerely described as the Disarmament Decade  it will be necessary to respect egalitarianânot discriminatoryâand effective foundations that will enable us to progress once and for all towards general and complete disarmament. The priorities established in 1978 in the Final Document of the special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament clearly indicate the steps to be taken. We cannot allow secondary issues to serve as an excuse to postpone the solution of more important issues on which a consensus has already been reached. In this regard it is clear that there is a fundamental objective above all: the objective of arresting and reversing the nuclear arms race  until it is completely eliminated.47.	In this connexion  we have already referred to some of the structural characteristics of and situations connected with the present system of international relations that affect the stability of peace and security. It has rightly been said that the absence of war is not enough to enable us to live in peace.48.	The genuine enjoyment of peace implies that each people is in a position to make its own order  has available the resources to develop its economy  is capable of trading with other nations and providing for the health and education of its population and  lastly  can live a worthy life of work in freedom. Only thus will peace be accompanied by the necessary security which development brings.49.	These aspirations are frustrated whenever an unjust system of economic relations persists  since its bases the welfare of certain nations not only on their own labour but also on insufficient payment for the efforts of other nations.50.	Only a few days ago a most serious attempt to reformulate the international economic order was frustrated h j the intransigence of some developing countries. We are all in agreement that the economy of the world is going through a period of grave difficulties. In those circumstances it would seem obvious that there should be no opposition to attempting to overcome the crisis by means of a negotiated solution.51.	Nevertheless  the proposal of the Group of 77 that a new round of global negotiations be held in 1981  within the framework of the North South dialogue  was not approved by three developed countries  which alleged that the procedural framework proposed during the eleventh special session of the General Assembly was unacceptable. In view of the present state of the dialogue  the Republic of Argentina reiterates before this Assembly its willingness to continue to make all the necessary efforts to enable the international community to reach a genuine consensus on all aspects related to the preparation of a new round of global negotiations.52.	Argentina  the only developing country that is a signatory to the Food Aid Convention of 1980   has donated significant quantities of grain to many countries in the developing world  thus contributing within its possibilities to the fulfilment of their food needs and allowing them to concentrate their efforts on other fields of economic development. In a spirit of solidarity  our country has also aided countries in emergency situations by supplying provisions and medicine. Our greatest satisfaction lies in the knowledge that we have been helpful  as evidenced in the expressions of thanks from the Governments of the recipient countries.53.	However  we do not believe that the elements essential to human lifeâfor example  food and medicineâshould be used as means of political or economic pressure.54.	With regard to humanitarian questions  the rules of the game prevailing in the international order render unacceptable the attempt to take political advantage of such questions. Those who adopt that attitude expose themselves to the censure of international opinion  to the distrust of States and to the squandering of efforts on a sterile objective: the furthering of electoral aims or the provocation of confrontation between peoples.55.	These attitudes become even more serious when arguments are used in a selective manner and when the strategic risks of the opportunistic accusers are smaller.56.	The internal political development of each nation  with its achievements and difficulties  is the sole and exclusive responsibility of that nation  and those who seek to teach lessons from abroad are committing an error with consequences that will be increasingly difficult to eliminate.57.	Similarly  no contribution to peace and security has been made by the violation of rules that from time immemorial have given diplomatic agents immunity in accordance with the delicate functions they must carry out. The interests of the entire international community are affected when these rules are infringed.58.	The perpetration of criminal attempts against representatives and diplomatic missionsâsuch as those that are  alarmingly  taking place at an increasing rate all over the worldâmust also be the subject of more decisive action with a view to the total elimination of such attempts.59.	Latin America is a subject of fundamental interest to us. The Republic of Argentina is a Latin American country  because of its geographical location as well as its culture and vocation. That is why I cannot fail to mention in this context an event that holds promise for our region and  consequently  for international relations in general.60.	The process of Latin American integration gained renewed momentum with the establishment of the Association for Latin American Integration  composed of 11 countries whose Foreign Ministers or other Ministers signed the Treaty at Montevideo in August of this year establishing the Association. The prospects opened up by this instrument exceed what was regarded as possible by the preceding Latin American Free Trade Association  after 20 years of hard and positive efforts. The economic pluralism of Latin America having been acknowledged  the new Association will make possible  in the long term  access to the much desired objective of the establishment of a Latin American common market. Also  it will enable the signatories to take steps to establish and intensify the links of solidarity with developing countries and integration areas in which they are active  in accordance with the guiding principles and commitments assumed in the context of the Declaration and Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order and of the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States.61.	We wish also to express our satisfaction with the undeniable substantial progress achieved by the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea during its ninth session  held at Geneva from 28 July to 29 August of this year. It is well known that our Latin American countries have made a great contribution in this important matter. We trust that final agreements will be speedily reached.62.	We are also satisfiedâand with justificationâwith the stage reached in the relations between Argentina and Brazil  as demonstrated by visits at the highest level of government and the signing of important economic  technological  trade  energy and nuclear agreements.63.	Our relations with the neighbouring and other countries of Latin America have been extremely good and  as an indication of the closeness of those relations  we point to the outstandingly important work of physical integration with the countries of the River Plate basin and the increase of imports from those countries by nearly 80 per cent in the last four years. That growth is in itself eloquent.64.	We should like to reiterate Argentina's gratitude to His Holiness Pope John Paul II for the continued and invaluable assistance he has been giving to the Governments of Argentina and Chile in the search for an equitable and honourable solution to the dispute over the southern zone of the American continent  in compliance with the provisions of the Montevideo Agreement of 8 January 1979.65.	This Assembly will be faced  for the second time during the course of the year  with the question of Palestine  the heart and crux of the crisis in the Middle East. The first opportunity this year was provided last July by the seventh emergency special session  which was convened chiefly on the initiative of the nonaligned countries. 66.	The position of the Argentine delegation at that timeâ which we now reiterateâconsisted in support for the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination to the establishment of its own sovereign State and to freedom to choose its own representatives and its own future.67.	At the same time  we reject the unilateral and arbitrary measures adopted by Israel in the territories it has occupied since 5 June 1967. Moreover  we believe that the City of Jerusalem must be put under a special regime  recognized by all parties and in conformity with the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council.68.	In appealing once more to the Israelis and the Palestinians to recognize each other's legitimate rights  we express the hope that they will fulfil  in an atmosphere of peace and far from all forms of violence  their responsibilities to a world in which the tensions are becoming extremely dangerous.69.	We also urge all the parties involved to make major efforts to bring about peace in Lebanon. We fervently hope that that longsuffering nation will preserve its complete sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity and that all acts of violence against its inhabitants will cease.70.	Another area which my country contemplates with alarm is southern Africa. The independence of Zimbabwe  which we noted with satisfaction  was not followed by other positive events in that area.71.	The international community is still awaiting the end of the illegal occupation of Namibia. That Territory must accede to sovereignty with complete territorial integrity. The present situation must be brought to an end  because its persistence calls into question the implementation of the principles and decisions of the United Nations and  at the same time  constitutes a significant danger to the peace and security of Africa and the entire world. In affirming this  we also welcome in advance the representatives of the United Nations Council for Namibia who will soon visit the Republic of Argentina.72.	My country wishes to reiterate most categorically its total rejection of apartheid and any other form of racial discrimination. Those systemsâwhich offend the moral conscience of all nations and are contrary to the Christian traditions on which we were brought upâare the root of future suffering and conflicts. We have no guarantee that the violence that they are creating will be localized and will respect the frontiers of the countries involved. There is therefore a double imperativeâmoral and politicalâto clearly condemn all forms of apartheid and racial discrimination.73.	Because of the seriousness of the risks confronting mankind  it is particularly important for the movement of nonaligned countries to continue to play an active part without abandoning its original principles. This presupposes the reaffirmation of the independence and impartiality from which the movement was born and which it must preserve at all costs so that its influence in world affairs may be great enough to meet the exigencies of the times.74.	Only thus will the movement of nonaligned countries be a reflection of the feeling of international responsibility of a significant number of States  which  over and above their political  economic and social differences  attempt to direct international relations towards full respect for non-intervention through solidarity and cooperation among peoples.75.	I come to a matter of the greatest importance to us. Year after year Argentina has given repeated proof of moderation and patience with regard to the usurpation by force by the United Kingdom of a part of our national territory  the Malvinas Islands.76.	This Organization is well aware of the background of this question and has not ceased to urge the Argentine and British Governments to continue negotiations to put an end to the occupation of the islands. Moreover  the heads of State or Government of the nonaligned countries have expressed their unqualified solidarity with Argentina regarding its sovereign right to the Malvinas Islands.77.	We must also mention the wide international support for Argentina's claim  as well as our willingness to seek an early solution by means of negotiations culminating in the definitive recognition by the United Kingdom of Argentine sovereignty over the aforementioned islands. As is well known  Argentina has made a series of efforts to meet the interests of the nucleus of inhabitants of the islands and has offered them the necessary safeguards and guarantees.78.	It is precisely at this time  on the occasion of the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of resolution 1514 (XV) that we must reaffirm our support for its provisions and redouble our efforts finally to eliminate colonialism from the world. It was by virtue of that resolution that the General Assembly adopted resolution 2065 (XX)  on which negotiations on the Malvinas Islands are based.79.	I hope that at the end of this session we shall be able to say that the efforts of this Assembly have been fruitful  that peace is possible and that we shall continue to work resolutely for its consolidation."
"6",316,"AUS",35,1980,"ï»¿Mr. President  on behalf of the Australian delegation  I should like to add my very warm congratulations to those already expressed on your election as President of the General Assembly. I have no doubt that you will serve the Assembly with distinction and I offer you the fullest cooperation of my delegation.146.	I wish also to express my Government's recognition of the continuing contribution made to the United Nations by Ambassador Salim  who brought to the office of President great diplomatic skill and wise counsel.147.	Since the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly  Zimbabwe and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines have joined the United Nations. I should like to extend a very warm welcome to these fellow members of the Commonwealth  with whom we look forward to working closely in the common tasks that lie ahead.148.	I do not believe that there is anyone hereâindeed I do not believe that there is an informed person anywhereâ who would contest the fact that the international situation has deteriorated seriously since we met here a year ago. While there are differences as to causes  motivations and responsibilities  the sense that we have entered a new and dangerous period is almost universal. So far  this period lacks a label  lacks a name. That  I believe  is no accident. We can be sure that it is not due to any lack of effort on the part of journalists  academics and speech writers. What stands out as we contemplate the current scene is its great complexity  and complexity resists labels.149.	The absence of a label  the fact that we are confronting a crisis without a name  is indicative of a deeper problem: the absence of any agreed conceptual map of the historical territory into which we are advancing. The problem is not that there is no map  but rather that there are many different ones. Some have pulled down from the shelf  either reluctantly or enthusiastically  the old cold war map of the 1950s. Some cling with diminishing hope to the detente map of the 1970s. Third world spokesmen are understandably reluctant to surrender the North South map they have drawn in recent decades.'150.	The reality is that none of these maps is adequate  but that all are relevant. For we are confronting a multidimensional crisis in which what have hitherto been semi-autonomous issues or areas of international politics are being drawn closely together and superimposed on each other. We have spoken much of interdependence in this forum over the last decade. It has now become increasingly evident that interdependence applies not only to countries but to issues and to realms of activity.151.	I believe that perhaps the most serious danger we face at present is that  confronted with what is simultaneously unfamiliar  turbulent and dangerous  a sense of unmanageability may come to prevail. This in turn could lead to the embracing of simplistic solutions  in a despairing search for order and certainty  or to a fatalistic resignation. Either course would be disastrous. We are going to need to maintain as never before a sense of historical perspective and of political proportion.152.	Thirty-five years ago  the peoples of the United Nations expressed their determination to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. To a remarkable extent we succeededâto the extent  that is  that in a period of intense and bitter great Power rivalry  a rivalry which in terms of all historical precedents should have resulted in armed conflict  a third world war was averted. In a period of pessimism  that is worth remembering and weighing in the balance.153.	That having been said  however  it must be recognized that the fact that we have avoided conflagration on a global scale is no consolation to the ravaged peoples of Indochina  Afghanistan  the Horn of Africa  the Middle East or other lands. The ideals and objectives of the Organization have been brutally assaulted by the actions of certain of its Members. Now  no less than in 1945  the international community is faced with the tragic plight of millions of peopleâkilled  maimed or rendered homeless and hungry by the scourge of war. Where we should be devoting a major part of our collective energy to meeting the developmental needs of the poorer countries and communities of this world  we find that energy divided and diminished by interstate and intergroup ambitions and rivalries which do nothing for mankind other than to add to its burden of misery and deprivation  a burden borne mostly by the poorest and most disadvantaged.154.	The first Articles of the Charter affirm that all Members shall refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State.155.	What  however  is  for example  the situation in IndoChina  a region of particular concern to Australia? There is growing great Power rivalry; 200 000 occupation troops remain in Kampuchea; and there is the consequent lack of any opportunity for the Kampuchean people to choose their own Government. In addition  there are threats to the security of Thailand  made manifest by the incursion of Vietnamese troops into Thailand earlier this year. Those are the causes of regional political instability and tension. They are also the causes of human suffering on a scale which is affecting the life of the whole region.156.	Australian policy in this situation is based on the resolution adopted last year  in which the Assembly called for the withdrawal of foreign forces from Kampuchea and for an act of self-determination by the Khmer people. Our support for those principles remains as strong as ever. A peaceful and secure Southeast Asia cannot be achieved until a political settlement has been reached in Kampuchea which is acceptable to all parties concerned and which gives full opportunity to the Kampuchean people to determine their own style of government and way of life. We accept that Viet Nam has legitimate interests to safeguard in regard to Kampuchea. What we cannot accept is that Viet Nam and its allies should be able to go on ref using to discuss seriously the fundamental questions of the occupation of Kampuchea by foreign forces and the legitimacy of the regime in Phnom Penh. Acceptable resolution of those issues is essential to the eventual achievement of a sovereign and independent Kampuchean nation as part of a secure environment for all Southeast Asian countries.157.	Australia has participated actively in the international efforts to alleviate the suffering of the Kampuchean people  both within Kampuchea itself and in refugee camps in Thailand. Australian contributions  both governmental and private  to international humanitarian relief programmes to date exceed $A 24 million. Those international efforts have been necessary not only to meet the desperate and immediate needs of the Kampuchean people but to provide the basis for their eventual self-sufficiency. The achievements of the programme sponsored by the United Nations have been significant. Both common humanity and the peace and stability of the region demand that the effort be sustained until a lasting solution is found.158.	IndoChina is not the only point of danger. The activities of the Soviet Union in Afghanistan and elsewhere have inevitably impaired the international climate of trust necessary for the negotiation of effective arms control measures. That is particularly true with respect to the preparations for the Conference  to be held in Sri Lanka  on the implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace. We must consider the proximity of Afghanistan to the Indian Ocean  as well as the general climate of apprehension and uneasiness among the littoral and hinterland States of the region which Soviet activity has brought about. The massive military build-up and deployment in the region of the Indian Ocean has cast an ominous shadow over efforts to bring about peace in that region and consequently over preparations for a conference aimed at the creation of a zone of peace.159.	It is difficult to envisage how we could expect a conference to produce a declaration on a zone of peace when one of the hinterland States of the region is forcibly occupied by one of the Powers which would attend the conference. It is  however  precisely during periods of international tension that we must redouble our collective efforts to work out effective arms control measures.160.	With that in mind  Australia is working actively with the other members of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean to work out arrangements for the eventual holding of a conference which would make a positive contribution to the implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace.161.	Across the Indian Ocean from Australia  the problems of southern Africa continue to preoccupy the United Nations and the international community. The peaceful accession of Zimbabwe to independence and membership in the United Nations contrasts starkly with the continuing bleak situation in Namibia and South Africa. As a member of the United Nations Council for Namibia  Australia has been closely involved in United Nations attempts to resolve the problems posed by South Africa's illegal administration of the Territory. The Australian Government supports fully the process of negotiation currently under way aimed at bringing Namibia to independence in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978). It is a matter for regret  however  that two years have elapsed since passage of that resolution. A number of basic issues still remain to be resolved. Further delay can only fuel the frustration of the inhabitants of Namibia and of the members of the international community who are committed to a peaceful resolution of that problem.162.	Just as my Government deplores the failure of the South African authorities so far to make possible the implementation of the United Nations plan for Namibia  so do we deplore the apartheid policies of the South African Government. We have heard the qualified promises from South African leaders that they will consider reforms. With that in mind  Australia calls on South Africa to adopt substantial and early measures to dismantle the repressive apartheid system and to redress the injustices which so many of its citizens suffer. The longer those processes are postponed  the more difficult it will become to bridge the deep divisions which characterize South African society  and the more likely it is that the political violence which has become an increasingly common feature of life in South Africa will escalate to the detriment of all the peoples there.163.	One area of tension in which there has been some positive movement is that of Cyprus. Australia welcomes the resumption on 9 August of the intercommunal talks on Cyprus sponsored by the United Nations and sincerely hopes that the new round of negotiations will lead steadily towards a comprehensive solution.164.	In this context  I recall that at the Meeting of Commonwealth Heads of Government  held at Lusaka in August 1979  it was decided to ask the Commonwealth Secretary General to convene the Commonwealth Committee on Cyprus at the ministerial level whenever appropriate. While we believe that the intercommunal talks offer the best avenue for an enduring settlement in Cyprus  depending on the progress made at those talks  there may well be a need for the Commonwealth aspect to be further explored.165.	Moving across the Mediterranean we find  regretfully  that the situation in the Middle East continues to deteriorate. Indeed  since I last spoke to the Assembly conditions there have clearly come to pose a grave threat to international peace.166.	The Australian Government will support any well founded steps which bring hope of a comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East. Any solution must clearly incorporate the principles embodied in Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  together with recognition of the legitimate political rights of the Palestinian people.167.	The Australian Government welcomes the contribution that the process begun at Camp David has made towards such a peace. Implementation of the bilateral aspects of that process has been one of the few positive developments in that troubled region  but  unfortunately  in other areas progress has been minimal. Neither the fundamental principles of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) nor recognition of the need to ensure a just future for the Palestinian people have been advanced.168.	The Australian Government has been concerned about the inflammatory statements and actions of parties on both sides of the dispute which unhappily have exacerbated the already tense situation in the region. The unilateral declaration by the Israeli parliament that Jerusalem was the undivided capital of Israel has hindered the prospects for a lasting settlement. On the other hand  publicly stated rejections of Israel's right to exist undermine efforts to promote the development of an atmosphere in which genuine negotiations could take place.169.	Given the growing and understandable sense of frustration over this lack of progress  it is most necessary that ways of moving forward again to meaningful negotiations be actively explored. The Australian Government has noted the declaration on the Middle East by the European Community heads of Government following their meeting at Venice in June of this year  and it hopes that the consultations flowing from this declaration will contribute  along with the Camp David process  to the search for a comprehensive settlement in the Middle East.170.	I could not conclude my comments on the Middle East without expressing my Government's apprehension about the threat to global peace posed by some aspects of the present situation in Iran. Iran has an important role to play in promoting stability in the Middle East region. But it is clear that this role cannot be realized while the Iranian authorities continue to flout international convention and international law by holding diplomatic hostages. The Australian Government renews the call it has made many times in the long months since the United States diplomats were seized for the quick and safe release of all the hostages being held by the Iranian Government.171.	I began my statement by referring to the deteriorating international situation. The events of the last few days remind us most forcibly of the dangers we face. The fighting which has erupted between Iraq and Iran is a further cause for very grave concern. That fighting continues to escalate. It has created a situation fraught with danger. It could have serious and unpredictable consequences for a highly sensitive region of the world. The problems between Iran and Iraq are  of course  complex and of long standing. Settlement will not be helped if outside parties seek to meddle in the dispute for their own advantage. Already there is serious concern that the conflict could tempt others into dangerous diplomatic and even military ventures.172.	Australia joins others in urging Iran and Iraq to terminate their conflict. We welcome the initiative of the secretary General and the President of the Security Council in appealing for restraint and urging that Iraq and Iran negotiate a solution to their differences. Unless there is a prompt response to these appeals  we believe the Security Council should meet as a matter of urgency to consider the crisis.173.	Among the distressing consequences of these and other conflicts is the appalling increase in the number of refugees around the world. In the past year  we have witnessed the continuing tragedy of hundreds of thousands of men  women and children being forced to flee their homes in fear of their lives and liberty and to seek sanctuary elsewhere. While substantial efforts have been made to find solutions to the problems of refugees  their numbers in almost every area of the world have continued to grow. Africa is faced with mass movements of people fleeing persecution  war and famine. Nearly 1 million people have fled from Afghanistan into Pakistan. There has been a massive influx of Kampucheans into Thailand and a continuing  steady stream of so-called boat people.174.	The problem is rendered the more tragic by the fact that today the largest numbers of refugees are concentrated in the developing regions of the world  those with least resources  available to cope with such a burden. Africa has suffered particularly badly in this respect  with over 2 million refugees and displaced persons in the Horn of Africa alone. In Southeast Asia  the burden of the IndoChinese refugee crisis has fallen particularly heavily on the countries of ASEAN  imposing great financial  social and political costs.175.	Solutions to the refugee problem can be found only with the cooperation and involvement of the world community  and it is encouraging to see the increasing attention which refugee questions are receiving in international forums. In the coming months the world will have to focus greater attention on Africa  which now has more refugees than any other part of the world. It is in recognition of this crisis that Australia has fully supported recent initiatives for the calling of a pledging conference on African refugees.176.	Australia supports the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in his efforts to alleviate the distress and to promote the resettlement of dispossessed peoples around the world. We are proud of our own role as a country of resettlement for refugees. Since the Second World War  some 400 000 refugees and displaced persons have found new homes in Australia. In addition to resettling refugees  we have been active in providing financial aid. We have contributed more than $30 million in relief assistance for refugees and displaced persons in the past two years alone.177.	However  we all know that the provision of humanitarian assistance is not of itself sufficient to deal with refugee problems. Long-term solutions will be found only if the underlying political causes of refugee situations are addressed. It is the duty of the world community to persuade those Governments concerned to accept their responsibilities towards their citizens and to change the policies which have led to massive refugee outflows.178.	I turn to economic issues  for the eleventh special session on development is still fresh in all our minds. At that time  I addressed in detail the major economic questions confronting the international community  and I do not intend to retrace the ground that was covered there. A word is in order  however  with regard to the final outcome of the special session. Its failure to achieve agreement on the conditions for launching the global round was certainly disappointing. The urgency and the severity of the problems of the current international economic situation require a fresh approach to the task of international economic negotiation..179.	The failure of the special session to reach agreement on procedures for global negotiations can be of satisfaction to no one. At this session of the General Assembly we must all reassess how best we might seek to go about the global round. Substantive differences remain and must be addressed. The way in which we approach these differences should  however  reflect flexibility on all sides. If this spirit is shared by all  success will be assured.180.	Failure to launch the global round should not obscure the fact that the special session was productive of some valuable results. We now have an International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade. It is a matter for satisfaction that the world community was able to agree upon a framework within which we might all approach the development needs of our time. We believe that the text agreed on in the special session should now be adopted and its implementation not be delayed.181.	A special tribute should be paid to the important contribution of the Brandt Commission to international thinking about development issues. The Commission was the result of a unique initiative and its members are to be commended for their efforts to identify areas in which the North South dialogue might be constructively pursued and for the stress laid on interdependence and the commonality of interest of North and South. Australia sees the report of the Commission as both significant and timely and is interested in doing what it can to give effect to the general approach taken in the report.182.	I turn now to nuclear and arms control and disarmament issues. The difficulties which confront the world in assuring itself of adequate energy sources highlight the importance of nuclear energy. We have seen an encouraging level of international debate on peaceful nuclear questions over the past year  such as the International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation  which should encourage the development over time of closer international comity on the arrangements and conditions governing nuclear trade and cooperation and sensitive stages of the nuclear fuel cycle. This trend was also observed at the recent Second Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons where  despite the lack of agreement on a consensus final document  there was substantial agreement on most issues relating to the application of international safeguards and the arrangements covering the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.183.	The further development of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes on a stable and secure basis depends  of course  on continuing efforts and constraints against the spread of nuclear weapons to additional countries. The relationship between the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and arms control and disarmament is integral to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  a Treaty which represents a political barrier to nuclear weapon proliferation  both horizontally to new States and vertically to existing nuclear arsenals. It was significant that at the Second Review Conference  while the Treaty was subjected to rigorous examination  there was no questioning of its principal objectives. The absence of a final consensus statement reflected concern over the pace and direction of nuclear disarmament efforts rather than any fundamental conflict of interest. But a note of warning has been sounded that there must be balanced implementation of all the Treaty's major provisions if its effectiveness is to be maintained in the longer term.184.	It is incumbent on the international community to make continuing efforts to encourage adherence to the Treaty and to offer incentives for doing so as well as disabilities for non- membership.185.	That is not to deny the necessity of further measures of nuclear arms control by the nuclear weapons States. Australia has given strong support to the SALT process; which resulted in the agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union  and trusts that it will be continued. We have also been an active proponent of the conclusion of a comprehensive test ban agreement as a further restraint on the existing nuclear arsenals and a further major obstacle to the spread of nuclear weapons. The finalization of such a treaty is urgent  for the involvement of the international community through the Committee on Disarmamentâto complement the efforts of the negotiating Powersâis essential if the treaty is to attract widespread support. Without that support its impact would be seriously limited.186.	Events earlier this year have had an undesirably adverse effect on the degree of mutual trust and confidence necessary in bilateral and multilateral arms control negotiations. It is my country's hope that an atmosphere more conducive to negotiations can be restored.187.	It is encouraging that the Committee on Disarmament has this year got down to serious business and has succeeded in separating polemical debate from the practical consideration of substantive issues. The Committee has been able in working groups to concentrate on the negotiating tasks for which it has a mandate.188.	I now turn to decolonization and the South Pacific. As others before me have noted  1980 is the twentieth anniversary of two landmark resolutions on decolonization adopted by this Assembly  resolutions 1514 (XV) and 1541 (XV). With one lamentable exception  all African States which were once colonies have achieved their independence  and we have seen considerable progress in the Caribbean and in the Pacific.189.	The most recent country to achieve its independence is the former condominium of the New Hebrides  the new State of Vanuatu. Australia has made known in committees of this Assembly its views on the achievement of independence by the State of Vanuatu. It is sufficient for me to say here that Australia welcomes the advent of the new State and looks forward to its becoming the newest Member of this Organization  should it decide to join the ranks. The events which followed Vanuatu's achievement of independence  specifically on Tanna and Santo islands  have drawn attention to the fact that the exercise of the right of self-determination in the South Pacific had previously been remarkably smooth and peaceful. It is Australia's hope that this predominant feature will continue to characterize the region as further transitions occur.190.	There is one subject on the international agenda which has progressed most positively. I refer to the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. The resumed ninth session  which recently concluded at Geneva  has achieved significant results  reflected in the fact that the Conference now has the text of a draft convention before it. Australia was particularly pleased with the progress made. It is our hope that the package which has been negotiated will hold together and that a convention can be opened for signature in 1981. We shall be making every effort to help to achieve that goal.191.	The Charter reaffirms our faith in fundamental human rights  in the dignity and worth of the human person and in equal rights of all men and women. Unhappily  it is all too easy to enumerate situations arising since the original signature of the Charter in 1945 and the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 in which the sanctity of human life and the protection of human rights have been disregarded. The features of the current international scene that I have referred to earlier make it clear that there are formidable obstacles to progress. Human beings in many parts of the world continue to suffer the denial of their fundamental rights through political oppression  racism and foreign domination  as well as through poverty or lack of effective access to the organs of State which determine their lives.192.	From an historical perspective  however  much has been done to bring hope to the dispossessed and deprived peoples of the world. Expectations have changed. Our definitions of deprivation have become more pragmatic  and today when we take account of the rights of individuals we include the rights of women  the disabled and the elderly. And we are beginning to talk of the right to development as a human right.193.	So long as we live in a world of sovereign States  there will always be some tension between the legitimate interests of the States and the rights of individuals. But while accepting that  we should always scrutinize very carefully any attempted justification of the dilution of rights in terms of reasons of State. It should be made absolutely clear that the onus of proof lies with the Government in question. The flagrant violations of human rights  for whatever reason  are a proper concern of the international community  and cessation of the conditions of such violations can rightfully be demanded of responsible Governments. Australia is firmly committed to international action to ensure the protection of human rights  and we shall continue to attach the highest priority to the full realization of that fundamental goal as pursued both specifically in United Nations human rights programmes and more broadly in the activities of the Organization as a whole.194.	I began my statement with some observations about the seriousness of the multiple crises which the world is now facing and by recalling some of the ideas which are basic to the Charter. There are some who will assume that  if we are moving into an era of great turbulence and danger  the Organization must automatically become more important than ever. There are others who will assume the exact opposite that as tensions increase and conflicts sharpen the United Nations will inevitably be shouldered aside and become of diminished relevance.195. Both  in my view  are mistaken. Nothing is automatic  nothing is inevitable. The role which the United Nations will play in this critical period is not predetermined. It will depend on the will and capacity which we  its Members  bring to bear to make it effective and to make it relevant.196. We should recognize the limitations of what the United Nations can do. But  having recognized them  we should ensure that the United Nations is used to these very limits. The United Nations cannot abolish power politics; it cannot end the conflicts and rivalries among some sovereign States. But it can bring pressure to bear to maintain dialogue and communications between conflicting parties  and it can contribute thereby to the process of peaceful settlement of international disputes. The United Nations is also best placed to articulate and organize the humanitarian impulses within the international community and to express the aspirations of mankind to peace and international cooperation. It can likewise bring moral censure to bear on those who ignore and isolate these impulses and aspirations. We have a duty to see that it does all these things  does them with conviction and does them with telling effect. "
"7",363,"AUT",35,1980,"ï»¿Mr. President  it is with particular pleasure that I congratulate you on your election as President of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. We greet you as the representative of a country which is a good neighbour and close friend of ours. Your great experience and deep knowledge  combined with your outstanding diplomatic skill and political acumen  augur well for the work of this session of the Assembly.â10.	We also wish to express our sincere gratitude and appreciation to your predecessor  Ambassador Salim Ahmed Salim  who guided the General Assembly through a particularly sensitive and demanding period in a steady  intelligent and prudent way.11.	It is also a pleasure for me to welcome two new Members to the Organization. We should like today to offer our heartfelt congratulations to the delegations of Zimbabwe and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  and it is our hope that we shall enjoy close co-operation with them.12.	In December  25 years will have elapsed since Austria was admitted to the United Nations. Austria has successfully made use of that time to establish  in the spirit of the Charter of the United Nations  good relations with all countries of the world  irrespective of their economic  social or political systems. In particular  we are proud to have excellent relations with all our neighbours.13.	During Austria's 25 years of membership  certain areas have emerged as focal points for our co-operation. These constant elements are the following: unconditional support for human rights  development  disarmament and strengthening of international law. In addition  Austria actively participates in United Nations peace-keeping operations.14.	Austria continues to attach great importance to United Nations peace-keeping efforts and is willing also in the future to contribute to the further development of this most useful instrument. I should like sincerely to thank all the soldiers who today are serving the cause of peace under the United Nations flag.15.	In pursuing its policy of establishing good relations with all our neighbouring countries  Austria  with respect to Italy  has received active assistance from the United Nations. Resolutions 1497 (XV) of 31 October 1960 and 1661 (XVI) of 28 November 1981 on the question of South Tyrol led to negotiations which in 1969 resulted in an autonomy agreement for South Tyrol. Thus the conditions for friendly relations between two neighbours have been established. In accordance with those resolutions  I should like to report that during the past year further positive steps have been taken to implement the so-called South Tyrol package. However  20 years have elapsed since the first General Assembly resolution on this question and 11 years since the Austro-Italian agreement. Nevertheless  essential parts of the package are still unimplemented. We therefore fully understand the impatience of the population of South Tyrol. The Austrian Government is particularly concerned that full equality for the mother tongue of the minority  which is so important to it  has not yet been guaranteed. Prime Minister Cossiga and Foreign Minister Colombo have recently made promising statements on this question. We hope that those statements will be honoured by a new Italian Government  too. That would justify my expectations that the problems which have not yet been settled will be resolved as quickly as possible and in a satisfactory way.16.	Four years ago I had the honour to speak before the General Assembly for the first time and to present Austria's position on the world situation.  There was little reason for optimism then and there is even less today. In addition to the crises which the Organization has been facing for years  we are now confronted with new and even more complex ones.17.	I should like here to refer above all to the situation in the Middle East. The present military conflict between Iran and Iraq constitutes a new element in the crises of the region. Austria is following the development of relations between Iran and Iraq with deep concern. The hostilities which are taking place in clear violation of the obligations under the Charter have created a very serious situation which  combined with the other conflicts in the region  threatens to assume global proportions.18.	It is Austria's position that  in view of these circumstances  an effective attempt must be made to settle the conflict by peaceful means and with due respect for international law and without resorting to any further use of force. Austria therefore welcomes and supports swift action by the Security Council. We  of course  recognize that regional organizations have assumed an increasing responsibility in the maintenance of international peace and security and in the mediation and peaceful settlement of regional conflicts. Austria appreciates this development. We deem it necessary  however  to recall that the primary responsibility for the maintenance of peace lies with the Security Council and that action on the regional level should never impede the Security Council from fulfilling its duties.19.	We are deeply concerned  both for humanitarian reasons and for reasons of principle  about the fate of the American hostages  who are still being held in Iran despite the intensive efforts of the international community. Although we do not underestimate the difficulties and fundamental changes arising in the wake of a revolution  we must reiterate the unconditional position we stated last year in the Security Council.  We strongly deplore the taking of hostages as a flagrant violation of international law and of the rules of diplomacy  which constitute the very basis of relations between States in all civilizations and cultures.20.	We are aware of the efforts to solve this problem and we hope that reason  understanding and moderation will prevail on all sides. We make an urgent appeal to the Iranian Parliament to free the hostages  in respect for international law  without any further delay  regardless of the rather intricate situation provoked by the military conflict with Iraq. In this context  I wish to thank the Secretary-General most sincerely for his tireless efforts in the interest of the hostages.21.	The military invasion of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union  which was condemned by the overwhelming majority of Members of the United Nations  including Austria  at the sixth emergency special session of the General Assembly early this year  continues seriously to disrupt the stability of the region and to threaten the policy of detente.22.	As regards the Arab-Israeli conflict  the situation has not improved in any way. Austria is deeply concerned about this development which  owing to its complexity and its relationship to other crises  could lead to a world-wide conflict. I assume that Austria's position on this problem is well known. It was presented in detail by both Chancellor Kreisky and myself during the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly. In accordance with our position as a permanently neutral State  it is marked by an effort to be objective and impartial.23.	We must note with great concern that all efforts to achieve a peaceful resolution of this conflict have thus far been unsuccessful. The most recent steps taken by Israel with respect to Jerusalem and its measures in the occupied territories have further aggravated the situation. We deplore and condemn Israel's attempt to annex Jerusalem because this is a flagrant violation of international law and the relevant United Nations resolutions. Consequently  it has to be considered as null and void. Jerusalem is a city where the beliefs and aspirations of great spiritual and religious traditions and powers meet  factors which increase the political complexity of the problem  adding emotional and even prophetic aspects. A high degree of political imagination will therefore be needed in order to work out specific formulas for solutions  and in this process all the considerations advanced by interested and objective observers will have to be taken into account.24.	In this connection  the criteria proposed by the Holy See should be mentioned. In addition to the call for free  access to all holy sites  these criteria include the requirement that the duly acquired traditional rights of the various religious communities in the city be respected and assured.25.	The problems involved are enormous. Therefore it is all the more vital that the greatest possible efforts be made to use all available opportunities to contribute to a just and peaceful solution. This problem cannot be solved by force. Israel  too  will have to accept this reality.26.	We also condemn Israel's policy of establishing settlements in the occupied territories and  in particular  the deportation of the mayors of Hebron and Halhul  freely elected representatives of Palestinian communities.27.	We call upon the General Assembly to take steps similar to those taken in adopting resolution 34/29 of 16 November 1979  concerning the Mayor of Nablus  to ensure that this action  which violates the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War  of 12 August 1949  and the most basic human rights  is revoked as soon as possible.28.	The present crises in the Middle East and Afghanistan have overshadowed the tragic events in South-East Asia. Nevertheless  the dimensions of that human tragedy remain staggering. Our position has not changed. We condemn Viet Nam's invasion of Kampuchea as well as the violations of human rights by the Pol Pot regime which preceded it. Our prime concern is for the Kampuchean people  with whom we are in full solidarity. This year  too  we will support all efforts to relieve the suffering of that people.29.	The many political crises in our world must not cause us to forget that the greatest potential source of danger to world order is that economic and social gap which separates the North from the South  the industrialized from the developing countries. The greatest challenge facing mankind in the last two decades of this century is to overcome the asymmetry in economic development. A new international order based on an equitable balance of the interests of developing and industrialized countries must be built through dialogue and understanding.30.	During the 1980s one of the most important elements in the development process and in international economic relations will undoubtedly be the availability of adequate energy supplies. The manner in which this problem is solved will test the viability of the world economy. This question places an equally great responsibility on all countries.31.	A long-term solution can be achieved only through a constructive dialogue between producers and consumers  which would best be undertaken within the framework of the United Nations global round of negotiations.32.	The energy crisis presents the international community  and the world monetary system in particular  with a significant challenge: the international monetary institutions must increase their role as catalysts between surplus and deficit countries.33.	I cannot imagine that mankind  which in its long history has solved tremendous problems with the help of human ingenuity  science and technology  must stand powerless before a situation which directly affects each and every one of us.34.	Instead  we believe that a large-scale joint undertaking by industrial and oil-producing countries can mobilize sufficient intellectual  technical arid financial resources to deal successfully with the North-South problem in all its dimensions. Austria's ideas for a massive transfer of resources were last put before the General Assembly at its eleventh special session. 35.	In view of the unsatisfactory outcome of that special session  I should like to return to a thought first voiced by Willy Brandt and then discussed intensively by President Lopez Portillo of Mexico and Chancellor Kreisky: a summit meeting of statesmen from industrialized and developing countries to mobilize the political will of Governments  thus promoting mutually acceptable solutions to the North- South problem. This could at the same time give a useful political impetus to the forthcoming round of global negotiations. The idea of convening such a meeting next year has won widespread support.36.	A commission for disarmament and international security  consisting of representatives from the East  West and South and headed by Olof Palme  was recently established at Vienna. The independent Palme Commission will function similarly to the Brandt Commission7 and will also deal with the problems of releasing funds for development. The Palme Commission has set itself the long-term goal of preparing for comprehensive disarmament agreements and for practical disarmament measures  particularly for submission at the special session of the General Assembly on disarmament to be held in 1982. We should follow the work of the Palme Commission carefully. One of its primary goals is to mobilize public opinion for disarmament. That is particularly important today  when we are witnessing signs of a new arms race between the great Powers.37. Our specific efforts to promote peace are based on a deep commitment to human rights. Without peace human rights are not secure; and peace cannot be guaranteed without respect for human rights. Therefore  our policy of unconditional commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights remains a corner-stone of our policy in the United Nations. We are convinced that respect for human rights is an indispensable prerequisite for peace  development  security and the reduction of tensions.38.	The tragic problem of growing flows of refugees all over the world has also to be seen in the context of human rights. I am therefore grateful to my colleague  the Foreign Minister of the Federal Republic of Germany  Mr. Genscher  for drawing the attention of the Assembly to the need to study the background of that problem. As a country with a tradition of accepting refugees and granting asylum  Austria supports the initiative of the Federal Republic of Germany and will participate actively in the work of the General Assembly relating to this new agenda item.39.	As I stated at the Meeting on Refugees and Displaced Persons in South-East Asia  held at Geneva on 20 and 21 July 1979  it is not the people in distress who are responsible for their situation  but those who have caused it. The responsibility therefore lies with those who are still not prepared to respect human rights  despite the Charter  despite the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  despite the two International Covenants on Human Rights and despite the many resolutions and treaties on human rights. All the people who are forced to seek asylum and to live as refugees in this world are victims of violations of human rights. That holds true for the victims of racial discrimination as well  and for those who are persecuted on political and religious grounds. But it holds true also for the people who are forced to leave their homes because of hunger and distress. When we talk about human rights  we mean political and civil liberties as much as basic social  economic and cultural rights.40.	The problems of the world are so numerous and our agenda is so comprehensive that it is impossible for me to address every point in this statement. My delegation will present the Austrian position on these questions in detail during this session. Let me just say in brief that we attach very great importance to  inter alia  the fate of Lebanon  the talks between the ethnic communities in Cyprus  urgent realization of the United Nations plan for Namibia  the Independent Commission on International Development Issues under the Chairmanship of Willy Brandt. elimination of the apartheid system in South Africa and of all other forms of racial discrimination  the elimination of capital punishment and torture and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons  as well as to all questions relating to the World Conference of the United Nations Decade for Women. We sincerely hope that at this session the Assembly will bring us closer to a solution of all these problems.41.	Although the present world situation does not leave much scope for optimism  I do not want to overlook the positive developments. We wish to mention Zimbabwe in particular. Its peaceful transition to independence and its course towards a multiracial society had raised our hopes that it would have an exemplary effect on our common endeavours to achieve the full independence of Namibia.42.	Non-alignment has become a dynamic force in international relations and a catalyst in solving important international problems. It has contributed to the development of a feeling of responsibility for global issues among States  large and small. We consider non-alignment a stabilizing element in international politics and believe that the non- aligned States have a special role to play in a period of increasing tension. We feel that opportunities for cooperation do exist between non-aligned and neutral countries  both on the global level of the United Nations as well as regionally  as for instance within the framework of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  which was held at Helsinki in 1975.43.	We expect the second review session of that Conference to be held at Madrid  to recall forcefully the obligations undertaken in the Final Act of Helsinki and to lend the process of detente the impetus it so urgently needs in this time of heightening tensions. The events of this year have demonstrated more clearly than ever before that detente has to be universal. It has become truly indivisible. Even if one wanted to limit it to certain regions  in today's age of interdependence that would be impossible.44.	We are all aware that we are living in a time of transitionâtransition from one historic period to another. In such a time tensions will inevitably develop between ideas and reality  reason and power  morality and politics. Each and every one of us is acutely aware of those tensions and their repercussions on both our personal and international life.45.	Everywhere in the world today we witness developments aimed at dismantling the established order in many sectors and calling into question recognized values without creating new orders to replace them. The resulting vacuum contributes to the rise of tensions  the solution to which situation is sought through the use of force. The spread of violence in many parts of the world is a consequence of that development  which fills us with growing concern. I am referring here to the increasing terrorism which claims innocent victims again and again  as for instance in the brutal and cowardly bombing attacks in Bologna and Munich.46.	We have to be aware of the fact that our youth  in its search for new life-styles and new forms of expression  is also attracted by violence. It is not by defensive attitudes  with the ensuing risk of perpetuating conflicts  that we shall succeed in integrating new forms of social behaviour into existing societies and in developing in our youth a sense of commitment to international co-operation and the ideals of the United Nations. We shall succeed in such an endeavour only if we make much greater efforts to guide the idealism and energy of youth towards positive goals and to work together with the younger generation to build new orders and values wherever the existing ones appear obsolete.47.	In this connection  I wish to say a word on the environment. The excessive exploitation of nature in this century has resulted in damage of still unknown consequences. Only over the past decade has it been recognized that measures must be taken to preserve the ecological balance. We must adopt a much more serious approach to our environmental problems. We must also try to integrate the concerns of environmentalists into our existing systems. We must see to it that these concerns are duly taken into consideration at the national and international levels. This is a responsibility which the Organization must not shirk.48.	The challenge all of us must face  whether we be statesmen or diplomats  scientists or philosophers  is that of combining our forces in order to create  step by step  a more human and more peaceful world order. We have no other choice if we wish mankind to survive.49.	On the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of Austria's membership of the United Nations  I would like to renew our commitment to the world Organization and our profession of loyalty to the Organization's goals and ideals with a quote from Karl Renner  the first President of our second Republic. He said:""A world of organized peace is coming; a world of lasting co-operation; a community of nations rich in blessingsâand the Republic of Austria will be the most loyal member of this community."""
"8",434,"BDI",35,1980,"ï»¿Mr. President  may I  on behalf of the delegation of Burundi  say how pleased we are to see you presiding over the work of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. Your long experience in the Organization  your high sense of responsibility and your determination to fight constantly for the ideals which led to the creation of the United Nations are a valuable pledge of the harmonious progress and successful outcome of the work of this session. Furthermore  you represent a country with which Burundi is pleased to have solid bonds of cooperation. Rest assured that my delegation will spare no effort to cooperate fully with you for the success of your delicate tasks.72.	May I also pay a warm tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim  of the United Republic of Tanzania. The diligence  competence  skill and dynamism he displayed  both during the deliberations at the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly and at the special sessions which dealt with topics that were complex  stormy and even explosive  won him the esteem  admiration and respect of all. He has done honour to his country and to Africa as a whole.73.	A few weeks ago we joyfully welcomed Zimbabwe as the one hundred and fifty-third Member of the United Nations. The decolonization of that country was a source of pride and hope to us. It showed the high level of maturity attained by the people and leaders of that country and their willingness to live together in mutual respect for each other's diversity. It shattered the absurd notion of those who still believed that colonization and the reign of apartheid would last for ever. A source of hope for those still struggling against the colonial yoke  Zimbabwe's accession to independence has given new impetus and strength to the efforts of all those fighting for self-determination and independence.74.	We also welcome Saint Vincent and the Grenadines as the one hundred and fifty-fourth Member State.75.	The United Nations will certainly be strengthened by the contribution of these two countries  whose struggle for peace  justice and respect for human rights and dignity has marked the history of their respective lengthy struggles. We are assured that they will lend new impetus and dynamism to the Organization.76.	We also wish to express our satisfaction and our support to Mr. Kurt Waldheim  whose high sense of responsibility  competence  integrity and clear-sightedness make that eminent statesman one of the personages who have won the esteem and admiration of the whole international community.77.	The thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly was an exceptional one for the Government and people of Burundi. The head of State of Burundi  Colonel Jean Baptiste Bagaza  took a personal part in that session. By his presence he was giving vivid proof of the gratitude of the Government and people of Burundi for the efforts of the United Nations within the framework of cooperation among nations. As he declared from this rostrum:""The work that has been done in this area by the United Nations is  in our view  of particular importance. We should therefore like to take this opportunity to pay a well-deserved tribute to the General Assembly  which can take pride in having so consistently lived up to the importance of its task and  therefore  constitutes an ideal framework for cooperation  exchange of experience and decision making."" 78.	That exceptional occasion enabled the people of Burundi  through its President  to express its full trust in and constant support for the United Nations in its noble task of striving ceaselessly for the triumph of its fundamental objectives.79.	Those fundamental objectives are also those of our people and have been comprehensively stated in the Assembly by President Bagaza. His conclusion on this score illustrates in several ways  on the one hand  the method of government of the Second Republic which makes participation by every citizen in public life the essential condition for its success  and  on the other hand  our opening up to the international community  which led to our association with the United Nations in one of the most important stages of our national life. I quote that conclusion:""In order to permit the Burundi people effectively to exercise its prerogatives of sovereignty  we created the necessary conditions for the party to be able to guide and genuinely to control the executive. In other words  the people run and manage their own affairs in the communes and the provinces. Leaders are only kept in their posts to the extent that they enjoy the confidence of the people.""Thanks to the political maturity of our people  we believe that the time has come to permit it to choose its leaders at all levels. This task is incumbent on the National Congress of the UPRONA party [Union pour le progres national]  a meeting of which is scheduled for the end of this year  and this will constitute in practice the consummation of the action already laid down at the level of the communal assemblies and provincial congresses of the renovated UPRONA party.""In the light of the foregoing  we can claim that the State which we are organizing is one which will permit the Burundi people to perpetuate their history  to strengthen their age-old unity  to consolidate the victories they have won  to build their democracy and to determine their future in a free and sovereign manner. It is for the people of Burundi  in fact  to pronounce on the type of society which will safeguard their identity  while guaranteeing their progress in a world full of change.""This is the role of the National Congress of the party  and this is why we quite rightly consider that this session of the party will constitute an event of primary importance in the national life of the Burundi people. We were therefore anxious to inform the United Nations and the whole international community of this  especially because we in Burundi consider that there must exist a certain harmony between internal options and a country's foreign policy."" 80.	A year later I am pleased to announce to the Assembly that the promises made by my President at the thirty-fourth session have been entirely carried out. The Congress of UPRONA  which met from 26 to 29 December 1979  was highly successful  because  on the one hand  of the broad participation of the people and  on the other  of the important decisions taken concerning the democratic organization of our country and the domestic and external options of the Government of Burundi. At the end of that Congress  the participants unanimously reaffirmed the guiding principles of Burundi's foreign policy as defined from this rostrum by the President of the Republic of Burundi  Colonel Jean Baptiste Bagaza. Those principles are good neighbourliness  positive nonalignment  non-interference in the internal affairs of other States  international cooperation and support for national liberation movements.81.	Basing myself on those fundamental principles guiding the foreign policy of my country  I should like to turn to the major issues of the day. In the main  they concern decolonization  the Middle East  Southeast Asia and the new international economic order.82.	South Africa's presence in Namibia  the militarization of that Territory  the policy of brutal repression of the Namibian people  the ruthless exploitation of that peace loving people  the plundering of Namibia's resources and the deliberate destruction of national unity and territorial integrity are  in the view of the Government of Burundi  criminal acts of aggression against the nation of Namibia and flout the will of the international community.83.	With a view to putting an end to this unacceptable situation  the United Nations has adopted a number of resolutions condemning South Africa for its illegal occupation and calling upon it to withdraw from Namibia.84.	In view of South Africa's intransigence  the Security Council  in its resolution 435 (1978)  has endorsed a proposal of five Western countries. In a spirit of great responsibility and high political maturity  the only genuine representative of the Namibian people  SWAPO  has accepted that United Nations proposal. However  to that positive attitude  the illegal South African regime responded only with mass arbitrary arrests of SWAPO leaders and Namibian patriots. South Africa's answer to the constructive proposal to demilitarize the frontier zone between Namibia and Angola has been to step up the totally unprovoked acts of aggression against the People's Republic of Angola and the Republic of Zambia.85.	In these circumstances  the Government of Burundi is convinced that the following measures and actions should be adopted by the United Nations and the entire international community: practical support for the armed struggle being waged valiantly by the Namibian people under the leadership of SWAPO; pressure to be exerted on that illegal regime by States and Powers involved in this policy of occupation and exploitation; and  above all  the imposition by the Security Council of comprehensive mandatory sanctions against South Africa pursuant to Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations.86.	Not far from Namibia  the South African racists continue to gag a whole people subjected to barbarous and hateful repression because of the colour of their skin.87.	In fact  in South Africa the situation is constantly deteriorating because of the criminal policy of apartheid. The vice is being tightened on a people struggling only for its survival  dignity and freedom.88.	The machine of war and repression is striking the Coloured inhabitants of South Africa mercilessly and without distinction. In this escalation of violence peaceful populations  the elderly  women and children are not spared. Indeed  let us recall the massacres of Sharpeville  Soweto and elsewhere.89.	In view of this intolerable situation  the South African people has been compelled to take up arms against that regime of tyranny. We seize this opportunity to pay a tribute to this valiant people and its national liberation movement. The victories already gained by the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania and  in particular  the African National Congress of South Africa should give rise to more solidarity with the South African people.90.	I should like  on behalf of the Government of Burundi  urgently to appeal to the international community so that appropriate measures shall at last be taken to restore freedom and dignity to the South African people at present subjected to the most ferocious repression.91.	In this context the delegation of Burundi reaffirms the legitimacy of the armed struggle being waged by the oppressed people of South Africa and condemns the racist South African regime for its policy of repression and its acts of armed aggression against the frontline States and the continuation of collaboration and political  military  nuclear  economic  cultural and trade cooperation with South Africa.92.	The Government of Burundi supports the military embargo imposed by the Security Council in resolution 418 344 (1977) against South Africa. Furthermore  the Government of Burundi is convinced of the need and the urgency for the Security Council to adopt mandatory measures pursuant to Chapter VII of the Charter  including Article 41  with a view to putting an end to the apartheid regime  which is a serious threat to international peace and security not only in Africa but also throughout the world.93.	Although the African continent has largely freed itself of colonial and racist domination  there are still anachronistic colonial situations such as those in Namibia  South Africa and Western Sahara  on which something should be said. The question of Western Sahara is  in my delegation's view  one of decolonization. It therefore falls within the framework of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV)  the twentieth anniversary of whose adoption we shall soon be celebrating.94.	For the Government of Burundi  there can be no doubt that the Sahraoui people must freely exercise its inalienable right to self-determination and independence in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and that of the Organization of African Unity [OAU]. My delegation considers that the efforts of the two organizations aimed at the decolonization of Western Sahara are complementary and call for the withdrawal of all Moroccan occupation troops from the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic.95.	We urge Morocco to abide by the relevant resolutions of the OAU and the United Nations calling upon it to put an end to its military occupation of Western Sahara.96.	With regard to the position of the Government of Burundi  I should like to reaffirm its solidarity with the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic  and to assure POLISARIO of its total support. In recognizing the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic  with which the State of Burundi has just established diplomatic relations at the ambassadorial level  the Government of Burundi is guided only by a concern for cooperation and solidarity with a people struggling for its dignity and freedom.97.	While still on the subject of the African continent  I should like to express the deep concern of the Government of Burundi over the tragedy in Chad. With regard to the situation in Chad  the Government of Burundi calls upon all States not to interfere in that country's internal affairs and to allow the people of Chad to settle their problems themselves.98.	For more than three decades the question of Palestine has been before the Organization. Numerous initiatives for a settlement have been put forward; all have ended in failure because of Israel's intransigence or simply because they ignored one of the parties concerned  namely  the people of Palestine  whose sole representative is the PLO.99.	Any settlement which does not duly take this factor into account can only lead to a deadlock. No country  no matter how powerful  no organization  however universal  can tell the Palestinian people how its State should be organized or what statutes or regime it should adopt  nor can any form of government be imposed on it. It is therefore up to the PLO alone  which is the sole authentic representative of the Palestinian people  to negotiate on behalf of that people and to arrive at a course of action without any foreign interference.100.	Looking at the situation in the Middle East  the Government of Burundi reaffirms its opposition to the acquisition of territory by force. It therefore condemns the occupation by Israel of Arab and Palestinian territories. The Government of Burundi also condemns the Israeli policy of Jewish settlements in Palestinian and Arab lands.101.	The decision taken by Israel to annex the eastern sector of Jerusalem has aroused deep emotion in my country and throughout the world. In the view of the Government of Burundi  that act is completely null and void. Thus  my delegation would call on the Israeli authorities to revoke their decision and to respect the sacred nature of the Holy City of Jerusalem.102.	The situation in Southeast Asia is scarcely more reassuring than those that I have mentioned in Africa and the Middle East. Indeed  the situation prevailing in Afghanistan  Kampuchea and Korea deserves special attention by the international community.103.	With respect to Afghanistan  the delegation of Burundi would like to state the following. First  the Government of Burundi respects the sovereignty and the basic choices of the Afghan people. Consequently  the Government of Burundi is opposed to any intervention or interference in  the internal affairs of that independent country which is a member of the nonaligned movement. Secondly  the Government of Burundi is opposed to any subversion from abroad against the people of Afghanistan and is opposed to any use of that territory as a springboard for threatening the security of any neighbouring country. Thirdly  the Government of Burundi considers that  given the present international political situation  the Afghan people can freely decide on its future only if all foreign troops are withdrawn from its territory.104.	With respect to the situation in Kampuchea  my delegation would also like to make its position clear. First  the Government of Burundi considers that the people of Kampuchea is alone able to determine without foreign interference  its future and its fate. Secondly  my Government is opposed to the use of that territory as a base for launching acts of aggression or attacks against any other State in the region. Thirdly  my Government is convinced that the time has come to allow the people of Kampuchea to take charge of its own destiny without foreign interference. Thus  the Government of Burundi favours the withdrawal of all foreign troops and forces from that territory and the ending of any external subversion against that people  v hose political personality and cultural identity have resisted all foreign occupation.105.	With respect to the question of Korea  the Government of Burundi unreservedly supports the peaceful reunification and independence of the Korean nation. My country supports the withdrawal of all foreign troops based in South Korea. My delegation would further like to draw the attention of the international community to the serious consequences of admitting two Koreas to the United Nations. We believe that this course of action should be opposed.106.	The position of my country on the situations which today are the flashpoints in the world has been arrived at only by concern for respecting the will of those peoples and for promoting a climate of detente and international security.107.	In this context  the Government of Burundi sincerely hopes that the conclusions of the tenth special session  devoted to disarmament  will be followed by action and that general and complete disarmament can get under way.108.	My country hailed the results of the Helsinki Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe as an important step on the road to detente. It welcomes the signing by the Soviet Union and the United States of America of the agreement known as SALT II   which we hope will be rapidly ratified.109.	With a view to strengthening international peace and security  the delegation of Burundi considers that the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace should be implemented by all States. We urge the great Powers to give up their rivalry in that region  which is so rich in promise.110.	Real and lasting peace and security are inconceivable without justice and equity in international economic relations. It is justice that is at stake here. In their report the eminent experts of the Brandt Commission  speak of moral imperatives. Today there are many peoples with respect to whom famine and poverty take their toll with unprecedented severity  developing countries which see their natural wealth ruthlessly exploited by the developed countries or through foreign transnational corporations. Those ""poor"" countries stand helplessly by while their resources are plundered and they see themselves being deprived of the means to promote their own development. I shall not even mention other factors which give rise to serious tension and which may  once the victims have become truly aware of what is happening  lead to desperate action. And we know very well that what comes too late is called irreparable.111.	The Assembly has just held its eleventh special session  which was entirely devoted to the consideration of economic problems. The presence at that special session of such a large number of very high level representatives stressed the concern felt by all the peoples represented about the chaotic world economic situation and demonstrated the ardent hope of the community of States that it can finally begin real cooperation in international economic relations. Statements were almost unanimous in noting the failure of the prevailing economic system because it is unjust  anachronistic  ineffective and not adapted to the present situation.112.	Although my delegation can say in general that it was satisfied with the level of representation and the quality of the debate  the same would not be true with respect to the assessment of the results of the work done at the session. Indeed  we were deeply disappointed by the refusal of someStates to allow global negotiations to begin. We hope that those States will change their position at the current session and will take this unique opportunity to break the deadlock.113.	One view is shared unanimously in all international forums: the North South dialogue has come to a halt. Confronted with this pause  any country can easily understand the impatience of the least developed countries  expecting as they do to see the international community urgently adopt and apply practical measures on their behalf.114.	A good many developing countries still have the energy to pursue the economic debate wherever it is taking place  and they still manage to support their national economies  to a greater or lesser extent. But the least developed countries are in desperate straights. The economies of those countries are on the verge of ruin.115.	There is no need to repeat all the eloquent statistics of the United Nations and the specialized agencies with respect to the situation in those countries. However  let us just mention the following: annual per capita gross national product  less than $100; their share of the manufactured goods market  less than 10 per cent of the gross domestic product; an 80 per cent rate of illiteracy among the population; a per capita income growth rate of less than 1 per cent over the last 20 years.116.	The report of the Brandt Commission adds that each of those countries subsists between survival and disaster and lives in an environment of total dependence on the international market forces which are completely beyond its control.117.	To that generally gloomy picture must be added the fact that my country  Burundi  which is one of the countries in that unenviable position  is additionally handicapped by being landlocked. That further challenge to our development effort places a heavy burden on our exports and imports. Thus  large sums from the already meagre national budget are constantly being deflected from their primary allocations to offset the considerable difficulties caused by the landlocked situation.118.	Burundi is also one of those countries that are ""most seriously affected"" by the present crises in the world economy. Quite apart from rhetoric  we can prove that the causes of our economic backwardness are many and deep-rooted and totally beyond our control. Our partners in the struggle for development will certainly forgive me if I set apart from the general picture of the economies of the developing countries the particular position of the least developed economies.119.	The developed countries  whose heavy historical responsibility no longer needs to be demonstrated  will also understand our cry of alarm and will immediately wish  we hope  to play their proper part in this rescue operation for the least developed countries. In the specific case of that category of countries  there is no more time to play with words and talk about the economies of the ""most seriously affected"" or the ""most vulnerable"" countries. The evil is more deep-seated  and should be given special priority attention by the international community.120.	We most ardently hope that the preparations for and the work of the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries  to be held next year  will be successful. My country is taking a very active part in preparing for that Conference and expects that action oriented measures will replace what might be called ""just one more resolution"" or ""just one more action programme""  since both have so far remained dead letters.121.	Burundi is convinced that the future prosperity of the developing countries lies in their mutual cooperation. Indeed  we even think that in view of the present deadlock in the North South dialogue  economic and technological cooperation among developing countries is an essential alternative.122.	What is  in the opinion of the Government of Burundi  the real meaning of South South cooperation? It is not  to our mind  a substitute for international cooperation but rather a supplement to it. Nor is it an element of confrontation with our partners in the North. On the contrary  cooperation among developing countries is one factor in developing the resources and capabilities of our countries and a means of promoting peace and cooperation in an international framework in which the developing countries  regarded as full partners  will forge their own destiny in freedom.123.	Since the adoption of the Buenos Aires Plan of Action several regional and interregional meetings have been held  some at the highest political level  and have clearly shown the determination of the developing countries to strive for collective self-reliance. Africa  for its part  showed that w y firm resolution at the second extraordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU  held at Lagos in April  which was an historic meeting. The African heads of State  convinced of the importance and urgency of strengthening regional and sub-regional cooperation  have solemnly declared as a priority common objective individual and collective self-reliance at the level of the continent. 124.	The firm commitment of Burundi to that objective is illustrated by  among other things  our active participation in the Economic Community of the Great Lakes Countries  which brings together Rwanda  Zaire and Burundi  and in the activities of the Organization for the management and development of the Kagera river basin  which joins the United Republic of Tanzania  Rwanda  Uganda and Burundi.125.	As we have just seen  the work facing the Organization is enormous. The success of our undertaking  we believe  depends on the political will of States to make effective the resolutions already adopted  on the one hand  on questions of decolonization and security  such as those concerning in particular Africa  the Middle East  Cyprus and Southeast Asia  and on the other hand  on the new international economic order.126.	We also believe that the mission of the United Nations will be successful only if the people we represent are fully informed and mobilized to struggle  with all mankind  against the great scourges of our time  namely  famine  disease  ignorance and poverty.127.	The political and economic challenges which face us are immense. Burundi believes that the community of States must face those challenges and work together in order to find appropriate solutions to them. Burundi firmly believes  too  that the United Nations is the meeting place for performance of that common duty to which we are committed by virtue of having signed the Charter."
"9",481,"BEL",35,1980,"ï»¿I should like first of all  Sir  to congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. I am all the more pleased to do this because I am convinced that you will do everything to ensure that our work shall be as effective and well organized as possible and that the General Assembly will scrupulously fulfil its eminent role under the Charter of the United Nations.113.	Before going any further  I should like also to thank the President of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly  Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim  on whose enlightened wisdom we so often relied during the past year in diverse and complex situations. We would do well to recall  once more  the remarkable way in which he presided over the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  a task which he successfully fulfilled with such wisdom and prudence.114.	I am pleased to have the opportunity to welcome the presence among us of the delegation of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines as the one hundred and fifty-fourth Member of our Organization. That presence confirms once more the universality of the United Nations.115.	I should like also to express the great interest with which I have taken note of the report of the Secretary General on the work of the Organization  and to express my great appreciation to the Secretary General for his remarkable synthesis of the many problems with which the United Nations has had to concern itself  for the suggestions he put forward and for his analysisâdiscreet  perhaps  but pertinent none the lessâof the changes in international relations and  thus  in the goals of our Organization. I should like to assure the Secretary General that Belgium will respond positively to the appeal he made when stating that it is up to the United Nations ""to tilt the balance in the right direction"" in order to respond to the profound disarray and confusion which  unfortunately  characterize the times in which we live.116.	It has become a tradition in our Assembly for the nine countries of the European Community to express themselves with one voice in the general debate through the delegation which holds our presidency. It goes without saying that Belgium shares all the ideas and views expressed by our colleague. Mr. Gaston Thorn  Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. The great problems of the day are mentioned in his statement. I shall not return to them  but wish to devote my first statement as Minister for Foreign Affairs of Belgium before a United Nations General Assembly to certain basic considerations which underlie my country's foreign policy.117.	First of all  I wish to reaffirm that the search for a common stance among the countries of the European Community in the international dialogue remains one of the most important concerns of the Belgian Government. We feel  indeed  that the political cooperation which has been established among our States  and which is frequently expressed in the United Nations  is an original and precious contribution by us to the international community. The very fact that we coordinate our positions and conciliate our views undoubtedly gives more weight to the collective voice of the nine countries  but also gives it more balance. In this way we contribute to the spirit of tolerance which should characterize our work. More and more  the life of our Organization is characterized by dialogue between groups. The European Community  which groups together nine today and will group ten tomorrow and soon  we firmly hope  twelve democratic States of Western Europe  was among the first to recognize this state of affairs and to make an effort to adapt its actions to it. We are pleased to note that  more and more  our common action is not only accepted and recognized  but greeted with interest and satisfaction. Hence we shall continue along those lines.118.	A second consideration which inevitably affects the representative of a country like Belgium concerns the sad fate of some of the smallest States of the international community  which too often become the victims of the struggle among the Powers. For centuries Belgium has been known as the battleground of Europe. Many peaceful villages and places in my country  from Waterloo to Yser and Bastogne  are known worldwide as having been the sites of confrontations between foreign armies. We could certainly have done without this reputation founded on suffering and ruins. For 35 years  and thanks to the alliance to which it belongs and remains constantly faithful  my country has known peace and can contribute to detente. But I note that the hotbeds of tension and bloody crises which arise all over the world and with which our Organization has to deal most often strike the small States. It is as if the balance of terror and the immense developments in the field of weapons protect the great peoples but crush the small ones  precisely those which the international community should most energetically protect. What is happening in Lebanon  Kampuchea and Afghanistan should be a reason for shame and indignation for each one of us. We are witnessing the systematic and prolonged violation of the territorial integrity  independence and right to life of populations which have had the misfortune of falling within the sphere of influence of mighty neighbours or of serving as battlefields for their struggles.119.	Ever since the beginning of this century  the international community has tried to structure itself so as to establish a rule of law which would not be the law of the jungle. This is the raison d'etre of the United Nations  and it is why our Organization must protest with unceasing indignation against the crushing of small States and the implicit or explicit threats which hang over the sovereignty of so many States. It is also why we must not assail the universality of our Organization by excluding any country whatsoever from our work.120.	Finally  I should like to recall that behind the abstract words which make up the daily vocabulary of our debates lies a human reality. The efforts made by this Organization have a finality which surpasses the governmental or State dimension. While Governments are the instruments of bilateral or multilateral diplomacy  men and women are its subjects. A diplomat is not an actor in an esoteric game; he is the servant of the cause of mankind.121.	The disappointing results of international cooperation for development and the continued existence of many areas of instability and insecurityâeven open conflictsâbring in their wake untold suffering  poverty and social inequality. Democracy is on the decline. Dictatorships succeed one another. Human rights are violated in all parts of the world. While millions of refugees wait  in terrible suffering  to be able to return to their homes  political obstacles sometimes prevent the Red Cross and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees from fully fulfilling their humanitarian mission. Our Organization cannot remain indifferent either to the causes of this massive displacement of peoples or to its consequences. Nor can it remain indifferent to the taking hostage for political ends of innocent men and women  whose lives are threatened as a means of pressure.122.	It is the duty of the international community to put an end to these acts  but its action will remain insufficient as long as all its members  without exception  do not fully resolve to eliminate the deep-rooted causes of this evil  which are both political and economic.123.	Man has a right to the development which can promote his prosperity. Development aid can no longer be considered a charitable or paternalistic act. Development engages the responsibility of the entire international community and is the direct result of the recognition of the right to development. This is not a new right but should be considered as the synthesis of other human rights  including civil and political rights. The ultimate bearer of these rights is the individual  and the exercise of these rights will enhance the development of the individual's personality. From now on we recognize that the promotion of respect for human rights must be an integral part of activities related to development and that its realization involves the participation of all  including women  young people and the handicapped.124.	This year at Copenhagen  the World Conference of the United Nations Decade for Women had as one of its themes the full participation of women in economic and social development. Belgium will take this fully into account in its efforts to promote complete equality between men and women on the national level.125.	""Full participation and equality"" are also the themes of the International Year of Disabled Persons  to be observed in 1981  which will provide our Organization with another opportunity to reaffirm the importance it attaches to the promotion of the value and dignity of human beings.126.	While many countries  beginning with developed countries  protect their weakest citizens against the risks of illness or unemployment through national systems of social security  it is inadmissible that the international community does not offer equivalent protection to the poorest countries. In the absence of determined common action in favour of the most impoverished countries  the Charter of the United Nations will not have been fully implemented  and the strong are likely to join the weak in chaos and misery.127.	In this context  we can only welcome the suggestions made by the Secretary General in his statement of 3 July last before the Economic and Social Council   in which he advocated special action in favour of the least developed countries which have been particularly affected by the economic crisis. We hope that this Assembly will take appropriate measures concerning this initiative.128.	Too many positive elements have emerged from the eleventh special session of the General Assembly which was recently concluded for us to speak of ""failure"". The establishment of a new International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decadeâwhich we will have to ratify formallyâis an extremely important achievement. On the subject of global negotiations  the work of these last weeks has enabled us to identify the difficulties and problems and also to clarify our positions. Progress has been made which will probably allow the present session to produce a unanimous will to start basic negotiations  without which international economic relations will remain chaotic. As I stated at the eleventh special session:""My country places great expectations in the outcome of these global negotiations. At the end of the negotiations  it would thus be ready to make a political commitment to apply the balanced results reached by consensus."" Belgium has done and will continue to do all that is possible to obtain that consensus.129.	In this context  I should like to recall briefly the proposal of my delegation concerning the conclusion of a pact for mutual growth which would link official development aid to the economic growth of the traditional and potential donor countries.130.	I repeat that Belgium earnestly hopes that solutions will be found to the world problems which confront us  because I am more and more convinced that the famous statement made by my predecessor Paul Henri Spaak before this very Assembly is as relevant as ever: ""It is not too late  but it is high time""  he said. It is high time because disorder reigns in too many areas; it is high time because the poorest become poorer; it is high time because the rich are also slowly involved in a spiral of impoverishment; it is high time because the chasms which separate us may no longer allow reasonable solutions; it is high time because misery and poverty all too often lead to actions fraught with risk; it is high time because the worsening of international relations could end willy-nilly in a global conflict.131.	The representatives of the 154 Member States represented here are all aware of the dramatic nature of this situation. They also know that they will have to work together in the struggle against the economic crisis and in favour of development. They must perforce succeed in this enterprise in the interests of world peace and security. It is obvious that such flagrant imbalances will sooner or later lead to violent explosions.132.	The arms race resulting from these imbalances is a permanent threat. We are appalled by the fact that $450 billion are now being spent on armaments in the world but only $20 billion on development aid. That is why the Brandt Commission has suggested in its recent report10 that machinery to strengthen the role of the United Nations should be established for the maintenance of peace. Such machinery should permit funds to be released for development through reductions in military expenditure.133.	Security and peace are not merely the absence of war; they also have an active character which could lead to balanced development and an equitable distribution of wealth. A lasting peace requires efficient economic cooperation. The absence of justice in international economic relations merely fosters dictatorial regimes which disregard the most elementary human rights. Those regimes disrupt peace  both by the international opposition to which they give rise and their economic and social injustices.134.	In his report on the work of the Organization  the Secretary General has deplored the fact that the numerous international conferences on disarmament had often done no more than agree on organizational and procedural matters  without really tackling questions of substance. They were unable to prevent a dangerous escalation in the arms race. Many countries of the third world  including the poorest  wear themselves out and are reduced to bankruptcy as they seek to take part in this senseless world competition. Matters may seem different for each individual State; but the only reasonable solution to a threat of over armament by a neighbour is a dialogue and a search for balance at the lowest possible level.135.	In Europe itself  continuing development of new weapon systems directed against our countries caused the Atlantic Alliance to take the decision last December to modernize its medium range nuclear weapons  in order to offer that dialogue and that search for balance at the lowest possible level. That offer of negotiations remains. Belgium attaches special importance to it and welcomes the prospect of preparatory talks on this subject being started on 13 October between the United States and the Soviet Union. In the same context  Belgium has always expressed its interest in the ratification of the SALT II agreement."" But there should be no doubt about the will of my country  together with its allies  to restore the essential balance. In our view  detente and defence are the two inseparable bases of our security.136.	Faithful to its long traditions in this field  Belgium remains strongly attached to all forms of international action in the field of arms limitation. Suffice it to recall the initiative taken here in 1978 by Belgium in favour of a study of all the regional aspects of disarmament. The purpose was to define a systematic regional approach for all disarmament problems and arms control. Belgium was pleased to read the report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Regional Disarmament over which it presided. That report was completed a month ago and submitted to the present session of the General Assembly for consideration. I hope that the debates which will take place will contribute to progress in the cause of disarmament.137.	May I also express on behalf of my Government  as was done in this very hall by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Sweden on behalf of his Government  great concern on the subject of the rumoured recent utilization of chemical weapons in two of the poorest countries in Asia. It is no longer enough for public opinion in the civilized world to condemn the utilization of chemical arms. All countries that have not yet acceded to the Geneva Protocol of 1925 must do so without further delay; that would allow all contracting parties to re-examine the desirability of maintaining the inter partes reservation for those who have registered it.138.	In conclusion  and to sum up  I have tried to stress the importance that Belgium attaches to an international community based on a certain number of fundamental legal principles  as set out in the Charter of our Organization.139.	The basic guideline of Belgium's foreign policy is certainly to do all it can to ensure that the international community of States  peoples and individuals shall be founded on those principles.140.	Just as one cannot imagine a democracy that it not based on the rule of law  so our Organization would be unthinkable were it not founded on a firm will to establish legal principles on an international level.141.	For countries like Belgium  which systematically refrain from using violence in international relations  the creation of a state of law at the international level is an indispensable element for the creation of a real community of nations."
"10",527,"BEN",35,1980,"ï»¿This being the first time that we have spoken from this rostrum  we wish to convey to this august Assembly the best wishes of the people of Benin and a message of peace from our leaders  the People's Revolutionary Party of Benin  and the President of the People's Republic of Benin  Comrade Mathieu Kerekou  and the Permanent Committee of the Revolutionary National Assembly and the National Executive Council.190.	I wish also to join in the warm congratulations addressed to you  Sir  on your unanimous election as President of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. This is a tribute by the international community to your distinguished qualities as a diplomat and to your competence. We are convinced that with those qualifications you will conduct our difficult and important deliberations with great skill and calm. Your election is also a tribute to the Federal Republic of Germany. In the fight being waged throughout the world  your country is playing a most outstanding role  thanks to its active presence and remarkable contribution to the universal undertaking of detente  of peace and friendly co-operation among the peoples of the world. We in Benin welcome our relations of co-operation and friendship with the Federal Republic of Germany  at both the bilateral level and within the framework of the European Economic Community.191.	We should also like to express to our brother Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim  that worthy son of Africa  the satisfaction  admiration and appreciation of our delegation for the remarkable manner in which he conducted the proceedings of the thirty-fourth session and for his courage at the sixth and seventh emergency special sessions and the eleventh special session of the General Assembly.192.	The delegation of Benin would like finally to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General for his outstanding qualities and constant efforts in the service of the noble ideals of the Charter. We pledge to him our constant support and assistance in the overwhelming tasks that he has assumed in the service of the international community.193.	Less than a year ago  in the face of the legitimate demands of the heroic people of Zimbabwe and as a result of their armed struggle  those who in the West had learned nothing from history tried in various waysâthrough blackmail  provocation and armed aggression against the frontline countriesâto make it appear that the ultimate victory of the fighting forces of the Patriotic Front was impossible. We are pleased to pay a tribute here to the representatives of free and sovereign Zimbabwe who now stand by our side. Our brothers of Zimbabwe have proved the historical invincibility of the legitimate fight for national liberation.194.	This is for all of us  but especially for those of us in Africa  a shining example of courage and conviction; it gives hope to our oppressed brothers in Namibia and South Africa. The people of Zimbabwe have preceded them on the path to freedom and justice. Imperialism will sooner or later learn the lessons of Zimbabwe's independence. They will perhaps prolong the untold suffering of our oppressed brothers in southern Africa  but the lessons to be learned from Zimbabwe's resistance will inspire further fights  result in more victories and lead to further solemn and historic celebrations in the General Assembly.195.	We should also like to bid welcome at the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly to the representatives of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. We extend to them our congratulations and the expression of our fraternal solidarity.196.	As so often in the past  the General Assembly at its thirty-fifth session is renewing its pledge  a vow it took more than a third of a century ago to rid the world of the scourges of war  injustice and hunger  and to build a world of peace  justice and prosperity for all; its vow to seek  thanks to the growing awareness of the peoples of the entire world and especially the oppressed and exploited peoples of Africa  Asia and Latin America  just solutions to the many problems that mankind is confronted with today.197.	Since its revolution of 26 October 1972  our country  the People's Republic of Benin  has fought on all fronts  inside and outside the country  to ensure that from what are often mere pious wishes and from our often unimplemented resolutions  a better world will emerge. Today again  through us  the revolutionary people of Benin intends to participate actively in these efforts to bring about a better world by making its modest contribution to our debate.198.	This thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly is being held at a time when the already disturbing international situation has become alarming and dangerous  essentially because of the global strategy adopted by the imperialist Powers as they try to defend their selfish interests in the world  the divisions they have created  the wars they have caused and the conflicts they have encouraged.199.	In our countries we witness powerlessly the redeployment of the armed forces of aggression  the forces of destabilization and the forces of colonial re-conquest of the imperialist Powers. Former gunboat policies seem to have made a comeback  as has the quest for spheres of influence. But in Africa and the Middle East  in Asia and in Latin America  one hears an outcry  the outcry of the oppressed peoples of the world as they fight their oppressors  the outcry of the exploited against the exploiters  the outcry of those who have been starved. That  of course  disturbs the easy consciences of those who persist in going against the tide of history. It upsets them. And that is what fortifies our optimism and confirms our hopes and our unshakable conviction that the peoples of the world fighting for a just cause will triumph in the end.200.	How can we fail to share the feelings of those who would like to see Namibia move towards genuine independence in keeping with a process similar to that followed by the valiant people of Zimbabwe? Although it is clear that that process is the only one that will point South Africa towards the least shameful way out of the hornets' nest of Namibia  South Africa will  we know  continue to defy the international community because its political short-sightedness is as great as its arrogance; and we know that  regardless of the turn of events in that area  South Africa's protectors  the Western Powers  will continue to plunder the resources of the country and will not fail to come to the assistance of South Africa by refusing to carry out the resolutions of the United Nations aimed al resolving the question of Namibia once and for all.201.	No one is unaware that the implacable logic of trade  the quest for profits and good business  together with the need for strategic control of certain maritime Powers  are all reasons for the duplicity of the West and explain its diplomatic shenanigans.202.	If one considers the nature  the origin and the size of me companies taking part in the mining of uranium in Rossing in violation of Decree Number 1 for the Protection of the National Resources of Namibia  enacted by the United Nations Council for Namibia on 27 September 1974  then certain positions suddenly become clear and the procrastination that has been observed can be explained in mercantile and strategic terms.203.	That has left SWAPO and its fighters only one way out: armed struggle. That is the only way that will bring the Pretoria regime to heel  the only way that will force it to capitulate  as indeed  it forced its toadies in Salisbury to capitulate.204.	At this decisive and ultimate phase in the struggle before the fins' outcome  we are convinced that our Organization has a primary role to play. It has no alternative but to stick to the commitments it has entered into vis-Ã -vis the Namibian people. As was affirmed at the conclusion of the historic International Conference in Solidarity with the Struggle of the People of Namibia  held in Paris in September last  it must continue to denounce the fraudulent constitutional or political manoeuvres by which South Africa tries to perpetuate its oppressive colonial system and to exploit the people and resources of Namibia. It must continue its refusal to recognize any political or administrative entity set up in Windhoek that does not result from free elections under the supervision and control of the United Nations. It must protect the territorial integrity of the country as an indivisible State  including the entire Walvis Bay area.205.	The People's Republic of Angola and the front-line countries are experiencing the repeated criminal assaults of the aggressors and mercenaries in Pretoria  and our delegation expresses its complete fraternal solidarity with them. No amount of bombing  no amount of suffering blindly inflicted on innocent populations  no amount of material destruction will defeat our collective resolution in Africa and our inflexible determination to support the legitimate fight for the national liberation of the Namibian people under their sole legitimate representative  SWAPO.206.	The victory in Zimbabwe is an inspiration to millions of human beings in South Africa  where elementary rights and dignity are being denied.207.	In Sharpeville in 1960  in Soweto in 1976  children were killed by racist and Fascist bullets. Men were tortured and murdered. But they did not die in vain. Sharpeville and Soweto have become for everyone  for all those who cherish peace and justice  symbols to which the uprisings of recent months in various cities of South Africa have given a hitherto unequalled significance. But the supporters of the ignoble system of apartheid must sooner or later understand that the outcry of the demonstrators and strikers in Durban  the Cape and Johannesburg are sounding the death of that regime  which has beer  repudiated. They must agree that reforms made merely for show will never blunt the determination or lull the vigilance of those who have been exploited and oppressed. Legitimate aspirations to a democratic and just society can never be thwarted.208.	What is striking today is that the womb that gave birth to the repulsive monster of fascism is still fertile. The present insane and tragic resurgence of fascism haunts the consciences of all in the world who cherish freedom and justice from Bologna to Munich and  last week  Paris. But the leaders of apartheid are heirs and undeniable accomplices of Nazi ideology. This elementary lesson in history should encourage us to be ever vigilant  ever more determined in the struggle against South African apartheid. We must expose the true face of that inhuman  unjust system  which serves to oppress our brothers in South Africa  and we must do so without hypocrisy. After having supplied it with a reactor  after having organized with South Africa a ""nuclear axis"" that is productive and profitable  some in Europe are now preparing secretly to sell it the radioactive fuel it needs. Is that generally known?209.	Our Organization  which has called apartheids crime against mankind and which says that apartheid is a threat to international peace and security  must play its role in promoting the emancipation of the peoples of the world. Regrettably  it is a fact that the resolutions adopted at each and every session have  become of their futility  only provided South Africa with opportunities to flout the Organization. Its constant defiance of the Organization would not be so open or so brutal if the racists and Fascists in Pretoria did not enjoy the protection of certain foreign Powers.210.	We have repeatedly  here and elsewhere  denounced and condemned their attitude  and there is no reason to hope today that they will abide by the obligations that flow from the application of the noble ideals of the Charter. In other words  all the measures that we shall continue to advocate against the racist Pretoria regime will produce no concrete effects unless more decisive enforcement action is taken against these imperialist Powers  and against their multinational corporations  whose economic activities contribute to shoring up that hatred regime.211.	The Security Council's refusal to adopt economic sanctions against Pretoria and all the other measures envisaged in Chapter VII of the Charterâthe only measures that can make Pretoria listen to reasonâshould prompt the international community to give all possible assistance to all the patriotic forces  particularly ANC  the national liberation movement which  like the Patriotic Front and SWAPO  has been waging its struggle for liberation in the field.212.	But it must be added that if the Pretoria regime is succeeding in perfecting its weapons  in building up its arsenals  it is because it can skilfully get round the binding embargo on the supply of weapons which has been officially declared. It is doing so with the thinly disguised complicity of Western companies; this is confirmed in the report of 19 September 1980 or the Security Council Committee established by resolution 421 (1977).""213.	The conclusions are clear; the recommendations are obvious and particularly simple for those who know that the recommendations concern them. Indeed  they have a threefold capability: political  economic and military; they have all the means of coercion to ensure that our resolutions are no longer treated with contempt and openly trampled under foot.214.	Although the problems of southern Africa are in the forefront of the concerns of our continent  there are other problems that the imperialists have created through the application of their policy of exploitation  domination and division. Certain foreign Powers are indeed directly responsible for the tragedy now unfolding in Chad. The Lagos agreement of August 1979 and the decision taken by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU  at its seventeenth session  held in July  in Freetown  demonstrateâif it were still necessary to do soâthat Africa has not only the will to solve its own problems itself  but also the wisdom and maturity necessary to do so. By providing for the deployment of a neutral African force as the prelude to a comprehensive and final settlement of this fratricidal conflictâorchestrated by remote controlâAfrica wished to avoid any internationalization of the problem  under the cover of which foreign interference  in its most criminal and subversive form  could continue.215.	Wisdom  maturity and a sense of fairness were also at the basis of the decisions taken at Freetown in regard to Western Sahara  By reaffirming the rights of the Sahraoui people to self-determination and independence  the OAU has remained faithful to the letter and spirit of the many clear and unequivocal resolutions on the subject adopted both by the United Nations and by the non-aligned movement 216.	POLISARIO is constantly winning military victories on the battlefield and  in addition  because of the recognition of the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic by the majority of African States  it has now won a particularly significant diplomatic victory. That is why the position of the People's Republic of Benin will remain unchanged so long as the present factors that explain that consistent position do not themselves change.217.	The General Assembly  which for many sessions now has adopted a clear-cut stand on this question  will have no choice but to invite Morocco to comply with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and the OAU and withdraw its troops forthwith from the territories it is illegally occupying  and thereby make possible the rapid application of the September 1980 decisions of the OAU Ad Hoc Committee on Western Sahara.218.	This is the appropriate place for our delegation to express its gratification at the decision of the General Committee of the General Assembly to inscribe on the agenda of the thirty-fifth session the question of the Comorian island of Mayotte. We express the hope that the Assembly will finally take a just and equitable decision with a view to the decolonization of that island.219.	It may have been thought in certain quartersâin defiance of all probabilitiesâthat the Camp David agreements had some chance of promoting peace and stability in the Middle East. But it must be agreed today that those agreements  which were a real fool's bargain and nothing but an empty treasure chest  have solved nothing with regard to the substance of the problem of the essential claims of the Palestinian people.220.	The Camp David agreements seem actually to have contributed to an exacerbation of the situation and to have enabled the Israeli authorities to assert their territorial claims with increased arrogance and determination. Thus  among the acts so characteristic of the Zionist Government's policy of fait accompli  there was the recent decision by the Knesset proclaiming the Holy City of Jerusalem as the indivisible and eternal capital of Israel; that decision inevitably aroused the greatest possible indignation  even among those who have endorsed  or approved by their silence  the Zionist authorities' policy of aggression.221.	In those circumstances the People's Republic of Benin  faithful to its principles in questions of relations among peoples and Statesâprinciples that are  incidentally  none other than those proclaimed by the United Nationsâ cannot give its blessing to agreements from which the parties primarily concerned have been excluded  that is  the Palestinian people and their sole and authentic representative  the PLO. Today  when it is unanimously conceded that no lasting solution can be found in the Middle East without a just and equitable settlement of the Palestinian question  refusing to negotiate with the PLO means refusing peace.222.	Furthermore  demagogically to make use of blackmail based on anti-Semitism in order to feed certain guilt complexes  cannot divert us from the fight against the Zionist impostor; it cannot possibly give us a guilty conscience. For nothing authorizes the Zionists to exact from the Palestinians the debt of blood  the debt of collective massacre and planned genocide  for which the Palestinians were not responsible and in which they played no part.223.	Speaking from this rostrum on behalf of a country and a people which  no less than the Jews of the Diaspora  underwent racism and endured the most brutal colonial oppression  we feel fully and legitimately entitled to condemn the Zionist aggression and endeavours in the Middle East. Therefore  Benin  which broke off diplomatic relations with the Zionist entity  cannot but fully support Security Council resolution 478 (1980) of 20 August 1980 calling on States that had established diplomatic missions in Jerusalem to withdraw them from the Holy City 224.	Turning now to Asia  which saw the birth and triumph of the great emancipating revolutions  we note that certain great sources of tension are still there  sources of tension that are maintained  fuelled and exacerbated by international imperialism and its accomplices. In Kampuchea  which has suffered for more than 30 years from intermittent warfare and colonialist and imperialist aggression  we firmly hope that peace will finally be restored  in the best interest of the Kampuchean people and in the interest of the other peoples of the region. That is why the People's Revolutionary Council of Kampucheaâfor which we should like once again to express our supportâmust consolidate national reconciliation and continue to work for peace.225.	Still in regard to Asia  we believe that the Iranian and Afghan revolutions  which have seriously shaken the positions of imperialism and feudalism  have opened up a process that will strengthen the unity and solidarity of the struggle of the peoples of the region.226.	The heroic struggle of the people of Korea  a people that for more than 30 years now has lived in the hope of reunifying its divided country  will not be in vain either. But this legitimate aspiration  although shared on both sides of the 38th parallel  has in the southern part of the country been the subject of the most barbarous repression by the various dictatorial regimes which  from Park Chung Hee to the present Government  have had no other policy but to follow the bidding of international imperialism. It is high time for a final settlement of the Korean problem; it is high time for the United States to understand finally that the safeguarding of peace in that region requires them to reconcile themselves to the withdrawal of their troops and the replacement of the Armistice Agreement by a peace agreement.227.	In spite of the conspiracy of silence by which some people would like to stifle and suppress it  the struggle of the Frente Revolucionaria de Timor Leste Independente [FRETILIN] in East Timor is being stepped up. We hail this resistance and struggle and consider that East Timor must be freed and its people must fully enjoy its right to self- determination.228.	More than a year ago  the new Nicaragua  born of the heroism of the Sandinist fighters  enlarged and strengthened the domain of liberty and revolution in Latin America. The dream of freedom and patriotic grandeur of Bolivar and Jose Marti  which the invincible Cuban revolution made an historical fact more than 20 years ago  has once again become possible. But beside those free territories in Latin America Fascist violence continues to torture  massacre and exploit in El Salvador  Chile  Bolivia and elsewhere  pursuing the mad dream of stifling the impetuous struggle of peoples for freedom  justice and dignity. The People's Republic of Benin brings its support and the pledge of its militant and fraternal solidarity to all the heroic fighters of Latin America.229.	In Cuba  the United States  on the strength of an unfair agreement  refuses to evacuate the Guantanamo base. Guantanamo must be returned to the Cuban Government and military provocations against the Cuban revolution and in the Caribbean must cease.230.	Puerto Rico is still one of the Latin American countries that has never exercised its rights to self-determination and independence. Using juridical sophistry  the United States has always opposed the inclusion of this item on the agenda of the General Assembly. However  those subterfuges have not prevented the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples from adopting various resolutions on Puerto Rico and the Organization must call on the American Government to comply with them.231.	The People's Republic of Benin gives its firm support to all actions initiated with the aim of making the Indian Ocean effectively a sea of peace. In that connection we support the concrete proposals put forward by the President of the Democratic Republic of Madagascar. We must  however  express our concern at the establishment in the Indian Ocean by the imperialist Powers of a whole complex of military bases and telecommunications  both mobile and fixed  the obvious goal of which is to pose serious threats to coastal countries that have gained their sovereignty and to peoples that are struggling for their liberation; to control militarily all the lines of communication; and to be able to use means of military pressure to support their political or economic manoeuvres with a view to perpetuating the plundering of the raw materials of the countries of the area. Thus the presence of imperialist military bases in the Mozambique channel  on Diego Garcia  on Reunion and elsewhere  the militarization and the increased nuclearisation of the Indian Ocean constitute a challenge to the decisions of the international community and a constant threat to the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of the countries of the area.232.	The situation in the Indian Ocean  where we see the growth of a formidable armada of international imperialism  makes it easier to perceive the profits and the calculations which the distressing Iraq-Iran conflict enables imperialism to make. For the flames of war between Iraq and Iran  the deaths and the immense sacrifices imposed upon those two fraternal peoples will in no way benefit the struggle of the Palestinian people or that of other peoples of the world against imperialist domination and intervention. For this suffice it to observe the cynicism of certain plans for intervention or suspect offers of mediation  whose sole goal and motivation is the logic of the stock market and the statistics of the energy needs of the West.233.	The People's Republic of Benin therefore issues an appeal for peace and for the cessation of this fratricidal war and for the blind and murderous language of arms to give way to the language of revolutionary reason and the solidarity of struggle. Within the great family of the non-aligned  where both occupy such a distinguished place  Iraq and Iran  two great countries both friendly to Benin could settle their dispute with the fraternal assistance of the other members and the chairman of our great movement  on the basis of its fundamental principles.234.	The evils and the problems that the peoples of the third world are confronting are not only political in nature. Economic problems help to hand them an extra measure of acuteness. We have therefore always desired true development that could restore dignity to these peoples and put an end to their domination by imperialism. The appeal that the third world continues to make to the rich nations for the establishment of a more just and more equitable economic order still has not been heeded in any real way.235.	It is in order to attempt once again to seek the most appropriate ways and means of promoting this new order that we have just held in this very place a special session of the General Assembly on global economic negotiations. The delegation of the People's Republic of Benin  which has taken an active part in this work  has already made known the views of its Government on this important question. If we are to return to it  it will be to issue a few useful historical reminders.236.	Indeed  during the course of the work of the sixth special session of the General Assembly  held in 1974  on economic problems  two resolutions were adopted on the basis of the claims of the developing countries  calling upon the international community  and particularly the industrialized countries and international institutions  to work to regularize trade in primary commodities through an integrated programme of which the Common Fund for the financing of buffer stocks would be the pivot; to open up world markets for the manufactured products of developing countries; to increase the volume of transferred resources from North to South; and to reform procedures providing for access to technology.237.	It is distressing to have to note that six years after the adoption of those texts and in spite of the many negotiations organized between the North and the South under the auspices of the United Nations  there has been no appreciable improvement in the situation.238.	Even worse  the major international conferences on the restructuring of relations between industrialized and developing countries have all failed. In particular the fifth session of UNCTAD in Manila from May-June 1979 and the Third General Conference of UNIDO in New Delhi from January-February 1980  served only to make even worse the scandalously unequal relations prevailing between producers of raw materials and industrialized countries. The reasons for that state of affairs are well known and we have only too often revealed them and condemned them.239.	In spite of those condemnations and appeal for solidarity  the external debt of the underdeveloped countries is constantly growing  as indeed is the already wide gap between developing and industrialized countries.240.	At their most recent meetings and in their preparatory documents  the World Bank and IMF have  through eloquent and even overwhelming statistics  made clear the tragic nature of that situation  of what is known as ""absolute poverty"" and of the threats of ""negative growth"" in the economy of many of our countries. The situation is only the more acute  and it is even more urgent to take concrete measures to spare mankind new crises and serious social explosions. The wager of peace and development will only be won in this wayâ-if we sincerely want justice and equality among nations  as well as the independence of the countries of the third world  to be effectively won and secured.241.	The need to lay the basis and establish the principles for a new economic order in international life  in our view  is in keeping with the concerns of all of us about the future of the world  in the face of the real dangers presented by the vast means of destruction and of warfare  conventional and nuclear. Disarmament  accompanied by global detente  therefore is a universal issue which all States  whatever their size and whatever the size of their arsenals  must resolve to consider  in response to the mere instinct for survival and so that future generations will not have to mourn another Hiroshima and another Nagasaki  even more cruel and devastating. Furthermore  elementary arithmetic shows us how many social works  how many economic assistance projects  and how many cultural enterprises could be undertaken with the enormous financial means and technology now devoted to the manufacture and increased stockpiling of armaments of all kinds  if the folly of the arms race were ended and definitely banished from the history of society and man.242.	Our country  the People's Republic of Benin  has  since 26 October 1972  decisively resumed the long history of its people's dignified struggle. Having embarked upon the revolutionary course of the anti-imperialist national liberation struggle  a few months ago it passed a new basic law and set up new institutions  thus entering the stage of constitutional revolutionary legitimacy  under the enlightened leadership of its vanguard Party  the People's Revolutionary Party of Benin. As a result of its courageous and bold policies and its determination for liberation  it has given rise to hatred  plots and subversion on the part of those former masters and new colonialists that have been unable to tolerate the sight of certain of their loyal chief agents being expelled from the centres of State power and from economic decision-making posts. That explains the military aggression committed by mercenaries against the People's Republic of Benin on Sunday 16 January 1977. Their defeat is well known and their paymasters have been denounced and clearly exposed. We cannot remain silent about their crimes and their misdeeds  because of their shameful failure must give birth to increased vigilance against the historical phenomenon of the use of imperialist and neo-colonial mercenaries. Thus  pursuant to Security Council resolution 419 (1977) relating to the aggression against the People's Republic of Benin  we have just submitted new proof  published recently by a French historical review. It is our most sincere wish that all States should do likewise whenever information or new material proof of the reality of aggression and the crimes of mercenaries comes into their possession. Such action is in keeping with the recommendations of the Security Council. Our country  a distressed witness and victim of those criminal endeavours at colonial reconquest  through its live testimony and its victorious resistance to aggression  wishes to make its modest contribution to the eradication of a scourge which has ceaselessly threatened our independence and jeopardized peace in the world.243.	Our reference to the affair of armed imperialist aggression of 16 January 1977 remains legitimate; it is entirely in keeping with the principles and requirements of the Charter  which binds us and justifies our common endeavours for peace  friendship and co-operation. Our great comrade in arms  President Mathieu Kerekou stated in his appeal to all the fighting peoples in the world  at the International Conference on Mercenaries  held at Cotonou in January 1978  the following:""International imperialism  after having enriched itself through black slavery  the slave trade in blacks  the wars of plunder and the colonial wars  is surviving and feeding itself today thanks to its cannon and other sophisticated military equipment  with the shameful design of restoring or installing in the countries of the third world colonialism  neo-colonialism  racism  fascism and the plundering of our immense natural resources. That is why we must view mercenaries not only as an international scourge which curbs and impedes the liberation of people still under foreign domination  but also and above all as a real threat to the independence and sovereignty of our young States  In a word  mercenaries constitute a veritable threat to the security of States  to democracy and peace in the world.""244.	If detente is indivisible  the freedom of peoples and justice among nations also cannot be divided or confined to certain continents or certain parts of the world.245.	Therefore let us see to it that our work and our resolutions arouse hope and contribute to the solution of the major issues of our time; because it is only resolute  decisive and collective action for peace and development that really deserves our energies and our efforts and indeed our sacrifices.246.	Ready for the revolution.247.	The struggle continues."
"11",572,"BFA",35,1980,"ï»¿At a time when the United Nations is going through a painful crisis of growth  when relations between States are becoming more and more complex and presenting virtually insoluble problems  to accept the direction of the affairs of this thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly is surely evidence of courage and unselfishness.2.	That is why  at the outset  I should like on behalf of my country and of my delegation to congratulate Mr. von Wechmar most warmly on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly. I say his acceptance is evidence of courage  and his election is a sign of confidence in and an honour paid not only to him personally but also to his country  the Federal Republic of Germany  with which the Upper Volta entertains excellent relations. We are quite sure in advance that his personal qualities  his competence and his dynamism will greatly contribute to the success of this session  in which there is obviously great interest  judging by the quality of the representation and the level of the debates. His predecessor  Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim  of whom Africa is proud  also deserves our respect. What has been accomplished under his enlightened guidance has enabled our Organization to make notable progress this year in the quest for peace and security.3.	To the Secretary General I reaffirm the encouragement of my Government in his tireless performance of his noble task. During the months of crisis we have just experienced  we have been able to gauge his determination to safeguard the ideal of peace and justice which is the very foundation of our Organization.4.	It now remains for me to discharge another agreeable duty: that of congratulating the new State of Zimbabwe  solemnly admitted to our Organization on 25 August last. Symbol of a bruised Africa  which  in light as in darkness  fights tirelessly for its independence and dignityâthat is Zimbabwe  free at last. May its accession to international sovereignty prove a fruitful contribution to our collective effort in solidarity to serve the cause of peace. May its example inspire the valiant peoples of Namibia and South Africa which  day and night  are fighting grimly to preserve their dignity as free men. Because  to quote a celebrated African  who is no longer with us  ""Freedom is the ideal for which  in all times and throughout the centuries  men have fought and died"". The people of the Upper Volta therefore salute multiracial Zimbabwe  where white and black  fraternally united  are now assuming their historical responsibilities.5.	I extend my words of welcome also to Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.6.	Those two new States have joined the comity of free nations at a time when the peace and security of the world are greatly threatened  human rights trampled underfoot and the health of the world economy is at its most precarious.7.	We are at a crossroads  at a year which is a turning point  and of which it will be said that it was one of the most critical in the history of international relations  not because it calls to mind the imminence of the end of the century  but because it is of great significance from the point of time  politics and economics.8.	First  it coincides in time with the thirty-fifth anniversary of the foundation of our Organization. Thirty-five years make it an adult; mature enough to indulge in introspection  to measure the road that has been traversed and to apply itself to new causes.9.	Then  in the field of politics  it is a prelude to a renewal of hegemonistic antagonisms  a sign of the renewal of the cold war.10.	Finally  on the economic level  1980 marks the beginning of the Third United Nations Development Decade.11.	Does that mean that the United Nations has performed its role effectively? The facts are more complex. Indeed  since its establishment in 1945  this supranational Organization  against all the odds and despite the difficulties and vicissitudes of our times  has taken initiatives  proposed solutions and even performed exploits which have led to notable progress in international life. Thus  in transnational political relations the United Nations has been  and remains the living and privileged witness of the greatest events of contemporary history. Similarly  in the economic sphere it has played a leading part  especially since the conclusions of the Jackson report showed the capacity of the United Nations system to promote international development. In fact  thanks to its competent staff and its specialized agencies  the United Nations has devised and carried out a vast programme of assistance to the developing countries  thereby proving its versatile  many faceted nature.12.	But although those efforts are undeniable  they could not be adapted to the rhythm of our time  which is set by ballistic missiles and voyages in outer space. That is shown by the successive crises which have severely affected international life in recent years. The consequence of this chaotic development is that the United Nations appears increasingly to be a fossilized system  the resolutions and recommendations of which have no practical effect. Moreover  the flagrant and repeated violation of the most elementary principles of international law leads to irrational and uncontrolled reactions  which are dangerous for the whole international community.13.	To say that our world is in crisis is not proof of any great originality. But there really is a crisis  a crisis which is essentially political and economic at first sight  but is also ideological and moral  as a moment's thought would quickly convince anybody.14.	Wherever we look we see that the questioning is general  through the internal convulsions of all societies  all continents  through the more or less violent and bloody conflicts which pit a large number of countries against each other  through the feeling of powerlessness which threatens our Organization. Must a situation so at odds with the hopes that clearly animated the drafters of the San Francisco Charter be seen as a proof of failure  or rather as the obligatory and not even contradictory path towards the mission assigned to the United Nations? Opinions differ on this point. I think we have better things to do than to take part in a theoretical and altogether sterile debate. Rather  we should patiently seek issues on which the world may be able to achieve the minimum consensus indispensable for building together our common human destiny.15.	Throughout history it has been the nature of man and of the societies he has organized to give rein to the desire for power. Whether in individual competition or in the race for leadership among nations  that constant is found at all levels  with formidable consequences  which are reflected in perennial wars  the exploitation of the weakest  greed and pillage. Generous doctrines and ideologies have been born aiming at radically reversing this course of events  but no conclusive results have been produced in practice. Those that professed liberalism and fundamental human rights based on freedom have equally not been able to resist the temptation of abusing and denying their own principles. And that is a pity.16.	During this jousting match  which technological development only exacerbated  the third world countries have become aware of their dependence on an already established order which only demands clients. Indeed  what kind of independence is it if one has no control over the prices of one's own products  if the monetary base standard is but a trap and if access to education and technology is first and foremost governed by the selfish interests of the multinational corporations. Even the richest societies do not nowadays escape the widespread anxiety about the future. Everyone feels that the apocalypse can come at any moment  for it is within the logic of over armament to encourage a constant forward movement and the taking of risks that are at times less calculated than we think. Hence we are at all times at the mercy of a mistake  if not a misjudgement of the facts.17.	This crumbling of the international order  promoted by a certain complicity  is sufficient to explain the arrogance of South Africa in persisting in its ignominious policy of apartheid. In hardening its position  the Pretoria regime each day exacerbates tension in the region  and the worst is to be feared. We reiterate our appeal to all countries friendly to Pretoria to bring South Africa to heed reason by making it understand that the independence of Namibia  under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO]  is unavoidable and the liberation of the South African people an irreversible process.18.	The ambiguities of the international political order doubtless equally explain the futility of efforts to break the deadlock in certain international conflicts.19.	That is the case  for example  with regard to Western Sahara and Chad. If the negotiations had been based exclusively on the relevant decisions of the African heads of State  they would by now have led to significant progress. Unfortunately  the inconsistency of certain attitudes only prolongs these fratricidal wars.20.	That also goes for the conflicts raging in Southeast Asia  where the permanent presence of foreign forces each day breeds hatred and vengeance among peoples united by a common civilization and aspiring only to live together in peace and harmony. With reference to the explosive situation prevailing in Cambodia  the Upper Volta  my country  which is fundamentally devoted to the values of democracy and freedom and places its trust in the Charter of the United Nations  rejects any concept of international relations according to which the existence of a State might henceforth depend on the opinion its own neighbours hold of it.21.	With regard to the problems of the Middle East  we should recognize quite objectively that it has become a dangerous powder keg for the international community as a whole  especially since the recent decision of the Israeli Government to make Jerusalem its ""eternal capital"". In its official statement my Government took a position on this question. That position is based on the sacrosanct principles of the non- acquisition of territory by force and the settlement of disputes through negotiation. For us the fate of Jerusalem is not what the Knesset will decide. That is to say that the Upper Volta fully associates itself with Security Council resolution 478 (1980)  for only compliance with that resolution can lead to the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East.22.	With regard to Afghanistan  notwithstanding the unequivocal condemnation by the international community of the Soviet intervention  that nonaligned Moslem State remains the theatre of bloody operations aimed at breaking any national resistance. The Upper Volta  a free country which has freely chosen its leaders  has already made its position known on this question  the definitive solution of which depends on compliance with General Assembly resolution ES6/2 of 14 January 1980  requiring the withdrawal of foreign troops and respect for the policy of nonalignment of Afghanistan.23. Having regard to threats to world peace  one must finally recall the inconceivable slap in the face to one of the most imprescriptible principles of international relations which is respect for the most elementary diplomatic customs. The trials to which a State Member of the United Nations has been subjected in Iran  with all the vile humiliation they entail  must not make us forget the risks this poses for the world. That is why  while the United States is doubtless not blameless with regard to the policy it has pursued in Iran  it nevertheless remains no less true that any dispute arising therefrom could surely not justify the taking of hostages among diplomatic personnel. Without elaborating  I say that that is an unjustifiable act for the very reason that all States Members of the United Nations cannot but feel very uneasy at such a flagrant violation of international law. Thus far  almost all of us have remained silentâin other words we are ourselves all hostages. Beyond the purely humanitarian aspect of the matter  it is the principle of respect for religion and  in particular  Islam  which is being called in question. The Upper Volta  a country member of the Islamic Conference  formally rejects any right and any claim to cover such practices with the cloak of Islam. That is why I make it my duty to recall here the message sent on 20 November 1979 to Ayatollah Khomeini by President El Hadj Aboubakar Sangoule Lamizana for the release of the kidnapped diplomats. It will be recalled that  in that touching appeal  the head of State of the Upper Volta exhorted the leader of the Iranian Revolution to respect fully the rules of international law. He said:""We are following with profound concern the events now taking place in Teheran since they seem to reflect ill what we know and believe of Islam and the universally recognized and respected principles of international relations.""Without judging the substance of the dispute between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the United States of America  it seems obvious that it is in the interest of all that the American diplomatic personnel that have been taken hostage should be freed swiftly.""In the circumstances we very much regret that you have not taken into consideration the unanimous decision of the Security Council of our international Organization and that you have turned a deaf ear to the urgent appeal that has been made to you.""We appeal to your faith as a servant of Allah to spare us a severe judgement by history of the true practices of Islam.""24. The present international climate  which is particularly tense and which characterizes the end of this century  may become the cause of our own collapse unless we prevent it from doing so  because  indeed  the obstinate refusal of the great Powers to disarm and the establishment of the most sophisticated war arsenals are disquieting harbingers of doom  unless in an effort of will the international community can transcend its national egoisms.25.	At the end of the Disarmament Decade  which was proclaimed in 1969 and which has certainly enjoyed some success  the Upper Volta wishes from this rostrum solemnly to appeal to the conscience of each nation so that violence in all its forms may be banished from our world for ever. We are prepared to make our modest contribution to such a collective effort  provided that the States most directly concernedâthat is  the great Powersâagree to give of their good will. The tenth special session of the General Assembly  devoted to disarmament  put special emphasis on this basic demand  stipulating that the new Second Disarmament Decade should promote the achievement of general and complete disarmament under effective international control. That salutary enterprise would not only free humanity from the spectre of war but would also  and in particular  contribute to the solving of economic problems by providing for development funds that would otherwise be used for military expenditures.26.	In our efforts to scrutinize the signs of the times and to work for the happiness of mankind  economic problems should be especially the subject of our reflections  because the economic aspects  as well as political actions  are essential elements of the dialectics of peace and security. We cannot and should not in any way remain insensitive and inactive in the face of the fact that colossal sums are being swallowed up by the arms race and that the resources of this world are being wasted when a tiny part of the money thus spent would allow us to develop  to modernize our agriculture  to give work to coming generations and to overcome underdevelopment.27.	All those burning questions  which have not been solved during the two United Nations Development Decades  should be broadly debated during the global negotiations that are to take place in 1981.28.	In anticipation of that broad collective effort  and in order to face up to the short-term international economic situation  which is difficult and particularly testing for the African countries  the heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity [OAU]  following their second extraordinary session of the Assembly  the first such session devoted to economic matters  which was held in April 1980 at Lagos  resolutely decided to lay the foundations for endogenous self-sustaining development centred in the African continent itself. In doing so  while relying on more dynamic  loyal and sincere international assistance  Africa wants first and foremost to depend on its own strength.29.	In its collective commitment to the establishment of the new international economic order  the United Nations has a leading role to play. It has a duty to put an end to the flagrant inequity of outrageous discrimination against peoples. And how will it do that? In our humble opinion  that should be done by emphasizing  in particular throughout the Third United Nations Development Decade  greater appreciation of man and his environment and the reconsideration of priorities in international development.30.	Any development philosophy and the indispensable activities underpinning it must place man at the centre. Only concerted action for the integral development of man  and the development of mankind in solidarity  can guarantee a more stable and more just world order. His Holiness Pope John Paul II  with the high-mindedness that characterizes him and his extreme sensitivity concerning third world problems  most appropriately recalled that point last year from this very rostrum  when he stated that ""the reason for all political activity  whether national or international ... comes from man  is exercised by man and is for man"". Naturally  a greater appreciation of the social function of man also raises the problem of man's environment  man's milieu. World attention has been concentrated in recent years on drought and desertification  phenomena of an unprecedented magnitude that have emphasized the intimate relationship between man and his environment. The deterioration in his wellbeing and his social prospects invariably accompanies degradation of the ecosystem.31.	All efforts in the fight against desertification should be oriented towards man's wellbeing. That was the main conclusion of the United Nations Conference on Desertification  and that was the thrust of the important statement made by His Holiness Pope John Paul II when he visited Ouagadougou on 10 May. In that statement which touched the hearts of the populations of the Sahel  ""those men who are thirsty for love and fraternal charity  and also water  which is necessary for their lives""  the head of the Catholic Church said in substance:""I lift my voice in supplication because I cannot be silent when my brothers and sisters are threatened. I am the voice of those who have no voice  the voice of the innocent who have died because they did not have water and bread  the voices of fathers and mothers who saw their children die and could not understand why.""I appeal to you all.""Let us not wait for the return of drought  this terrible  devastating drought. Let us not wait for the sand to bring death again. Let us not allow the future of these people to be for ever threatened. The solidarity of yesterday has through its extension and its effectiveness shown that it is possible to listen to no voice but that of justice and charityânot that of individual and collective egoism.""32.	Since it suffered from this terrible calamity and since the effects continue to disturb its development efforts  my country  the Upper Volta  has at the last two sessions of the General Assembly suggested that a world programme be established in the field of reforestation. At the risk of repeating myself  then  I would say that the Upper Volta reiterates its proposal that there should be a United Nations decade for the tree. A green Sahel by the year 2000 should not be seen as a mirage but as a prerequisite for the survival of a whole civilization.33.	It is recognized that problems are interdependent and linked one to the other in a consistent and logical pattern  and that solutions to some have immediate effect on others. Thus  action against desertification is directly linked with problems of food  energy and  to a lesser extent  raw materials. These three fields are of great concern to my Government  as are commercial problems and monetary problems. I know that these questions have been fully discussed at the eleventh special session  devoted to economic issues  and that they will be debated again within the framework of the global negotiations which are to be launched next year. May I nevertheless briefly touch once more on food and energy issues in order to emphasize just how much of a priority they have for us in the Upper Volta.34.	During the Second United Nations Development Decade  the agriculture and food production of the developing countries increased only 1.3 per cent instead of the envisaged 4 per cent. That very fact is sufficient to convey clearly the acuteness of the food problem in the world. Aware of this worsening situation  we emphasized once more at the eleventh special session  devoted to economic problems   the urgency with which we should promote conditions for real world food security. The dimensions of the problem go far beyond national boundaries  and it is therefore essential to strengthen international cooperation in this field.35.	Food aid to countries that need it most  in particular those affected by drought  is an extremely laudable act of generosity testifying to the humanitarian qualities in international relations. However  as was emphasized by the heads of State and Government of the OAU at the second extraordinary session  devoted to economic matters and held at Lagos  only broad-based  permanent and long-term solutions can resolve the problems of food throughout the world  the first of these measures being to help developing countries to set up modern and rational methods of production which would enable them to achieve self-reliance in the area of food.36.	The energy crisis is of equal concern. Many say that it is the origin of the generalized economic crisis. We will not enter into the debate on that. But whatever the causes for this situation  one might wish to single out the fact that the developing countries  and in particular those that do not produce oil  are suffering much more from the shock and repercussions of the oil crisis. A country like the Upper Volta  which is among the least advanced countries  and has no outlet to the sea  had an oil bill in 1979  just last year  of $30 million  or a tenth of the overall value of its imports. We must  therefore  swiftly find a solution in order to break this deadlock. In the framework of the collective eff ort to establish the new economic order  we should  in an effort of solidarity and realism  redefine the terms of the dialogue between producers and consumers. Parallel with that  research should be pursued and intensified in the field of new and renewable energy sources. Wind energy  solar energy  nuclear energy are all possibilities which should be taken into account in the global strategy aimed at resolving the world energy crisis.37.	All these complicated problems of our world are disquieting signs at the dawn of the new International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade. The economic order that should result from this is awaited with impatience by millions of human beings who day by day are falling prey to growing feelings of frustration. The success of this new order depends  first and foremost  on two essential imperatives.38.	Politically speaking  what is required is a real will on the part of States to negotiate and fundamentally transform the fate of mankind  without any consideration other than the general interest. That means  in particular  abandoning the principle of ideological subordination  whatever it may be and from whatever source. It means also the renunciation of any attitude of complacency in either camp. We must negotiate forthrightly for the place which should be ours  namely  a place that should be one and the same for all men throughout the world.39.	Methodologically speaking  it is indispensable to achieve a democratization  and perhaps even a structural reform of the United Nations system  so that it may be better adapted to the needs of our era. We must manage to overturn the order of importance and give decision-making power to the largest possible number of States. We must recognize that the General Assembly has a particular role to play. A democratic machinery must be set up for taking decisions that will include small States in the solution of any problem that affects the future of the international community.40.	The new economic order therefore presupposes at the outset a restructuring of the international political order which  without detracting from the sovereignty of each State  would allow a bit more space for the United Nations  a United Nations which would no longer be controlled by a group of countries  but mandated by the international community as a whole.41.	The new economic order is also a moral value. It is the machinery whereby the developing countries would finally attain their rightful place  in which the determining parameters would no longer depend upon the geographical size of States  their military potential or the size of their population  but upon their own character  their respect for the human person  their specific contribution to the common work  their contribution to the search for peace.42.	We African countries are especially aware of the immense debt of gratitude we owe the United Nations and what an irreplaceable role it has played to the benefit of all third world countries. That is why our words should be understood solely as an incitement to go forward and as a modest contribution to the quest for new prospects.43.	And thus  although to some the event might appear to be of secondary importance in comparison to so many serious problems  it is a pleasure for us to bring up the initiative represented by the recent meeting of women from all continents which was held at Copenhagen last July. 44.	Certainly  the feeling that predominated among the so-called serious observers was that this second conference smacked a little of folklore.45.	But I should say that the important thing is perhaps not so much the concrete results or the sparsity of the resolutions and recommendations that came out of the conference; the important thing is the fact that those debates could take place and that dialogue could be opened  despite the gulfs which existed between traditions and ways of thinking. The important thing is that at last an essential part of mankind could take the floor  enter into discussions and present this new perspective  this new approach to the same basic problem.46.	On behalf of the Upper Volta  I would say that in the final analysis the event was neither minor nor of secondary importance; to imagine that what took place at Copenhagen was nothing but a pointless game would be to misinterpret the true dimension of our time.47.	It is essential that the women of the whole world bring their own sensitivity to bear  that they remind us that everything in life should not be conceived and resolved in terms of strength and power  but that what we have is quite simply life  and the little parcel of happiness to which every individual should have a right.48.	Better than we  the women of the whole world should be able to convince our childrenâthe youth of the whole worldâthat the future has not been irremediably warped and that it has orientations other than violence and apocalypse. And perhaps those women of the whole world could also from time to time remind usâthe ""powerful  all knowing statesmen""âthat it is not only war that counts  but also a certain satisfying quality of life.49.	It is time for dialogue and discussion; it is time for choices and  thus  for sacrifices. The Third United Nations Development Decade will be what we want it to be. It is for our civilization  going forward towards this great rendezvous with history  to move in the direction of greatness and not that of renunciation. A long these lines  I take pleasure in paying a tribute to the independent Willy Brandt Commission for the highly interesting document it has provided for our consideration.  Stressing the need for a change in our way of thinking as a condition for the establishment of a new international economic order  that report was especially instructive for the North South dialogue.50.	Humanity is fighting for its survival and it is imperative that a new international morality be defined. I am certain that despite its present imperfections the United Nations can be the ideal instrument to achieve this.51.	We must understand how eternally precarious the safety of the world is; through its history so many sacrifices have been required to overcome so many dangers.52.	We must acknowledge that the higher interests of our Organization require that nothing come before the duty to serve it.53.	We must be prepared to unite fraternally in order to safeguard peace and security  not only for our age  but also â and above all â for future generations.54.	It is in that way  and in that way alone  that we will have fully assumed our international responsibility  that of leading millions upon millions of human beings for whom we are responsible towards greater wellbeing and justice  towards greater hope and happiness."
"12",615,"BGD",35,1980,"ï»¿90.	The members of the Bangladesh delegation value the opportunity to participate in the deliberations of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly and extend the warm greetings of the Government and people of Bangladesh.91.	Bangladesh welcomes the admission of Zimbabwe and of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines as new Members of the United Nations family. We have no doubt that their membership will be a source of added strength for the United Nations. In this connection  we recall with pleasure the active association of Bangladesh with the initiative of the Heads of Government of Commonwealth Countries at the Lusaka meeting  held in August 1979  which eventually led to the peaceful transfer of power to the elected representatives of the people of Zimbabwe.92.	The Bangladesh delegation congratulates you most warmly. Sir  on your election to the presidency of this august body and wishes you all success in the discharge of the duties attached to your high office. We would also like to record our sincere appreciation for the dedication and efficiency with which your predecessor. Mr. Salim Alimed Salim performed his responsibilities as President.93.	We wish also to compliment Mr. Kurt Waldheim  the Secretary-General  for his relentless efforts in carrying forward the objectives of the United Nations and for the courage  patience and skill that he demonstrated in dealing with some of the most serious threats to international peace and security during the past year.94.	Bangladesh deeply mourns the passing of President Josip Broz Tito of Yugoslavia. By his death  not only Yugoslavia but the world as a whole has lost an outstanding leader and statesman dedicated to the cause of peace  freedom and justice. The non-aligned movement has indeed suffered an irreparable loss. As one of its founding members  he had nurtured and steered the movement to its emergence as a great political force. During the many critical periods in the growth of the movement  he proved to be a tower of strength and inspiration.95.	We view with great concern the progressive deterioration in the political and economic situation of the world. The Middle East crisis has been aggravated by Israel's continuing defiance of the decisions and resolutions of the United Nations  and more so by its latest illegal action in declaring Jerusalem its ""eternal and undivided"" capital. This is an affront to the sentiments of 2 billion Muslims and Christians  and a gross violation of international law and the Geneva Convention. The Middle Last  one of the most sensitive areas of the world  has become more explosive than ever before. An imperative condition for defusing the highly volatile situation and- establishing enduring peace in this region is the immediate withdrawal of Israel from all illegally occupied Arab territories  including Jerusalem  and the restoration to the Palestinians of their inalienable national rights  including their right to a State of their own in their homeland. We are also deeply concerned over the new threat to peace and security in the region as a result of the escalation of the armed conflict between Iran and Iraq. We sincerely hope that the leaders of the two countries will heed the appeals addressed to them  including one from President Ziaur Rahman of Bangladesh  to end this fratricidal conflict and agree to an immediate cessation of hostilities pending a just and honourable settlement of the dispute through peaceful negotiations  as urged upon them by the Security Council last night.""96.	It is extremely disquieting that the crises in Afghanistan and Kampuchea remain unresolved. Committed as it is to the Charter of the United Nations and to the principles of non-alignment  Bangladesh stands for scrupulous respect for the sovereign equality and the territorial integrity of all nations and for non-interference in the internal affairs of other nations. Bangladesh  therefore  is firmly of the view that the solution of these problems lies in the immediate withdrawal of all foreign troops and in the creation of conditions to enable the people of these countries to have a Government of their own choice without any external intervention  military or otherwise.97.	Bangladesh is opposed to all forms of colonialism  racism  racial discrimination and apartheid and is fully committed to supporting all efforts for their total elimination. Bangladesh  as in the past  also expresses its complete solidarity with the people of Namibia in its heroic struggle for freedom and recognizes SWAPO as the legitimate representative of the people of Namibia.98.	Bangladesh views peace and stability within a region as of paramount importance. It has been the constant endeavour of Bangladesh to develop friendly relations and to promote co-operation with all its neighbours. It is against this backdrop of the foreign policy of Bangladesh that the proposal of the President of Bangladesh for the creation of a South Asian forum for periodical consultations on matters of mutual interest and possible co-operation in economic  cultural and other fields was mooted. The response to this proposal has been extremely encouraging and we believe that such a forum would significantly contribute to peace  stability and harmonious co-operation within our region.99.	The unresolved political crises and the widening areas of tension and conflict which pose a threat to peace and security are not isolated or unrelated phenomena. It is tragic that they are located in the regions of the third world where the majority of countries gained their independence only recently. They indicate a renewed trend in power rivalry and expansionism. This is  indeed  a disturbing development  marking a shift from respect for the rule of law to the use of force in international relations  with an inevitable escalation of the arms race no longer confined to the great Powers.100.	The world economic scene is equally disquieting. Both the developing and the developed countries are engaged in a grim battle. The developing countries are battling against the problems of poverty  hunger  disease and illiteracy and the industrialized countries against those of inflation  recession and unemployment. However  the least developed countries have been hardest hit by the present economic crisis and are involved in a desperate struggle for their very survival.101.	The deteriorating economic and political situation is also accompanied by a decline in human and moral values. The deaths of millions due to starvation and malnutrition do not seem to shock their fellow human beings. Four fifths of the world's income is commanded by a fifth of its population. Tragically enough  much of it is used either in supporting a life-style based on wasteful consumption or on such unproductive purposes as the manufacture of new and more deadly weapons of destruction. I would not like to sound like a prophet of doom  but if the world is allowed to drift and the political and economic crises become increasingly-aggravated  the consequences cannot but be most dreadful.102.	The political  economic and moral crises facing the world of today are all interlinked and essentially form part of a larger crisis  embracing the totality of altitudes  habits  values and institutions inherited by us. The causes of these crises are embedded in the very structure of a world order utterly unsuited to the needs of a changed world society. We live in a new world and a new era  but still remain shackled to the habits  attitudes and institutions of a bygone age. We are members of an interdependent international community transformed by advances in science and technology and the resurgence of the nations in Asia  Africa and Latin America. Our problem is essentially one of adjusting ourselves at the individual and national levels to the new realities  new goals  new values and new concepts of a social  political and economic order.I0.V The emergence of the new independent sovereign States constituting the overwhelming majority of the Slates Members of the United Nations is one of the new realities. The military might and economic strength of the industrial nations are also a reality. But the old notion that a nation can ensure its political and economic security by increasing its military might is an illusion and an anachronism. It is inconsistent with the commitment of these nations to the principles of the United Nations Charier to abjure the use of force and to respect the sovereignty of other nations. The race for military supremacy is clearly based on the preposterous concept that the greater is your power to destroy  the more secure you are. But the escalation of the arms race has  ironically enough  created a situation in which none of these great Powers can destroy the other without destroying itself. It is abundantly clear that the growing arsenal of deadly weapons does not ensure security but endangers it  while the mounting expenditure on arms which has already crossed the $500 billion mark poses an increasing threat to the economic security of the world through escalating inflation  recession and unemployment.104.	The contemporary world has clearly reached a new watershed and is moving gradually but inexorably towards a new balance in the power configuration by replacing bipolarity with multi-polarity and towards a new concept of peace which replaces isolation with interdependence and confrontation with co-operation. The problems facing mankind on the economic  political and moral fronts highlight the futility of national policies based on a parochial and isolationist approach. Mankind has the resources and technology to deal effectively with these problems. As a matter of fact  the technical and financial resources of the world today are far greater than ever before. An enormous productivity potential remains undeveloped. What is needed  therefore  is a renewed commitment to the philosophy of an indivisible and interdependent world and a global strategy for the application and management of world resources in harnessing and developing the productivity potential of the world on a global basis.105.	It is more evident than ever before that the problems plaguing both the developing and the industrialized countries are intertwined  that these problems cannot be resolved in isolation or through confrontation. But they can be resolved through co-operation  a better perception of mutual needs  a more rational application of world resources to generate more productivity  more income  and a wider market with more goods and services to go round  curbing inflation and creating more employment. A reality that must be recognized is that the world cannot permanently be divided into segments of rich and poor  just as political and economic security cannot be divided on a regional basis. It should also be recognized that all benefit from peace and stability and a more rational use and distribution of the world's finite resources.106.	The problems are clearly global in character and call for a global approach and strategy. Given such a global approach based on mutuality of interests and complementarity of efforts  mankind can be rid of the problems of hunger  disease and illiteracy that plague two thirds of the world population and those of inflation  recession and unemployment that bedevil the industrial nations.107.	In sum  in order to ensure the political and economic security of mankind on a global basis  the following measures are imperative.208. First  all Member States of the United Nations  including the industrial nations  should honour their commitment to the principles and objectives of the United Nations Charter.109.	Secondly  they should renounce the use of force in the settlement of disputes and co-operate in establishing and enforcing the rule of law in international relations.110.	Thirdly  they should implement their commitment to the goal of disarmament.111.	Fourthly  the great Powers themselves should set an example in checking nuclear proliferation by refraining from production of new nuclear weapons and by gradual reduction of their existing stock of such weapons.112.	Fifthly  they should follow the policy of creating zones of peaceâfor example  in the Indian Ocean  South Asia  South-East Asia  Africa and Latin America.113.	Sixthly  they should adopt and implement an international development strategy through a more rational use and distribution of world resources and technology for full exploitation of the productivity potential in all parts of the world.114.	Seventhly  they should build up a food security system to ensure the supply of food from food-surplus regions to food-deficit ones  in order to prevent starvation and malnutrition  and also ensure the flow of adequate inputs to countries with potential for rapid agricultural development.115.	Eighthly  they should transfer resources to the least developed countries in the form of outright grants and investments in joint ventures  implement the Immediate Action Programme for the least developed countries and adopt appropriate measures for the success of the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries to be held in 1981.116.	Ninthly  within the framework of economic cooperation among the developing countries  the surplus funds available to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries [OPEC]  after meeting their own developmental needs  should be invested in other developing countries  with priority assigned to the special needs of the least developed among them; in like manner  the more developed among the developing countries also assist in accelerating the pace of development of the least developed countries; and in order to ease the hardship of the developing countries caused by the rise in the oil prices oil should be provided to the developing countries at concessional rates and to the least developed among them at half price.117.	Tenthly  in view of the energy crisis  an international consortium should be formed with assistance from both the industrial and the OPEC countries for exploration and development of energy in the developing countries.118.	Eleventhly  during the Third United Nations Development Decade  top priority should be assigned lo meeting basic human needs  such as food  shelter  clothing  health  education and employment  as an integral component of human rights.119.	Twelfthly  in accordance with the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter  special attention should be paid to the needs of women  children  youth and disabled persons.120.	Thirteenthly  efforts should be intensified to eradicate the remnants of colonialism and racism.121.	Fourleenthly  in view of the importance of the seabed resources to the developing countries  the efforts now under way for development and codification of international law and a new universal convention governing the ocean regime should ensure a just and equitable sharing of these resources  including the sharing of the water of international rivers.122.	Fifteenthly  the democratic principle of equal and full participation of all countries  including the developing ones  in the formulation and implementation of decisions in all fields of international relations  should be accepted.123.	The founding fathers of this Organization had a vision of a new future for the family of mankind and charted a path of progress for all  based on peace  freedom  justice  equality and human dignity. The challenge before us today is; can we follow the path charted by them towards the goal of a new and just world political and economic order as envisaged by them? Should Member States resolve to meet this challenge  we can have the peace  security and development that we seek.124.	I should like to conclude by reiterating the appeal of the President of Bangladesh at the eleventh special session of the General Assembly.125.	Let us approach the forthcoming global round of negotiations in a spirit of partnership and co-operation and with a full sense of our global obligations. Our future depends on the fruitful outcome of these negotiations."
"13",661,"BGR",35,1980,"ï»¿I should like first to congratulate the President  on his election to the presidency of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly  and to wish him every success in this important post. I should like also to express my gratitude to his predecessor  Mr. Salim  for his successful conduct of proceedings.143.	It is with particular satisfaction that we welcome to the membership of the United Nations the representatives of the freedom loving people of Zimbabwe who  in a long drawn-out and heroic struggle against racism and colonialism  won its independence. There is no doubt that  by its activities in the United Nations  the Republic of Zimbabwe will help promote the triumph of the ideals of peace  cooperation among States and social progress.144.	We also welcome as a Member of the United Nations Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.145.	The Assembly will recall that  in the 1970s  as a result of the purposeful and persistent efforts of the countries of the socialist community and also of the nonaligned States and progressive and peace-loving forces  and thanks to the sober and realistic approach and sense of responsibility of a number of Western statesmen and leaders  substantial progress was registered in the struggle for peace  security and international cooperation. The danger of war was considerably reduced and diminished. As a result of the deepening process of detente  the preconditions were created for the solution of a number of international problems. Greater prospects emerged for achieving  by means of talks  the elimination of dangerous sources of conflict. Genuine prospects emerged for the accomplishment of considerable progress in efforts aimed at curbing the arms race and reducing the tremendous burden of armaments. There was an acceleration of the process of elimination of the vestiges of colonialism. A start was made on the restructuring of international economic relations on a just and democratic basis. All that enabled the peoples of the world to entertain well-founded hopes for a peaceful and better future.146.	Unfortunately  on the threshold of the 1980s  the world has witnessed a turn of events that has threatened the positive gains achieved at the expense of such tremendous effort. That reversal was the result of the activities of those very forces that so fiercely resisted detente from the very beginning and attempted to keep mankind in conditions of cold war  mistrust  hostility and confrontation. The imperialistic  reactionary and hegemonistic forces are pursuing goals that are not at all new in their exacerbation of the international situation.147.	Recently the United States  with the support of certain countries members of NATO and the present Chinese leadership  has deliberately been stepping up tension in various parts of the world and has brusquely declared those parts of the world to be ""spheres of its own vital interest"". It has intervened in the internal affairs of sovereign States and has been creating Special Forces for this purpose  such asâ the Rapid Deployment Forceâ. It has sharply stepped up its military preparations  established new military bases  attempted to forge new military alliances  impeded talks on a number of disarmament questions  increased its military expenditures and created ever newer and more sophisticated forms of weaponry. We have seen how those forces  contrary to the universally acknowledged norms of international relations  have gone so far as to limit political  economic  cultural and other links with socialist countries. The goal of all that could not be clearer: to achieve military supremacy over the socialist countries and to pursue a policy ""from a position of strength"". That conclusion is most eloquently confirmed by the proclamation of the new nuclear strategy of the United States.148.	The historic experience of mankind  however  particularly over the last few decades  has made it abundantly clear that the imperialist plans to achieve a dominant position in the world are entirely unrealistic and groundless. Efforts designed to carry out such plans lead only to one thingâthe escalation of the arms race and an increase in the danger of armed conflict.149.	A completely different course  which is in keeping with the true interests of the peoples of the world  is proposed by the socialist countries. In July of this year  the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party and Chairman of the Council of State of the People's Republic of Bulgaria  Todor Zhivkov  stated:""The major historic task dictated by the times  dictated by life itself  is to produce a system of measures  agreements and understandings in order to guarantee on our planet the peaceful coexistence of States with different social systems  peace  freedom and the progress of peoples.""150.	This is a task which it is certainly possible to perform.151.	All that is necessary is to evince the necessary realism and goodwill and do everything possible to eliminate the dangers with which the present international situation is fraught. To this end it is necessary to increase political contacts and exchanges of views. This need was very clearly confirmed at important meetings  which were recently held at the highest level. I refer to the talks between the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and President of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR  Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev  and the President of France  Valery Giscard d'Estaing  and the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany  Helmut Schmidt.152.	In order to preserve detente as the dominant trend we must also mobilize all peace-loving forces and world public opinion. We are certain that a considerable contribution to this end is being made by the World Parliament of the Peoples for Peace  currently being held at Sofia  in which representatives of public opinion of more than 130 countries are taking part.153.	The People's Republic of Bulgaria is a member of the socialist community  whose positions on international issues are well known. They are positions of principle  the aim of which is to strengthen detente  put an end to the arms race  carry out effective disarmament measures  eliminate sources of tension  eradicate the vestiges of colonialism  neo-colonialism  racism and apartheid  restructure international economic relations on a just and democratic basis and ensure the observance of all the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.154.	These positions were reaffirmed at the Crimea meetings of the leaders of the socialist countries.155.	The constancy and resolution with which our countries defend these positions are evidenced by all the proposals put forward by the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty over the 25 years of its existence. Some of those proposals have already borne fruit.156.	I shall confine myself to citing as an example the proposal concerning the convening of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe  which some viewed as Utopian when it was first put forward by the countries of the socialist community.157.	In May of this year the Conference of the Political Consultative Committee of the States Parties to the Warsaw Treaty put forward a new initiative concerning the holding of a summit meeting of the leaders of States in all parts of the world to discuss problems connected with the elimination of sources of tension and the prevention of war. We are convinced that a meeting of this kind would do a great deal to ease tension in international relations.158.	Literally all our proposals can be implemented to good effect if our partners display the political will and readiness to discuss them and to work for the achievement of a sensible compromise.159.	The achievement of progress in resolving existing problems in any area of international life would undoubtedly contribute to an improvement of the international situation. But there is no doubt that the most important issues arc detente and disarmament  which mean a peaceful future for the world. All countries  large and small  rich and poor  developed and developing  have a vital interest in the achievement of progress in this field  for man's survival depends on whether there is war or peace. Everything depends on the decision whether the resources spent on the elimination and destruction of mankind will instead be spent for the good of mankind  for the elimination of backwardness  hunger  poverty  disease  illiteracy and ignorance. There are sufficient resources available for all needs  including the preservation and restoration of the human environment  housing  factories  irrigation  and schoolsâfor everything that ensures man's progress. That is why the socialist countries strive consistently for the strengthening of peace and detente  the achievement of progress in disarmament and the development of cooperation among peoples. Examples and proof of this are the new initiatives put forward by the Soviet Union at the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly.160.	The People's Republic of Bulgaria wholeheartedly supports the proposal to include in the agenda of this session as a particularly important and urgent matter  an item entitled ""Urgent measures for reducing the danger of war"". We believe that it would benefit the cause of peace and security for the General Assembly  at this session  to express its opposition to the extension of existing military and political groupings and the creation of new military blocs; to call upon all States  and above all the permanent members of the Security Council and countries linked with them by military agreements  not to increase the strength of their armed  forces or their conventional armaments as from a given date  as a first step towards their subsequent reduction; to declare that it is in favour of the nuclear Powers taking agreed steps to strengthen the security guarantees of nonnuclear States; and to support the immediate conclusion of a treaty on the general and complete prohibition of nuclear weapon tests and the declaration of a one year moratorium on nuclear tests of any kind.161.	In the course of more than three decades the United Nations has adopted a considerable number of useful resolutions and decisions in the field of disarmament and strengthening of international security. The Assembly's agenda still contains many constructive proposals  put forward by the Soviet Union and other States  which have preserved to this very day their validity and relevance. In this connexion  a new memorandum put forward by the Soviet Union and entitled ""Peace  disarmament and international security guarantees""  calls for mobilization of the efforts of all States  large and small  to curb the arms race and strengthen political and international legal guarantees of prevention of the danger of a new war and of preservation of peace. This is an appeal to all State leaders  to their conscience and to their sense of responsibility before mankind.162.	We are convinced that attention should be focused on the adoption of measures to halt the manufacture of all types of nuclear weapons and to gradually reduce existing stockpiles until their complete elimination. It is our belief that the conclusion of a treaty on the non-use of force in international relations and of an agreement on the strengthening of security guarantees for nonnuclear States would increase trust and give a powerful impetus to the process of real disarmament.163.	Along with measures in the field of nuclear disarmament  we should persist in our efforts to ensure the elimination of other means of mass destruction  such as chemical and radiological weapons  the prevention of the emergence of new types and systems of weapons of mass destruction as well as the early reduction of stockpiles of conventional weapons.164.	Within the European context we attach primary importance to the following questions: the successful holding  at Madrid  of the second review session of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe  at which a decision should be taken to convene a conference on military detente and disarmament in Europe; the immediate initiation of talks on medium range nuclear missiles in the European continent simultaneously and in organic link with the forward based American nuclear weapons; and the attainment of an agreement on the mutual reduction of armed forces and armaments in central Europe  real prospects for which are created by the constructive proposals recently submitted by the socialist countries.165.	We welcome the important proposal to consider the problem of the ""Historical responsibility of States for the preservation of nature for present and future generations"" [item 120). Taking the necessary steps concerning this question would be a significant contribution to the solution of a problem of vital importance to mankind.166.	Concurrently with the efforts to take new measures designed to stop the arms race and achieve disarmament  particular attention should be focused on the problem of enhancing the effectiveness of existing international instruments which are in force in this field by making the participation of States in them universal. We believe that the United Nations can and must contribute substantially to the practical solution of this important topical question.167.	In order to ease tension in international relations it is necessary to extinguish the hotbeds of tension in various parts of the world.168.	The seventh emergency special session of the General Assembly  which was devoted to the question of Palestine and held from 22 to 29 July this year  has proved once again that the Middle East conflict cannot be resolved without a resolution of the Palestinian issue. It is clear to all  though not all concede it  that separate agreements not only have failed to bring about peace  but have complicated the situation in the region still further. They encourage Israel to take increasingly brazen actions  as exemplified by the annexation of East Jerusalem.169.	The development of the Middle East crisis demonstrates that there can be no just and lasting settlement to the conflict until such time as Israel withdraws from all the Arab territories occupied in 1967  until the Arab people of Palestine exercises its inalienable right to self-determination  including the right to create its own sovereign State  and until the independent existence and security of all States and peoples in the region are guaranteed.170.	All parties concerned  including the Arab people of Palestine  through its sole legitimate representative  PLO  must participate in the settlement of the Middle East problem.171.	The outbreak of armed conflict between Iran and Iraq has given rise to serious disquiet. We hope that hostilities will cease and that both sides will find a solution  by peaceful means  to the problems that exist between them.172.	The People's Republic of Bulgaria is adhering to its position of principle that the question of Cyprus should be settled in a peaceful way in the interests of both the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots  on the basis of the preservation of the territorial integrity  sovereignty and independence of the Republic of Cyprus and respect for its policy of nonalignment.173.	Our country supports the policy of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  a policy aimed at ensuring favourable conditions for a peaceful and democratic reunification of Korea.174.	Serious concern arises in connection with the military bases which have lately been established around socialist Ethiopia. They threaten the security of that country and of all nations in the region. We fully support the aspirations of the Ethiopian people to peaceful development  the safeguard of the territorial integrity of their homeland and the ending of any interference whatsoever in Ethiopia's internal affairs.175.	The agenda item entitled ""Question of peace  stability and cooperation in Southeast Asia"" which is to be considered at this session on the proposal of a number of countries  including Bulgaria  is directly linked with the question of the relaxation of tensions and the strengthening of world peace  security and detente throughout the world. The People's Republic of Bulgaria supports the efforts of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  the Lao People's Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of Kampuchea to make of Southeast Asia a zone of peace and stability  to promote peaceful coexistence in the region and to settle disputed questions through negotiations. Because of the incessant activities of the imperialist and hegemonistic forces  the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of the States in the region are being constantly violated or threatened. These forces are stepping up their efforts to impose their will on the countries in the region. They are not giving up their efforts to undermine the peaceful reconstruction which the heroic people of Kampuchea  having thrown off for good the yoke of the criminal clique of Pol Pot  are now carrying out.176.	The Government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria insists that the Kampuchean people be represented at the United Nations by their sole legitimate representative  namely  the People's Revolutionary Council of the People's Republic of Kampuchea.177.	The People's Republic of Bulgaria supports unconditionally the struggle of peoples all over the world for national independence  against domination and exploitation and for social progress. The efforts to attain those ideals constitute an objective process which the imperialist and reactionary quarters are trying to stifle through the use of coercion  military threats and violations of the sovereignty of independent States.178.	The ""undeclared war"" waged by the forces of imperialism  hegemonism and counterrevolution against the sovereign Democratic Republic of Afghanistan with the aim of destroying the acquisitions of the April revolution is still going on. This not only hinders the peaceful and constructive activity of the Afghan people  but also impedes a political settlement of the problem and represents a direct threat to international peace and security. The People's Republic of Bulgaria  which fully supports the people and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan  is confident that the political settlement of the problem can be achieved only on the basis of the constructive  realistic programme announced by the Afghan Government on 15 May 1980.179.	Unfortunately  the imperialist and reactionary forces which continue their interference in Afghanistan have as yet given no sign whatever of a positive attitude towards such a settlement.180.	This fact has at least one explanation: the extinguishing of the hotbed of tension in Afghanistan would deprive them of pretexts for continuing their propaganda clamour  and then it would become abundantly clear to all that the long-term plans of the imperialist and hegemonistic forces for obtaining world supremacy  rather than the events in Afghanistan  are at the bottom of the present aggravation of international tensions.181.	Twenty years ago  on the initiative of the Soviet Union  the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted the historic Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. We can now note with satisfaction the decisive role that the Declaration has played in mobilizing world public opinion for the eradication of one of the most degrading phenomena in human history  namely  colonialism. The People's Republic of Bulgaria is deservedly proud of having invariably sided  along with the other socialist and progressive States  with the colonial peoples and of continuing to render its contribution to the triumph of their just struggle for national liberation.182.	But unfortunately that struggle has not yet ended.183.	The question of Namibia and the policies of apartheid pursued by the racist regime of South Africa persist and are as acute as ever. My country supports the struggle of the people of Namibia led by its sole authentic representative [SWAPO].184.	We reaffirm our position of principle in favour of the granting of full independence to the people of Namibia.185.	However  we oppose attempts to resolve this question outside the framework of the United Nations  or to use the Organization as the means of imposing on the Namibian people a kind of ""independence"" which would  in essence  protect foreign interests.186.	All that I have said so far is based on the principles which underlie our foreign policy and our relations with neighbouring and distant countries. Thanks to that policy we have good relations with all our neighbours. There is now in the Balkans a prevailing desire for peace  cooperation and good neighbourliness  and the People's Republic of Bulgaria is by no means playing the smallest role in the attainment of those objectives.187.	The establishment of new international economic relations among all the States of the world is one of the key issues at present. The possibilities of solving this problem depend directly on the strengthening of peace and security and the development and deepening of the process of detente  as well as on the implementation of practical measures for disarmament.188.	The deepening crisis of the capitalist economic system is having a negative impact on international economic relations. In the field of foreign trade that crisis has led to a slowing down of the rate of development of international trade  the constant growth of protectionism and the exacerbation of the monetary problems of a number of capitalist countries. As a result  the economic conditions in many developing countries have deteriorated and their ability to use their international economic ties for the solution of their development problems has been restricted. The eleventh special session of the General Assembly demonstrated once again that the scope  the depth and multifaceted nature of the contemporary crisis phenomena require a radical transformation of international economic relations on a just and democratic basis rather than a mere adjustment of the existing machinery.189.	In accordance with the position of principle of the countries members of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance  we fully support the efforts of the developing countries to achieve economic independence. Our solidarity with them in their struggle against colonialism and neo-colonialism  for the elimination of relations of inequality and subordination imposed upon them by the imperialists and for the right to dispose freely of their own natural resources will remain firm.190.	In conclusion  I should like to emphasize that in the 35 years of its existence  in circumstances of dynamic and contradictory international relations  the United Nations has contributed significantly to the strengthening of peace and detente  the promotion and deepening of the positive trends and processes in the world and the solution of many complicated international problems.191.	Throughout the years of its membership in the United Nations  the People's Republic of Bulgaria has remained faithful to those noble goals and has contributed to their achievement. The people and the Government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria reaffirm their willingness to continue their active and steadfast efforts to ensure the implementation of the purposes and principles set forth in the Charter of the United Nations  in order to support the aspirations of mankind to peace  cooperation  freedom and social progress."

I should like  moreover  to convey to the Secretary- General our sincere appreciation of his ceaseless and tireless efforts in shouldering the duties and responsibilities entrusted to him by the General Assembly  foremost among them being promotion of the cause of international peace and co-operation. We thank him  too  for his report on the work of the Organization and the international situation during this year  a valuable report which contains a comprehensive presentation of all current international issues and crises.42.	I take this opportunity also to welcome on behalf of the delegation of my country the admission of the two States of Zimbabwe and St. Vincent and the Grenadines to membership in the United Nations. Their admission to our family of nations is a step towards the universality of the Organization. We look forward to the day when we shall see the representatives of the people of Palestine and Namibia and other peoples in the world which are still under colonial domination  occupation and subjection sitting among us in this hall as full Members  in fulfilment of one of the objectives of the Organization  namely  the universality of its membership.43.	Each year we meet here to review together the events of the world in general. We ought at this session  now that we are at the threshold of the 1980s and 35 years after the establishment of the United Nations  of which the commemorative day falls on 24 October  to pause and reflect on the achievements of the United Nations throughout the past years."" Has the Organization accomplished the principal aims and purposes for which it was established  particularly the maintenance of international peace and security?44.	The United Nations  after 35 years of existence  has practically attained the objective of universality. It now includes 154 States representing all the corners of the globe. It has become a true symbol of mutual co-operation among States and peoples of various political  economic and social systems.45.	Nevertheless  it has failed to achieve its principal aims and purposes concerning the maintenance of international peace and security and the satisfaction of the aspirations and ambitions of the peoples of the world.46.	Thirty-five years after the establishment of the United Nations  the cause of international peace and security is still in danger. The arms race among States is still at its peak  not for lawful self-defence but to threaten the independence and sovereignty of other States  and even threaten the annihilation of the human race by various destructive methods. Poor States are still getting poorer and rich States richer. Hunger  poverty and ignorance are threatening the lives of millions of people.47.	The future of the world at the beginning of the 1980s seems to be dim  politically and economically. Most States are increasing their armaments feverishly. We see in every part of the world sparks of armed conflict emitted  which  if allowed to continue and spread  could at any moment set the whole world ablaze. This was clear in the first months of this year  when we noticed a real deterioration in the relations between the two super-Powers  endangering the international atmosphere. We  as a small State in one of the most sensitive regions of the world  feel deeply concerned at the course that events are taking between the two super-Powers. Recurrent political events are causing smouldering hotbeds of conflict to threaten the world with real disaster. The turbulent situation in the Middle East  Indo-China  Afghanistan and southern Africa and the course of events in Latin America and Europe have caused the escalation of the cold war between East and West. The cold war would have turned into a real war but for the self-restraint shown by some leaders.48.	The two super-Powers seem to be competing to implement their policies of world domination  particularly as regards the third world. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan  for example  has exposed our region and the whole world to incalculable and unpredictable dangers. It may not be an overstatement to say that current international tensions are very similar to the stormy conditions which preceded the outbreak of the Second World War  owing to the dangerous ventures of some great Powers. If a third world war breaks out  it will no doubt lead to the annihilation of the human race and the transformation of the world into a complete nuclear desert.49.	We are now at the beginning of the 1980s. A new mode of relations among States is needed. The time has come for us to rid ourselves of old thoughts that govern our action and behaviour. War by proxy among the great Powers waged in the third world has to be discontinued now. We consider that the most important element for the creation of an international atmosphere of confidence is the observance of equitable relations among States. Such relations should be based on respect for the principles of the Charter  particularly mutual respect among States for each other's independence  sovereignty  integrity and security and the principle of non-intervention in the domestic affairs of other States. We have explained on more than one occasion and in more than one forum that detente is not confined to Europe; it is indivisible and inseparable and should extend to the whole world. It cannot be confined within Europe  away from developments in other parts of the world. We should never forget that the responsibility for world peace and security is no longer the exclusive right or monopoly of the great Powers alone; it is the collective responsibility of all States  large or small.50.	International peace and security in many parts of the world is at the crossroads  particularly since the world  and especially the world's hotbeds of tension such as the Middle East  has become the scene of recurrent explosive events.51.	The critical situation in our area is a source of worry. The indications are that the continuance of the dispute between Iraq and Iran at the present level of intensity may cause the situation to take a dangerous turn which would have serious effects on peace and security  not only in our region but in the whole world. Therefore we support the appeals addressed to both parties for self-restraint and a cease-fire and to resort to negotiations and respond to the good offices of the Islamic Conference. We welcome the recent decision of the Republic of Iraq to observe a ceasefire.52.	The events taking place in the Middle East have attracted the overwhelming attention of the community of nations  especially after the intensification of the savage and racist Zionist aggression against the Palestinian people. The convening of the General Assembly this year in the seventh emergency special session to consider the question of Pales-' tine and the series of meetings held by the Security Council to consider the explosive situation in the occupied Arab lands are clear proof of the dangerous situation in the area. Israel has built more settlements on occupied Arab lands. It has intensified its measures of oppression  persecution and torture against the inhabitants of the occupied lands and wiped out the Arab heritage of such lands  especially in the Holy City of Jerusalem.53.	The West Bank has been the scene throughout this year of wide national uprisings against Zionist tyranny. The Zionist authorities have met such rejectionist national uprisings by increased measures of oppression and terrorism  in order to Judaize the occupied territories and empty them of their occupants and impose the so-called plan of self-rule on the Palestinians. This plan has been strongly rejected by all the Palestinian people. This has driven the Zionist occupying authorities to deport three eminent persons from the West Bank and refuse their return to the occupied territories  contrary to resolutions 468 (1980) and 469 (1980) in which the Security Council ordered their return to their homeland. The occupying authorities have continued their repressive and savage measures against eminent national personalities who oppose their occupation and the plan for the liquidation of the Palestinian cause through the Camp David agreements. This has been clearly proved by the attempted assassination of three of the mayors in the West Bank  which resulted in the infliction of grievous bodily harm on them. The international community has expressed its great concern at the explosive situation in the region because of Israel's tightening grip on the inhabitants of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.54.	The situation in the Middle East is passing through a very dangerous and delicate stage because Israel is increasing its challenge by declaring the annexation of Jerusalem as the permanent capital of Israel  thereby flouting Security Council resolutions 476 (1980) and 478 (1980) and General Assembly resolution ES-7/2. The decision of Israel to annex Jerusalem is a grave violation of the principles of the United Nations and its resolutions.55.	The refusal of the international community to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel is a clear indication of the awakening of the conscience of the international community  as Jerusalem is an indivisible part of occupied Palestinian lands. The Zionist annexation of the Holy City involves a radical change in the religious and spiritual nature and status of the city since it threatens the political  human and spiritual rights not only of the Palestinian people but of all Moslems and Christians in the world.56.	Security Council resolution 478 (1980) of 20 August 1980 is of the utmost importance as the first resolution with which most Member States have complied  in conformity with law and justice and the principles of the Charter. Even the closest friends and allies of Israel could not stand by its side on this issue but preferred to be neutral  so as to avoid being accused of acting contrary to justice or condoning the breach of the principles of the Charter. Israel has thus become politically isolated on this issue.57.	We offer in this forum our compliments to the States which have transferred their embassies from Jerusalem in accordance with Security Council resolution 478 (1980). We should like to emphasize this connection that if all Member States had complied with all the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council  Israel would not have been able to challenge the principles of the United Nations and ignore its resolutions on Palestine and the Middle East. We appeal to the world  represented in the Assembly  to move quickly in order to save Jerusalem from the claws of Zionist domination. We also call upon the Security Council to face up to its responsibility to maintain the principles of the United Nations by imposing on Israel the sanctions provided for in Chapter VII of the Charter to compel it to evacuate all occupied Arab lands  including Jerusalem.58.	There is no doubt that the assistance and support given to Israel by some States  particularly the United States  have encouraged it to challenge a-id ignore the United Nations resolutions and proceed with its evil plans to annex Jerusalem and the occupied Palestinian and Arab lands. Such States  by their blind support of Israel  are in fact and in truth acting contrary to the United Nations principles  binding on them under the Charter  which prohibit categorically the occupation of land by the use of force.59.	The aim of Israel  by geographical expansion through the annexation of Jerusalem and the building of more settlements under the pretext of security  is first and last the annexation of the whole of Palestine and the dismissal of its inhabitants. Jewish settlement has been and still is one of the principal policies of consecutive Israeli Governments since 1967. We challenge Israel to declare before the General Assembly its adherence to and respect for the principle of non-acquisition of territories by force  as provided in Article 2  paragraph 4  of the Charter  and its readiness to evacuate all occupied Arab lands under a just and durable peace in the region.60.	It has become internationally indisputable today that the Palestine question is the core of the dispute in the Middle East and that without the just and durable resolution of the question of Palestine and the Palestinian people  there will be no peace or stability in the area. It has become clear that no just and durable peace can be reached in the Middle East under the umbrella of the Camp David agreements and the Egyptian-Israeli Treaty. The way to peace planned by the Camp David agreements between Egypt and Israel has reached a dead end. An opportunity should be given to the United Nations  as the natural and appropriate body to find a comprehensive  just and durable solution to the dispute in the Middle East  in which all parties concerned participate  including the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]  which is supported by the masses of the Palestinian people; and the majority of the States of the world.61.	Therefore we should like to reaffirm that to be successful any peaceful attempts to establish a comprehensive  just and durable peace in the Middle East must  in our opinion  be based on certain essential elements: namely  the complete evacuation of Israeli forces from all Arab lands occupied since 1967  including Arab Jerusalem  and the granting to the Palestinian people of their legitimate and inalienable rights  including their right to return home and to self- determination and the establishment of an independent State in their homeland. They should be allowed to participate in any discussion of this question on an equal basis with all parties to the dispute in the Middle East. Accordingly  Bahrain welcomes any initiative or step towards the solution of the Middle East problem in conformity with these just principles  provided that no harm is done to the rights of the Palestinian people or other Arab States whose lands are occupied. We call upon this international Organization  which bears a special responsibility to the Palestinian people  to help and assist them and support their struggle against Zionist occupation  so that they may recover their legitimate and inalienable rights  which have been repeatedly and frequently recognized by the United Nations and the States of the world.62.	Reference should be made here to the development of events in the sister country of Lebanon. The situation in the south of Lebanon has been very serious this year. That country has been exposed to Israeli attacks which violate all international rules and agreements.63.	Events have proved the true nature of Israel since its implantation by force in the Middle East; it has been revealed as an agglomeration of imperialist  racist  settler and expansionist people who cannot live in the area without the use of force against surrounding countries. The repeated attacks and military raids waged by Israel all over Lebanon without provocation are a dangerous phenomenon which cannot be condoned  nor can they be explained except on the assumption that Israel is a racist entity which lives on expansion and aggression.64.	A question which we would like to pose before the Assembly is  when will the Security Council stop moving in a circle of resolutions condemning the repeated savage military attacks waged by the Israeli forces against Lebanon and the United Nations Forces  resolutions that Israel has always violated with impunity? We call upon the international community to support Lebanon and stand by the Lebanese people against the Israeli challenges aimed at the weakening of Lebanon  the exhaustion of its economic capabilities and its disintegration as an entity.65.	The critical situation in Afghanistan is no less serious than the situation in the Middle East. The convening of the General Assembly in the sixth emergency special session at the beginning of this year under resolution 377 (V)  the ""Uniting for Peace"" resolution  to discuss the explosive situation in Afghanistan is a clear indication of the extent of the seriousness of the situation.66.	We have explained on more than one occasion that we are against all kinds of pressure and all forms of intervention in the domestic affairs of States and all acts of aggression  whether from East or West. We therefore have condemned the Soviet invasion of the non-aligned Moslem country as being an outrageous violation of all international norms and rules and the principles of the Charter. The international community has expressed in General Assembly resolution ES-6/2 its great concern and displeasure at what happened in Afghanistan.67.	We consider that calm and peace will return to Afghanistan only upon the complete withdrawal of all foreign forces from Afghanistan  through respect for its sovereignty and integrity as a non-aligned country and non-intervention in its domestic affairs  and only if the people of Afghanistan are allowed to determine for themselves their form of government and their economic  political and social system  without foreign interference.68.	In South Africa  the white minority regime still pursues its policies of apartheid and racial discrimination by imposing unjust discriminatory laws against the black majority in that country. This has led again this year to mass outbursts of anger and exasperation. The time has come for the racist regime in South Africa to realize that the international community will not stand by  with its arms folded  in face of the open challenges of South Africa to the principles of the Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.69.	The rejection by the racist regime in South Africa of the proposal contained in Security Council resolution 435 (1978) for setting in motion the process for peace and independence in Namibia calls for our condemnation and inspires disgust. Therefore  we support the call for the imposition of mandatory sanctions on the South African regime under Chapter VII of the Charter in order to compel it to abide by and comply with the United Nations resolutions and the will of the international community which it has always disregarded.70.	The hopes that were pinned on the eleventh special session of the General Assembly devoted to international development and co-operation have been frustrated  particularly as more than six years have passed since the Assembly  at its sixth special session  adopted the Declaration on the New International Economic Order and Programme of Action. Since that Declaration  lengthy and difficult negotiations have taken place between North and South at various levels  within and outside the framework of the United Nations  for the establishment of the new economic order on just and equitable grounds. These negotiations have regrettably not been successful  owing to the uncompromising attitude of the developed countries. The fact that the Assembly at the eleventh special session failed to arrive at an agreement should not shake our determination to find solutions to the pending issues within the framework of the United Nations  and particularly to reach agreement on the procedures and agenda for the global negotiations.71.	Despite the accomplishments of the United Nations over the past years in various fields the road before it is still long  rough and difficult and a lot of effort and sacrifice are required on the part of the peoples and Governments of Member States in order to support the creative role of the Organization in confronting the challenges of this age. We therefore hope that at this session resolutions will emerge which will correspond to the responsibilities and challenges facing our world and satisfy the great hopes and aspirations which peoples and Governments place on the United Nations.72.	For our part  we reaffirm that the Slate of Bahrain will spare no effort to contribute effectively and positively to the work at this session to the attainment of such noble goals. We would also like on the occasion of the thirty-fifth anniversary of the entry into force of the Charter to reiterate Bahrain's adherence to the principles of the Charter and to declare our great confidence in this international Organization  which has frequently attempted and achieved solutions to the serious problems facing our world today."
"15",744,"BHS",35,1980,"ï»¿Mr. President  I should like first of all  on behalf of the Bahamas Government and its people  to congratulate you on your election as President of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. Your distinguished record of achievement eminently qualifies you to guide the deliberations of this body. I wish you every success in your high office and can assure you  Sir  of my delegation's full co-operation.106.	I am further pleased to have this opportunity to thank your predecessor  Ambassador Salim of the United Republic of Tanzania  who through quiet diplomacy and expert skill guided the work of the past session in an admirable and efficient manner.107.	I wish also to take this opportunity to express our sincere appreciation to the distinguished and indefatigable Secretary-General and his staff for their devotion to duty and loyalty to the Organization. They have our full support in their endeavour to execute the decisions and resolutions of the Organization.108.	Believing firmly in the principle of universality of membership of the United Nations  my delegation warmly welcomes Zimbabwe and the sister Caribbean nation Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to membership of this Organization. We wish to congratulate those two Commonwealth nations on their independence and their emergence into the community of free and sovereign States.109.	In 1973  when the Bahamas became a Member of the United Nations  we gave some indication of how we perceived the international situation and the problems con-fronting the world community. We also expressed our confidence in the United Nations as a global mechanism for the resolution of international problems. However  today  seven years later  we are obliged to acknowledge that many of those problems are still with us. Indeed  in some instances they have worsened and in others given rise to new problems. We wish therefore  in addition to restating the principles of our foreign policy  to give an assessment of the international situation and to consider how best our United Nations can overcome the problems confronting it and find lasting peaceful solutions to them.110.	The foundation of our foreign policy  like that of other States  is the preservation of our national sovereignty and identity as a free and democratic society of which human values and respect for individual freedom are unchallenged ingredients. As a nation  it is our goal to help to create an international environment in which all people may live in a similar state in peace and freedom under the rule of law. Specifically  some foreign-policy guidelines of the Bahamas are: first  that the Bahamas will pursue a course of peace with its neighbours and with all like-minded nations; secondly  that the Bahamas will support the right of all colonial peoples to self-determination and independence; thirdly  that the Bahamas will oppose the political interference of one State in another State's internal affairs; and  fourthly  that the Bahamas will work for a more equitable and stable world economic order.111.	In pursuing these goals we regard our membership in the United Nations as a corner-stone of Bahamian foreign policy  and we see the world Organization as a unique vehicle for bringing us closer to the ultimate goalâthat is  a world at peace based on greater respect for the individual and his fundamental needs.112.	International society is extremely heterogeneous. It consists of a wide range of cultures  traditions  races  religions and ideologies. In view of this diversity it is evident that only global co-operation can create the conditions of stability and peace that are necessary for ensuring economic and social progress for all mankind.113.	In this connection  the Bahamas continues to regard the United Nations as an indispensable instrument for co-operation at the international level. However  in reflecting on the course of developments in recent years we must conclude that progress and a constructive approach to global problems are possible only if Member States move from confrontation to meaningful dialogue and from dialogue to consensus and implementation. For too long fundamental political and economic issues have remained unresolved  shifting about in a sea of rhetoric. Much has been said about strengthening the role of the United Nations. Yet we fail to accept the reality that such strengthening can come about only through the exercise of sincere political will by the Member States. It depends on their willingness to subordinate certain national ambitions and short-term interests to selfless interests and the common yearnings for peace.114.	Representing the Government of a developing nation  I am concerned over the state of the world and of the Organization. Indeed  the positive facts and developments are overshadowed by negative events and situations. The emergence of newly independent States contrasts starkly with aggression  war and occupation of States' territories by foreign Powers. Progress in the fight against inflation  and the prosperity in some parts of the world  are overshadowed by unemployment  inflation  persistent mass poverty and lack of advancement in achieving structural change in world economic relations. The relative stability in Europe and the absence of war in other regions have to be balanced against the uneasy stalemate and dangerous clashes in the Middle East  the senseless violence in southern Africa and the increased threat of nuclear proliferation.115.	It is against that back-drop that I wish to address myself to some of the key issues of the day which also happen to dominate the agenda of the thirty-fifth session.116.	The Bahamas remains firmly opposed to all forms of racial discrimination  wherever it exists. We condemn the apartheid policy of the Government of South Africa  for it not only violates all our principles and ideals but poses a dangerous threat to international peace. Events over the last few years have demonstrated the growing frustration of the black population and the intransigence of the South African Government. In our view  for example  the Bantustan policy  far from solving the problems posed by apartheid  is in fact a means of perpetuating it. In November 1977  by its resolution 418 (1977)  the Security Council imposed a mandatory arms embargo on South Africa. The Bahamas not only welcomed that move but supported it whole-heartedly. Further  we support the call to States to cut their economic relations with the racist regime of South Africa. Members may rest assured that the Bahamas will do everything in its power to help to bring about a non-racial democratic government in South Africa.117.	The Government of the Bahamas firmly supports the right of the people of Namibia to self-determination  independence and enjoyment of the fundamental rights stipulated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.118.	It is also our view that the people of Namibia should be able to exercise their inalienable rights in a democratic fashion under the supervision of the United Nations  and that all political groups  including SWAPO  should be able to participate.119.	Further  the Bahamas wishes to pay the highest tribute to the front-line States for the sacrifices in both human and economic terms which they have made and are still making concerning the deplorable situation in South Africa. While the Bahamas commends the efforts expended by the five Western Powers and the United Nations in bringing the issue to a point where optimism was warranted  we deplore the present foot-dragging of South Africa in this matter and warn that it would be irresponsible and dangerous for South Africa to continue to do nothing or to promote arrangements which would be internationally unacceptable.120.	For a number of years now the United Nations has been seized of the question of independence for Belize. The Government of the Bahamas affirms its support for the just aspirations of the people of Belize to self-determination  independence and territorial integrity  in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. The Bahamas also supports Belize in its rejection of the suggestion that it cede part of its territory to Guatemala as the price of gaining its independence. We regard any such move as creating a dangerous precedent for States in the region. The Bahamas therefore calls on all parties  in keeping with General Assembly resolutions  to accelerate their negotiations with a view to achieving a just and workable settlement of the dispute and thereby allowing the people of Belize to exercise their inalienable rights.121.	Turning to the question of Cyprus  my delegation wishes to express its deep disappointment over the slow progress which has been made in settling that problem. The basic position of the Bahamas Government is that the sovereignty  territorial integrity and independence of the Republic of Cyprus must not only be maintained but safeguarded as well. The Bahamas believes that a settlement in Cyprus can be brought about only through negotiations between the parties. We therefore attach great importance to the intercommunal talks and urge resumption of discussions as quickly as possible. We further call upon all nations to condemn most strongly any outside interference in the internal affairs of Cyprus.122.	With regard to the Middle East it is disheartening to note that  after numerous hopeful starts  very little progress is being made towards an ultimately acceptable solution. The Bahamas has seldom expressed its opinion on the conditions it views as necessary for peace in the Arab-Israeli conflict. Today we are convinced  however  as a matter of principle  that any solution must be based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and on the following fundamental principles: first  the acquisition of territory by force is unacceptable; secondly  Israel must end its occupation of territories it has held since the 1967 war; thirdly  the sovereignty  territorial integrity and independence of each State in the region must be respected as well as the right of the citizens of each State in the region to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries; and fourthly  the establishment of a just and durable peace must take account of the legitimate rights of the Palestinians.123.	With regard to developments since the Camp David accords  the Bahamas is concerned over certain measures taken by the Government of Israel in the occupied territories. Those measures are contrary to the basic principles stated earlier and they constitute additional difficulties in the negotiations. The Bahamas Government therefore calls upon the parties to refrain from making any declarations or adopting legal  military  administrative or other measures which would constitute an obstacle to peace.124.	Similarly  the situations in Kampuchea and Afghanistan are of concern to the Bahamas in that the crises demonstrate an imposition of wills on small independent States by foreign Powers through the use of force  in blatant violation of international law  thereby threatening international peace and security. The Government of the Bahamas strongly condemns armed intervention against those two countries by foreign Powers  in violation of principles enshrined in the Charter. The Bahamas consequently calls once again upon Member States  in particular those directly concerned  to adhere to the United Nations resolutions that seek to resolve those two situations.125.	I now turn to a consideration of the economic and social issues which are so vital to the welfare of our peoples. It should be recognized that the attainment of peace and security will continue to remain a distant goal unless the basic economic and social needs of mankind are fulfilled  at least to a reasonable degree.126.	As a developing State  we are becoming increasingly aware of the wide-ranging effects that the actions of other States  particularly the industrialized and oil-producing States  have on our policy options. That is why it is so important for us to discuss economic and development issues effectively in this body. The Bahamas has watched and followed with keen interest the dialogue over proposals for a transformation of the structures of economic relations between developed and developing countries. My delegation must  however  register deep disappointment regarding the results which have emerged from discussions at the sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly  at the sessions of UNCTAD  at the Conference on International Economic Co-operation  in the Committee of the Whole and now  most recently  at the eleventh special session of the General Assembly.127.	The continuing world-wide economic stagnation may have made progress towards a new international economic order more difficult  but no less urgent. The developing countries have been affected even more severely than the industrialized countries. My delegation must again appeal for commitments which would extend beyond words and conferences towards the effective implementation of what has previously been agreed upon. Of essential importance here is the mobilization of political will by all parties. The developed countries should find ways of convincing their nationals of the moral imperative of assisting developing nations and also of the good economic sense of so doing. Developing countries  on the other hand  must renew their commitment to self-reliance and third world economic co-operation  correcting deficiencies and gaps in their national economies which only they can reasonably be expected to correct.128.	The Government of the Bahamas recognizes the incalculable benefits which have accrued to the people of the world as a result of the presence of the United Nations over the last 35 years. No other organization  State or grouping of States has been able to assist the economic well-being of so many for so long. Yet  despite those achievements  the United Nations and the specialized and intergovernmental agencies could improve on their performance. My delegation holds this opinion especially regarding the approach to the allocation of development and technical assistance taken by the various agencies.129.	The Bahamas wishes to reiterate what other small island developing countries have drawn attention to in this chamber; that is  that the quantum of assistance which is allocated to a country is largely determined by its gross national product per capita. That gives a completely unrealistic and inaccurate evaluation of a country's wealth and leads to the classification of a resource-poor country as wealthy and a resource-rich country as poor. Indeed  the net effect of the application of this criterion is the penalization of a given country with an artificially high gross national product per capita because of the existence of some anomaly in its economic structure  which  in the case of recently independent States  may be the result of bygone colonial economic policy.130.	The Bahamas contends that when the same approach is adopted in bilateral and other non-United Nations multi-lateral groups or agencies  it makes it very difficult for the lower or middle income State to receive help for its development projects. We do not mean in any sense that the major thrust of aid efforts should not go to the least developed States. We do mean  however  that some attention should be given to preventive development assistance  to help those States about which I am speaking. We should not wait until all the efforts and assistance must be restorative. That can be achieved simply by taking into account  apart from the gross national product per capita  the size of the country  its potential for development  the human resources available and the nature of the specific problems confronting the country.131.	We are pleased to note that the United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy  which the General Assembly called for at its thirty-third session  will convene in August next year. In our opinion the energy issue is one of the most urgent among our global problems. The rich countries consume a disproportionate amount of the world's energy supply. Accordingly  it is primarily their responsibility to conserve energy  to pro-mote intensified exploration and exploitation of conventional energy sources and to develop alternative sources. In those efforts the Government of the Bahamas will lend all the support it can possibly give.132.	Having touched upon only some of the issues con-fronting this body  I cannot help but think of the many other problems which likewise demand our attention. It is expected that at the outset we may have different proposals  different priorities and different approaches to problems  but it must be recognized that  to achieve progress  convergence and consensus must occur. We have to be realistic. We cannot continue to use inflated rhetoric. Action is badly needed if we are to keep public support for the United Nations.133.	Today more than ever the United Nations is necessary  even indispensable. It represents hope for many nations  especially for the small and the militarily weak. It is the supreme resort  the guardian of international law and a source of comfort and assistance.134.	We offer our undivided support to the General Assembly and to the Security Council  as well as to all other organs of the United Nations system. We support  too  measures which promote unified action and increase the effectiveness of the United Nations. To achieve these goals  the Bahamas urges Member States and the Secretariat to seek daily to define priorities better  to plan integrated programmes and to follow policies of reducing expenses and of conservative budgeting which should allow a greater proportion of the available resources to become available for projects that will be of particular benefit to developing nations.135.	For almost a decade now  the world community  through the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea has been trying to devise a new legal regime for the oceans that will be fair to all countries. We are pleased to note the success achieved at the last part of the ninth session by the Conference in this endeavour which brings the work of the Conference nearer to the achievement of a universal and comprehensive treaty acceptable to all nations by consensus.There can be no doubt as to the positive achievements of the Conference. Achievements such as the freedom of navigation  the preservation of the marine environment and the conservation of fisheries benefit all nations  both developing and developed. The provisions of the draft treaty relevant to the legal regime of archipelagic States' represent a far-reaching accomplishment  since for the first time the world community recognizes the legitimate aspirations of archipelagic States to be considered a unitary  political  historical and geographical category.137.	We look forward to the tenth session of the Conference  which  it is hoped  will be the final substantive session. We realize that there still remain some issues to be finalized  among them the delimitation of maritime boundaries. We hope that this issue will be resolved in a manner that is fair and just to all concerned.138.	In conclusion  let me state that we must never forget our goals and objectives. Despite the myriad problems and the weaknesses inherent in our Organization  the Charter binds us to certain basic principles which areas valid now as they were in 1945. Let us therefore pledge ourselves to assist in promoting the principle that conflicts  disputes and economic and social problems must be solved through constructive dialogue and peaceful negotiations and  most importantly  through the enforcement of realistic ways to eliminate injustice and reduce inequalities among the peoples of the world."
"16",816,"BLR",35,1980,"ï»¿Mr. President  I wish to congratulate you on your election to the important post of President of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly and offer our wishes for the fruitful and constructive accomplishment of the important tasks entrusted to you.38.	This session of the General Assembly  which marks the thirty-fifth anniversary of the work of the United Nations  is being held during a period when  because of the actions of the imperialist and hegemonist forces  the world situation has perceptibly deteriorated and the process of detente is being severely tested. The struggle for improvement of the international situation is a very difficult process which is marked by confrontation between two diametrically opposed trends in world politics: the course adopted by the socialist countries and other peace-loving forces that are in favour of peace  respect for the rights of peoples and detente and  on the other hand  the course adopted by the most militaristic and aggressive circles of the imperialist Powers and the Beijing hegemonists who are trying to bury detente  to eliminate the positive achievements of recent years and to pursue a policy of oppression  militarism and aggression.39.	In disregard of the realities of the contemporary world  in fear of the successes of socialism and the national liberation movements  and in face of the growth of freedom- loving democratic and peace-loving forces as a whole  the imperialistsâfirst and foremost the reactionary circles of the United States of Americaâhave adopted a course of violating the military balance which has been brought about in the world in its favour and to damage detente  security and co-operation among peoples. This is where the root causes of the present exacerbation of the international situation lie.40.	It would appear that the victory in the Second World War over Fascist Germany and militaristic Japan and the development of events in the world during the post-war period have made it clear once and for all to everyone that it is incontrovertibly true that the path of militarism and aggression can lead nowhere but to total defeat  and that the policy of a position of strength is something which cannot be used to solve a single problem  and in particular to halt social revolutions.41.	However  the United States  which throughout the existence of the United Nations and in defiance of the Charter has more than 200 times used its armed forces against other States  has once again embarked upon a course inimical to the cause of peace  apparently forgetting about the failures of such a policy in the past.42.	Under the cover of trumped-up pretexts  the United States has arbitrarily awarded itself the right to dictate to its allies a high and continually growing level of military expenditures; it has been imposing upon them the decision to deploy on their territories American missiles with nuclear warheads and is attempting to decide with whom they should not maintain economic  trade  scientific  technological and cultural co-operation; they are even trying to tell athletes whether or not they should take part in international sports competitions. They demand unquestioning obedience from others  but at the same time the United States refuses to honour commitments that it had earlier assumedâeven to its own allies. The United States is toying with plans for building up the manufacture of fissile material for military purposes  for improving even further its nuclear weapons  creating nuclear and chemical binary weapons  announcing deliberate and false military alerts  and carrying out subversive actions and acts of provocation against sovereign States.43.	Recently in the United States  one after another like mushrooms after rain  there have been springing up new and ever-more militaristic doctrines and strategies; but these are poisonous ""mushrooms"". Among them are the unjustified declaration by the United States of various parts of the world  very far distant from its shores  as its own spheres of vital interests  and a strategy  although limited  of definitely nuclear warfare. In this regard I should like to point out that to plan nuclear war in any form is irresponsibly and cynically to plan world catastrophe.44.	To justify such a dangerous policy  recourse is being had once again to a whole anthology of fallacious myths about an alleged Soviet military threat. In this regard  as long ago as 60 years the founder of the Soviet State  Vladimir Ilyich Lenin  warned:""There are foolish people around who cry out about 'red militarism'; these are political crooks who pretend to believe this stupidity and scatter charges of this kind all around  using for this purpose their lawyer's skills to invent false arguments and to throw dust in the eyes of the masses.""45.	Anti-Sovietism and anti-communism have become a weapon of combat  not only against the USSR and other socialist States  but also against all freedom-loving and peace-loving forces  and a means of undermining detente and  in these circumstances  the exploiting essence of capitalism and the aggressive nature of its foreign policy are becoming ever more apparent.46.	We are witnessing a rapprochement between aggressive circles of imperialism  particularly the United States and the Chinese leadership  built on an anti-Soviet foundation hostile and inimical to the cause of peace. The partnership of imperialism and Beijing hegemonism in  among others  the military field  represents a new dangerous phenomenon in world politics  dangerous for the whole of mankind  including the people of the United States and China.47.	The attempts of the aggressive circles of imperialism to win military supremacy over the socialist community and threats to ""punish"" such a powerful State as the Soviet Union simply demonstrate the total loss of any sense of reality among the ruling circles of certain Powers. Surely everyone must understand that the Soviet Union can stand up for itself  for its own interests  and for the interests of its allies and friends. It is also obvious that the peoples of the world understand perfectly well the true price of peace  the strength of mutual support  and they will never give this up  because they see in it a guarantee of success in the struggle for a better future  peace and social progress. And that is something that should also be understood by those who are still trying to view the world of today from a standpoint of imperialism  hegemonism and selfish and even ambitious personal interests.48.	Faithful to its international duty  the Soviet Union responded to the appeal for assistance to the Afghan revolution  acting on the basis of the Treaty of Friendship  Good- neighbourliness and Co-operation between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and in full compliance with Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations. The USSR took into account the repeated appeals by Afghanistan for assistance in defending the country against penetration from outside by counter-revolutionary forces instigated by Washington  Beijing and their accomplices in order to strangle the Afghan revolution and to create a pro-imperialist springboard for military aggression on the southern frontiers of the USSR and against independent countries of the East.49.	It should be pointed out that those who are shouting the loudest at this session of the General Assembly about the presence of a limited contingent of Soviet troops in the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan are themselves doing everything to make sure that the possibility of the withdrawal of that contingent is made as remote as possible  that is to say  they are doing nothing to eliminate the causes of the need for this assistance.50.	A political settlement of the situation that has arisen in Afghanistan is entirely possible. The path to it has been outlined in the proposals made by the Government of Afghanistan on 14 May of this year. Obstacles to such a settlement are being created by the United States and China which  to this end  are using Pakistan in particular and artificially fanning the flames of tension.51.	I should like in particular to stress that no attemptsâ whether at this session of the General Assembly or elsewhereâto resolve the problems of the Afghan people in defiance of its will  no plans affecting the sovereignty of the Afghan State or disregarding its lawful Government and which fail to guarantee the security of Afghanistan against the intervention of bandits from outside in its internal affairs can possibly be successful. Such attempts and plans are totally hopeless and doomed to failure.52.	Mankind needs lasting peace. Peace engenders co-operation among peoples; co-operation strengthens peace. But lasting peace will not descend of its own accord on our planet; peace and disarmament  detente and the just settlement of conflicts must be fought for. In the present complicated international situation  all Statesâlarge and small  developed and developingâare in duty bound not to relax but to intensify common efforts to improve the international climate  to curb the arms race and to organize a decisive rebuff to all imperialistic and hegemonistic forces which are dragging the peoples of the world into the abyss of tension  ""cold"" war  and even ""hot"" war. There is no room for a wait-and-see attitude in the circumstances.53.	The Byelorussian SSR is firmly convinced that there are in the world social and political forces capable of ensuring the normal  peaceful coexistence of States with different social systems  and capable of averting the threat of a world thermonuclear conflict. The path to attainment of this objective is that of talks based upon strict observance of the principles of equality and equal security.54.	We note with satisfaction that  along with the States of the socialist community  an overwhelming majority of countries hold a similar viewâprimarily  members of the non-aligned movementâas demonstrated  among other things  by the statements that have been made in this debate. Responsible representatives of a number of Western countries have also stated their intention to maintain normal relations with the Soviet Union and other socialist States. Thus we can see that there is a possibility of continuing our joint work for the sake of maintaining detente as the dominant trend in world politics.55.	The Soviet Union and other countries of the socialist community strongly oppose the imperialist doctrine of the arms race and war hysteria in favour of their own doctrine of unrelenting struggle for peace and security on earth.56.	As the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR  Comrade Leonid Brezhnev  in his message to the participants in the World Parliament of the Peoples for Peace  recently held at Sofia  reconfirmed:""The Soviet Union has repeatedly stated  and substantiated by its practical steps  that we are prepared to take all necessary measures aimed at reducing the threat of a destructive military conflict. We do not want to compete in the production of lethal weapons and we are genuinely in favour of limiting and reducing military arsenals  in favour of disarmament. We are prepared for a political solution to all international problems.""57.	A further convincing manifestation of this clear-cut and lucid policy of the unremitting concern of the Soviet State for peace is the proposal submitted by the Soviet Union at this session of the General Assembly to include in the agenda the important and pressing item entitled ""Urgent measures for reducing the danger of war"".58.	In the present circumstances of a worsening international climate and the slowing down of talks on disarmament matters  the appeal contained in the draft resolution submitted by the USSR in the First Committee under that agenda item  is particularly timely and relevant: it is an appeal to all States to refrain from expanding the membership of existing political and military groupings or from creating new ones  inter alia by endowing with military functions those regional organizations which do not at present have such functions. That measure  together with the proposed renunciation by all States  with effect from 1 January 1981  of a build-up of their armed forces or of conventional armaments  would be a first step towards the subsequent reduction of armed forces and conventional weapons.59.	A pressing and urgent measure in the field of the limitation of nuclear weapons would be  as is proposed in the aforementioned draft resolution  the earliest possible elaboration and conclusion of an international convention on the granting to non-nuclear States of guarantees against the use or threat of nuclear weapons against them  and of an international treaty on the full and total prohibition of nuclear weapon testing. Success in this area would be promoted by a positive response from all nuclear Powers to the appeal of the USSR to make similar solemn declarations  approved by the Security Council  on the non-use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear States which do not have them on their territory  as well as by an understanding among nuclear States not to conduct any nuclear explosions for a year  starting from an agreed date.60.	We are confident that a careful  thorough consideration of the Soviet proposals  widespread support for them  and their immediate implementation can thwart the apologists of nuclear folly and adventurism and create  at the present stage  conditions that would give new impetus to the struggle for international peace and security  for the preservation and development of detente and for disarmament.61.	In this tenth anniversary year of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security  the United Nations should take further decisions in the interests of international peace and security and the preservation and development of detente  as well as strict and universal observance of the Charter.62.	A central problem of ensuring just and lasting peace has been  and remains  achievement of progress in the field of military detente  limitation of the arms race and genuine disarmament. The Soviet Union and other countries of the socialist community have  in recent years  submitted quite a few specific proposals on this range of issues. I would recall just a few: cessation of the nuclear arms race and the elimination of nuclear weapons; conclusion of a world treaty on the non-use of force in international relations; non-emplacement of nuclear weapons on the territories of States where no such weapons exist at present; prohibition of radiological and chemical weapons  as well as of new types and systems of weapons of mass destruction; strengthening of the non- proliferation regime; creation of nuclear-free zones and zones of peace; reduction of military budgets; and the convening of a world disarmament conference.63.	It is imperialism and its accomplices that are to blame for the fact that these and other proposals have not yet been implemented. The arms race is the very foundation of their aggressive policies. The inability to ensure social progress for the broad masses of the people is driving the monopolies and the ruling circles of imperialist Powers to violence in domestic and foreign affairs.64.	We proceed from the belief that it is possible to put an end to the arms race. The States of the socialist community have repeatedly expressed their readiness to limit and ban all forms of weapons on terms of complete reciprocity and without prejudice to anyone's security. This is attested to by the memorandum submitted by the delegation of the USSR at this session  ""Peace  disarmament and international security guarantees"".65.	Of primary importance before the quantitative and qualitative limitation and reduction of strategic arms would be the entry into force of the SALT II Treaty  ratification of which has been unjustifiably delayed for more than a year now by the American side  althoughâand this is worth recallingâPresident Carter said on 13 May 1979  that if it failed to ratify the Treaty  the United States would find itself in the role of a warmonger refusing to participate in a joint attempt to limit the proliferation of the most destructive weapon mankind has ever known.66.	A broad programme of strengthening detente and of confidence-building measures and also the halting of the whirling fly-wheel of the arms race have been put forward at the meeting of the Political Consultative Committee of the States Parties to the Warsaw Treaty held at Warsaw on 14 and 15 May.67.	The Soviet Union also proposed that a start be made on a discussion of the question of medium-range nuclear missiles in Europe at the same time as  and in organic connection with  the question of American forward-based nuclear systems. The conclusion by 1 August this year of the withdrawal from the territory of the German Democratic Republic of 20 000 Soviet military personnel and 1 000 tanks and other military equipment and the proposal of the socialist States at the Vienna Talks on Mutual Reduction of Forces  Armaments and Associated Measures in Central Europe to reduce in a first stage a further 20 000 Soviet and 13 000 American military personnel would create genuine possibilities for the conclusion of an agreement on a first stage and the production of other mutually acceptable decisions. All that is necessary is for the Western States to evince a sense of responsibility and in a spirit of good will respond to the new Soviet initiatives  which are in keeping with the genuine vital interests of the peoples of Europe and the whole world.68.	Underlying the Soviet peace initiatives are the profound analysis of the demands of the international situation  and a sober assessment of the real possibilities; due account has also been taken of the unquenchable thirst of the peoples of the world for peace and social and economic progress.69.	A little over two months ago we marked the fifth anniversary of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe  which adopted a Final Act at Helsinki on 1 August 1975  constituting a major event in the history of post-war Europe and opening up broad prospects for the peaceful development of the continent.70.	Our task now is to see to it that every State party to the Conference observes the Final Act in all its parts and is ready to participate constructively in the second review session of the Conference  at Madrid  and conclude it with important results  as well as to ensure the convening of a conference on military detente and disarmament in Europe  which was proposed by the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty as early as last year.71.	The duty of the United Nations is to promote a just settlement of existing conflicts by political means and to eliminate hotbeds of international tension.72.	That applies primarily to the Middle East  where the designs of imperialism are for ever complicating the situation.73.	The United States has embarked upon an open assertion of its military presence in that region and the Asian and African areas surrounding it. On trumped-up pretexts  it has thrown in powerful naval and air forces and is feverishly building a network of American military bases and showing its first ever more often through the so-called rapid deployment force. And all this is aimed at one thing: while keeping the Arab and other Islamic countries in the sights of their lethal weapons and to remain in control of their natural resources.74.	At the same time  with the sponsorship of Washington  Israel  which is spending for military purposes per capita four times as much as the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO]  is becoming more arrogant than ever in its actions to suppress the rights of the Palestinian people  its acts of aggression in Lebanon and its continued occupation of Syrian territory. It has even gone so far as cynically to declare the annexation of the eastern part of Jerusalem. The Israeli Government is flagrantly flouting all the decisions of the United Nations on the Middle East problem  including resolution ES-7/2 adopted on 29 July 1980  at the seventh emergency special session of the General Assembly  on the question of Palestine  which is the key to the whole Middle East problem.75.	It is time now to call a halt to the protracted hullabaloo about the anti-Arab policy of separate deals. The only path to a just and lasting settlement in the Middle East is that of collective efforts by all parties concerned  including  of course  the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]  on the basis of the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from all Arab territories occupied in 1967  including East Jerusalem  the implementation of the inalienable national rights of the Arab people of Palestine  including its right to self- determination and the creation of its own State  and the ensuring of an independent existence and development for all States of the area.76.	The situation in South-East Asia remains tense. This tension is being created above all by the expansionist policy of China  which is carried out in complicity with the United States. At the same time  naked pressure is being exerted on States members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations [ASEAN]  in particular Thailand  in order to subordinate them to their diktat.77.	The establishment of an atmosphere of peace and stability in this area would be in keeping with the vital interests of the countries of South-East Asia. Constructive ideas on this subject have been put forward at the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of three Indo-Chinese States  which was held last July in Vientiane  as well as in the proposal of the People's Republic of Kampuchea on talks and the conclusion on a bilateral basis with Thailand  Malaysia  Indonesia  the Philippines and Singapore of treaties on mutual non- aggression with a view to converting that part of the world into a zone of peace  independence  freedom  neutrality  stability and prosperity. We welcome the inclusion in the agenda of this session of the item entitled ""Question of peace  stability and co-operation in South-East Asia""78.	The delegation of the Byelorussian SSR favours an immediate and full restoration of the lawful rights of the People's Republic of Kampuchea in the United Nations and the expulsion of the bloody criminals of the Pol Pot clique  thrown out by the Kampuchean people on to the scrap-heap of history.79.	The Byelorussian SSR believes that we must resolve the problem of Cyprus on the basis of the decisions of the United Nations providing for unconditional and total respect for the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus  its status as a non- aligned State  the withdrawal from the territory of Cyprus of all foreign troops and the elimination of all foreign military bases.80.	The Byelorussian SSR supports the just position of the Korean People's Democratic Republic and the struggle of the Korean people for the reunification of their country by peaceful democratic means without any outside interference and favours the withdrawal of foreign troops from South Korea.81.	In the year of the twentieth anniversary of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples we welcome a new victory of the national liberation movementâthe defeat of one more bastion of colonialism and racism in southern Africa and the constitution of the Republic of Zimbabwe. We congratulate Zimbabwe on its admission to membership of the United Nations and we welcome Saint Vincent and the Grenadines as the one hundred and fifty-fourth Member of the Organization.82.	The Byelorussian SSR has consistently supported the national liberation  anti-colonial and anti-racist struggle of the peoples of Africa and other continents. We are in favour of the independence of Namibia and we oppose the annexationist policy of the United States with regard to Micronesia. The historic Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  which was adopted on the initiative of the Soviet Union  must be fully implemented.83.	Mankind is today faced with a range of vitally important problems which can be solved only by means of broad and constructive international co-operation. Guided by the desire to develop such co-operation in preserving the natural environment of our planet  defending it against the pernicious effects of the arms race and using natural resources in the interests of the economic and social progress of all peoples and in order that this may be done on a rational and scientific basis  the Soviet Union has taken an important initiative at this session of the General Assembly by proposing the discussion of the question of the ""Historical responsibility of States for the preservation of nature for present and future generations"". The delegation of the Byelorussian SSR expresses the hope that all States Members of the United Nations will manifest good will and adopt a constructive approach to the consideration of this important proposal of the Soviet Union and that the General Assembly will adopt an appropriate decision.84.	Among the urgent problems now facing many States are those of the necessity of providing vast masses of people with food  raw materials and sources of energy and of overcoming the economic backwardness  engendered by colonialism and capitalism  of countries of Asia  Africa and Latin America. Imperialist monopolies continue to plunder developing countries  to disregard their legitimate interests and to impede the restructuring of international economic relations on a democratic and just basis. According to data provided by UNCTAD  foreign corporations are exporting many millions of dollars from developing countries in the form of profits alone  an outflow which is more than double the inflow of new investment.85.	Because of the major Western countries  the eleventh special session of the General Assembly held recently could not fulfil the hopes of the peoples of the world for substantial progress towards organizing truly equitable international economic co-operation and supporting the efforts of developing countries in accelerating the rate of their economic growth.86.	Guided by the principles of internationalism  the States of the socialist community have provided and are continuing to provide assistance to developing countries in the acceleration of their economic development and the strengthening of their political and economic independence. At the present time  the member countries of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance are giving economic  scientific and technological assistance to 90 developing countries in various parts of the world.87.	For the developing countries co-operation with socialist countries is one of the most important prerequisites for reducing their dependence on imperialist States and transnational corporations. The socialist community has consistently favoured the .structuring of international economic relations on a basis of equality and respect for the sovereignty of all States  and it supports the progressive and just demands of developing countries for the elimination of all manifestations of discrimination  inequality  exploitation and diktat in those relations.88.	With all the complexities of the current international situation and despite the designs of those in aggressive circles on peace and detente  the will of the peoples for peace  harmony and co-operation is prevailing and  we are convinced  will finally triumph.89.	The Byelorussian people  which in the course of the Second World War lost one fourth of its sons and daughters and more than half its natural resources  knows as well as anyone the meaning of war. It is something we must not allow to happen again. Together with the peoples of all the countries of the socialist community  our people is fighting vigorously for lasting peace and international security.""Socialism  in an historically brief space of time  has revealed its incontrovertible advantages over capitalism and is now emerging as a decisive factor for social development  the improvement of the international political climate and the creation of a solid system of international security and as a consistent advocate of the elimination of war from the life of mankind.""Those optimistic words were uttered with cogent force and insight in September of this year  shortly before his tragic death  by an outstanding leader of the Communist Party and the Soviet State  Alternate Member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Byelorussian SSR  Pyotr Mironovich Masherov. Having emerged from the flames of the great patriotic war  when he had more than once looked death in the face  he was an ardent champion of peace  a man of principle and a consistent fighter for the freedom of the peoples  economic and social progress and the shining ideals of communism.90.	All the people of our planet need peace  for they want to live in tranquillity and to work creatively; they want to see the most important human right of all  the right to life  made secure.91.	As one of the founder Members of the United Nations  the Byelorussian SSR believes that it is necessary to stress once again that the duty of the United Nations is to do everything in its power to achieve the major objective proclaimed in the Charter  that of saving succeeding generations from the scourge of war."
"17",898,"BOL",35,1980,"ï»¿Having the great honour of representing my country before this great Assembly  I wish to put before you the views of the Government of National Reconstruction of the Republic of Bolivia  under the leadership of General Luis Garcia Meza.225.	However  before doing so  I wish to refer to the election of the Permanent Representative of the federal Republic of Germany  Mr. Rudiger von Wechmar  as President of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. The Bolivian delegation knows full well and fully appreciates the personality and the ability of Mr. von Wechmar. We know his dedication and his active and intelligent participation in the search for solutions to the problems affecting the peace' of the world.226.	We also wish to express our appreciation to the President of the previous session  Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim. His ability  his fine diplomatic skill  allowed him to carry out effective and fruitful work.227.	We should also like to stress our acknowledgement of the work of the Secretary-General  who has continued his dynamic and efficient mediating efforts. It is undeniable that he has never failed in initiatives or negotiations where his ability and experience could open the road to positive contribution  to the achievement of peaceful solutions.228.	Our Organization has given a warm welcome to Zimbabwe and to Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  two new States which have joined the United Nations  thus stressing again its universality. My delegation is extremely pleased to tender its welcome to the new Members of our Organization.229.	Now  may I pay a very warm tribute to the history of two brother peoples: Bolivia and Peru. This is the second time that Bolivia has been called upon to speak in the General Assembly at a memorable moment in the history of our two countries. Yesterday we commemorated the immolation of Admiral Miguel Grau on the bridge of the warship Huascar. The figure of Admiral Grau is loved and respected by the people of Bolivia. His glorious feats performed in an unequal battle on the coasts of Angamos  in defence of part of the Bolivian coastline  are a symbol and a mandate that the people of Bolivia will never forget.230.	My country  land-locked in the centre of South America  with a diverse geography which is a challenge to the creative imagination of man  struggled with a history at once turbulent and heroic. It would appear that our mysterious and changing landscape has been reflected in the past of a small but proud nation  determined to overcome the vicissitudes that fate had in store for it.231.	That turbulent history is not only due to the slow and painful apprenticeship of a young nation: foreign interference was also a fundamental factor in hindering the Bolivians' ability to win from fate a successful  just and free country.232.	Now  quite recently  we have witnessed a profound change in the domestic order. The Government  under the leadership of General Luis Garcia Meza  was born of the resignation of the former President  Lydia Gueiler. An untenable situation  bearing the seeds of total destruction  led the head of the country at that time to hand over public office to the head of the armed forces of the nation. Consequently  it was not a coup dâÃ©tat  it was rather a very difficult transition from the chaos in which the Republic found itself to the order and freedom required by all Bolivians.233.	Events have been deliberately distorted. Discrimination in the treatment of our country has shown us how in the world today principles of justice and equality can be distorted in accordance with sectarian interests. But this does not frighten us. We are convinced of the justice of our cause. We have acted in accordance with the dictates of a profound and sincere nationalism.234.	My people is a witness to the fact that we are acting with prudence and exceptional tolerance  that three abortive elections revealed in their outcome the characteristics of fraud and cheating  with the encouragement of outside influences that tried to prepare the way for adventurers and demagogues.235.	That was why the people were happy to accept the established authority and voluntarily supported the crusade of national reconstruction. Thus the Government of National Reconstruction has achieved unchallengeable legitimacy.236.	The people of Bolivia have deeply engrained principles of democracy. A state of life based on those ideals cannot be replaced by the mere holding of spurious elections. Democracy is far more than that. It is the mutual respect and converging interests of majorities and minorities. It is the rule of law. It is the people organized to undertake great common enterprises. It is the co-ordinated work of the entire social corpus of the country to achieve an atmosphere of peace  justice and freedom.237.	This is our concept of democracy  with special characteristics that allow a country with different races  customs and languages  and with completely different outlooks to merge them. Bolivians have to make efforts  and they are doing so  to create that democratic model that is just in the political  economic and social spheres  with full solidarity and respecting the interests of all parts and of the whole. Together with that concept is one that is born of the unshake-able determination to dignify the human person  to ensure respect for his spirit and future  to assure to each individual his right to freedom  justice  education and the benefits deriving from culture  work and just payment for itâin sum  a task that will allow the individual to enhance himself and widen and improve the atmosphere in which he lives.238.	To protect those fundamental freedoms of mankind  we must act within the confines of the law  so that a few will not overshadow and endanger the future of the others and assume an authoritarian attitude that is alien to the feelings of the nation.239.	Bolivia has been a victim of flagrant interventions. It would appear that minorities are to be favoured  however small they are  when trying to achieve public power  with imperialist attitudes  receiving assistance from great and small  from nearby and distant interests  distorting and misinterpreting the events and thus trying to maintain them-selves- in power.240.	The Government of Bolivia is firmly determined to practise tolerance and to live in peace with all nations of the world  as the Charter of the United Nations so wisely states in its notable Preamble; but there have been certain acts which turn back the hands of time in an attempt to revive colonialist intentions which seemed to have been left behind for ever.241.	The tasks imposed upon themselves by the armed forces of Bolivia in filling the vacuum created by corruption  fraud  uncertainty and the divisive actions of extremism are obviously to meet the imperative needs of rebuilding the nation. We must set our country back on the road to progress  and this can be achieved only by the re-establishment of individual guarantees  social justice  the rule of fruitful and creative work and  over and above all  the formation of a new civic awareness which will return to the Bolivian his faith in his future.242.	With efforts and sacrifices  we have arrived at the time of reconstruction  and therefore the Government of Bolivia is determined to change structures  and it has started transformations of an institutional nature to ensure to the citizens  to whatever level of society they belong  full participation in the management of public interests. We intend to guarantee a system of life that will safeguard the democratic values of my people. On this matter the President of Bolivia has stated:""The strengthening of the cultural and historical traditions of the Bolivian people and its constant will to achieve social progress and transformation will be the basis on which we shall build a national democracy with popular participation.""In the construction of this new institutional reality  the world must know that the armed forces of the nation  together with its people  will never again fall prey to fraudulent elections and the foreign involvement that paralysed our political and institutional life.""244.	The task is gigantic. The road to be followed leads to a certain goal: that of a free  just and sovereign nation with hopes for a better future. Furthermore  the temporary function assumed by the armed forces of Bolivia aims at a true restoration of democracyânot just a formal oneâand thus at the participation of the people of Bolivia in an effective and efficient way in the construction of the country's future  with an electoral system and the establishment of parties which guarantee respect for the plurality of ideologies.245.	The failure of the pseudo-democratic experiments has created only institutional instability  domestic frustration and a loss of credibility abroad with regard to our potential and our possibilities as a modern  free and sovereign State.246.	Our resolve is to create a political model in keeping with the characteristics of the Bolivian nation. We also firmly intend to reject any interference  pressure or adventurism. It is a matter of pride for the Bolivians that they should manage their own affairs  and the Government of National Reconstruction is acting accordingly. Imperialist or neo- colonialist positions will not reflect this ardent determination. However small peoples may be  when they pursue vital and just causes they inexorably triumph.247.	Thus  Bolivia is not going to interrupt its march towards a future of happiness. In these times through which the nation is living  despite the organized calumnious attacks on our Government  we are taking a positive forward step towards the reorganization of the nation. The concept of national reconstruction is not merely a promise or a circumstantial goal. It is an historical imperative to return to the country a collective awareness and pride of direct participation in the life of the nation.248.	Fortunately  many important countries of the world have been able to comprehend the popular massive will of the Bolivian people  our sacrifices and our concern  and our decision in true autonomy to follow the road traced for us by destiny. We pay a tribute to those countries  because they are thus correctly interpreting the most noble principles of international coexistence.249.	I should not have added anything to what I have just said  but the repeated accusations  all false and one-sided  concerning violations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which govern coexistence in civilized societies  force me to point to certain situations that have arisen in my country and on this matter to make public the view of my Government.250.	However  before doing so  we must admit  if we do not wish to run the risk of becoming naive or of blindly and stubbornly believing misinformation  that there are moments of upheaval in the lives of peoples. Transition often makes it impossible to preserve order  and therefore to restore it is imperative to put an end to the violence that is unleashed and the anarchy that is rampant through the exercise of authority.251.	Furthermore  we know that it is very easy  in matters of human rights  to criticize and to demand  even though the critics themselves are obviously guilty of having violated those very rights. But this distorted viewpoint  very often maliciously exploited  cannot provide a smokescreen to allow the shirking of responsibilities in matters of human rights. It is not going to be allowed to do so  for it is the will of the Government to live within the law  so that these actions will serve the purposes of the law  and  in the words of a great Bolivian  this is the only servitude that does not humiliate.252.	We must not live under conditions of subterfuge and misinformation. The armed forces took the responsibility of leading the nation because they were forced to do so by the need to correct the existing pseudo-democracy and anarchy. We could hardly fall into the same pretence  since we know that it leads to nothing positive or substantially permanent in the country.253.	Bolivia is determined to play the true role in international life  which it must by reason of its history and geo-graphical location. That exceptional location makes Bolivia a very important factor within the framework of Latin America  which is now seeking the development of a unified personality. The geo-political situation of Bolivia has given it a multiple interrelationship with five Latin American nations  and thus it has become a meeting ground of interests which move it nearer to all its neighbours and give meaning to the fact that  as was said many years ago  ""Bolivia is the land of contacts"".254.	My country stands full square among those nations that wish to consolidate the national State through the creation of a political  economic and social model that will fulfil its own characteristics and peculiarities without foreign interference and without adopting ideologies that will distort the aspirations and the feelings of the Latin American people.255.	The nationalism practiced by the Government of National Reconstruction in Bolivia is not exclusive to the nascent Latin American nationalism that is manifested in the region's many efforts at integration. The Government of National Reconstruction continues an integrationist policy that is well defined  since we consider that political differences must not hinder  because of current circumstances  any possibility of continental unity. We endeavour to follow an independent international line based solely on the permanent interests of the Republic itself.256.	Furthermore  we reaffirm our absolute adherence to the purposes and principles of the United Nations  particularly those concerning the legal equality of States  respect for the self-determination of peoples  the obligation not to interfere in the domestic affairs of other States  international co-operation  and determined action to maintain international peace and security by encouraging relations of friendship that are indispensable among nations if we are to achieve civilized and peaceful coexistence.257.	The position of my Government concerning international policies is defined in the recent statement made by the President of Bolivia  General Luis Garcia Meza. The Government of National Reconstruction reiterates its respect for international agreements and maintains relations with all countries of the world in conditions-of reciprocal respect for ideological pluralism  self-determination of peoples and the sovereignty of States.258.	Ours is a position of anti-colonialism and non- alignment. It is a position of solidarity with the dependent countries of the world and a rejection of all forms of racial discrimination.259.	The Government of National Reconstruction not only adheres to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  we intend to give real meaning in social terms to its principles which must not simply remain formulas of international pressure. As far as we are concerned  those principles must guarantee to men and peoples the right not to be exploited and the right to build up their capacity to overcome misery and backwardness.260.	While enjoying the best relations with the Powers of the West  and more especially with the countries of our continent  the Government of National Reconstruction of the Armed Forces is extremely interested in strengthening our relations with the socialist countries  whose experience in moving ahead from levels of backwardness similar to ours can be very useful to countries like Bolivia  aside from any political and ideological considerations.261.	The Government of National Reconstruction is deeply interested  too  in the achievement of a new international economic order  and we contend that continental integration is a means of freeing our people and not an instrument for a pseudo-democratic continuation of dependency.262.	We wish to stress the geo-political role of our country in its multiple effects on all the regions  sub regions and basins within the political diversity that constitutes an accepted principle of international coexistence. In our attitude in favour of integration  we are interested  obviously  in the Andean region  whose human and natural centre lies in Bolivia and the basins of the Rio Plata and the Amazon  as well as the Pacific area  of which we are historically  naturally and undeniably sovereign participants.263.	Thus we reaffirm an unshakable Bolivian policy  which sums up the fervour of a people and seeks to redress an injustice: the return of my country to the sea.264.	The nations of America agreed with this when  at the ninth session of the General Assembly of the Organization of American States  they adopted resolution 426  which offers Bolivia continental solidarity and urges negotiations on a sovereign access by my country to the Pacific Ocean. Thus  at this international meeting  I wish to express my gratitude and thanks to our brothers in the inter-American system and to express our hope that those efforts will be continued with greater vigour and thus meet the dictates of international justice.265.	These days bring to our attention another zone that creates tensionâthe Middle East. The decisive influence of energy-producing resources on the world economy has led to confrontations that are designed to perpetuate dependency and flaunt peaceful coexistence and the combining of interests.266.	Bolivia  whose own natural resources were the object of long exploitation for unilateral benefits  considers that we must guarantee respect for the interests of peoples that have  with their raw materials  created the wealth of the powerful. Thus we will avoid greater hatred and events that could well shake the very foundations of our society.267.	The situation in the Middle East also touches on the need to achieve peaceful coexistence on the well-known basis  which Bolivia supports  of respecting the rights of the Palestinian people and the right of Israel to assure its lasting life as a sovereign nation.268.	From that standpoint  we reiterate our belief that only civilized dialogue can be employed to overcome the difficulties that confront the Middle East.269.	At a moment when the world is watching a most painful armed confrontation that is draining the blood of two peoples  Bolivia reaffirms its vocation as a peaceful nation and demands from the United Nations firm and prompt action to put an end to that ghastly and tragic conflict.270. Bolivia shares the suffering of those countries which in their regional struggles  incited by hegemonic centres  are paying their painful tribute to universal peace.271.	Famine  ignorance and  in brief  general poverty  cause greater tension than the nuclear threat  the arms race or racial intolerance. Inequality should be the concern of mankind  now disunited by the prosperity of the few  a mankind faced by the yearning of the majority for a better life. This is both a problem and a challenge that we must take up bravely and with determination  because justice demands that we do so.272.	In our concept of development we give pride of place to the achievement of true economic independence so as to wipe out the relations of dependency that some countries would like to perpetuate.273.	The crisis in which the international community finds itself today has shown incontrovertibly the flaws in the present international economic order. The consequences of such a crisis are particularly unfavourable for the countries of the third world  dangerously aggravating and multiplying the problems of their underdevelopment. In the light of that desperate situation  it is imperative that a series of steps be taken internationally within the framework of the United Nations in order to find a way of restructuring international economic relations.274.	In the General Assembly in 1974 the international community  with historic perspective and vision  solemnly proclaimed its determination to work with the necessary urgency to establish a new international economic order. Today more than ever the peoples of the third world  the peoples which are suffering  are fully aware of their right to conditions of life in keeping with human dignity. The privileged nations under the present order can no longer deny them that right.275.	Bolivia recognizes supports as instruments of that new order the International Development Strategy and the global negotiations on international economic cooperation and co-operation among the developing countries.276.	Unfortunately  six years after the proclamation of that new order and despite arduous preparatory efforts  the international community has just seen another failure in international co-operation. The eleventh special session of the General Assembly did not have the desired results: it did not adopt the International Development Strategy  nor did it launch the global negotiations.277.	However  my country still believes it to be the responsibility of this Assembly to overcome those obstacles and increase the possibility of taking a great step towards the establishment of a new concept of international cooperation.278.	The developing countries have decided to make a joint effort to establish a system of co-operation among their peoples to give new content to the spirit of solidarity among the countries of the third world.279.	In the more specific sphere of raw materials it must be noted that  despite the fact that the international community has approved principles of policy and the machinery of operation  some States have persisted in the unilateral practice of placing on the international market non-commercial reserves of minerals  as in the case of lead  which has adverse effects on the economies of the producer countries.280.	Bolivia reaffirms its faith in the San Francisco Charter. The United Nations  overcoming tremendous obstacles  has persisted unceasingly and unswervingly in its efforts to preserve peace.281.	Bolivia sees peace as the result of solidarity and co-operation  rather than as the mere absence of confrontation. We must not only avoid international conflicts but also guarantee the future of the inhabitants of each continent  each country and each region of the world. We cannot justify our continued effort to eliminate collective violence unless we try also to eradicate misunderstanding  violations of the human person and the denial of freedom. Without freedom there can be no guarantee of justice.282.	I have expressed the views of a nation which is courageously facing its future. That courage can be seen in its decision to build a country enriched by work  respected for the practice of justice  adorned by culture and ennobled by its faith in the solidarity of mankind."
"18",945,"BRA",35,1980,"ï»¿Mr. President  may I offer you the first compliments in this general debate. I do so with sincere satisfaction and in the certainty that my words will be a part of a general expression of recognition of the qualifications which so well entitle you to provide the leadership in the work that we are about to begin. With you in the Chair  we have every certainty that the debates on the items to be dealt with at this session will be conducted in an efficient and equitable fashion.3.	Before going any further  I should like to express my thanks to the President of the thirty-fourth session  Mr. Salim A. Salim  who was repeatedly called upon during the past year to give us the benefit of his guidance in diverse and complex situations. It is fitting here to recall once more his impressive performance at the head of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  a task that he performed with wisdom and prudence.4.	I take this opportunity of welcoming two new Members of our community of nations  the Republic of Zimbabwe and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  and I congratulate you and the Assembly on this occasion. Both countries have our best wishes for a future of progress and peace.5.	It is particularly auspicious to see among us the delegation of Zimbabwe  as that means the culmination of a long process of struggle. When I recently visited that country  brief as my stay was  I could appreciate the spirit with which its Government and people face the task of building a society both just and efficient.6.	We again welcome the delegation of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  whose presence in this Organization is an effective contribution to the consolidation of the principles of self-determination and independence among the Caribbean nations. Its admission will enrich the group of Latin American States  where it will be fraternally received.7.	In opening this general debate  I reaffirm my country's commitment to the general principles of international conduct which are prescribed in the Charter of the United Nations and which are the heart and soul of this Assembly. Brazil will dedicate its best efforts to the preservation of international peace and security  to cooperation for development and to the promotion of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms  without any distinction as to race  language or religion  just as the Charter of our Organization provides.8.	It is difficult  unfortunately  to find causes for optimism in the present world situation. Since last year  tensions that have already caused mankind so much anxiety have grown still stronger; risks of upsetting world peace have become far more grave; the world economic crisis has become more severe; and famine and poverty persist  with their accompaniment of deep imbalances among nations. There is little reason for us to be proud of or even to accept the present state of things in the community of nations.9.	The process of international decision-making has itself too often proved short-sighted. That process  shaped in an era prior to decolonization and to the global spread of economic and political problems  and unchanged in its essence  has shown itself to be painfully defective. At the political level  it reflects and reinforces the imbalances which so much affect the lives of our peoples. It fails to include the participation of new political forces. Its centralizing character does not reflect the philosophy of our Charter  and as a result has become unworkable. On the one hand  an important and essentially positive development has taken place in recent history: no single country  no condominium of Powers  has the ability effectively to control events in the different regions of the world. On the other hand  the use that the main Powers make of their strength  which is still tolerated by the international order  is inadequate to the new realities and needs of the world. Those Powers continue to think and act according to specific strategic interests; they continue to show perplexity and immobility regarding the crucial problems of peace and development; they continue to magnify regional tensions instead of contributing effectively to the resolution of the root causes of such tensions.10.	Neither the ideal of justice nor the recent course of events allows us to suppose that the maintenance of the present international order may lead to peace and prosperity. We have become used to references to interdependence in the world of today. At times  however  we have the feeling that no attention is paid to the fact that that word obviously conveys the idea of reciprocity. Interdependence is a two way road. Its political dimension is mutual respect among nations. Its institutional foundations lie in universal obedience to the principles of the Charter  such as equal sovereignty among States  self-determination  non-intervention and the peaceful settlement of disputes. There is no need here for further definition and qualification. Equality means equality  sovereignty means sovereignty and non-intervention means non-intervention. It is necessary for those basic principles to be observed in their entirety by ail Members of our community  for quibbling about their implementation means adding new and serious threats to already tense international relations.11.	That means that no country  however strong  can presume to legislate to the world  as if it were a kind of overlord. That means that matters which affect everyone must be decided by all  and those which relate to the life of only one country must be decided by that country alone. That means that the international system must not be vertical and centralizing  that the international decision-making process regarding issues of global interest needs to be opened to the wide and representative participation of the community of nations.12.	There is no better channel for dealing with world problems than dialogue and the effort to defuse tensions as they arise. A mature attitude is needed. The so often illusory prospects and temptations of immediate gains which characterize confrontation strategies should be resisted. Beyond immediate concerns  self-discipline and courage are required if we are to talk and negotiate rationally and objectively. A mistake frequently made is to believe that public opinion in each country and at the international level is incapable of perceiving the long-term common interests. There is no serious reason to prevent the more powerful States from adhering to truly common goals  while they use their imagination and wisdom to move beyond routine approaches.13.	In the context of the recent increase in tension  it is encouraging to note the political ability demonstrated by Western Europe and by the third world. The developing countries with their voice and their vote in the General Assembly have clearly shown the importance they attach to respect for the basic principles of international law and their determination not to be used as pawns on the chessboard of crisis. They have reaffirmed their faith in non-intervention in dialogue and in the relaxation of tension. They have demonstrated  and surely will continue to demonstrate  a will to play a constructive role  each acting in accordance with its particular situation.14.	We are appealing to precisely that constructive approach and spirit of international cooperation. We do not restrict ourselves to the criticism of attitudes and the denunciation of injustice. We are ready to cooperate in the establishment of a more just and effective international order. My country  within the limits of its resources  has given repeated demonstrations to that effect. We are committed to fostering a climate of trust among nations; we are always alert to the possibilities of cooperation on an egalitarian basis; we repudiate the formation of Power blocs; we seek to give a forward thrust to existing opportunities for development. We have the right to expect the United Nations to work effectively for the creation of a better future  one of peace and prosperity  free of hegemonies  intervention or war.15.	The wide-ranging work of our Organization requires the adoption of an equitable scale of priorities in the consideration of the problems we must face. But peace and development are inseparable goals. No distinction should be made between them. Peaceânot a state of precarious balance among heavily armed nations  but indeed a just and reliable international orderâwill never be attained without development. Developmentânot just economic growth in some areas  but indeed the redressing of the grave imbalances among nationsâcan be a realistic undertaking only if peace prevails.16.	The quantitative and qualitative increase in the nuclear arsenals of the great Powers continues to pose a paradoxical contrast with the unmistakable desire of the immense majority of nations to live in peace. It is embarrassing to see that the concentration of scientific and technological knowledge of those Powers is being wasted on research in and development of constantly improving deadly devices. New strategies are planned with a sinister logic  as if it were possible to survive a nuclear war.17.	The new momentum in multilateral discussions on disarmament arising from the commitments entered into at the tenth special session of the General Assembly has met with reluctance on the part of countries with intercontinental offensive power. Nevertheless  the Committee on Disarmament  a body which has our fully participation and support  has kept on trying  only to be blocked by an inversion of priorities which postpones the consideration of nuclear disarmament in all its forms.18.	The ninth session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea has adjourned at Geneva on 29 August last with significant results to its credit. However  there are still gaps in the informal text  of the draft articles which are to become the future convention  and additional efforts will be required in order to improve upon it. If the constructive spirit  serenity  and sense of collective responsibility which we have advocated throughout the Conference are allowed to prevail  we trust they will result in the adoption by consensus of a well-balanced charter of the seas that will guarantee the interests of coastal States and give substance to the principle of the common heritage of mankind in the international seabed area.19.	Like the overwhelming majority of nations  Brazil deplores the haste of countries which  in the course of negotiations  have enacted unilateral legislation on the exploitation of resources of the seabed beyond national jurisdiction. Such acts bring undue pressure to bear on the negotiations and contravene resolutions of this Organization and should  therefore  be repudiated by the international community.20.	In our own region of Latin America this is a period of disturbance  but the prevailing trends are essentially positive. Relations among Latin American nations are deepening and there is more room for them to cooperate with each other as equals on the basis of balanced and mutual advantage.21.	Thanks fundamentally to the operation of endogenous factors  a new and dynamic Latin American reality is being created. Political and economic stagnation is being replaced by a more complex situation  one richer in opportunities for change. Diplomacy is increasingly active and the strengthening of a network of bilateral dialogues certainly facilitates the launching of new Latin American regional efforts and the building of a more homogeneous  more creative stand for the region in its comprehensive debate with the rest of the world.22.	Brazil's stance is that regional unity should be based on the purposeful exploitation of the countless affinities among our countries. It also depends on the mature and balanced recognition of the political  economic and cultural diversities existing among us. Latin American unity is a project for democratic  egalitarian and mutually trusting coexistence among our countries. Such unity rejects hegemonies  interventions  axes or blocs.23.	President Joao Figueiredo has pledged himself to provide additional impetus for these positive trends and to increase his contacts with other heads of State in Latin America. During the last 12 months the President of Brazil has paid official visits to Caracas  Asuncion and Buenos Aires and in turn has been the host in Brazil of President Morales Bertnudez of Peru  President Lopez Portillo of Mexico and President Gorge Videla of Argentina. Brazil thus participates with its sister nations in the common effort for the construction of a truly operative and dynamic understanding among the Latin American nations.24.	In the course of the present session we will be celebrating the twentieth anniversary of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  a basic instrument for the affirmation of the right to self-determination  sovereignty and independence.25.	We must now concentrate on the questions of Namibia and of the elimination of apartheid in South Africa  lest we face the continuing frustration of those peoples there and of all of us at the United Nations. Every effort must be made to ensure that prompt and fruitful results are gained from the work accumulated throughout these years at the United Nations towards a solution for the problem of Namibia  those people are represented by the South West Africa People's Organization. The risk we have been running since Security Council resolution 435 (1978) was adopted two years ago is that of having placed too much trust in negotiations that have not developed in accordance with legitimate expectations.26.	The persistence of military aggressions conducted by the Government of South Africa against Angola and Zambia is unacceptable. Political contrivances such as the installation of the so-called national assembly of Windhoek are also unacceptable. The very latest exchange of messages with the Secretary General betrays the evasive and delaying attitude of South Africa. In this  as in other problems pending on our agenda  the position of the Organization of African Unity [OAU] and  in particular  that of the frontline States  is fundamental inasmuch as  on 2 June last  they have reaffirmed at Lusaka the priority they accord to the question of Namibia on the basis of documents already adopted by the United Nations.27.	The responsibly of this Organization for the preservation of international peace and security does not allow us to ignore the present escalation of intransigence  arbitrariness and violence which render the prospects for peace in the Middle East increasingly remote.28.	Particularly serious are the implications of certain measuresârecently adopted or announcedâof consolidation of illegal occupation and of formal annexation of territories taken by force. The Security Council has already firmly expressed in its resolution 478 (1980)  its universal rejection of the measures which purport unilaterally to modify the status of the City of Jerusalem.29.	In connexion with the establishment of the basis for a comprehensive  just and lasting peace  Brazil reaffirms that it is indispensable for the consensus to prevail so as to ensure the following: the complete withdrawal of occupying forces from all Arab territories; the exercise of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to return to their homeland  to self-determination  to independence and to sovereignty in Palestine in accordance with the Charter and the relevant United Nations resolutions; the participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO] in peace negotiations; and the recognition of the right of all States in the region to exist within recognized boundaries.30.	We can also expect the Council to provide a more complete and appropriate framework for the Consideration of the question  in which the rights of the Palestinian people are duly recognized.31.	I also wish to make a particular reference to the tragic situation in Lebanon  the country of origin of so many Brazilians who have greatly contributed to our national life. Lebanon deserves our full solidarity  and its independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity must be preserved.32.	When I addressed the General Assembly last war. I noted that the world economy entered the decade of the 1980s in a state of generalized uncertainty.' The aggravation of the global economic situation  throughout the last 12 months  only strengthens the evidence that we are all facing an entirely new situation in qualitative terms.33.	We are going through much more than a simple transitory stage  that of a slackening of the rate of growth of world output and of a simultaneous increase of inflationary tensions  There is a profound and comprehensive system wide network crisis which affects industrialized economies and accentuates the distortions and imbalances of their relations with the developing world.34.	The so-called ""energy crisis""  as central as it may be today in our concerns and as dramatic as may be its economic impact  should be recognized for what it really is: not as something accidental or exogenous  but as a component part of an underlying structural crisis of a broader and more lasting nature. The energy problem is felt essentially in the North South dimension. Therefore  in order to be effective  its solution can be sought only within the context of efforts aimed at a global revision of the relations between highly developed countries and the developing world as a whole.35.	This finds eloquent proof in the factâwhich no one would dare denyâthat developing countries have recently assumed an increasing and even decisive role in the fabric of the international economy  either as providers of raw materials  as markets  as increasingly competitive industrial suppliers  as areas for new investments or as users of capital often lacking alternatives for application in developed economies which are either in a state of stagnation or reduced growth.36.	This role of the third world has been attained not because the world markets have become more responsive to the aspirations and needs of the developing countries  but in fact it was achieved despite persistent and. in many cases  increasing obstacles such as the new and more effective forms of protectionism  the transferral of inflationary tensions and the generalized increase of interest rates in capital markets.37.	In the last few years  the third world has been a weights factor in sustaining the level of economic activity of the developed world. Nevertheless  possibly under the pressure of its own difficulties  seen from the narrow viewpoint of the present state of affairs  the developed world has. in practice  adopted an increasingly distant attitude towards the problems of underdevelopment. It is obvious in the summit meetings of the so-called ""Seven"" and in several multilateral forums that less attention has been given to the structural problems of the North South relationship  and an attitude has become prevalent which practically limits itself to considering marginal measures and to assigning the responsibility for the evils that now afflict the world economy to increases in the price of oil.38.	Another and more subtle expression of the aloofness of the North towards the South is the attempt to introduce restrictive categories for developing countries  grouping them according to level of income or industrialization or classifying them either as importers or exporters of oil. An entire conceptual arsenal is being put together to bolster this effort to produce divisive and diversionary effects. In fact  this categorization is just one more proof of the protectionist attitude of the developed world and of its lack of interest in grasping the problem of underdevelopment in its entirety  with all its economic  technological and social aspects.39.	It is time to realize that the full  true integration of developing countries into the international economy cannot be brought about by imposing upon them an institutional framework which is unilaterally predetermined by the major economic Powers but  rather  can be achieved only by allowing them adequate access to decision-making processes for the problems affecting the international economic situation. It is an illusion to presume that in the new international scene which we face it is possible to maintain privileged structures and  at the same time  solve global problems. The attempt to preserve obsolete structures of domination over international flows in matters of trade  finance and technology can only prolong and even aggravate the present difficulties. In the world today  the exercise of power is contradictory with the objectives of prosperity. The time has come for us to interpret anew the ties between nations of the North and the South and to replace the rhetorical affirmation of interdependence with the practical construction of mutuality.40.	In order to do so  the developed countries must recognize that solutions will not spring spontaneously from piecemeal deliberations in different multilateral agencies and forums if the present elitist decision-making structures are maintained and operational criteria remain unaltered. These might have been adequate in the past  but they no longer serve their purpose. The essential meaning of the so-called ""global negotiations"" is precisely that of offering to all of us what may be one last chance to seek an integrated and harmonious set of measures to reformulate the North South relationship. This opportunity can materialize only if we are able to undertake the urgent task of devising a political thrust which can generate from the universal forumâthat of the General Assembly of the United Nationsâsignificant modifications in multilateral economic institutions  so as to make them more open to the participation of the developing countries and more receptive to their specific needs.41.	Therefore  the Brazilian Government cannot conceal its grave concern regarding the stalemate which occurred a few days ago during the eleventh special session of the General Assembly. In our opinion  the failure to launch global negotiations is not in any way compensated for by the existence of a consensus reached on the text of a new International Development Strategy.  Such a text  as my Government sees it  is not satisfactory  for it does not even take into account substantive progress related to previous agreements reached in other bodies  and it will still be subject to reservations and declarations of a restrictive or interpretative nature from the developed countries.42.	A most meaningful fact is that the third world has been able to preserve its fundamental sense of unity  despite the legitimate differences in interest which might occasionally arise and regardless of external pressure  as I have mentioned.43.	The present crisis necessarily leads to an increasing unity among the nations of Latin America  Africa and Asia in a common effort to revise the patterns of their relationship with the North. However  the crisis does not cease to present us with renewed challenges and obstacles. Our unity should be continuously reaffirmed and reinvigorated even more so when the effortâlegitimate in itselfâto increase the value of scarce and non-renewable resources causes effects of a dramatic nature in other developing countries.44.	The time has come for us to deploy  within the South South relationship  an intensified effort to diversify and enlarge the bases of understanding and cooperation. Concrete  substantive and effective flows of trade and financing among developing countries must be added to the political ties and to the common platforms in the North South context.45.	The industrial  technological and financial potential which now exists in the third worldâadded  of course  to its immense natural and human resourcesâopens to the nations of the three developing continents broad prospects of a fruitful direct relationship  avoiding the often politically or economically onerous procedure of going through the main centres. The challenge before us is  in short  to create for the third world a profile of its own  based on its internal reality and dynamism  and not merely on the expression of the differences between us and the developed nations.46.	Success in this truly pioneer effort of establishing ties of effective partnership among developing countries rests on a clear political commitment. Only the common will to draw closer will allow us to reach concrete results. Such a decision must be as firm as the difficulties are great in establishing ties among nations like ours  which for a long time have remained far apart and which  even today  are predominantly orientedâin the economic and financial fieldsâ towards the great industrial centres.47.	Brazil  for its part  fully trusts that the nations of the South will be able to take advantage of the present difficulties in order to reaffirm their own personality  strengthen and enrich their unity and solidarityâan element indispensable for the success of their struggle to overcome underdevelopmentâand revise the terms of their relationship with the industrialized North.48.	These are in the main  the remarks that I want to make on behalf of the delegation of Brazil as the debate at the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly opens.49.	If throughout all these years we have reiterated our concerns  it is because the march of international events proceeds at an inexorable and even accelerated pace  while solutions lag behind. Therefore  our work cannot but reflect the ever-growing problems and the shortcomings of the international decision-making process. It is fitting that my delegation stress that it awaits the day when contentious subjects in our annual agenda are replaced by matters of common cooperation and understanding.50.	Throughout the three months of work before us the delegation of Brazil will spare no effort to help create better conditions for participation and international dialogue  in the certainty that the United Nations is still the most adequate instrument at the disposal of the international community for the achievement of the objectives of peace and development."
"19",989,"BRB",35,1980,"ï»¿We meet at a time when the world economic outlook  both immediate and longer term  is depressingly bleak. On the political front  discussions on detente are deadlocked. There is a continuing escalation in the build-up of arms. Disputes between nations  particularly in the third world  are increasingly characterized by recourse to arms rather than being solved by the use of the machinery for peaceful settlement provided in the Charter.40.	It is a time which demands of each nation  of each one of us  the expression of genuine concern which you  Mr. President  have continuously shown for the aims and spirit of the Charter of the United Nations. Your election to the presidency of this Organization is indeed opportune  and should be the harbinger of that commitment which is demanded of us if we are  in an atmosphere of compromise  to find satisfactory answers to the issues which face the thirty-fifth session. Barbados is sure that the experience and wisdom you bring to this task will help us to fashion solutions for the daunting problems confronting our nations in the 1980s.41.	It is fitting to record here our gratitude to the outgoing President  Mr. Salim  for the attention and dedication which he devoted to the critical issues which arose during his term of office. His performance has been a credit not only to him and to this Organization  but to his country  the United Republic of Tanzania  as well.42.	It must have been a source of deep personal regret to him that patience  diplomatic skill and an attitude of compromise did not provide a sufficient catalyst to bring to a successful conclusion the eleventh special session of the General Assembly. The reasons for the failure of that session are historically more deep-seated.43.	Two years ago  at our thirty-third session  I made reference to the fact that proposals for the transformation of certain inherited  outmoded economic structures which were stunting the economic development of third-world countries were continually being discussed in numerous forums  but no real progress was being achieved. I said then:""We cannot accept that relations among nations should continue to be conducted on the basis of a 'zero-sum' principle  which assumes that the extent of a country's increase in the enjoyment of goods and services is equal to the loss of goods and services enjoyed by other countries ....""Developed countries  in the negotiations for a new international economic order  are still preoccupied with looking at quantifiable variables. Consequently they conclude that  since the relationship between the developed and the developing countries is asymmetrical  with a preponderance of economic power weighted in favour of the developed countries  then it is possible to continue ad infinitum an international system of dependency without full and fair participation by the developing countries . .. ."" 44.	Events  expressed attitudes and the continued lack of progress during the past year in the North-South dialogue confirm this assessment. The crisis in international economic relations continues. We have once again failed in a special session of this Organization to make any further progress towards eliminating the dangerous and debilitating economic chasm between developed and developing countries. And the chasm is widening the longer we fail to act. In spite of the depressing economic prospects which the world faces  and at a time when the world economy is in a state of deep crisis  a number of developed countries stand fast behind their ramparts and refuse to exercise the political will and firm commitment needed to deal with a dire and dangerous situation.45.	Continued refusal to take positive action to restructure and revitalize the global economy by establishing a more equitable  just and stable international economic order will certainly multiply  not diminish  the problems which at present face us. Because of the undoubted interdependency of the world in which we live  all countries will suffer from further stagnation unless the fundamental changes envisaged under the New International Economic Order are agreed on without further delay. Enlightened self-interest demands of the North a positive decision.46.	A year ago my delegation emphasized from this rostrum that the only way to rescue the world economy was to initiate immediately a full  constructive and genuine dialogue on the vital issues of structural change  energy  trade and monetary reform. We also warned that any negotiations implicit in such a dialogue must be serious and meaningful if they were to result in a satisfactory resolution of the issues involved. It was precisely within such a context that my delegation readily supported General Assembly resolution 34/138  with the aim of launching at the special session in 1980 a round of global and sustained negotiations on international economic co-operation. This Organization was unable to launch those negotiations because of the intransigence of a number of the developed countries during the preparatory phase as well as during the special session itself. Despite their declared support for such negotiations and despite their expressed recognition of the interdependence of the issues involved  those countries continue to refuse to accept or agree on the structural changes necessary to improve the international economic system. Rather  they t persist in offering minimum incremental modifications to the existing structure in the hope of destroying the solidarity of the developing countries on this vital question of fundamental structural change.47.	The time has certainly come when such myopic and selfish conduct in international economic relations must cease. For we cannot be expected to respect and have confidence in our partners in negotiations of any kindâlet alone negotiations on fundamental structural change in international economic relationsâwhen they behave in such a manner. Nor can we engage in any serious and meaningful negotiations when there is distrust of our colleagues in the negotiations.48.	My delegation believes that  despite the failure at the special session to launch the global negotiations  we still have a reasonable opportunity at this current session to achieve that goal. However  a pre-condition of the successful achievement of the goal must be a genuine willingness and honest commitment on the part of all Governments to accept the urgent need to work earnestly and collectively for fundamental structural changes in the current international economic system.49.	For some countries this will mean the abandonment of certain entrenched positions which they currently hold. For others there must be a willingness to consider procedural devices which are in harmony with the content and spirit of General Assembly resolution 34/138. The resolution explicitly states that the negotiations should proceed in a simultaneous manner in order to ensure a coherent and integrated approach to the major issues of raw materials  energy  trade  development  money and finance. The resolution further states that the negotiations should not involve any interruption of  or have any adverse effect upon  the negotiations in other United Nations forums.50.	The proposals contained in the Chairman's revised text on the procedures and time-frame for the global negotiations  are clear. We believe that the fears and concerns expressed by those developed countries which have blocked a potential consensus on the paper are unfounded. Contrary to the views expressed by them  the suggested procedures do not in any way seek to undermine or impair the integrity of any of the specialized agencies. Those agencies will still be involved in the negotiations in accordance with their respective competence.51.	We remain convinced of the need for the global negotiations called for in resolution 34/138. My delegation therefore appeals to the Governments of the Federal Republic of Germany  -the United Kingdom and the United States of America to reconsider their positions with a view to permitting this Assembly to complete the unfinished business of its eleventh special session. We cannot afford to delay any longer.52.	It is certainly not beyond the ingenuity of us all to devise stratagems to solve problems which may superficially appear intractable. Surely there is a lesson to be learnt from the part played by the Commonwealth of nations in the negotiations which finally ensured the emergence of a free and independent Zimbabwe. During those negotiations  at the moment when hope of success appeared most forlorn  it was a final initiative of frank and direct discussions by heads of Government themselves at Lusaka which broke the impasse and led to what is perhaps the most spectacular peace settlement of the decade.53.	Let us not  if we genuinely desire to make progress on the economic front  hesitate to adopt this precedent as a parallel device  thus enabling world leaders  shielded from the public and the press  to exchange ideas  explain their unique difficulties and problems  reach compromises and advance proposals for solutions to problems without having to be troubled by adopting stances not likely to be taken by them in an open forum. In summary  my delegation welcomes the initiative now being taken by the Governments of Austria  Canada and Mexico to arrange a meeting of representative heads of Government in an effort to achieve a breakthrough in the negotiations for the New International Economic Order. We stand ready to co-operate with all such efforts.54.	That the global round of negotiations has not been launched should not  however  blind us to the real but limited progress made in some areas of critical importance to the economies of the developing countries. Consensus on the international development strategy will help to minimize failure in other areas. Barbados stands ready to benefit  in common with other third-world countries  from the social content of the new strategy. Up to the present  the most important progress resulting from these negotiations has been the social content and aspects of the strategy. The unambiguous and positive attitude of the Group of 77 on social issues reflects the commitment of those countries to the betterment of their peoples. This social programme involves primary health care for all  provision of basic shelter  full employment  universal primary education and substantial reduction in the incidence of infant mortality  among other things.55.	These are all goals to which my Government  in its domestic policies  has been consistently and successfully addressing attention and emphasis. We realize  however  that we are part of one world and that peace and progress are indivisible. A crisis anywhere can mean a crisis everywhere. We therefore welcome the deep concern over the grave and growing plight of the least developed of the developing countries and the measures being taken to alleviate their situation.56.	But I must also re-emphasize the special position of those island developing countries  such as Barbados  whose needs  because of their seemingly high per capita income  are apt to be ignored. During the June meeting of the twenty- seventh session of the Governing Council of UNDP  some developed countries adopted a clear and deliberate approach aimed at limiting the number of UNDP recipients to those with per capita gross national product (GNP) of less than $500. Their object was also drastically to reduce the indicative planning figure of those countries with per capita GNP above $1500. Barbados has always contended that  for small island developing countries  the criteria of per capita GNP and population size are not reliable determinants of such countries' needs for assistance or of their level of development. Small island developing countries  such as Barbados  are being increasingly penalized in a number of ways by those very countries which would have us believe that proper internal economic management and self- reliance are the sine qua non for growth and development.57.	My country's aim is self-reliance. Independent and impartial observers comment regularly on my country's efficient internal economic management. But for decades to come the natural constraints of physical size and limited natural and human resources will make Barbados dependent on external technical and financial assistance on very concessionary or grant terms. It is unreasonable to use the per capita income criterion as a yardstick of development when considering the aid needs of countries such as Barbados  for this has the effect of placing those countries in the same category as countries with the potential capacity of nuclear Powers or with undeveloped reservoirs of mineral hydrocarbon wealth and vast expanses of underdeveloped agricultural lands.58.	Is not this concept of GNP criteria now being used as another ruse on the part of developed countries to drive a wedge between' small island developing countries with seemingly high per capita GNP and the least developed countries whose immediate needs for technical aid and financial assistance are genuinely critical? One category of States must not be sacrificed for another category of States  nor must the partial satisfying of one group of needs be used to frustrate the necessary development objectives of another group of needy Countries. Above all  in the face of these new assaults  developing countries must maintain their solidarity to demand more aid  not less.59.	For  whilst the economic situation of most third world countries has become precarious over the last decade  there has been no corresponding increase in official development assistance. Some donors have failed to accept or to achieve the United Nations target of transferring 0.7 per cent of their GNP  in the form of concessionary funds  to third world countries. In other countries  the gap between actual transfers from the Development Assistance Committee of member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and their collective United Nations target has risen continually  Indeed  between 1974 and 1978  the gap has widened from $12.7 billion to $14 billion in 1975  to $15.3 billion in 1976  to $18.5 billion in 1977 and to $21.6 billion in 1978. Other donors  with the exception of the countries members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  have shown an even worse performance. In the case of the centrally planned economies  aid flows  measured in terms of their GNP  comprise less than one tenth of 1 per cent. What may be impartially said of the major industrialized market economies may likewise be said of the major centrally-planned economies in relation to aid flows; they both display a niggardly attitude towards the real needs of poor developing countries  except where they judge it to be in their own self-interest to make particular exceptions with the aim of maintaining their economic and hegemonic dominance.60.	With this nonchalant approach must be contrasted the genuine concern and disinterestedness shown by some underdeveloped countries  such as Trinidad and Tobago  for the pressing needs of their neighbours. The Government of Barbados  like other Caribbean sister States  welcomes the far-sighted and magnanimous proposals made by Trinidad and Tobago to provide for the financing of the incremental cost of petroleum products  fertilizers and asphalt to other States members of the Caribbean Community. Likewise  we consider the initiatives taken by the Governments of Mexico and Venezuela to give similar relief in relation to energy to some nine Caribbean and Central American States through their Energy Co-operation Programme as a bold and useful step  worthy of emulation  mutatis mutandis  by developed countries.61.	Within the Caribbean there is one area of humanitarian need which cries out for this sort of immediate initiative by developed countries. Developing countries of the Caribbean sub region  during the years from 1978 to 1980  have seen the disruption of their economies  as they have had to deal with the additional burden of reconstruction after devastating disasters. Because of their size and limited resources  Caribbean countries cannot each establish and maintain adequate machinery for disaster preparedness. We are grateful for such assistance as has been given to the region as a result of past disasters. But natural holocausts  such as volcanoes  hurricanes and floods  leave the adversely affected States with disrupted economies and the pressing need for long-term reconstruction of infrastructure and of their agricultural and industrial sectors. A region such as the Caribbean cannot by itself sustain such massive financing. We call upon the United Nations and upon bilateral donorsâparticularly those with a favourable trade balance with the region such as the Federal Republic of Germany and Japanâto provide urgent  meaningful aid and to assist in setting up machinery which will be permanent and which will aim at responding to the region's needs  should such disasters further befall us.62.	The tragedy of our times is that  despite the correct diagnosis of the ills confronting the world  nations continue to disregard the medicines and ignore the cures. There are pressing needs for more food  adequate supplies of energy  more shelter  wider education  better health care and adequate clothing. Daily  these basic human needs are being denied to 800 million poor in the third world whilst developed countries fritter away resources on a build-up of arms. Barbados calls for the early and full implementation of strategies for general and complete disarmament. This would at least release funds for the purpose of development. It would also minimize the risk of war.63. We regret that so many developing States are now themselves being likewise caught up in the whirlwind race for the acquisition of armaments. There is a pressing case for an early convention on the limitation of conventional weapons. We advocate  too  a limitation on the spread of nuclear weapons and we have backed our words by our actions in acceding earlier this year to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.64.	It is a cause of the deepest regret that it is the third world which provides today's theatres of war. There is war in Afghanistan. There is war in Cyprus. There is war in Western Sahara. There is war in Palestine. In Ethiopia and in Lebanon there is war. In Iran and Iraq the cymbals of armaments fail to respond to the Security Council's call for peace. In our own interests  we third-world States must recognize that divisions within our societies and within our regions lead to victories only for those developed nations which sell us the implements of war. That is why Barbados appeals to all outside nations not to interfere in the conflict within the Persian Gulf and we join with those urging Iran and Iraq to settle their dispute by peaceful means.65.	Now more than ever there is need to abide by the principles of the Charter  particularly those which provide for the settlement of disputes by peaceful means. It is not that the Charter of this Organization is deficient; it is rather that some of us are honouring it more in the breach than in the observance. The Charter provides for non-intervention in the internal affairs of States  yet the Soviet Union persists in the occupation of Afghanistan. The Charter provides a procedure for settling disputes peacefully  yet Turkey persists in contributing to the division of Cyprus. We trust that the recent moves by the Secretary-General to arrange talks between the two communities of Cyprus will at long last lead to a successful healing of the wounds of that country; for an undivided sovereign Cyprus provides the safest structure for maintaining the integrity of that State.66.	The Chatter provides for self-determination. Yet  in the Sahara  Morocco  once itself the object of colonial subjugation  misuses the lessons of history to reverse the process of freedom and deny the people of the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic its true independence. We call on Morocco to respect the Charter.67.	In Palestine  the clear solution is self-determination and a homeland for the people of the occupied territories. Israel too must have the right to exist as a sovereign State within defined and secure boundaries  Within Ethiopia and Lebanon  outside interference must cease. Iran  in calling legitimately on Iraq to abide by the provisions of the Charter and withdraw from its territory  should itself set an example by complying with the resolutions passed by the Security Council on the release of the American hostages and should uphold the rule of law by honouring the ruling of the International Court of Justice. 68.	Barbados is dedicated to the peaceful settlement of all international disputes in accordance with the principles of international law. That is why we have this year declared our acceptance of the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice. For acts of violence and terrorism are no real substitute for the rule of law. They can lead to the overthrow of democratic Governments and institutions and undermine respect for human rights. Conversely  in societies where repression is substituted for freedom of expression and periodic democratic elections are denied  the repressed will revert to the weapon of violence instead of the shield of the rule of law to achieve their legitimate rights.69.	As a signatory to a number of human rights treaties and conventions  Barbados is deeply disturbed by these trends in the international community. Wherever serious violations of fundamental human rights occur  even within our own little corner of the world  we will continue to speak out strongly against such violations. Even in the face of harsh criticism  we will continue to oppose  be it in the Caribbean or elsewhere  the imprisonment of people without trial  political assassinations or any form of denial of traditional fundamental rights. Barbados is alarmed at the authenticated daily incidents of the disappearance of large numbers of people in certain States in Latin America and the Caribbean. We are also concerned that hundreds of Asians and Africans are for political and sometimes racial reasons being denied their basic human rights. Barbados therefore urges the world community to turn its attention to designing a strategy for the effective implementation of the United Nations human rights programme. For as man continues to dehumanize his fellow man the United Nations must hasten to strengthen and extend its machinery for dealing with human rights questions.70.	The Secretary-General has reported on the increase in the number of human rights violations and the fact that questions of fundamental human rights have been put aside or deadlocked during the past year by political and economic expediency. We must therefore continue to support measures designed to improve the international machinery for the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. We appeal to all States Members of this Organization to comply with the principles of the Charter and of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We call upon them to support the struggle against all assaults on human dignity  such as economic and social ostracism  involuntary disappearance  arbitrary arrest and detention  torture and wanton murder.71.	The Barbados Government is also deeply distressed at the ever-growing and complicated problem of refugees and displaced persons. The Secretary-General's report has focused on the African and Asian problem and the urgent demands for relief and rehabilitation of displaced persons in those continents. In Latin America and the Caribbean also  the problem is assuming dangerous proportions. Barbados fully supports the Secretary-General's comments on the need for a review of the emergency operations in the United Nations system. The problem of displaced persons now touches us all and needs the closest scrutiny of the world community so that appropriate strategies may be devised. We call upon those nations which have adequate physical resources to open their borders as first places of asylum to all genuine refugees. We also call upon them not to discriminate in this real human tragedy and to desist from accepting or refusing refugees on the basis of their ethnic origin 72.	There are still those who continue to use the dehumanizing practice of racism to rob the majority of the people of South Africa of the opportunity of participating effectively in the government of its native land and sharing equitably in the resources of its country. Apartheid is an abominable and repugnant system practised by a heartless and archaic class. It is destined for destruction. Barbados can never tolerate any form of racism. We therefore reiterate our call for the immediate implementation of total economic and military sanctions against South Africa.73.	That country persists in defying resolutions passed by this Assembly and the Security Council calling for the early independence of Namibia. Every nation other than South Africa is satisfied that the people of Namibia is entitled to self-determination and independence. Yet there is reluctance on the part of some countries to use the provisions of the Charter to enforce South African compliance with international law.74.	The total eradication of colonialism will continue to demand of all of us persistent efforts as long as there exist those nations which continue to advance unfounded claims in order to delay the inexorable process of decolonization  In Latin America and the Caribbean the legitimate right of the people of Belize to early independence within secure boundaries and with all their territory intact is still being thwarted  not by the metropolitan Power but by the neo- colonialist regime of Guatemala. Guatemala  like South Africa  persists in defying the clear terms of the resolutions of this Organization. Unless Guatemala is prepared to accept this Assembly's resolutions  any attempted negotiations will fail  for Belize can never compromise on its sovereignty or territorial integrity. At this thirty-fifth session  Barbados  in conjunction with friendly Caribbean  Commonwealth and other countries  will seek this Assembly's endorsement of a resolution calling on the administering Power to set an early date for the independence of Belize  before 31 December 1981  and calling on this Organization and the administering Power to do whatever is necessary to ensure the continued existence of an independent Belize. We feel sure that all right-thinking Member States will sponsor or support such a resolution.75.	The successful implementation of such a resolution will be a fitting way to mark the twentieth anniversary of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV). That resolution is still a signal landmark in the history of decolonization  Within my region  the Caribbean  there is still much work to be done to achieve freedom for some of our brothers and sisters  who are still under colonial rule. But every step forward is an advance towards the promotion of human dignity and the realization of the full value of man. We in the United Nations  particularly those of us in the third world  have travelled the long  bitter and hard-fought road to victory with the people of Zimbabwe. But truth  justice and freedom triumphed in the end. We warmly welcome the admission of Zimbabwe to this Organization.76.	The births of the new States of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Vanuatu are also real advances towards the full realization of the principle of self-determination. The admission of the sister State of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to membership of this Organization is for us in Barbados and the Commonwealth Caribbean a source of special joy; but it is also a further realization of the equality of nations and of the universality of membership of the United Nations.77.	Events such as those give us hope that solutions will ultimately be found for the many difficulties which the world faces in the decade of the 1980s. We have certainly entered a decade burdened with unresolved but not insoluble problems. At present there is insufficient agreement on how to address those problems; but there is no lack of answers for the outstanding questions. It is the duty of each nation  of each one of us  in the interests of the survival of mankind  to choose the correct answers and to apply the right solutions. Let us have the courage to do so. Let us keep the faith of the Charter and maintain the hope of mankind."
"20",1065,"BTN",35,1980,"ï»¿On behalf of my delegation and on my own behalf I should like to extend to Mr. von Wechmar warmest congratulations on his unanimous election to the high office of President of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. We are fully confident in his personal ability to guide us in the tasks that will confront the General Assembly during his term of office. His election is a fitting tribute to his great country  the Federal Republic of Germany  and to him personally. I should like also to extend our felicitations to the other members of the General Committee.228.	My delegation was highly appreciative of the constructive results achieved under the stewardship of Mr. von Wechmar's predecessor  Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim of the United Republic of Tanzania. We owe him deep gratitude  and we wish him the very best in all his future endeavours.229.	I should like to take this opportunity to commend the Secretary General for his unrelenting efforts in trying to maintain international peace and security. He has been able to face the tremendous challenges of his high office with timely and appropriate action  courage and consistency.230.	My delegation is very happy to join in warmly welcoming Saint Vincent and the Grenadines as the one hundred and fifty-fourth Member of the United Nations. We are certain that the Organization will benefit from its experience and participation in our work. Its membership brings us still closer to our goal of universality for the United Nations  a goal to which we attach high priority.231.	The Government and people of Bhutan are firmly committed to the ideals and principles of the Charter and to those of the nonaligned movement. We therefore seek as free people to live in peace and friendship with all nations and to develop our country in every sector of human endeavour in a manner we ourselves deem fit and proper. At the same time we will join with other peace-loving nations in an effort to build a world order based on respect for the sovereign equality of all nations  peaceful coexistence  justice and mutually beneficial cooperation. We will spare no effort in the quest for the maintenance of international peace and security  to which all peace-loving nations should be wholly committed. We firmly believe that  as is stated in the Declaration of the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Nonaligned Countries  the quintessence of the policy of nonalignment is the rejection of all forms of subjugation  interference or intervention  direct or indirect  and of all pressures  whether political  economic  military or cultural  in international relations. In keeping with the true principles of nonalignment  we will continue to refuse to join any form of military alliance or power bloc.232.	The arms race is definitely the greatest folly that mankind has embarked upon  and concrete steps to halt and reverse the trend are long overdue. A study has determined that at present there exist more than 50 000 nuclear weapons  which have a destructive capacity a million times greater than that of the Hiroshima bomb. The number of people held hostage to the threat of nuclear catastrophe has reached 4.5 billion. In the 1980s  if present trends continue  military outlays are expected to exceed $600 billion a year  even given the assumption that inflation will be checked. In every area of disarmament we continue to witness hindrances and a lack of progress. Since the tenth special session of the General Assembly  devoted to disarmament  three years have passed and little headway has been made in implementing the programme of action adopted at that session.233.	My delegation welcomes the declaration of the 1980s as the Second Disarmament Decade  and it hopes that concrete measures will be taken to reduce the already rapidly escalating expenditure on armaments  expenditure that could easily be channelled to helping developing nations surmount their adverse economic conditions. We must never forget that in the long run the true guarantee of international peace and security is the elimination of hunger and poverty.234.	The Asian situation is still one of crisis and turmoil. We cannot ignore or condone the situations resulting from interference in the internal affairs of sovereign States and from great Power rivalries  as such developments go against the Charter and could very easily assume serious proportions. The peace and tranquillity conducive to the carrying out of tasks for economic and social betterment can come about only when foreign military presence is removed and the countries of the region agree genuinely to live within the framework of the undiluted principles of the Charter.235.	The question of turning the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace  according to the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace  which could beneficially influence the establishment of permanent universal peace  has again been made more difficult because of the rivalries of the superpowers and other vested interests. During the Meeting of the Littoral and Hinterland States of the Indian Ocean in July 1979  the Bhutanese delegation very clearly outlined the position of my Government. In brief  our position was  first  that the further escalation and expansion of the military presence of all Powers in the Indian Ocean should be halted; secondly  that all military bases and other military installations should be removed from the area; and  lastly  that there should be work towards realization of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace. My delegation continues to maintain that position.236.	The ravaged war-torn region of the Middle East has so far been an area where all attempts towards achieving a lasting peace have failed. The problems seem to defy solutions. However  most of us believe that the vital element in achieving peace in the Middle East is the withdrawal by Israel from occupied Arab territories and the establishment of the sovereign independent State of Palestine. At the same time  we fully recognize the right of all States in the region to live within internationally recognized and secure boundaries. These are the only steps that will lead to a lasting peace and provide a true guarantee of the right of all States in the area to exist peacefully. At the seventh emergency special session called in July this year the General Assembly analysed the situation and the problems in the Middle East. We supported resolution ES7/2 which emerged from that session. The international community  and especially those Governments in a position to do so  should continue their efforts to resolve the Middle East crisis peacefully within the framework of that resolution.237.	The eruption of the Iraqi Iranian conflict has added yet another adverse dimension to the problem of peace in that part of the world. My delegation appeals to both sides to exercise maximum restraint and to permit immediate mediation by mutually acceptable parties. Here the good offices of the secretary General should be fully utilized. Our deep concern for the speedy solution of problems resulting in military clashes is due to the possibility of such initial friction becoming more widespread and going beyond our capacity to contain them easily. Warfare and the use of the threat of force must be replaced by peaceful negotiations for the solution of international problems.238.	The peacekeeping involvement of the United Nations has contributed immensely to containing conflicts and reducing tension. At the same time  the humanitarian efforts again made under the auspices of the United Nations have helped in alleviating the suffering of many displaced peoples from war-torn areas. Such activities of the United Nations must continue and expand.239.	The Government and the people of Bhutan rejoice at the emergence of a sovereign independent Zimbabwe. That was a true victory over colonialism  racism and apartheid. Africa has been able to discard yet another shackle. However  the illegal occupation of Namibia by South Africa continues in total disregard of international law and opinion. The people of Africa have our complete support in their relentless struggle to do away with the vestiges of colonialism and the abhorred practice of apartheid. We are certain that it will not be long before the continent of Africa is completely emancipated.240.	We can no longer continue to tolerate the injustices resulting from the prevailing international economic order. The specific areas where injustice exists and the corrective measures that are required have crystallized. Only the lack of political will on the part of some countries is preventing the international community from implementing the measures for the creation of the new international economic order. It must also be realized that failure on our part to come to terms with  and consciously establish  a just and equal world economic order will give free play to several uncontrollable forces  which could upset the wellbeing of the developed societies themselves. Furthermore  we must also realize that the hungry and the poor may not remain for ever silent and docile. The key to the solution is in the hands of the developed and other countries rich in capital and technology  and we urge them to take positive steps in the correct direction.241.	The eleventh special session of the General Assembly did not reach the expectations of the developing countries. However  the final outcome has a few positive elements. The consensus reached in respect of the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade provides the international community with helpful guidelines  especially with regard to the nature  size and complexity of the tasks that need to be undertaken during the Decade. At the special session the Assembly also recognized the serious deficiencies in the economies of the least developed countries and called for immediate and increased assistance to that category of countries. Unless the structural weaknesses of the least developed countries are speedily removed  these countries will continue to register negative or negligible rates of growth. Special assistance has also been sought for the most seriously affectedâthe landlocked and the island developing countries. The Secretariat and the agencies concerned must now make every effort to fulfil the mandate given to them at the eleventh special session. Here bodies like UNCTAD can play a more positive role. We shall continue to support their endeavours to fulfil their international role and obligations.242.	In Bhutan  under the truly dynamic leadership of His Majesty King Jigme Singye Wangchuk  we are now in the process of launching our fifth Five-year Plan. The twin objectives of our economic development continue to be the achievement of self-reliance and the raising of the living standards of our people. However  in the formulation of the programmes under this Plan we have taken into consideration the experience of the past which  among other things  shows that we must ensure that the benefits of development are more widespread and commensurate with our input. In the gigantic task of trying to achieve a better economic lifestyle for our people  we have been provided with assistance by several friendly nations and international organizations. Such assistance is essential to a country like ours  as assistance acts as a catalyst and leads to the ultimate achievement of the goal of self-reliance. With the availability of appropriate types of economic and technical aid  Bhutan  with its comparatively rich heritage of economically exploitable resources  can within a short span of time develop a self-generating economy. For instance  Bhutan has a huge hydroelectric power potential  forest and mineral resources  agricultural products and good possibilities in other fields. However  in order to make those sectors productive  initial input of external capital and technology is required.243.	Bhutan has the added disadvantage of being a landlocked country. Such a geographic situation has definitely retarded economic growth. Several severe handicaps must be removed before a landlocked country can achieve sustained economic progress. For example  adequate transit facilities have to be provided and transportation systems within the landlocked country and from the landlocked country to the ports of transit countries have to be made adequate and efficient. Most of the exports of landlocked countries become uncompetitive in international markets because of high transportation costs. My delegation hopes that all those countries in a position to do so will take steps to provide assistance to the least developed and the landlocked countries 244.	In conclusion  I should like to mention that one of the factors of the deteriorating international situation coupled with an unprecedented arms build-up is suspicion and distrust in each other's intentions  especially among the bigger countries. It is in this context that my delegation welcomes moves for initiating confidence-building measures  particularly among the power blocs. Such confidence-building measures should  however  also be initiated in other areas of the globe and especially among countries where potential for conflicts exists. Another factor is the failure at times to realize that the conduct of international relations between sovereign States has to be within the framework of international law. Besides  obstacles must not be put in the path of the attainment of the legitimate aspirations of self-determination by peoples. The community of nations  with the dawn of the realization of what is necessary for human survival  along with the appropriate political will  can definitely lead our peoples to a safer future and a happier and better world order."
"21",1105,"BWA",35,1980,"ï»¿ Your country  Mr. President  the Federal Republic of Germany  and mine  Botswana  enjoy very cordial relations. Through our diplomatic and other relations and through our dealings with German institutions and people  we have developed a knowledge of and confidence in German capabilities. In congratulating you upon your election to the presidency of the thirty-fifth regular session of the General Assembly  therefore  we recognize that the blending of these national traits with your acquired experience and diplomatic skills will provide the leadership which this Organization requires. We hope that under your stewardship we shall find not only that our deliberations will be crowned with success  but that our resolutions will find ready implementation.2.	I congratulate also all the members of the Bureau for their well-deserved election to their respective offices. We are all aware of the weight of the responsibility we have placed on them. We are confident that they all have the shoulders to bear it.3.	To Ambassador Salim A. Salim  Permanent Representative of the United Republic of Tanzania  the outgoing President of the thirty-fourth regular session  the eleventh special session and the sixth and seventh emergency special sessions of the General Assembly  and to his Bureau  we express our unstinting gratitude for the creditable manner in which they acquitted themselves in discharging the task entrusted to them throughout the year.4.	So also must we hail the co-operation and support which our illustrious Secretary-General has always been ready to provide and has provided. It would be impertinent to attempt to measure or assess the degree of his fidelity and commitment to the aims and objectives of the United Nations as enshrined in the Charter. Suffice it for us to thank him warmly.5.	But before I make a political tour of the world horizon as I am wont to do  permit me briefly to interpose a national sentiment in this Assembly and before the delegations assembled here to acknowledge with gratitude all the messages of condolence and all the expressions of sympathy and of goodwill and continued solidarity addressed to my country following the demise of our late President  Sir Seretse Khama. It was not without cause that our nation mourned the passing of its Founder  as did those who knew him as their friend. May his soul rest in peace.6.	The eleventh special session of the General Assembly that has just ended is one of the many varied meetings  conferences  symposia  working groups and so on  all inspired by the overriding objective of correcting economic and development inequalities  redressing prevailing injustices and closing the ever-widening gap between the life conditions of the developed and the developing world.7.	As my country  Botswana  fully participated in the deliberations of that session  it would be imprudent of my delegation to subject this Assembly to the painful tedium of repetition. I must nonetheless record my country's grave disappointment that  even at the end of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade  the general debate at the plenary meetings was still engaged with the identification of problems  the justification for the development of improved international economic relations and the exhortation to work out a sound  universally acceptable strategy and programme of action for the decade ahead.8.	We are gravely disappointed because the failure of the developed countries to comply with resolutions of the sixth special session of the General Assembly and of UNCTAD has resulted in a further and more serious decline in real terms of trade of the developing countries and because  with the ever-spiralling energy costs  even the true political independence of those countries is in jeopardy. It is clear to us that although a resolution to launch global negotiations was adopted at the thirty-fourth session  its objective will be frustrated by the reluctance and inflexibility of some developed countries to negotiate meaningfully the relationship between the central authority and the United Nations specialized agencies.9.	Despite all these very serious setbacks  disappointments and frustrations experienced in the past two decades  developing countries continue to rely for ultimate success on the realization by developed countries that justice and peace in the world will come only when all nations are self- supporting.10.	It is therefore hoped that no effort will be spared to ensure that through the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade real development progress will be achieved. As a first step in this direction  it is vital also that the international community should endeavour to secure the success of the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries  scheduled for early next year.11.	We cannot over-emphasize the importance of regional economic co-operation for developing countries. In recognition of this fact  heads of State and Government of majority- ruled States in southern Africa made a declaration in April this year on the setting up of regional machinery for coordinating and integrating the development of their economies and reducing their economic dependence  particularly on South Africa. Various studies have been undertaken in various fields  including food production and security  animal diseases  natural resources  transport and communications. For the success of this effort funds will be required. We shall continue to rely for assistance on those who share our concerns and support our objectives.12.	This year we celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  contained in resolution 1514 (XV) of December 1960. The resolution crystallizes the hopes and aspirations of colonized peoples everywhere. Our period of celebration should be an occasion for reflection and the assessment of our achievements.13.	The record over the lifetime of this resolution provides us with only qualified justification for rejoicing  for while many hopes  many aspirations  have found their fulfilment  some have been tantalizingly frustrated.14.	In celebrating this occasion  therefore  we should  in true Christian fashion  place more value on what we still have to achieve than in what we have achieved. Only when we rededicate ourselves and work assiduously and unremittingly to that end may man universally regain his freedom  his respect and his dignity.15.	International concern is being expressed also about the growing tendency of States to violate the conventions relating to the rights  privileges and security of diplomatic personnel and foreign missions in the territories of States Members of this Organization. The practice is gaining in frequency as it is degenerating in cruelty. Our Organization remains mute  impassive and seemingly insensitive to the physical suffering of the victims and the psychological ordeal endured by their families. The problem requires our urgent attention with a view to restoring to international diplomatic relations the time-honoured security and dignity without which international communication and understanding will not always be possible.16.	The political problem Of Western Sahara is that it is a case of the recolonization of an African country by another African country.17.	The first preambular paragraph of the charter of the Organization of African Unity [OAU] expresses the firm conviction of the heads of State and Government of the signatory States that ""it is the inalienable right of all people to control their own destiny"".18.	The Kingdom of Morocco is not only a fully-fledged member of the OAU but enjoys the high distinction  limited to only a few among the present membership of that organization  of being one of the founding member States. It is when the Kingdom of Morocco  so placed and so honoured  undermines the charter by denying the Sahraoui people the total emancipation of their territory  their right to independent existence  their sovereignty and the territorial integrity of their State  it is when the Kingdom of Morocco  so placed and so honoured  deliberately obstructs and frustrates efforts directed towards resolving the dispute between itself and the Western Sahara peacefully by negotiation  that Botswana recognizes Western Sahara as a sovereign State and supports its admission to membership of international organizations.19.	It might be observed by some that Western Sahara does not satisfy the classical criteria for the recognition of States. That might well be so; but the question is whether the Kingdom of Morocco has the right to be obstructionist  or whether the Kingdom of Morocco is exempted from the observance of the time-honoured  far-sighted resolve by the OAU to respect colonial boundaries existing at the time of the attainment of independence. If the answer to these questions is ""No""  as I am certain it will be  the Kingdom of Morocco should be ordered to withdraw its forces from Western Sahara and allow the people of that country to determine its own destiny without hindrance. If its deliberate decision after a referendum is to join Morocco  my country will respect that decision. Africa has unequivocally repudiated Morocco's claim to that territory. Morocco should terminate its colonial aggression against the people of Western Sahara.20.	In July 1980 the seventh emergency special session  convened to consider the question of Palestine  voted overwhelmingly in support of resolution ES-7/2 calling upon Israel to withdraw from occupied Arab territories not later than 15 November 1980. The said resolution was one of the many which have been churned out to no avail since Security Council resolution 242 (1967). The requirement that Israel withdraw is international confirmation of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territories by war and an expression of disdain regarding Israel's annexation of Palestinian and Egyptian territories.21.	Israel has consistently  over the years  flouted injunctions to withdraw and would surprise no one  least of all the United Nations  if  when 15 November 1980 arrive  Israel not only defied the resolution  as usual  but decided to establish a few more Jewish settlements in the territories concerned or demolish a few more homes of innocent Arabs on the West Bank as a reprisal for the enlistment of their sons in the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]. Such action would be thoroughly provocative  but consistent with the acts of escalation in which Israel has engaged during the past few years.22.	Botswana continues to regard the Palestinian problem as the core of the Middle East conflict  and only by restoring to the people of Palestine its legitimate right to territory and self-determination can hope for a comprehensive settlement be entertained. Such a comprehensive settlement cannot be reached without the participation of the Palestinians or their accredited legitimate representatives  the PLO. We recognize the right of every State in the area to live within clearly demarcated and secure boundaries. We deplore the declaration that Jerusalem is the eternal capital of Israel and the desecration of the holy shrines of other religions.23.	We call upon Israel to show the same degree of commitment to the working out of an acceptable solution to the Middle East problem as is displayed by the other parties concerned and to work tirelessly and honestly towards the attainment of that objective.24.	Because they had not themselves known peace for decades  the people of Viet Nam should have  after the end of their long liberation and revolutionary wars  held peace sacrosanct and inviolate not only for themselves but in the territory of others. Their adventures in Kampuchea  however  do not confirm the validity of such suppositions. Inurement to pain and suffering cannot provide enough reason for their actions; the reason must lie in their quest for hegemonistic accretions.25.	Botswana is guided in its foreign policy by its respect for the fundamental right of people to self-determination. For that reason  we find the interference of Viet Nam in the affairs of Kampuchea  under the guise of humanitarian intervention  inexcusable and capable of being dangerously infectious. Other States nurturing similar ambitions might catch the fever. Botswana does not condone the excesses of the Pol Pot regime but my country cannot  for that reason alone  condone external aggression. The problem of Kampuchea should be solved by the Kampucheans themselves and Viet Nam should give them the opportunity to do so by withdrawing its occupation forces from that country.26.	In the view of my delegation  what goes for Kampuchea goes for Afghanistan as well and in equal measure. Botswana calls for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Afghanistan and for the cessation of all military aid to any nationalist group in that country. To condone the destabilization or overthrow of a Government by a foreign Government because of differing social and economic systems would be to create a dangerous precedent. Weak  small nations such as my own  existing side by side with powerful neighbours  would lose their right to self-determination and to their identity. The United Nations must increase its vigilance to ensure that such acts of aggression are outlawed.27.	We urge the people of Afghanistan to seek a solution of their differences by any of the peaceful means provided for in the Charter of the United Nations.28.	On the occasion of the eleventh special session of the General Assembly  the Republic of Zimbabwe was admitted to the membership of the United Nations as the one hundred and fifty-third Member. The independence of that country and its subsequent admission to full membership of this Organization proclaim the victory of the forces of change and progress over those of conservatism and colonialism.29.	After many years of fighting and exposure to human misery and suffering  the people of Zimbabwe must now adjust to a life of peace   rehabilitation and national reconstruction. The task will not be an easy one. They will be subjected to pressures. They will be tugged and pulled in different political directions by external forces motivated by the desire to extend their imperial influence and promote their interests. Botswana implores the people of Zimbabwe to continue to be inspired  in peace  by the sublime ideals of national unity and national interests which won them respect and resounding victories in war. We urge the international community to guard against any external interference in the internal affairs of Zimbabwe and to assist the people of that country to come into their own.30.	We are confident that Zimbabwe will add strength to the Organization and curb colonialism from following the course of adventurism in other parts of the world. The strengths and weaknesses of oppressed peoples should not be measured by the quantity or quality of their weapons  but by reason of their will to sacrifice their lives for their freedom. May the success of Zimbabwe be an inspiration to others.31.	Another reply from South Africa on the Namibia question has come to handâanother chasm to keep the United Nations from its sworn objective of realizing the emancipation of Namibia  yet another document that adds frustration to impatience  and constitutes a serious indictment against the sense of purpose  urgency and degree of importance which South Africa professes to attach to the solution of the Namibia problem. While the Secretary- General has replied promptly to South African communications in the past  South Africa has consistently made three months of sterile silence the appropriate interval between official replies. The raising of unnecessary and irrelevant queries can only arouse doubts concerning South Africa's seriousnessâotherwise to what purpose  one might ask  is all this wrangling? Is it to encourage the hope that the people of Namibia might tire of insisting upon the exercise of their fundamental right to self-determination and so recognize and accept the existing apparatus of minority domination? Is it to enhance the chances of the consolidation of the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance? Is it hoped that the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO] might burn itself out to extinction? If none of these  what then?32.	In 16 paragraphs of its letter of 29 August last  South Africa accuses the United Nations  its organs and bodies  of partiality towards  and preferential treatment of  SWAPO and for being SWAPO's ""most ardent protagonist"". It berates the Secretary-General for his actions  statements and comments in the course of his duty. It expects him to condemn SWAPO for waging the struggle to help to restore to the Territory of Namibia the legality which this Organization upholds. It recoils at the condemnation of its violation of the territorial integrity of the People's Republic of Angola and the Republic of Zambia and of the killing and maiming of their peoples.33.	It is the responsibility of the sovereign nations here assembled to pass judgement on the statements and comments of their chief executive if these should call for such action. To require his unswerving compliance with varying standpoints of individual States would be to nullify the concept and practice of impartiality. Botswana has nothing but praise for the objectiveness with which the Secretary- General executes his heavy international responsibilities  in particular for his efforts to advance the course of the liberation of Namibia through the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978).34.	To hail the role played by the front-line States in the struggle for Namibia's independence may sound immodest when it comes from me  for my country  Botswana  is one of the countries in southern Africa which  together with SWAPO  has been directly involved in the search for an abiding solution to the Namibian problem. In the interest of peace  and to facilitate fair elections free from any form of armed intimidation  the People's Republic of Angola and the Republic of Zambia graciously volunteered to demilitarize areas of their territories. SWAPO has accepted the holding of free and fair elections under United Nations supervision and involving all the parties in Namibia. The delay in the holding of elections  therefore  postpones the day when the people of Namibia as a whole should give their own verdict. In the circumstances of the case  it is South Africa that shows definite partiality towards SWAPO  for by obstructing the election process it perpetuates and gives support to the internationally held position that SWAPO is the sole legitimate representative of the Namibian people.35.	Neither repeated aggressions against the sovereign independent States of southern Africa  which have so often been condemned by the Security Council  nor the attendant massacres of their people and of the Namibian refugees in those countries  neither the strategy to enhance the chances of the Pretoria-sponsored internal minority parties nor the haranguing of the Secretary-General of this Organization will stop SWAPO from winning the elections if the people of Namibia  in the free and fair exercise of their right to self- determination  wish to entrust their destiny to that liberation movement. South Africa should climb down and engage in serious  constructive and meaningful discussions aimed at setting the stage for the holding of elections within a reasonable time. Together we must accentuate the positive  even if it is to express our appreciation to SWAPO for its co-operation  as amply illustrated by the compromises it has progressively made in the interest of a settlement. Botswana does not find doing so impolitic for  let it be known  it would equally have no inhibitions in expressing like appreciation for any substantive South African move towards making the independence of Namibia a practical reality.36.	Four years ago from this very rostrum 1 said that the bell that had tolled for Angola and Mozambique in southern Africa would next toll for other States in the region. It has tolled for Rhodesia; it will toll for South West Africa soon. The time has now come for South Africa to refrain from drawing unconstructive conclusions and even from rearing up to score points on what it considers weaknesses in the United Nations position as expressed by the Secretary- General  and to grapple with fundamental issues relating to the objectives  conditions  manner and timing of the different processes leading to elections and ultimate independence in Namibia. Now is the time for South Africa to accept the fact that SWAPO exists not only to fight against but to talk to  in a spirit of realism and compromise and not of capitulation. Now is the time for South Africa to accept that Namibia will be free and that it will only have itself to blame if Namibia should be so antagonized as to become what South Africa might consider an unfriendly neighbour.37.	In Africa  the last decade has been marked by the accession to independence of the former Portuguese colonies  the Comoros  Djibouti and the Seychelles. Their independence was hard won and bought with the lives of valiant young men and women in a heroic struggle for liberty and freedom for their people. This they have honourably achieved. Their graves are unmarked and unknown  but we revere their memory.38.	There is no reason to suppose that the ensuing decade will not witness again in Africa the further extension of the frontiers of justice and freedom. Already the flag of the Republic of Zimbabwe flutters proudly in the breeze outside our Headquarters building. Namibia and Western Sahara wait their turn  which should come sooner rather than later if an end is put to the liberation wars which stubborn colonialism has forced upon the people of those Territories.39.	In South Africa  the violation or  rather  the denial of fundamental human rights to Africans in order to protect white privilege and supremacy is being challenged. The burden of apartheid and racism has become too heavy to bear any longer. Schoolchildren have taken to the streets; industrial workers have downed their tools; high tension has led to incidents  such as the SASOL explosion  the Silverton Bank hold-up  attacks against police stations and the stoning of people to death  that are becoming all too commonâ all of which are eloquent indications of impending disaster. It lies within South Africa's competence to avert it.40.	We are aware of the reported recent constitutional changes made in that country. Some political observers believe that those changes are designed to pull the country out of the strait jacket of its traditional policy of racism and apartheid. We are not too sure about that. However  we are aware that Prime Minister Botha  addressing the Transvaal National Party Congress  said recently: ""We must get our priorities right. We cannot afford to stare ourselves blind against blacks who have lived with us for years."" That is significant  particularly when it is coupled with his oblique admission of the powerlessness of even the strongest army in the face of insurgency and chaos born of freedom-seeking revolution.41.	Six years ago the world welcomed the promise  made by yet another Prime Minister of South Africa  of radical changes in South Africa within six months. The promise of change was inspiring and impressive  but it proved hollow and inconsequential. The scepticism with which the international community has greeted the latest pronouncements by Prime Minister Botha is therefore not surprising.42.	That the whites in South Africa are desirous of preserving their racial identity and their culture is neither in dispute nor begrudged  except to the extent to which such identification becomes justification for defining an individual's rights and status by his birth  assessing his worth by his colour or his race and determining where he will not work and where he will not live. That is what makes the system totally repugnant. What is more  while any immigrant or refugee of European extraction can acquire South African citizenship  the Xhoss of the Transkei  the Batswanas of Bophuthatswana and the Vendas of northern Transvaal have been made to go through the motions of losing their South African citizenship in an attempt to transform the reality of a plural South African society into the questionable concept of multinationalism within a single country. Africa has refused to recognize this arrangement. We appreciate the stand of other States which also shun the consolidation of racism and apartheid. We are outraged by the actions of those who see these Bantustans as potentially lucrative centres for the establishment of their industries.43.	It is not the redrawing or redefining of South Africa's provincial and regional boundaries which will satisfy the aspirations of the oppressed people of South Africa; it is the dismantling and abolition of the policy of apartheid and its supportive apparatus  and the restoration to the people of South Africa of their rights  including the right to self- determination. The promotion of the sentiment of ethnicity will not stem the tide of the rampant desire for change. To be orderly and peaceful  change must be immediate and based on freedom  equality  justice and dignity for all."
"22",1149,"CAF",35,1980,"ï»¿Every year since San Francisco  35 years ago  the General Assembly  inspired by its determination to achieve peace  discusses the future of the human race in an effort to find in a spirit of co-operation solutions to the many complex problems confronting the world. This is also an opportunity for us to give thought to what is becoming of the Organization  to think about our vocation  our responsibilities as the guardian of international peace and security  and to discuss ways of enhancing the effectiveness of our action.116.	This is the basic reason for the presence here of so many statesmen who have come from all corners of the world to bring their contribution  in their own manner and with their own conviction  to a collective undertaking involving all nations  large and small  rich and poor  in a community of interests that are often different but in the final analysis complementary.117.	But too often numerous questions facing the General Assembly on such occasions remain without appropriate answers because of the lack of political courage and will  the lack of a firm and resolute commitment on the part of certain Member States. Such a situation inevitably reduces the effectiveness of the United Nations and damages its reputation and its credibility.118.	The primary responsibility of the Organization is to seek new ways and means of enabling the international community to reduce the number of conflicts and cease the tensions that disrupt this world and so we feel that everything possible should be done in order to give effect to the purposes and principles of the Charter.119.	Accordingly  I should like first of all to convey to the Assembly the warm wishes for complete success of Mr. David Dacko  President of the Central African Republic  who has always demonstrated total belief and trust in the destiny of the United Nations.120.	I should also like to congratulate Mr. von Wechmar most warmly on his unanimous election to the presidency and to tell him how happy we are to see him guiding the work at this session. We welcome him as President  not only because of his distinguished qualities as an experienced diplomat but also because of the sincere friendship and the ties of co-operation between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Central African Republic  both on a bilateral basis and within the context of the European Community. I am fully convinced that his great experience of the United Nations will enable him to carry out his very difficult task with success.121.	I should also like to pay a well-deserved tribute to Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim for the exceptional brilliance with which he guided the work of the four preceding sessions of the General Assembly. The unanimous congratulations he has received fill us with pride and do honour not only to the United Republic of Tanzania  his country  but to Africa as a whole.122.	As for the Secretary-General  the indefatigable apostle of peace  whose merits are well known to all  I should like to assure him of the total support of my Government in his often difficult  delicate and tireless work to strengthen and ensure the fulfilment of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.123.	I should also like to welcome with pride and warmth the admission this year of two new Members to this great family of the United Nations  the Republic of Zimbabwe and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. On behalf of my country I sincerely wish them every success in their very difficult task of national reconstruction and development.124.	The admission of a new Member of this concert of nations is always an important event  bearing witness to the vitality of the Organization and also strengthening its universality  and it is an encouraging sign that our noble ideas are being spread throughout the world.125.	As this thirty-fifth session begins  the international situation is one of particular concern to us all: conflicts and tension between States continue to become stronger; national sovereignty and territorial integrity  which are sacred principles  are constantly being violated. Indeed  we have to say that little progress has been made in the evolution and democratization of international relations.126.	As for the world economic situation  it seems to be in a very distressing state of stagnation. This is a challenge to the human imagination  which is so fertile and inventive in other areas. We must find bold solutions to the problems causing this very grave structural crisis that is disrupting the international economy. 127.	At this session the General Assembly must try to analyse the situation with a view to responding more effectively to the requirements of the world today.128.	The threats of the cold war were dissipated long ago and had ceased to be the focus of international concern; we were freed for the time being from the nightmare of a cataclysm  thanks to the conclusion  in spite of the existence or persistence of certain local or regional tensions  of agreements. There was the Helsinki Final Act  then there were the SALT I and SALT II agreements  signed by the two super-Powers  and they brought a ray of sunshine to the cloudy skies of international politics. But in the hotbeds of conflict that have erupted in various places we can see a resumption of tension in international relations. There is now an atmosphere of cold war that creates suspicion  distrust  concern  fear  all of which give rise to a lack of understanding  which often in turn gives rise to conflicts between peoples and nations.129.	This return to the cold war and this atmosphere of confrontation tend to produce a strengthening of military blocs and the development and proliferation of nuclear weapons. This rapid deterioration of the world situation certainly gives no grounds for optimism. The United Nations  whose primary responsibility is to ensure international peace and security  must do its utmost to restore an atmosphere of trust and detente in relations between States in order to ward off the danger of a general conflagration that still hovers over the world.130.	I should like to examine more closely the hotbeds of tension and conflict that I mentioned earlier and that continue to be matters of great concern to my Government.131.	In Africa the Central African Republic is seriously concerned over the continuation of fighting and bloodshed in Chad  a neighbouring and fraternal country which for several years has been suffering the horrors of civil war. We cannot but feel for that country because of the tremendous loss of human life  the great suffering of the population and the considerable damage and destruction. Faced with that situation  my delegation can only deplore the foreign and African intervention carried out in an attempt to divide the country  and we condemn all exploitation of that crisis as well as all attempts at selfish domination  to the detriment of the interests of the people of Chad.132.	The Central African Republic for its part will continue to support the efforts undertaken within OAU and by all countries that love peace and justice to put an end to the fratricidal fighting in Chad. My Government believes that the return of true peace to Chad is impossible without understanding among all the parties involved and without national reconciliation. Accordingly  and as far as we are able  we are willing to contribute to a real and swift solution of the problem.133.	In northern Africa the development of the Western Sahara conflict runs the risk of becoming internationalized and engulfing the sub region. So far it has indeed proved extremely damaging to understanding and a spirit of cohesion among African countries.134.	The Central African Republic trusts that a solution can be found quickly and we associate ourselves fully with all efforts undertaken to bring peace back to that part of the continent.135.	In southern Africa the delaying tactics of the racist Government in Pretoria which have so far prevented the implementation of the mandate of the United Nations Council for Namibia and delayed Namibia's accession to sovereignty are doomed to failure. My delegation believes that the independence of the Territory under the leadership of SWAPO is inevitable.136.	The Central African Republic would like to reiterate once again its full support for SWAPO  the sole legitimate representative of the Namibian people  in its heroic struggle to condemn the acts of aggression by South Africa against neighbouring African countries.137.	The South African regime is continuing to defy the international community by persisting in its shameful policy of apartheid  the violation of human rights and repression of the majority of its population. Basically  the so-called reforms of Pretoria have changed nothing.!38. The South African Government and those Powers that support it must realize that the system is doomed. Indeed  the radicalization of opposition to apartheid within the country and the successes won by the liberation movements are eloquent proof of that. It is in the interests not only of the peoples of South Africa but also of the international community as a whole that the policy of apartheid be eliminated as quickly as possible  for it contains within itself the seeds of a serious threat to stability and peace in that part of the world.139.	In the Middle East  the situation remains of concern. The Central African Republic continues to believe that a just and lasting peace in that region can be achieved only within the context of an over-all settlement. In this respect  consultation and dialogue among all the parties concerned in a sincere spirit of mutual concession would seem to be the best way of arriving at an equitable solution to the problem.140.	We would state once again our belief that it is indispensable for the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people to be respected and restored and for the right of the State of Israel to exist within secure and guaranteed boundaries to be recognized  in accordance with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  if we wish to have a lasting and peaceful settlement of the conflict.141.	However  my delegation considers the Camp David accords as a positive and significant step forward towards a solution of the problem. We regret  however  that the peace process has been compromised by Israel's policy of fait accompli and we call for a resumption of negotiations as soon as possible.142.	The situation in Lebanon is also a matter of continuing concern. The Central African Republic fully associates itself with the efforts made by the United Nations to restore peace to that country and we trust that all parties will co-operate with the United Nations to that end.143.	In the eastern Mediterranean area  my Government welcomes the resumption of the dialogue under the auspices of the United Nations between the two Cypriot communities and we trust that that dialogue will lead to a lasting and just solution of the crisis in order to preserve the unity  territorial integrity  sovereignty and non-alignment of Cyprus.144.	The delegation of the Central African Republic deplores the armed conflict between Iran and Iraq  two non-aligned countries  and we would add our voice to the voices of all the other delegations that have spoken here and called upon those two parties to cease hostilities and to settle their dispute by peaceful means.145.	With respect to Afghanistan  the implementation of General Assembly resolution ES-6/2 adopted at its sixth emergency special session in January 1980 would  in the view of my delegation  allow the crisis to move rapidly towards a satisfactory solution.146.	Hotbeds of tension persist in South-East Asia. This is dangerous and poses a threat to international peace and security. Accordingly  my Government would call for a return to peace and tranquillity in that nerve centre of the world.147.	The General Assembly should devote particular attention to the problem of disarmament. To date  little progress has been made in that area. On the contrary  arms expenditures continue to increase. Those expenditures divert to destructive purposes vast sums which could better be used to improve the well-being of mankind. They simply feed international tension and create hotbeds of conflict throughout the world. It is imperative that a solution be found to that problem and that we give serious consideration to the possibility of allocating to the economic and social development of the least developed countries an increasingly larger share of the amounts currently spent on arms.148.	The problem of refugees is one of the most tragic problems facing the world today. Millions of human beings have been driven from their homes and families because of intolerance  civil war and international conflicts. Often in anguish they are forced to wander in search of food and shelter. The international community owes it to itself to furnish aid  support and comfort to them.149.	The delegation of the Central African Republic also hopes that more attention will be given than has been given in the past by the international community to the fate of the 5 million African refugees.150.	Like all developing countries  the Central African Republic had placed great hopes in the eleventh special session of the General Assembly  devoted to economic problems and international co-operation. Unfortunately  the results were far from living up to our hopes. The eleventh special session ended in a semi-failure as a result of divergencies of views on the question of the procedures and time table for the global negotiations  despite many concessions made by the Group of 77 in an effort to reach a consensus.151.	The delegation of the Central African Republic cannot but express its disappointment over that situation  which may well delay the negotiations that  in principle  were to begin in 1981.152.	Nevertheless  we feel that the thirty-fifth session does offer us another opportunity to hold discussions and to reach a compromise that would be satisfactory to all. In this connection  my delegation welcomes the good will demonstrated by the United States in the statement made on 22 September 1980 by the United States Secretary of State  Mr. Muskie [4th meeting] and we hope that other countries will follow that example.153.	Despite the semi-failure of the eleventh special session  my delegation cannot but express its satisfaction over the consensus that emerged on the text of the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade  which will begin on 1 January 1981. We welcome the set of measures advocated for more active and more equitable North-South co-operation.154.	We hope that the international community will give effect to those measures as a whole  with a view to the real establishment of a new international economic order  once they have been adopted by the General Assembly.155.	My delegation has always  here and elsewhere  expressed its views on the major economic problems facing our world today. My delegation believes that the international monetary system that was set up at the end of the Second World War is unjust and unsuitable because it responds more to the interests of the developed countries than to those of the third world. A fundamental reform of that system is imperative in order to respond to the realities of the world today and to the concerns of the developing countries  which must definitely be involved in the reform of the system and in all decision-making procedures  on a footing of equality with the industrialized countries.156.	With respect to the current world trade system  my country believes that a structural change is one of the priori-ties of the new international economic order. That change must be in the interests of the countries of the third world. They must be granted facilities on a non-reciprocal basis and their products should be given unrestricted access to the markets of the industrialized countries. It is imperative to proceed without further delay to improve the generalized system of preferences in accordance with the agreed conclusions reached at the fourth session of the Special Committee on Preferences of the Trade and Development Board  in order to increase the share of the developing countries in international trade.157.	With respect to commodities  which constitute the bulk of the exports of developing countries and also their' major source of income  the Central African Republic believes that the measures adopted at the international level to raise and to stabilize prices at remunerative levels must be implemented.158.	In this respect  we welcome the agreement reached at Geneva on the establishment of a Common Fund"" for financing buffer stocks for commodities  despite the few difficulties that remain. It is our sincere wish that that Fund  an essential instrument for attaining the objectives of the Integrated Programme for Commodities  may become operational as soon as possible.159.	Regarding industrialization  the importance of which for the acceleration of development no longer need be demonstrated  my delegation regrets that it is inadequate in most developing countries. Their share of world production amounts to only 7 per cent  although the Lima Declaration and Plan of Action on Industrial Development and Co-operation set a target of 25 per cent by the year 2000. Considerable efforts must therefore be made to industrialize the developing countries and to encourage exports through a major transfer of financial and technological resources to them.160.	The developed countries must accordingly take the necessary measures to facilitate freer and broader access by developing countries to science and technology. It is highly desirable that the Vienna Programme of Action on Science and Technology for Development be effectively implemented.161.	In the area of the transfer of resources for development  adequate provisions must be made quickly in order to improve the financial situation of developing countries whose balance of payments shows a chronic deficit.162.	Those developed countries whose official development assistance has not yet reached the target of 0.7 percent of gross national product must in a spirit of solidarity make the necessary efforts to reach that target. It is urgent that those developed countries that have not yet done so take the appropriate and necessary measures to convert debts into grants or to relax their terms in accordance with resolution 165 (S-IX) of the Trade and Development Board. 163.	On the question of the least developed and landlocked developing countries  which include the Central African Republic  my delegation believes that the international community must urgently implement the Programme of Action for the 1980s that UNCTAD decided to launch under its resolution 122 (V) of 3 June 1979. 164.	I should like to take this opportunity to express our satisfaction at the special provisions contained in the text of the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade for the least developed and land-locked countries. They are to be given increased assistance from the developed countries and international financial institutions to help them overcome their handicaps.165.	My delegation would also appeal to all developed countries to contribute generously to the United Nations Special Fund for Land-locked Developing Countries. We welcome the decision taken by the General Assembly to convene in 1981 the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries  pursuant to General Assembly resolution 34/203 of 19 December 1979.166.	The special disadvantages arising from the geographical situation of the land-locked countries are so evident that there is no need for me to comment on them. I would just say how pleased my delegation was at the historic success of the ninth session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  held at Geneva. After seven years of long and difficult negotiations the informal text of a convention on the Law of the Sea has at last been drafted. It is our sincere hope that that convention can be signed by the end of 1981  at Caracas.167.	Before concluding this part of my statement  I should like for a few moments to dwell on the very serious food situation in the developing countries.168.	While $500 billion is wasted annually by the industrialized countries on the arms race  approximately one billion human beings are suffering from  and indeed dying of  hunger and malnutrition in the poor countries. We cannot remain insensitive to that tragic situation. That is why my delegation believes that we must as a matter of urgency implement the recommendations contained in the Declaration of Principles and the Programme of Action adopted by the World Conference on Agrarian Reform and Rural Development in Rome in July 1979. 169.	We welcome the recent signing of the new Convention on Food Aid  which raises the guaranteed volume of aid from 4.2 to 7.6 million tons. My delegation trusts that all efforts will be made to ensure that that objective  which is the absolute minimum for aid provided  be reached before the renewal of the Convention  scheduled for 1981. We fully support the carrying out of food strategies  an idea launched by the World Food Council at its fifth ministerial session  held in September 1979 at Ottawa.170.	I should now like to make a few comments on the situation in my country one year after the restoration of the Republic.171.	Fourteen years of dictatorship and plunder brought economic ruin to my country and indeed traumatized the people of the Central African Republic. Since 20 September 1979 my Government has been dealing with this tragic situation in its efforts to achieve national reconstruction. A biennial plan for economic and social recovery for 1980-1981 has been adopted. It emphasizes economic recovery  the improvement of public financing  and mobilization of financial resources over the short and medium-term.172.	Priority has been given to the productive sectors of the economy  particularly agriculture  to development of the rural areas and the improvement of roads and other communication networks  all of which have received special attention from the Government.173.	In the field of public finances the Government has adopted a policy of budgetary austerity  eliminating all unnecessary expenditure on luxury items  reducing operating expenses and reorganizing the administrative structure.174.	In the field of health major efforts are now under way to improve health services and the general well-being of the population in order to ensure that our people are more able to work for national development. The educational system is now being reformed  and it is being directed towards the productive sector in order to respond to the real needs of our people and to halt the rural exodus.175.	Our Government has also taken a number of measures to restore the confidence of foreign investors. At our request  several missions  including one by the World Bank  have visited the Central African Republic to bring the files up to date on the public debt inherited from the previous regime. Despite difficulties at the financial level  we have begun to organize our debt servicing system and to pay outstanding debts. We have also developed a new investment code which offers generous guarantees to foreign capital.176.	Major efforts have been made to meet the needs of the Central African Republic to ensure that we can reconstruct our own national economy. However  what is required is a tremendous amount that is often more than we are able to provide. Accordingly we need considerable foreign capital to support our action at the national level. That is why my Government welcomes the fact that at Bangui from 23 to 28 July 1980 we had a meeting of partners to finance the biennial recovery plan.177.	I would like to take this opportunity to thank all those friendly countries and international bodies  including several specialized agencies of the United Nations  that were kind enough to participate in that important meeting. I should also like to express our hope that the pledges made by participants at that meeting will be honoured so as to support the efforts being made by my country.178.	With respect to the political situation  all the fundamental freedoms have been restored. Citizens' rights are respected and guaranteed  and independence  sovereignty and justice have been restored. A draft constitution has been prepared and will be submitted to the people of the Central African Republic for approval. After it is adopted new institutions will be set in place  and the President of the Republic and the members of the National Assembly will be elected by universal suffrage. That will ensure the restoration of democracy.179.	I should like here again to tell the international com-munity that the Central African Republic is determined to ensure its reconstruction in peace and dignity. We are willing to co-operate with all countries that love justice and freedom and that respect our sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity  in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and that of OAU.180.	This review of the current international situation has highlighted the need for greater independence and solidarity among nations  rich or poor  large or small. That requires a greater sense of collective responsibility in the face of the problems  upheavals and tensions confronting us  so as to enable our Organization to carry out the changes necessary if we are to respond to the demands of a constantly changing world. Freedom  the well-being of man and world peace requires it.181.	My country intends  in so far as its modest means permit  to contribute to the attainment of the noble ideals contained in the Charter of the United Nations."
"23",1193,"CAN",35,1980,"ï»¿Mr. President  my first words must be ones of congratulation to you on the assumption of the highest office in the Assembly. Your election represents not only a recognition of your own outstanding personal qualities but also an indication of the respect in which your country is held by the community of nations.155.	During the special session of the Assembly on economic cooperation  I had the opportunity of appearing here twice to address the Assembly. Different evaluations will be made of the results of the session but none of them will term the exercise a full success. The world's economic problems remain starkly visible: hundreds of millions of lives wasting in poverty  the development goals of many developing nations knocked askew by soaring bills for essential imports and recession in the industrialized world. Solutions are not easily available. The issues are complex. Quite clearly  approaches vary. In many respects  the difficulties of the special session in reaching agreement reflect the difficulties inherent in the world's economic problems. However  I urge all nations to look towards productive compromise on the negotiating issues so that the process of trying to deal together with the problems can go forward. The General Assembly provides (hat opportunity.156.	Meanwhile  Governments need to look hard at their own efforts to contribute to economic redressment. As announced at the closing meeting of the special session  Canada will for the rest of the decade be increasing its aid contribution.  We are also studying other areas where our contribution to development can be improved.157.	The world which this Assembly reflects is one buffeted by change. Both a dynamic of development and an irresistible force  change is in many respects a mixed blessing. It can be volatile  destabilizing. Northern and southern methods and cultures meet and sometimes clash. Accelerated aspirations are often frustrated. People fear change: they may reject it  often after breakdowns occur  or suppress its social and political expression  which can be an invitation to revolution.158.	But change will go on and must go on. We must  whenever possible  make both technological change and social change acts of progress. The task of our world Organization is to prompt and channel change into positive and predictable directions. The end lesson  as far as the work of the General Assembly is concerned  is that economic development and orderly adaptation to its dynamic of change are basic ingredients of peace and security.159.	For example  I say again that there cannot be authentic or enduring security in the world as long as there is widespread global poverty and economic injustice. Increasingly  we recognize the economic interdependence of the nations of the world. This reflects both an economic fact and a method of approaching issues. Our interdependence is a sign of changing world relationships and is also a response to the dynamics of rapid change itself.160.	The North South dialogue has its political dimension  as can be seen in most world crises. And just as we must accept change in our economic relationships and reject intervention and the economic subordination of one country by another  so we must reject the political and military equivalents. Just as we are strengthening our international instruments for promoting and channelling economic change  so we must continue to strengthen our methods and means for promoting international peace and social and political justice.161.	A glance at our political geography can help to illustrate this.162.	Where is there greater evidence of the resistance to change than in the perpetuated insult which apartheid in South Africa represents to any human being who cares about human dignity? ""Oh  but they are beginning to change""  I am told; ""Do not disturb the process"". What process? Where are the changes? A minority of whites still totally dominates a majority of blacks through a repressive society and a system rooted in racist supremacy. This is not acceptable in any form and it never will be. South Africa must recognize the inevitability of change.163.	We again welcome Zimbabwe to this body. We applaud the changes which its presence here represents.164.	Similarly  we look forward to the day when we can welcome the representatives of Namibia to the General Assembly as representatives of a Member State. After more than three years of intensive United Nations effort  the settlement expected in Security Council resolution 435 (1978) is within our grasp. Technical arrangements are in hand. Only the commitment on the part of South Africa is missing. Right now the circumstances for reaching a final and peaceful settlement are promising. If left untended  they will only deteriorate. A team of the Secretary Generalâs representatives is to meet shortly with representatives of South Africa in an effort to clear the way for reaching that final settlement. The consequences of continued resistance to change will be severe.165.	It is with the deepest and most troubled apprehension that we contemplate Soviet action in Afghanistan. What is the occupation of that nonaligned country if not old-time great Power behaviour of the kind which the United Nations was formed to eliminate? What has this invasion meant to us all? The process of East West detente  of vital importance to the world community  is now undermined; world peace itself is now more fragile; confidence about intentions is now shaken; nonalignment is certainly now in jeopardy: and  lastly  the flouting by the Soviet Union of the solution proposed last January by the huge majority of States in this Assembly  and particularly of the call for the early and unconditional withdrawal of all Soviet troops  inevitably colours our reaction to positions the Soviet Union takes on other issues before this Assembly. We again call on the Soviet Union to restore to Afghanistan the sovereign rights which its people are entitled to expect and deserve.166.	I turn now to the situation in Kampuchea. There again we have witnessed the invasion of a small nation by a powerful neighbour wishing to impose its solution  its views  its regime. There again we have an outpouring of refugees looking to the world for survival. Is this what some leaders consider to be realpolitik'. a policy of strike when you can  take what you can? What cynicism. Kampuchea racked for decades by other peoples' wars and then by a regime of undiluted destruction  is a global concern. Many of us have joined Kampuchea's neighbours in keeping the survivors alive and in settling the refugees. But the real problems of that area require a political solution and we emphatically reject the occupation of Kampuchea and the attempt to control change by force of arms which Viet Nam's invasion by definition represents.167.	I welcome and support the vigorous efforts of the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to promote un equitable solution to the issues. I urge the international community to persevere in this just cause and not to accept that a fait accompli has been imposed by Viet Nam.168.	Let me turn now to the Middle East. Is that situation to exasperate this Assembly for the next 30 years? Has the past not taught us how dangerous a state of continual unresolved tension can be for the people of the area itself as well as for the world as a whole? Respect for the sovereignty  territorial integrity and independence of every State in the area and for the right of all States  including Israel  to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries must remain the cornerstone in efforts to reach a comprehensive solution to the Middle East dispute. There must also be recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. Li.ke other peoples they are entitled to political expression within a defined territory and to participation in the negotiating process to find a just and comprehensive peace settlement.169.	The current negotiations have led to a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt. There has been progress in dealing with serious problems  but difficulties remain. Further decisions must soon be made or else achievements to date will be jeopardized with all the consequences that this would entail. Whatever the method or forum  I urge all parties to recognize the form of change and to move away from confrontation and violence to moderation and compromise.170.	The aforementioned situations are some  but by no means all  of those where there is a threat to world peace through resistance to change or through the recourse to arms to impose change. In different ways  they serve to illustrate the need to abandon prevailing methods of resolving conflicts in exchange for collectively developed machinery  and not to revert to the rule of force. The world will not become more stable in the next decade. The rate of change will accelerate. There is a real probability that certain States may try to exploit the vulnerability of others to their own advantage. A determination to channel and to control the volatile impact of change into constructive  peaceful directions is necessary. First  however  we need to break away from old patterns of approach and attitude.171.	The North South dialogue is an obvious example in this respect. We must recognize our global responsibilities  but resist the notion that every problem must have a global  generalized solution. I also think that there are issues and stages of discussion where bloc to bloc negotiation will be less useful. By way of illustration  I think of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. There a complicated array of different groupings of countries arranged to correspond with differing economic  political and even geographical interests  has wrestled with longstanding questions of principle and tradition. This method has enabled the countries involved to draft  in effect  a new constitution for two thirds of the world's surface in the more pragmatic  realistic and  I believe  productive way which a pluralistic approach can afford. Change demands such departures from accepted dogma and I believe that our approach to North South issues is clearly in need of both stimulation and reform.172.	Another area of potential institutional improvement is the United Nations Secretariat itself. The office of the Secretary General has unique value as an instrument for attenuating conflict. The Government of Iran still keeps United States diplomatic personnel hostages almost a year after their forceful seizure. Although the tireless efforts of the Secretary General to arrange a solution have not yet achieved their objective  they illustrate the potential of his office for promoting solutions  at least in other less unreasonable and chaotic circumstances. In the past 35 years his predecessors have in fact often led the Organization into significant developments  such as peacekeeping operations  which improved our collective ability to manage conflict. Yet there is a potential for further improvement to increase the Organization's capability for mediation in conflict.173.	Cyprus is a case in point. There  we need a two pronged effort to heal the divisions which have plagued its two communities since shortly after independence. First  peacekeeping efforts should continue. Canadian armed forces have served with UNFICYP for 16 years  and Canada intends to maintain its contribution as long as active efforts to achieve a settlement appear to have promise. Secondly  direct mediation efforts by the Secretary General and his representatives should be encouraged  to promote substantive negotiations with representatives of the two communities in order to resolve their differences peaceably. In this case  peacekeeping and mediation go hand in hand  both dependent upon the skill and dedication of the United Nations to furthering our common aim of ensuring peaceful change.174.	By a similar token  I believe that greater use should be made of the secretary Generalâs responsibilities under the Charter to act with the authority of his office in situations arising from violations of human rights. For many years Canada has introduced and supported proposals in the General Assembly to reinforce the Organization's abilities to promote and protect human rights.175.	I continue to support the concept of a United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the strengthening of the role of review and inquiry of the Commission on Human Rights. Although the attainment of these objectives may take some time  interim solutions are available. I urge the Secretary General to use his good offices where the evidence of human rights violation is sufficiently serious. All States should extend their cooperation to him in order to alleviate difficulties and avoid confrontations and to further the interests of international cooperation.176.	Neither the political nor the humanitarian roles which I have suggested demand changes in the Charter of the United Nations or fundamentally different mandates from the General Assembly. Rather  these roles rest on a willingness of Member States to respect the Charter  to recognize the desirability of channelling the winds of change into constructive directions and to abandon old behavioural patterns.177.	Another area to which the Canadian Government attaches special significance is disarmament. At this General Assembly  the midpoint between the first and second special sessions on disarmament  I welcome the much greater attention which the United Nations gives to the subject  although I regret the lack of specific and ratified agreements on further measures of arms control and disarmament. Are the peoples of the world not entitled to feel impatience  for example  that our Governments have still failed to negotiate a nuclear test ban treaty which can be accepted and ratified by all States  or that a treaty to ban chemical weapons remains blocked by disagreement over means of verification?178.	Canada is committed to breaking the pattern of madness which spiralling rearmament represents. Our recently appointed special Ambassador for disarmament will be working at this session towards the goals set out by Prime Minister Trudeau of Canada two years ago at the special session on disarmament  especially those that restrain and cut back the competition in strategic nuclear weapons. Without restraint in this area we can have little reason for optimism that the proliferation of nuclear weapons around the world can be stopped. As a first step we will pursue vigorously the cessation of the production of fissionable material for nuclear weapons.179.	Breaking the patterns of the past  adapting to change  improving our collective machineryâthese are the emphases we should give to this Assembly's work. When countries revert to outdated type by hanging on to privileges  using force  keeping self-serving methods of approach to issues  our collective achievement is diminished.180.	As an example  may I return briefly to the recent results of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. The emerging law of the sea treaty would be robbed of much of its meaning without universality and durability. Those conditions will be fulfilled only if all interested parties commit themselves to a consensus which is fair to all. We have not seen such a consensus in at least one vital area  that of seabed mining. If  for example  the interests of the land based mineral producers  including Canada and many developing countries  are ignored or overridden because of the desire of some States to secure unrestricted access to the mineral riches of the seabed  then the future of the treaty of the law of the sea may be badly compromised. The problem can only be compounded by States stepping outside the internationally agreed framework to play the game by their own set of rules.181.	In order to bridge the gap between producing and consuming countries and find a common basis of agreement on this issue  we have joined a number of countries from the developing world in initiating an independent United Nations study to determine the impact of the seabed production formula proposed by the major mineral consuming States. I hope that the results of this study will encourage a fresh look at the whole question. That fresh look could be crucial to the future of the new convention  which  in turn  is crucial to the future of us all.182.	The recent law of the sea experience is instructive in two different respects. First  it has demonstrated that serious negotiations carried on within a sensible  practical framework can resolve difficult questions involving deep changes in the approach to issues where the willingness to do so exists. Secondly  it demonstrates in perhaps the most cogent possible way that no institution  no matter how well conceived or well administered  can function in the absence of agreement on such a fundamental question as adherence to the principle of consensus.183.	I have spoken about change in the international system  and I have tried to underline our collective responsibility to ensure that the forces of change lead in positive directions. This Assembly is itself a symbol of change in the world. Three times as large as it was 30 years ago  with quite different emphases in its work  it needs now to set its imperatives against the ideals identified in the Charter. Although the Charter was drawn up in the absence of most countries represented here  I am sure that those ideals still represent a valid framework for our endeavour. Indeed  they are constants in a sea of change. I urge our rededication to them."
"24",1254,"CHL",35,1980,"ï»¿Mr. President  it is a great pleasure for my Government to congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. You represent a country which is admired by Chile and with which we enjoy historical ties of friendship and co-operation in various fields. Your acknowledged talents as a diplomat constitute a priceless guarantee of success in the conduct of the important matters to be dealt with at this session.138.	We also wish to extend our appreciation to Mr. Salim A. Salim of the United Republic of Tanzania  who so wisely presided over the last session of the General Assembly  as well as other important sessions of our Organization during the year.139.	Similarly  the Government of Chile welcomes the delegation of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  a country on the American continent whose independence was attained this year and which has recently become a Member of the United Nations. We hope that that nation will continue to progress on the path of peace and prosperity.140.	At the beginning of the decade of the 1980s the United Nations is entering a new and delicate stage with the maturity and fruitful experience acquired through its 35 years of existence.141.	In the course of time  peoples have developed in the most varied manner. Today there are more than 100 States which have been incorporated gradually within the grand framework of the principles and purposes embodied in our Charter. Strict observance of and faithful compliance with those principles will enable us to continue to endorse and support the legitimate aspirations to a world of peace and co-operation.142.	The evolution of this phenomenon is not alien to the United Nations. In fact  one of its great achievements has been specifically decolonization  which has led to the independence of many States and to their joining us in our common tasks.143.	Chile has always contributed to the efforts of the international community to find valid solutions within this Organization.144.	The world is concerned to tackle the problems which face it in the latter years of the twentieth century. Chile shares that concern and it is its national objective to focus on the challenges it presents.145.	On several occasion my Government has informed the Assembly of the reform has introduced in the economic  social  juridical  labour and educational fields  inter alia  with a view to adapting their structures to the requirements of our time. However  this task could not be accomplished in the absence of a system of coexistence and a dynamic  secure and stable Government. Peoples cannot remain static.146.	The Government of Chile has  since 11 September 1973  repeatedly reaffirmed its intention to begin a new era in the history of our homeland  designing with an eye to the future the structures of a stable and creative political regime. It has further stated that the new system of institutions developing in the country would be entrusted with establishing the legal framework for the great collective task to which the nation is committed.147.	Accordingly  one of the first steps taken by the Government was to entrust a committee  composed of university professors of various democratic ideological tendencies  with the task of drawing up a draft political constitution. Over 100 representatives of the most diverse activities  including professional  union and youth leaders  collaborated in that work  contributing their ideas and their concerns.148.	After five years of thorough legal and political studies  including the consideration of the most modern constitutional texts  the committee studying the question of a new constitution presented to the Government the preliminary draft of a fundamental charter.149.	The State Council  a body made up of national representatives at the highest level  including former Presidents of the Republic  former magistrates of the higher courts of justice  former rectors of universities and union leaders  reviewed the preliminary constitution. In order to carry out its task properly  the Council requested wide-ranging collaboration  and many suggestions were received.150.	The conclusions reached by the State Council after over one and a half years of analysis were presented to the President of the Republic. Finally  the head of State and the Government Junta drafted the final text of the constitution which  as had been previously promised  was submitted to a plebiscite for approval.151.	The Chilean public followed the development and preparation of the new political constitution step by step. Both the preliminary draft prepared by the committee on studies and the draft prepared by the State Council  as well as the final text of the new Constitution  were duly published  giving rise at every stage to wide and active discussion on the part of the different sectors of national life in Chile.152.	The public debate held during the period just prior to the plebiscite was particularly intense. In that debate supporters and opponents of the new constitutional text and of the Government's action expressed their views for or against in public rallies  with complete freedom and full publicity. The mass communications media  domestic and foreign  published and informed the country and the world of the individual and collective views of all Chileans.153.	On 11 September  in conditions of freedom  secrecy and full information  a plebiscite was held throughout the Republic so that the Chilean people might decide on the approval or rejection of the proposed political Constitution.154.	In a country of 11 million inhabitants  6 300 000 citizens voted. This represents the highest participation ever known in our national history.155.	All Chileans over 18 years of age  men and women without any discrimination whatsoever  fulfilled this duty which  in accordance with Chile's political tradition  is mandatory. Foreign residents also voted  inasmuch as they share in the life of the nation.156.	More than 4 200 000 citizens voted in favour of the new Constitution  that is  over 67 per cent of the voters. Approximately 1 800 000  that is  30 per cent  voted against it. Votes declared null and void amounted to only 2.77 per cent.157.	No one can contend that there was a lack of opportunity or means to express  with complete freedom  opinions for or against the constitutional text  and to participate in the debate. No one can truthfully hold that there was no access to each of the steps of the balloting process. No one can in good faith state that  on account of regulatory or technical circumstances or legal restrictions  he or she was deprived of the right to vote. No one who thinks dispassionately can doubt the legitimacy  legality and correct conduct of the plebiscite.158.	Chile is a country which is noted for its constitutional stability. In a period of over 150 years of independence  Chile has had only two constitutions: those of 1833 and 1925. Today  we have approved a new fundamental law which  taking in the principles of freedom and democracy enshrined in the preceding constitutions  aims at organizing that stable and creative political regime needed to meet the vital challenge of the years to come.159.	The political Constitution of 1980 contains  in general terms  some solutions not usually provided for in contemporary fundamental charters  aimed at solving the problems of the Chilean individual of our times.160.	As regards the crucial dilemma of the individual versus the State  it provides for the principle of subsidiary status of the State  thus limiting the latter's action in order to prevent its interference in areas which are basically left to the free initiative and action of individuals.161.	On those grounds  the Constitution of 1980 is directed towards defining the field of action of the rulers and ensuring the freedoms of those governed.162.	It further enshrines all the rights of man  as established in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenants on Human Rights  and provides the means required by individuals in order to ensure that their rights are fully respected.163.	Another basic characteristic of the political charter is the effective attempt to secure the participation of the people  based on methods designed to bring the people closer to their rulers and to enable the latter to have the opportunity of learning the opinion of those governed.164.	Likewise  under the rule of the Constitution of 1980  Chile continues to be a democratic republic and its authorities are chosen by means of free  secret and informed elections. It establishes  once again  the traditional separation of the powers of the State and especially the independence and the immutability of the judiciary  which is created in an autonomous manner  a prime guarantee for the respect of the legal order.165.	Just as the new Constitution endeavours to protect the individual from possible abuses by the State and the authorities  it also aims at protecting the individual from one of the most serious scourges of our contemporary times  that is  violence used as a tool for political conviction  in other words  terrorism. The General Assembly has been dealing with this distressing problem of the twentieth century  this ultimate denial of human rights.166.	The fundamental charter of Chile explicitly defines the preaching of violence and the practice of terrorism as a constitutional crime and entrusts the investigation  trial and punishment of such acts to the courts of justice.167.	The aforementioned results of the plebiscite are unequivocal: over 4 million Chileans  that is  67 per cent of the voters  have decided that the first presidential term of office of eight years  with which the new Constitution enters into force  is to be entrusted to General Augusto Pinochet Ugarte. These figures grant the Government the highest representation registered in the political history of our country.168.	The President of the Republic  faithfully interpreting this legitimate will of the nation  once the results of the plebiscite were known  affirmed that there were neither winners nor losers and called upon all Chileans to unite in order to continue striving for the prosperity of the country and  most especially  for the economically weaker sectors.169.	At the beginning of my statement I said that the world was concerned over problems which should be resolved in the last two remaining decades of this century. Those problems are numerous  diverse and serious. The most complex and dangerous ones stem from political situations or from social-economic behaviour  in addition to other problems stemming from religious  doctrinaire or ideological beliefs.170.	Approximately one year ago the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. The urgent meetings of the Security Council and the emergency special session of the General Assembly  which condemned that intervention  have proved to be futile in resolving that situation. Neither have the appeals for respect for the most elementary human rights and fundamental freedoms of the people of Afghanistan achieved their purposes. We have witnessed with amazement the intervention in that small country of one of the super-Powers which  because of its military might appears to feel itself invulnerable in the face of the outcry of the international community.171.	The tragedy affecting that country is eloquently evidenced by the Afghan refugees who are fleeing to Pakistan and whose fate deserves priority consideration by this Organization. Chile shares that concern.172.	Unfortunately  the case of Afghanistan is not unique. We have witnessed  with distress  the bloody and lengthy struggle of the people of Kampuchea.173.	The millions of refugees  whose sad story has made an impact on international public opinion  necessarily constitute another humanitarian problem of vital importance for the United Nations. Chile  as in the case of the refugees of Afghanistan  has contributed in so far as possible to the efforts made to resolve this situation. We trust that the generous assistance provided by countries actually reaches those for whom it is intended and who need it so badly. We most sincerely appreciate the work accomplished by the international organizations and other entities  such as the International Red Cross  engaged in this noble humanitarian task.174.	It will soon be one year since the unusual problem of the diplomatic hostages in Iran began. We note the continued breach of the most basic rights and immunities en-shrined in numerous international instruments.175.	The crisis in the Middle East continues to be one of the political situations which cause the most pressure and which most threaten the peace of the world.176.	The recent seventh special session of the General Assembly testifies to the priority assigned by the international community to the solution of the Middle East problem and its main element  the question of Palestine.177.	The Government of Chile supports without reservation the endeavour of the United Nations to find an urgent solution to the crisis in the Middle East. It believes  likewise  that all efforts towards peace in that region should be welcomed and encouraged by the entire international community.178.	A realistic solution should be based on the withdrawal of Israel from all the occupied territories  on the acknowledgement of the right of the States of the region  including Israel  to live within secure and recognized boundaries and on the full exercise of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  including the establishment of a sovereign and an independent State  in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations  especially those of the Security Council.179.	We are concerned over the situation in Lebanon  a State with which we have close ties of friendship. Many sons on that land are of Chilean nationality. We support the efforts of the Government of Lebanon to achieve peace  unity and prosperity  as well as the important work performed by this Organization in that country.180.	As regards the grave situation which has arisen between Iran and Iraq  my Government wishes to put on record its support for the appeal issued by the Security Council  through its resolution 479 (1980)  to end the conflict and bring about a peaceful settlement in accordance with the principles of justice and international law.181.	On the African continent  my country has been particularly pleased to witness the birth of the State of Zimbabwe  after so many years of struggle and suffering. For us  it is historical evidence of the positive mission which can and should be carried out by the United Nations in the peaceful settlement of international disputes whenever the parties show goodwill and a readiness to reach an agreement. My Government cannot fail to express its appreciation to those who have made this achievement possible  especially the people of Zimbabwe and the Government of the United Kingdom  whose flexibility and determination have brought the Lancaster House agreements to a happy conclusion.182.	While expressing our best wishes for the well-being of the people of Zimbabwe and for its progress on the path of freedom  development and social progress  we trust that it may serve as an example in other unresolved situations  such as the case of Namibia. In this regard we call on the parties to make it possible for the Security Council plan for Namibia to be carried out.183.	Our firm support for decolonization and the self- determination of peoples is accompanied by our forceful condemnation of all types of racial discrimination  including apartheid  and of all foreign intervention in the solution of Africa's problems.184.	We share with our sister countries in Latin America a common destiny towards which we must advance guided by common principles and values. We must unite our efforts in positive action for the benefit of all peoples. The closer relations among our nations  the increase in trade and the regional co-operation are all pointing in that direction.185.	We are glad to observe such tendencies on the continent. The meeting held at Montevideo last August  which gave rise to the Association for Latin American Integration and which I had the honour to attend  is eloquent evidence of that spirit of co-operation.186.	However  we cannot conceal our concern over the foreign intervention and the escalation of terrorism in some regions of America. We wish to see the American continent free from the scourge of terrorism and of totalitarian ideologiesâso alien to its historical and cultural traditionsâwhich imperialist interests are attempting to introduce in the region for hegemonistic purposes.187.	The international community has witnessed how Chile  faithful to its tradition of using peaceful means to settle international disputes  had recourse to the mediation of His Holiness Pope John Paul II in connection with the dispute with the sister republic of Argentina.188.	Thus on 8 January 1979 both countries signed the Montevideo Agreement  through which they agreed to request the mediation of His Holiness and solemnly undertook not to resort to the threat or use of force in their mutual relations.189.	Under the lofty guidance of that august mediator  the parties submitted their respective positions and conducted active negotiations aimed at finding points of agreement so as to facilitate a just and definitive solution to the controversy.190.	Chile has emphasized and now reaffirms its appreciation of the noble mediating task performed by His Holiness the Pope and expresses its trust in that high office.191.	My country is confident that the solution of the controversy of concern to us must be found on the basis of the mutual readiness and the goodwill of the Governments to unite in their efforts for the well-being of their peoples and of full respect for the rules of international law and the agreements and commitments we have signed  which constitute the foundation for harmonious relations between States.192.	In this decade the world is facing increasingly urgent economic problems. The solution to those problems  which has so long been postponed  cannot be set aside indefinitely.193.	Our indecisiveness concerning the need for structural changes offers the prospect of a grim future characterized by slow economic growth  high rates of inflation and increased unemployment in developed and developing countries alike.194.	The international community  despite the diverse and complex problems facing it  should not forget the sufferings of millions of human beings who are experiencing extreme poverty in the lower income countries. We all share that responsibility. This is Chile's understanding.195.	None the less  international co-operation is weakened by the decreasing flows of financial aid  the alarming increase in protectionist and discriminatory barriers against exports from the developing countries and the persistent instability imposed today by international currency conditions.196.	During the 1950s and part of the 1960s  the world economy was surprisingly prosperous. To a great extent  this was accounted for by the more liberal economic policies of the developed nations and their favourable impact on the increase in international trade. However  those same nations which in the past promoted free trade are now  paradoxically  supporting a sort of ""organized free trade""  involving protectionist measures and commitments for ""self-limitation of exports"".197.	My country regards the subject of energy as a fundamental element in the restructuring of present international economic relations.198.	The developing countries have been doubly affected by the sudden rise in the price of energy  inasmuch as we have felt its direct impact through our hydrocarbon imports and have had to absorb the increase in prices of manufactured goods  resulting from the adjustment policies of the industrialized countries.199.	My Government deems it vitally important to support all feasible initiatives aimed at channelling funds to finance investments and provide needed assistance for the development of conventional and non-conventional sources of energy in the developing countries  especially in those where there is a considerable shortfall in domestic oil production.200.	The facts I have mentioned and the far from satisfactory results of the eleventh special session of the General Assembly prompt us to affirm the need for greater political will on the part of the developed countries. We appeal to them to realize the importance of their role in solving inter-national economic problems and in the growth of the developing countries.201.	We  the countries of the third world  must also contribute with our efforts and our dedication to maintain our economies  ensuring that resources are not uselessly squandered and making it possible for our entire populations to share in the benefits of development.202.	That is my Government's understanding of the position and five years ago it began a process of restructuring which enabled it to adjust to changes in the world economy  thus avoiding the maintenance of obsolete systems of production regardless of cost.203.	This development has been characterized by a higher growth rate than obtained in the past and by increased economic independence. The overall growth of Chile's economy during the period 1976 to 1980 amounted to 40 per cent.204.	Moreover  the Government of Chile has assigned top priority to the redistributive role which the State should play for the benefit of the neediest  since the 1970 census revealed that 21 per cent of Chileans lived in conditions of dire poverty.205.	In order to overcome this tragic social and economic situationâwhich is shared by many of our nationsâand to permit the inhabitants of the country equitably to share in the benefits offered by economic development  my Government has considerably increased its social expenditures  including financing of programmes in the fields of health  nutrition  education  housing and social security.206.	Thus  social expenditure has been increased from 27 per cent of Government spending in 1973 to 53 per cent in 1980.207.	Significant social progress has been achieved  and this is due to the stability of our Government system and to the implementation of an economic policy which has proved to be sound and successful.208.	My country  which is greatly interested in the outcome of negotiations on the new convention on the law of the sea  wishes to pay a heartfelt tribute to the author of the first Declaration on the 200-mile maritime zone  the recently deceased former President of Chile  Mr. Gabriel Gonzalez Videla  who had the visionary foresight to proclaim  on 23 June 1947  a principle which is today universally accepted.209.	That statesmanly action  which places him among the pioneers and precursors of the new law of the sea  gave rise to the Declaration of Santiago of 19526 on the maritime zone of the countries of the South Pacific linking Chile  Colombia  Peru and Ecuador. Furthermore  this Declaration is one of the bases for the vast process of revision of the law of the sea  a process which culminated in the adoption and signing  at Caracas  of a universal convention on the subject.210.	The important conclusions reached at the ninth session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  especially in connection with questions on the exploration and exploitation of the sea-bed and ocean floor beyond the area of national jurisdiction  cause us to look forward optimistically to the completion of the broad task undertaken by the United Nations over 10 years ago.211.	In the face of this extended attempt to achieve consensus in the international community  we cannot but voice our rejection of the unilateral adoption of national laws favouring the exploitation of the sea-bed beyond the area of national jurisdiction. These laws lack all validity with regard to the international community. My country endorses the protests raised by  among others  the countries of the South Pacific and of the Group of 77.212.	At the dawn of this new decade  we reaffirm our unlimited support for and commitment to the fundamental principles of the United Nations which the Charter has enshrined as indispensable for peaceful coexistence in the international community.213.	Among other principles  we place emphasis on equal rights  the sovereign equality of States  the fulfilment in good faith of obligations undertaken  the peaceful settlement of disputes  the refraining from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State  non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States  the self-determination of peoples and international co-operation.214.	We know that this task is difficult. We know that some States pay lip-service to these principles without ever having honoured them; we know that they distort them in order to use them against other States whose political regimes constitute barriers to their hegemonistic endeavours. We know too that however difficult the task it must never be abandoned. That is Chile's resolve."
"25",1300,"CHN",35,1980,"ï»¿Mr. President  first of all allow me to extend warm congratulations to you on your being elected President of the thirty fifth session of the General Assembly. We believe that under your presidency the current session will achieve new successes in the noble cause of maintaining international peace and security.81.	This year we are celebrating the thirty-fifth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations and the twentieth anniversary of the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution 1514 (XV) containing the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. On this occasion we note with pleasure that four more countriesâZimbabwe  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Kiribati and Vanuatuâhave joined the ranks of independent countries since last year. We warmly welcome the admission of Zimbabwe and of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to the United Nations. It is our sincere hope that these newly independent countries will play an active role in international affairs and make their contributions to the cause of world peace and to the progress of mankind.82.	The past year has witnessed encouraging progress in the struggle to win national liberation  defend state independence and safeguard world peace. The brilliant victory of the Zimbabwe people marks a significant turning point in the course of the African people's struggle to root out colonialist and racist domination in southern Africa. The just demand of the Palestinian and other Arab peoples for the recovery of their lost territories and the restoration to the Palestinian people of their national rights has won increasingly extensive support throughout the world. Irresistibly  the national democratic movement of the Latin American peoples continues to develop in depth. The peoples of Kampuchea and Afghanistan  holding high the sacred banner of safeguarding national independence and fighting heroically against brute force  have upset the smug calculations of foreign aggressors for a quick decision in the war and exacted an ever heavier price from them. In 1980 the United Nations  the Islamic Conference  the Association of Southeast Asian Nations [ASEAN]  the Organization of African Unity [OAU] and the European Community have made a series of very important decisions on the major international issues of today  giving expression to the urgent desire of all peoples for world peace  security and justice. The unprecedentedly strong reaction to the Afghan incident shows that the struggle of the people of the whole world against hegemonism and for world peace has reached a new level.83.	However  we cannot ignore the fact that world peace and the independence and security of States are still facing serious threats. The international situation is more tense and turbulent than before. The danger of war is growing. Relying on its vastly increased military strength  the Soviet Union has stepped up its pace of expansion. It has launched a blitzkrieg against Afghanistan and occupied the country by armed force. With Soviet backing  the Vietnamese authorities have not only refused to withdraw their forces from Kampuchea but have invaded the border areas of Thailand  making threats of war against the Southeast Asian countries. Thus the resolutions of the United Nations on Afghanistan and Kampuchea have been grossly trampled underfoot.84.	Prior to the Afghan incident  the Soviet Union had normally carried out its military invasion or subversion of third world countries through its agents. But this time  in Afghanistan  it dropped the mask and sent troops to fight the battle itself. Through its propaganda machine it openly declared that ""under the new historical conditions  the internationalist missions of the Soviet armed forces have broadened"". In other words  the Soviet Union may  under the pretext of fulfilling its ""internationalist obligations""  carry out armed intervention in other countries at will. It even advanced a theory to justify aggression by stating that  in the Soviet Union  ""a hostile Afghanistan is unacceptable  because there is a common border 2 200 kilometres long"". This ""doctrine"" of allowing no hostile neighbours means that all the neighbours of the Soviet Union must show complete obedience. It is even more peremptory and aggressive in nature than the notorious doctrine of ""limited sovereignty"". Based on such logic  would it not be all right for Israel to hold on to the Arab territories it has occupied by force and commit further aggressions against the neighbouring Arab countries that are opposed to its expansionism? Would it not be all right too for the racist regime in South Africa to continue its illegal occupation of Namibia and even send troops for aggression against southern African countries that are opposed to racism? Clearly  in spreading these fallacies  the Soviet Union is trying both to defend its present aggressions and to create theoretical justifications for similar acts in the future. Whether in theory or in practice  the Afghan incident marks a new stage of development in the external expansion of the hegemonists.85.	In sending troops to Afghanistan and supporting the Vietnamese invasion of Kampuchea  the Soviet Union aims not only to enslave those two countries but also to turn them into springboards for further expansion. Both incidents are important steps taken by the hegemonists in their policy of a southward drive. With the dispatch of troops to Afghanistan  the Soviet armed forces have pushed more than 600 kilometres southward to press against the northern and western parts of the Pakistani border and the eastern part of the Iranian border. Another step forward will take them to the Indian Ocean and the shores of the Gulf. By supporting the Vietnamese invasion of Kampuchea  the Soviet Union has strengthened its control over Viet Nam and moved into Cam Ranh bay  thereby advancing its military base in the Far East southward by more than 4 000 kilometres and pressing towards the Straits of Malacca. In driving south towards the Indian Ocean and along the Pacific Ocean  in coordination with its activities of expansion in the Red Sea and in the Horn of Africa  the Soviet Union aims to seize strategic sites in the vast area of crucial importanceâfrom the Red Sea and the Arabian Peninsula in the west  through the Straits of Malacca in the middle and to the South China Sea in the eastâencircle the oil fields in the Gulf and control key international sea lanes. In other words  while further threatening the whole Asia Pacific region  it intends to outflank western Europe and to hasten the completion of its global strategic deployment for world domination.86.	Therefore  the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and its support for the Vietnamese aggression in Kampuchea are certainly not ""accidental"" events  but premeditated acts; not ""defensive"" measures  but offensive and aggressive moves; not ""local"" problems  but major issues affecting the overall situation of the world. The threat they pose to world peace and the security of all countries is not ""temporary"". The hegemonists will never stop where they are. They will see how the wind blows and wait for an opportune moment to start new adventures in order to attain their strategic goals. In these circumstances  while the third world countries located along the route of the hegemonists' southward drive will no doubt bear the brunt of the attack  other countries  including the Western European countries and Japan  will also be facing gravest threats. Should the Soviet Union succeed in every step of its expansion and in its global strategic plan  it will be difficult for the world to avoid another holocaust.87.	It is not without reason that  faced with the realities of intensified arms expansion and war preparations by the Soviet Union over the years and considering the change that has taken place and is going to take place in the global balance of military strength  many people have pointed to the mid1980s as a period of danger. This point of view is not devoid of foundation. That the 1980s opened with the Afghan incident was indeed a bad omen. The incident has further revealed the ambitions of the hegemonists and brought into relief their adventurous nature. Thus an alarm was sounded for the people of the world  awakening them to the fact that the international situation has now reached a crucial point. Faced with the war provocations by the hegemonists  the people of the world must promptly and decisively choose between a resolute counterblow or a steady retreat.88.	We believe that the strategic offensive by the hegemonists should be countered with overall measures so that wherever they seek expansion  they will be held in check. It is not enough just to condemn and call for sanctions against the aggressors. We must also adopt effective measures to help the people of countries subjected to aggression  because in fighting for their national independence and liberty they are in fact struggling for international peace and security. Provided that the countries of the world strengthen their solidarity  coordinate their actions and persist in struggle  it is entirely possible to check the aggressive drive by the hegemonists  upset their global strategic plan and prevent their launching a new world war.89.	But if we yield our positions one after another in the face of hegemonist onslaught  the hegemonists will become even more insatiable and unscrupulous in their expansion and aggression. In the end  we shall be backed against the wall with nothing but the choice between being forced into complete submission or being caught totally unprepared for a major war. The course of the Second World War has demonstrated to the full what a heavy price one has to pay for the failure to make the right choice in time. History does not simply repeat itself  but the lessons of the past are worth taking seriously.90.	At present  the Soviet Union is playing the trick of ""detente"" with great fanfare in order to divert world attention and divide the anti-aggression forces. For some time it has been advocating ""a summit meeting of leaders of States of all the regions of the world""  making appeals to the parliaments and members of parliaments of various countries ""to strengthen peace and detente""  and so on and so forth. As a matter of fact  it has long been the established practice of the hegemonists to pursue aggression and expansion while trumpeting the slogan of ""detente"". Especially after massive aggression and expansion  they always strike a pose of defending peace and launch a big ""detente"" offensive. Was it not the Soviet Union which proposed in 1969  not long after its invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968  that the question of so-called ""strengthening international security"" be considered by the United Nations General Assembly? Shortly after the Afghan incident  it was predicted that the Soviet Union would come forward with another round of the ""detente"" offensive. As it turned out  that was exactly what happened. The new item entitled ""Urgent measure for reducing the war danger"" proposed by Mr. Gromyko; the plenary meeting yesterday for consideration at the current session is precisely that kind of thing. The facts show that the armed aggression against Afghanistan being carried out by the Soviet Union constitutes in itself a grave threat to world peace. If the Soviet Union is really sincere about ""reducing the war danger""  is there any action more ""urgent"" and practical than the scrupulous implementation of General Assembly resolution ES6/2  endorsed by 104 countries  and the immediate and total withdrawal of its aggressor forces from Afghanistan?91.	In the face of the current pressing international situation  the Chinese people are determined to keep up the struggle against hegemonism together with the peace-loving and justice upholding peoples all over the world. The Chinese Government will maintain its consistent foreign policy of peace and wishes to establish and develop State relations with all countries on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence. But we are resolutely opposed to any act of hegemonism. We take this stand not merely for the sake of our own security but  more importantly  with a view to safeguarding the overall interests o world peace.92.	The question of how to check the naked armed aggression in Afghanistan and Kampuchea must have priority over other issues on the agenda of the current session of the General Assembly.93.	More than eight months have elapsed since the sixth emergency special session of the General Assembly adopted a resolution by 104 votes  calling for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan. However  the Afghan people continue to shed their blood because foreign aggressor troops are still engaged in the massacre  over 1 million Afghan refugees have been compelled to flee the country and the number continues to rise. While intensifying its repression of the Afghan patriots  the Soviet Union instructed the Kabul regime to put forward a so-called ""seven point proposal"" for the settlement of the Afghan question  advocating bilateral negotiations between the Kabul regime and Governments of neighbouring countries. The aim of the Soviet Union is to legitimize the Afghan regime it has installed through military intervention and to confuse the public so that the crux of the Afghan question would appear to be a matter of relations between Afghanistan and its neighbouring countries  and not one of Soviet armed aggression. Such a proposal has of course met with universal opposition.94.	Viet Nam has behaved exactly the same way in Kampuchea as the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. Disregarding General Assembly resolution 34/22  adopted by 91 votes  Viet Nam has not only persisted in its aggression against Kampuchea but also extended the flames of war to Kampuchea's neighbour  posing an increasingly serious threat to peace and stability in Southeast Asia.95.	After the recent setback in its armed incursion into Thailand  Viet Nam  acting as the overlord in IndoChina  has dished up a so-called ""four point proposal"" for defusing the tension along the Thai Kampuchean border. While evading the question of the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Kampuchea  the proposal calls for the establishment of a demilitarized zone along the Thai Kampuchean border and advocates negotiations between Thailand and the Heng Samrin regime. In essence  this is an attempt to force others to recognize the puppet regime in Kampuchea  installed and propped up by Viet Nam at bayonet point  and to divert attention from Vietnamese armed aggression  which is at the core of the Kampuchean issue.96.	Thailand and other ASEAN countries have sternly rejected this unreasonable Vietnamese proposal. The Thai Government has sharply pointed out that the proposal represents ""an attempt to legitimize the illegal presence of foreign forces in Kampuchea"". Viet Nam has now sanctimoniously requested that the ""Question of peace  stability and cooperation in Southeast Asia"" be included in the agenda of the current session of the General Assembly. One cannot help asking: in Southeast Asia today  which country  in fact  has stationed its troops on foreign soil? Which country has tried to overthrow the Government of another country by means of armed aggression? Which country  after all  is sabotaging peace  stability and cooperation in the region?97.	It is understandable that some countries hope to find a political settlement of the Afghan and Kampuchean questions so as to ease international tension. China is in favour of a just and reasonable political settlement of the two questions. However  we are opposed to any political settlement based on the acceptance of the faits accomplis created by the aggressors. We should guard against their attempts to distract public attention in the name of seeking a political solution  and to turn negotiations for a political settlement into an endless debate so that they may buy time to step up their military actions and consolidate their gains from aggression. We should likewise guard against their attempt  in the course of a political solution  to exploit the desire of certain people in the world for momentary peace and security and to induce them to sacrifice the fundamental interests of the Afghan and Kampuchean peoples.98.	The Afghan and Kampuchean incidents have the same characteristics. In the joint statement issued at Kuala Lumpur last March by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of ASEAN and the European Community  it was pointed out that the two incidents ""have as a common denominator the imposition of will on small independent States by foreign Powers through the use of force in open violation of international law  thereby threatening international peace and securityâ. In the view of the Chinese delegation  a just and reasonable settlement of the Afghan and Kampuchean questions requires that the following three basic principles be followed.99.	First  the foreign aggressors must withdraw all their troops immediately and unconditionally from Afghanistan and Kampuchea in compliance with the relevant United Nations resolutions. This is a principle of key importance and the prerequisite of any settlement.100.	Secondly  after the withdrawal of foreign troops  the Afghan and Kampuchean peoples should be free to decide their own destiny without any outside interference. In its resolution  the Eleventh Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers  held at Islamabad from 17 to 22 May of this year  emphasized respect for ""the Afghan people's inalienable right to decide their own form of government and to choose their economic  political and social system"". Recently  the Government of Democratic Kampuchea stated that after the withdrawal of foreign troops from Kampuchea ""the Kampuchean people may choose their own national government through a general election by free  direct or secret ballot  and  if necessary  under the supervision of the United Nations Secretary General or his representative"". The Chinese Government supports the above propositions.101.	Thirdly  Afghanistan and Kampuchea should be restored to their independent and nonaligned status.102.	After the Afghan and Kampuchean questions are settled in accordance with the above three principles  China  in the interest of safeguarding the independence of these two countries and peace in Asia and the world  will be ready to join the other countries concerned in an international guarantee that the territory of Afghanistan or Kampuchea shall not be occupied or used to encroach on the independence and sovereignty of other countries in either region  nor shall there be any form of interference in the internal affairs of these two countries.103.	At the current session the Assembly will also consider some other major international political and economic issues. We should act promptly  wisely and with farsightedness in our effort to find a just  reasonable and effective solution of these issues  not only on the merits of each case but also in consideration of their impact on the world situation as a whole.104.	The Middle East question has been dragging on for several decades  gravely threatening regional and world peace and stability. At the seventh emergency special session of the General Assembly on the question of Palestine  held in July this year  speeches made by many representatives and the final resolution  adopted by 112 votes  expressed the demand of the people of the world for an early comprehensive settlement of the Middle East question. In this connexion  the declaration of the European Community issued at Venice on 13 June also has a positive significance in promoting a Middle East settlement. However  Israel has brazenly declared the above resolution ""illegal""  accelerated its plan of occupying Jerusalem and committed new aggression against Lebanon. This is an act of utter contempt for the international community and a direct challenge to the United Nations. Israel has been so intransigent and arrogant precisely because it feels secure in the knowledge that it has the backing of one superpower and that the other superpower  honey on lips and murder in heart  will not give genuine support to the Arab countries.105.	The Chinese people strongly condemn Israel for its policy of aggression and expansion and for its dogged obstruction of a comprehensive settlement of the Middle East question. We firmly support the just struggle of the Palestinian and other Arab peoples. We favour the position of many countries that Israel should withdraw from the Arab territories it has occupied since 1967  including Jerusalem  that the Palestinian people should regain their national rights  including the rights to return to their homeland  exercise self-determination and establish their own State  and that all the Middle East countries should have the right to independence and existence. We have always held that the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]  being the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  should participate as an interested party in a comprehensive settlement of the Middle East question.106.	The people of Zimbabwe has finally shaken off the yoke of colonialism and racism after protracted armed struggle. This has greatly changed the outlook of southern Africa and will undoubtedly expedite the great historical process of eradicating colonialism and racism from the entire African continent. After independence  the Zimbabwe Government has made creative efforts in handling racial relations at home. This will have a far-reaching impact on future developments in southern Africa. However  to this day the racist regime of South Africa still refuses to end its illegal rule over Namibia; what is more  it has further intensified its repression of the people of South Africa. This is intolerable. We firmly support the correct views of the frontline States on the question of southern Africa. Like Zimbabwe  Namibia should achieve genuine national independence in conformity with the aspirations of its people and on the basis of territorial integrity and national unification. Apartheid and the system of racial discrimination in South Africa should be completely abolished. The United Nations should make its due contribution to the termination of the colonial and racist rule in southern Africa.107.	The developments on the Korean peninsula call for close attention. The military junta in South Korea is intensifying its Fascist dictatorship by every ruthless means. Recently  in defiance of world condemnation  this regime has brazenly pronounced a death sentence on the well-known democrat  Kim Dae Jung. All this has not only created new obstacles to the North South dialogue and the peaceful reunification of Korea  but has also added to the destabilizing factors in the Korean situation. A reasonable solution of the Korean question will be of major significance to the maintenance of peace in East Asia and the Pacific region. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea has put forward a series of formulas and proposals for the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea and has worked tirelessly to this end. On its part  the international community should help to create favourable conditions for its realization. It is necessary to implement as soon as possible the relevant resolution of the General Assembly adopted five years ago by dissolving the ""United Nations Command""  withdrawing all the United States military forces and equipment from South Korea and converting the Korean armistice agreement into a peace agreement through negotiations between the parties concerned.108.	We are deeply concerned over the recent military conflict between Iraq and Iran. We sincerely hope that the two parties will cease hostilities speedily and settle their disputes through peaceful negotiations so as not to be exploited by those harbouring ulterior motives.109.	The current session  moreover  cannot shut its eyes to the stark economic situation prevailing in the world today. Most developing countries  poor in the first place  are now finding their economic situation deteriorating further. The disparity in wealth between North and South is in fact widening. An important reason for this is that  though politically independent  the third world countries are hampered by the old international economic order. This inequitable international economic order must be reformed if the economic development of the developing countries is to be promoted. The recently concluded eleventh special session of the General Assembly reached consensus on the international Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade  which  to a certain degree  reflects the desire of the developing countries. However  on the question of global economic negotiations  the session has failed to achieve the progress it should have achieved. In this connexion  we hope that the current session will take a bigger step forward to make a good start in the global economic negotiations and guide them in the direction of strengthening economic cooperation between nations on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. The key to this hinges on the renewed efforts on the part of the developed countries  which would hardly be able to expand their own economies without economic ties and cooperation with the third world countries. What is more  the present international situation requires them to look farther ahead from a vantage point and approach the North South relations from an overall strategic perspective. Improvement in the economic situation of the third world and better North South economic relations will contribute not only to world economic stability and growth  but also to the cause of world peace and security.110.	Thirty-five years have elapsed since the founding of the United Nations. During this period  the international Organization itself has undergone great changes. A large number of newly independent countries have become Members of the United Nations. This has so changed the composition of the Organization that it is better able to reflect the aspirations of the people of all countries to the maintenance of international peace  security and justice as well as their desire to promote economic development and social progress. Today  it is no longer possible for any big Power to control and manipulate the United Nations. The United Nations traversed a tortuous road before it became what it is today. This has not come about easily  but through the joint efforts of all countries and peoples that love peace and uphold justice.111.	However  we must not fail to see that the United Nations is facing a grave challenge. It is expressly provided in the Charter that the primary task of the United Nations is to suppress acts of aggression. But actually a good number of correct resolutions adopted by the General Assembly for this purpose have been brazenly violated and undermined by certain Member States. The Charter clearly stipulates that all Members shall refrain in their international relations from the use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State; yet  certain Member States have deliberately violated these provisions. Again  the Charter stipulates in explicit terms that international disputes must be settled in conformity with the principles of justice and international law; yet  certain Member States attempt to replace these principles by the law of the jungle and ""recognition of faits accomplis created by aggression"". The overwhelming majority of the Member States demands that the United Nations effectively fulfil the noble obligations placed on it by the Charter; yet  a tiny minority attempts to lead it onto the tracks of the League of Nations. This is an intense struggle  which can be won by the overwhelming majority of the Member States only if they persevere in opposing and suppressing by deeds as well as words  both inside and outside the United Nations  any violation of the United Nations Charter.112.	This is the first session of the General Assembly in the 1980s. The coming decade will be a complicated and volatile decade  fraught with crises. Therefore  people have every reason to expect the current session to make a new contribution to opposing aggression  preventing war  safeguarding peace and promoting progress  so that a good start may be made in the work of the United Nations in the 1980s. We must not disappoint the people of the world. China is ready to work together with other Member States for the success of the current session and for the implementation of the purposes and principles of the United Nations as laid down in the Charter"
"26",1343,"CIV",35,1980,"ï»¿May I at the outset  on behalf of the delegation of the Ivory Coast and on my own behalf  offer most heartfelt and cordial congratulations following the unanimous vote which has brought Ambassador von Wechmar to the office of the presidency of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. His election is the recognition of the contribution of the Federal Republic of Germany to the establishment of detente between East and West  and peace in the world. It is likewise a tribute to his personal qualities and to the meritorious efforts which he has unswervingly deployed since he has represented his country with unlimited distinction at the United Nations for the triumph of the ideals of the Organization. Nor are we ready to forget the decisive role he played within the group of five Western Powers working towards a peaceful settlement of the Namibian conflict and which has elaborated for this purpose a plan which the United Nations has endorsed. I wish from the bottom of my heart that the lofty mission entrusted to him will be fully crowned with success  and I wish to assure him of the entire and unalloyed co-operation of my delegation.171.	May I offer my sincere gratitude to his predecessor  Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim  who has carried out his task with the talent and competence that are well known to us. There is no doubt that the General Assembly  in electing him as a representative of Africa to direct its work  chose well.172.	I would be remiss if I were not to express my gratitude to our dynamic and courageous Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  for his tireless dedication to the objectives of the United Nations.173.	The Ivory Coast is pleased with the progress achieved since the last session of the General Assembly in the sphere of decolonization. The access to independence of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines was preceded by that of the Republic of Zimbabwe and the Republic of Vanuatu. It is with great joy that I hail the admission of Zimbabwe and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to the United Nations. I should like to assure their delegations of all our sympathy and our earnest desire to maintain the best possible relations with them. We are particularly gratified at the process by which the transfer of power to the majority has been carried out and at the reconciliation which has taken place between the racial communities within Zimbabwe.174.	The Ivory Coast hopes that the Republic of South Africa will soon draw the necessary lessons from the settlement of the question of Southern Rhodesia  because the situation prevailing in southern Africa is a source of profound concern to us.175.	The war continues to claim victims in Namibia and in the neighbouring States. Violence continues to grow in South Africa itself. Blind  merciless and bloody repression strikes down school children who in their turn dare to denounce openly the inhuman and odious system of apartheid and racial discrimination. Those who endure this system and South African occupation are quite naturally ready to enter into a pact with the devil himself to escape their situation and to satisfy their legitimate aspirations for freedom and human dignity.176.	The occupation of Namibian territory  apartheid and racial discrimination thus constitute threats to peace and security in Africa and are promoting foreign interference. With every passing day this danger increases. It is indeed high time to put an end to this situation.177.	The Government of the Ivory Coast urgently appeals to the South African Government to facilitate the implementation of the United Nations plan for the settlement of the Namibian question. An internal settlement of this question  of which the establishment of a council of ministers seems to be the beginning  appears quite clearly to be doomed to failure  as was the case with Southern Rhodesia. Only the organization of free and democratic elections  as provided for in the United Nations plan  can lead to a lasting settlement of the conflict and bring peace to Namibia. We exhort the five Western Powers to continue to work for a peaceful solution of this problem  in spite of the difficulties which prevent the implementation of the United Nations plan.178.	The Ivory Coast wishes to reaffirm its position with respect to the policy of apartheid  now that the Government of South Africa has taken an initiative in creating a consultative body composed of representatives of the various communities of the country  but excluding the black community. My country considers that it is only through dialogue between all the communities without any exception that it will be possible to promote their harmonious coexistence. That coexistence cannot be conceived of except in an acceptance of fundamental freedoms and equality of rights for all citizens of South Africa  without any consideration of race.179.	The Ivory Coast is deeply concerned also by other conflicts on the African continent  those in the Horn of Africa  in Chad and Western Sahara. It cannot conceal its bitterness at the fact that interventions by OAU have so far not made it possible to make any progress in the settlement of those conflicts. It deplores foreign interference in the Horn of Africa. The situation prevailing in that region strengthens us in our conviction that the only way to protect Africa against such interference is through a policy of neutrality based  as we have so frequently stated from this rostrum  on peace within each African country; peace between African countries; and peace between African countries and the rest of the world. We renew our appeal to the parties to the conflicts in the African continent to settle their conflicts by resorting to peaceful means  to brotherly dialogue  free from any foreign interference.180.	Because of its persistence and its gravity  and because of the destruction and sorrow it causes  the conflict in the Middle East continues to be a source of profound concern. Our position in this respect remains unchanged. We continue to believe that only recourse to dialogue can provide a global  fair and lasting settlement of the conflict. After 30 years of war that have inflicted untold suffering on the peoples of the region  sown death and desolation and caused so much ruin  we could only welcome the attempts at a peaceful settlement of the conflict.181.	The Ivory Coast is pleased with the results already obtained along those lines. It is profoundly convinced that an over-all just and lasting settlement of the conflict is possible if all the parties agree to seek it through negotiationâthat is to say  by means of dialogue. We shall not cease to affirm that that presupposes at the outset refusal by the parties to delude themselves as to the realities of the region. There can be no solution of the conflict without the withdrawal of Israel from occupied Arab territories and without its recognition of the national rights of the Palestinian people  in particular its right to an independent homeland. Nor can there be any solution unless the Palestinians recognize Israel's right to exist. That is the price of peace in that region.182.	We cannot hide our indignation at the violations of such sacred principles of the United Nations Charter as respect for sovereignty  territorial integrity and non-interference in internal affairs  nor our anguish at the resultant threats to international peace and security.183.	Those violations and their consequences  which inevitably bring to mind the sorry period of the cold war  have demonstrated that detente is desired and sought only between the great Powers  and that the developing countries are but pawns and victims of the merciless struggle that pits the two blocs against each other. The great Powers confront each other through proxy States or proxy rival factions within States. Nor are there any scruples about invading a State directly or through an allied Power  regional or otherwise  in order to impose some faction or regime upon it. And unquestionably that is neo-colonialism and imperialism.184.	Thus detente is seen as the absence of any direct confrontation between the great Powers  particularly the two super-Powers  but not as the disappearance of the fundamental antagonisms between East and West  which will come about only through the elimination of one of the competing conceptions of a just order that the two blocs represent.185.	In fact  the great Powers wish to achieve peace not through detente but through the old and dangerous principle of a balance of forces  which inevitably leads to mistrust and an arms race and has begotten all the wars that mankind has known.186.	Disarmament is not possible under such conditions. It is therefore not surprising that the measures adopted so far in this field have not resulted in any significant reduction in armaments  and that they have all been aimed at stabilizing the nuclear balance and consolidating the strategic status quo on the basis of parity. We would reiterate the appeal to the great Powers made by President Felix Houphouet- Boigny  when he said:""Men have adopted the regimes of their choice. They did not create the world. Let them beware of destroying what they have not created  that is to say the world and mankind with it.""187.	The two blocs will be able to achieve peace through detente and disarmament only if they give up trying to convert each other and to impose upon the world their ideologies and their truths  and if each recognizes the right of the other to exist and to be different. In order to assure peace and international security  detente must be global and not limited to the great Powers.188.	The Ivory Coast believes that those States that are not parties to a bloc can contribute positively to the strengthening of peace and international security -if they practise a genuine policy of neutrality. Such a policy implies peace within each of those States  peace between those States  and recourse to dialogue to settle any potential disputes between them.189.	Only neutrality of that kind can protect them from subversion  interference and foreign intervention. It would save the developing countries from allowing themselves to be drawn into the rivalries between the two blocs  having to spend millions of dollars for the purchase of weapons and the creation and training of powerful armies and thus sacrificing their development. The only worthwhile kind of competition between the great Powers in these countries is competition which relates strictly to the economic  social  technical and technological fields.190.	Our policy of being open to the world  without any exclusions  which was affirmed at the Congress of the Democratic Party of the Ivory Coast  just held at Abidjan  is based upon those considerations.191.	It is clear from the positions I have just outlined that peace is a fundamental goal of my country's foreign policy. Hence the economic crisis through which the world is now passing cannot but be a source of profound disquiet for my country because it contains the germs of conflict and so threatens international peace and security. As a result of unjust economic relations and of an economic system instituted by and for the developed countries  nearly 1 billion human beings in the developing countries are undernourished  and many millions of them are dying from hunger.192.	The World Food Conference that was convened in 1974 following the food crisis of 1972 and 1973 considered that within 10 years it might be possible to ensure that no child would go to bed with an empty stomach and that no family would have fears about food for the morrow. Today it appears that  if considerable efforts are not made during the next 20 years  there will still be 400 million malnourished persons in the year 2000.193.	And yet the development efforts of the developing countries are being held back by the decrease in their export revenues that results from the constant deterioration in the terms of trade. That is why the Ivory Coast is gratified by the felicitous results of the negotiations on the creation of a Common Fund under the Integrated Programme for Commodities  of UNCTAD.194.	Certainly  all the wishes of the developing countries have not been fulfilled. In particular it is clear that  compared to the $6 billion initially contemplated for an attempt  with some chance of success  to stabilize the prices of the 18 commodities of the Integrated Programme  the $750 million finally agreed on is not very much. But the agreement that made it possible to establish a Common Fund seems to symbolize the rich countries' realization of the need to stabilize the export incomes of the poor countries.195.	We hope that the conditions for the operation of the Fund will rapidly be formulatedâin particular as far as concerns the entry into force of the agreement that established it  the constitution of its two windows and the conclusion of agreements on commodities.196.	We wish the establishment of the Common Fund to mark the beginning of the disappearance of the spirit of speculation that prevails in exchanges between developed and developing countries  and the beginning of the process that will lead to the stabilization of the prices of raw materials  the principal element of the new international economic order.197.	It is indeed paradoxical that the developed countries should be asking for the stabilization of petroleum prices when they do not agree to the stabilization of the prices of commodities such as cocoa and coffee. Need we recall that it was in order to avoid the speculation to which petroleum fell victim that the exporting countries established a common front?198.	The spirit of speculation of the wealthy countries is therefore at the root of the rise in petroleum prices which is engendering inflation throughout the world  excessive indebtedness  increased deficit in the balance of payments  and increased wretchedness in the developing countries. lt leads to the death of freedom and encourages subversion and foreign interference and intervention in those countries. In short  it leads to their destabilization.199.	As has been stated by President Houphouet-Boigny ""Poverty resulting from speculation on other raw materials may well in the long run create a situation that is dangerous both for those who are the victims of those evil practices and for those who engage in them  a situation that is bound to be exploited by those who try to fish in troubled waters.""200.	A new international economic order implies also that manufactured goods produced in factories  sold to the developing countries by the developed countries should not be restricted or denied access to the markets of the latter. The industrialization of the developing countries would gain as a result  and achievement of the goal of the Lima Declaration of 29 July 1980  which provides for their share of world industrial production to be increased from 7 to 25 per cent by the year 2000  would be facilitated.201.	It would be mutually beneficial for the developed as well as the developing countries if the Tokyo Round agreements concluded in 1979  which are designed to lower customs duties and to eliminate non-tariff barriers to trade  could be implemented. It has been demonstrated that the number of unemployed in the third world would be reduced by 6 million by 1986 without halting the expansion of employment in the developed countries if the latter would progressively end restrictions on the import of manufactures from the South. The argument according to which a broadening of the developed countries' markets for such imports would lead to increasing unemployment in those countries is therefore groundless. On the contrary  it is protectionism which constitutes a threat to employment in the developed countries.202.	The establishment of a new economic order also calls for reform of the international monetary system. The latter must take the form of replacing the floating exchange rates  which generate insecurity  by fixed or stabilized parities. There again  it is the developed countries which bear the responsibility for the reforms. It is for them to put an end to the present monetary disorder. The reform of the monetary system should make it possible to establish a link between the creation of new liquidities and the granting of supplementary resources to the developing countries so as to bring about a large-scale transfer of the financial resources necessary for their development.203.	We are therefore pleased at the decision taken during the annual meeting of IMF and the World Bank  which has just been held  to authorize the developing countries to receive larger loans than those that have been granted to them in terms of their quotas.204.	Any discussion of a present economic crisis must include a reference to the problems of the world energy supply. It has been shown that without a massive and generalized mobilization of all energy resources  there will be an energy shortage within 20 years. Energy consumption in the third world countries will triple by the year 2000 and will represent 37 per cent of world consumption  compared with 25 per cent at present.205.	The investments required in order to ensure fulfilment of energy requirements by the year 2000 are enormous. They are estimated at $10 000 billion. More than half that amount relates to the nuclear power industry  the principal replacement source of energy in the industrialized countries. However  it is essentially in the developing countries that the problems of investment with respect to energy arise most acutely.206.	We are bound  therefore  to welcome the project to establish a branch of the World Bank designed to finance the energy development of the poor countries  whose author is Mr. Robert McNamara  President of the Bank. We trust that the project  which comes at the right time to strengthen the hopes that we have placed in the United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy  will soon see the light of day.207.	We urge the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly to adopt decisions to set in motion global negotiations within the framework of the North-South dialogue. We also appeal to the developing countries  and in particular to the richer ones  to display their genuine solidarity by organizing among themselves a system of co-operation in order to deal with the world economic crisis.208. The division of the world into two political and military blocs has not made it possible for the United Nations so far to come anywhere near assuming its responsibilities with respect to the maintenance of international peace and security. But it could be different if Member States  accepting themselves as they are  had a just  equitable and realistic understanding of the growing interdependence of their economies.209.	The Organization could then be the framework for fraternal and active solidarity in which Member States could take joint action to ensure that millions of people do not die of hunger  that 70 per cent of the children of the third world no longer suffer from malnutrition  that a billion human beings are no longer doomed to illiteracy and that the riches of the earth can be equitably distributed among the nations.210.	Before this common aspiration for the happiness of men  of all men without exception  man's hostility towards man would begin to be blunted  force would be replaced by dialogue and the world would come to know genuine peace."
"27",1380,"CMR",35,1980,"ï»¿Mr. President  I should like  first of all  to associate myself with you in conveying  on my own behalf and that of my delegation  our most profound condolences to the delegation of the Byelorussian SSR on the distressing loss it has just experienced in the death of Mr. Pyotr Masherov  First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Byelorussia  a death that occurred on 4 October. We wish to extend to the delegation of the Byelorussian SSR our most profound sympathy.4.	Mr. President  since I am speaking for the first time in this Assembly  I should first of all like to tell you how happy my delegation is at seeing you elected unanimously to a post of such prestige and delicate responsibilities as that of President of the General Assembly at its thirty-fifth session. You are the distinguished representative of a country which  through its energy and determination  has won the admiration and respect of the international community. But you are  above all  the representative of a friendly country  the Federal Republic of Germany  whose history has left its imprint on the destiny of my country  the United Republic of Cameroon.5.	That historic encounter between our peoples has served  ever since Cameroon became independent  to enrich in particular the development and strengthening of multifaceted and mutually advantageous co-operation between our two countries  both bilaterally and multilaterally  and especially through our association in the Treaty of Rome through the Conventions of YaoundÃ©  of 1963 and 1969  and of Lome  of 1975 and 1979.6.	I wish to assure you of my delegation's complete readiness and firm determination to give you every possible co-operation to enable you to discharge your important functions effectively. Your qualities as an experienced diplomat and your vast knowledge of the problems of the world strengthen our conviction that you will contribute decisively to the solution of the various urgent problems facing our Assembly.7.	I should like also to take this occasion to pay a tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim  for the patient authority and the distinction with which he conducted the proceedings of the Assembly over the last 12 months. We are grateful to him for having so worthily responded to the hopes placed in him by Africa and the international community.8.	My delegation also takes this occasion to reaffirm our great satisfaction at the manner in which the Secretary- General has been discharging his important and delicate functions  and at his ceaseless efforts to enable the international community to solve the problems of the day in accordance with the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations.9.	It is a pleasure for me to repeat here the congratulations of my country to Zimbabwe upon its accession to independence  after one of the most bitter and fierce liberation struggles in the history of decolonization  under the aegis of the Patriotic Front and with the support of the international community. Cameroon looks forward to co-operating with this new sister republic in the Organization of African Unity [OAU] and within the greater family of non-aligned nations  as well as in the United Nations itself.10.	Finally  I wish to welcome the accession to independence of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and its admission to membership of our Organization as its one hundred and fifty-fourth Member State. In spite of the physical distance between our two countries  the historical and cultural heritage of our peoples makes us feel certain that we will enjoy friendly and fraternal co-operation.11.	The work of the thirty-fifth session of the Assembly is taking place in an international situation which is in the grip of crises: a political crisis because of the resurgence of hegemonistic rivalries that give rise to the tension  instability and conflict that constantly beset the third world and seriously affect the spirit of detente; an economic crisis as a result of the collapse of the lopsided system established right after the Second World War  and of the reluctance of the affluent countries to embrace the concepts of a new  more just and more equitable international economic order and resolutely to commit themselves to its establishment as a way out of our present difficulties; a social  cultural crisis  a crisis of civilization  if ever there was one  because of the generalized uncertainty  fear  mistrust and poverty which are the inevitable outcome of the situation.12.	In Africa  our primary concern and the least developed continent in spite of its vast natural and human resources and potential  the situation remains disturbing because of the persistence of apartheid and the instability engendered by various sources of tension  which are themselves in turn generated and revived by the effects of decolonization  by greed and by foreign interference.13.	Against such a background  Zimbabwe's accession to independence was a breakthrough and a decisive stage in the process of the total liberation of our continent from all colonial oppression and racial discrimination. Unfortunately  however  the significance of that far-reaching event  as far as Namibia and the oppressed peoples of South Africa are concerned  does not seem to have been fully grasped by the Pretoria racist regime.14.	In Namibia  indeed  the prospects remain confused. The hopes raised by the adoption of the United Nations plan to permit that international Territory to gain independence through free and democratic elections under United Nations supervision and control have constantly been thwarted by the negatively ambiguous attitude of the South African Government. Its considerable correspondence addressed to the Secretary-General  particularly its letter of 12 May last  which raised new  entirely fictitious  trumped-up difficulties in order to distract the attention of our Organization  is particularly enlightening in this regard. The recent setting up in Namibia of a so-called ministerial council  in our view  marks the beginning of the end of the process of an internal settlement  which we have ceaselessly  denounced and condemned.15.	It is urgent  therefore  for the international community to do its utmost to thwart this cynical design. Those who have assumed responsibility for the conception and adoption of the United Nations plan for a peaceful settlement of the Namibian question must make use of the decisive assets they possess to prevail upon South Africa to co-operate with the Secretary-General in implementing the plan. The persistence of the Namibian problem  because of the dynamics of war and the instability caused thereby  and because of the interests of the Powers in the region  is a threat to international peace and security  in addition to eroding the authority and credibility of our Organization  which has thus far shown a certain laxity in the face of the bad faith and arrogance of the South African regime.16.	In this regard  the position of my country  which has assumed important responsibilities in the United Nations Council for Namibia  is well known. It was recently recalled by the President of the United Republic of Cameroon  His Excellency Mr. Ahmadou Ahidjo. Cameroon supports the struggle of the Namibian people  represented by the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO]  and its right to self-determination and independence in a united Namibia  including Walvis Bay. We reject any unilateral solution devised and imposed by South Africa; we support the practical arrangements for implementing the settlement plan accepted by the Security Council in its resolution 435 (1978). Finally  we are convinced of the need to bring to bear against South Africa the enforcement measures provided for in Chapter VII of the Charter to compel that country to co-operate with the United Nations.17.	This same conviction determines our approach to the situation in South Africa itself  where the criminal policy of apartheid  in spite of certain superficial adjustments  continues to keep the overwhelming majority of the South African people in servitude  and receives encouragement through the passivity of certain Powers and the weight of foreign interests.18.	The aggravation of tension and the violent incidents which are proliferating in that country attest to the resolution and determination of the oppressed people of South Africa to throw off the yoke of apartheid and recover their dignity. The international community must support this legitimate struggle by active assistance to the South African liberation movements and the actions proposed to this effect by the OAU and the United Nations.19.	In its determination to work for the total liberation of the African continent from colonial domination and racial discrimination  Cameroon will continue to support  as it has in the past  the decisions of those two organizations and to provide aid and assistance to the liberation movements concerned.20.	Apart from the explosive situation which persists in southern Africa  elsewhere on our continent the independence of several young States continues to be threatened by foreign interference  the persistence of fratricidal conflicts and the proliferation of sources of tension.21.	My delegation vigorously reaffirms its view that in order to remedy this situationâwith its resulting instability and waste of energy and resourcesâwe should abide by the letter and spirit of the Charter and recognize and respect the inalienable right of every country freely to decide its own destiny.22.	Cameroon  which has always worked for the strengthening of friendship and co-operation among peoples  will continue within the framework of its policy of peace  non- alignment and co-operation with all countries which respect its identity  independence  political options and social and economic policies  to provide support both within the United Nations and through the appropriate committees of the OAU to the search for an authentically African settlement of these conflicts.2.3. Whether they stem from the process of decolonization or result from internal or inter-State conflicts  these crisis situations are accompanied by destruction  poverty and an increasing number of refugees and displaced persons  who in Africa alone number 5 million.24.	The international community should give to the consideration of this problem all necessary attention  in the light of the efforts made by the host countries. It is fortunate that this item has been included in the agenda of this session.25.	We are also pleased to note the consultations under way between the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the Secretary-General of the OAU with a view to organizing an international pledging conference for refugees in Africa.26.	The principles contained in our Charter  in particular non-interference in the internal affairs of States  the non-use of force or the threat of force  and the peaceful settlement of disputes  should guide us in our efforts to resolve the conflicts which are raging in various parts of the world.27.	These principles must more than ever before govern the search for a just and lasting settlement of the conflict in the Middle East  where dangerous tension continues to develop.28.	Of course  the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council fall within this framework; but the fact that all the interested parties have not complied with those resolutions with a view to their effective implementation  makes the prospect of world peace rather vague and distant.29.	For its part  Cameroon is convinced that the settlement of the Palestinian question is the key to any peaceful  just and lasting solution of the Middle East problem. This means that the Palestinian people  under the aegis of its authentic representative  the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]  should be able freely to exercise all its inalienable rights  including that to a homeland in Arab Palestine  and to participate on an equal footing with all other parties and at all levels in any process for the settlement of the conflict.30.	A just and lasting peace in that part of the world necessarily entails the withdrawal of Israel from all Arab territories occupied by in since 1967 and recognition of the right of all States in the area  including Israel  to live in peace within internationally recognized borders. It is to be deplored in this regard that  in spite of the resolutions of our Organization and the pressure of world public opinion  Israel continues to strengthen its presence in the occupied Arab territories by multiplying its settlements and its recent decision to make Jerusalem its eternal and indivisible capital.31.	We are pleased to note that the Security Council  in its resolution 478 (1980)  adopted on 20 August last  declared that decision null and void and reaffirmed the international status of the Holy City.32.	My Government has never underestimated the complexity of the Israeli-Arab conflict and the need to exercise patience in order to bring about a lasting settlement. We are also convinced that such a process could be accelerated if all the parties to the conflict showed the same spirit of accommodation and willingness to co-operate.33.	It seems to us to be indispensable to reverse the present trend towards excessive militarization of that region and to promote there a new climate of detente and co-operation free from any outside intervention and hegemonistic rivalries.34.	It is in this spirit that we appeal urgently for the preservation of the independence of Lebanon  its unity and its territorial integrity.35.	In the same spirit  we appeal to Iran and Iraq to put an end to their hostilities  lay down their arms and agree to settle their dispute at the negotiating table. The interest of their peoples demands this. Peace and security in the region make it an urgent necessity.36.	The aggravation of conflicts and the birth in Asia of new crises which continue to threaten international peace and security are of constant concern to us.37.	Whether in Afghanistan or Kampuchea  respect for the cardinal principles of the Charter of the United Nations and those of the non-aligned movement  in particular the obligation on all States in their international relations to refrain from the use or the threat of force  to respect the sovereignty  territorial integrity and independence of States and not to interfere in the internal affairs of other States  remains the solid basis on which any action to normalize the situation should be founded.38.	We hope that the efforts undertaken by the Secretary- General and certain States in the area will very soon make it possible for all the parties concerned to embark upon constructive dialogue with a view to a political solution which will take full account of the principles that I have just mentioned.39.	The same applies to the delicate problem of the island of Cyprus  a founding member of the non-aligned movement  which has been subjected to external interference since 1974 and is now threatened with an explosive situation.40.	Cameroon deplores the fact that the numerous resolutions adopted by the Security Council and the General Assembly to enable the Cypriot population as a whole to exercise its right to full sovereignty and effective control over the whole territory of Cyprus and its natural resources should have remained dead letters.41.	The resumption on 9 August last of intercommunal talks constitutes an encouraging move which should be strengthened by the mediation of the Secretary-General and especially by the declared will of the leaders of the two communities.42.	Cameroon will continue to support any initiative designed to promote fraternal dialogue between the two parties concerned with a view to restoring peace on the island and guaranteeing the sovereignty  territorial integrity and non-alignment of Cyprus.43.	Two years ago  at its tenth special session  devoted to problems of disarmament  the General Assembly attempted to stimulate the efforts of the international community by providing three essential guidelines for the attainment of the objective of general and complete disarmament.44.	It decided  first  to support the initiatives taken by States at the regional level to expand and reinforce the concept of denuclearized zones; secondly  to encourage the search for ways and means to bring about the complete and effective prohibition of nuclear weapons of all kinds and the freezing and reduction of military expenditures  to the benefit of development aid; and  finally  to give all those measures maximum publicity throughout the world through international conferences and existing negotiating machinery and to strengthen them by security guarantees to the non-nuclear-weapon States  the conclusion of appropriate international conventions and the intensification of action designed to reduce international tension.45.	We note that  unfortunately  not only has very little progress been achieved in attaining those objectives but  on the contrary  the deterioration of detente has considerably weakened the political determination of States  if it has not actually led them to a further escalation of the arms race. The continual increase in world military expenditures  which this year have been estimated at about $500 billion  is scandalous if one realizes that public assistance to development has been stagnating around $20 billion a year and is even tending to diminish. The constant proliferation of ever more sophisticated means of destruction poses a real threat to mankind  whose peace and security should rather be based on solidarity and co-operation among peoples.46.	That is why Cameroon remains convinced that a binding agreement among the various military Powers  with a view to bringing about the total prohibition of nuclear tests and the limitation and destruction of stockpiles of all kinds of atomic and chemical weapons and other weapons of mass destruction  could contribute significantly to the restoration of a climate of peace and confidence conducive to international solidarity and co-operation.47.	We are ready to make our contribution  in the framework of negotiations and appropriate consultations  to any initiative which could promote the process of general and complete disarmament with a view to development.48.	I have just set forth the views of my Government on the most important political aspects of the crisis of our time  which could at any moment plunge mankind into confrontations with unforeseeable consequences. But to those threats to international peace and security represented by more or less limited regional conflicts we should add those which stem from the persistence of injustice and inequality in international economic relations. Indeed  as is stressed by the Secretary-General in his excellent report on the work of the Organization  ""peace is as much at stake in the discussions on economic questions as prosperity and a decent standard of living for all humanity"".49.	That axiom  with regard to the present economic crisis caused by the collapse of the economic order as a result of the Second World War  led us to define  at the sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly  held in 1974 and 1975  the principles and objectives of a new international economic order which would be more just and more equitable because it would give all peoples equal opportunities for progress  well-being and prosperity.50.	However  we cannot but note that that new international economic order is still embryonic  while the North- South dialogue seems to be moving towards a deadlock.51.	The international economic situation during the decade which is ending still constitutes a source of grave concern. The world economy  as we have just been reminded by  inter alia  the reports of the World Bank and IMF  is getting steadily worse. In the developed countries signs of an economic revival are hardly perceptible  such is the persistence of recession  inflation  unemployment and deficits in the balance of payments. For the developing countries  there remains the spectre of poverty  disease  hunger and  indeed  total economic deprivation for 1 billion human beings. In our continent  which contains 20 of the 31 least developed countries  and particularly those in special categories whose poverty is such that they are below classification level  the situation is even more tragic. The annual per capita income of about $365 is the lowest in the world. The rate of growth over the last 20 years  taking all the countries together  has barely exceeded 4.8 per cent  while infantile mortality has reached a figure of 137 per 1 000 and almost half the active population is unemployed. With regard to health  the ratio is 1 doctor to 672 inhabitants in urban areas  as against 1 to 26 000 in rural areas.52.	In this situation  which has been made even worse by natural calamities and disasters and aggravated by the rivalries of Powers in search of customers  raw materials and spheres of influence  the developing countries are condemned to the labour of Sisyphus  in a most insensitive international atmosphere.53.	Little significant progress in international negotiations has been made in the course of the last decade. It is appropriate here to express our gratification at the remarkable results obtained by the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. Indeed  by the end of the ninth session a compromise was reached on essential questions  particularly the functioning of the Sea-Bed Authority and also arrangements for the exploitation of the international zone. We wish to express the hope that the forthcoming convention on the law of the sea will not be frustrated by unilateral legislative measures. That compromise was possible thanks only to the presence of a genuine spirit of co-operation and a persistent political determination to transcend immediate and apparently contradictory interests so as to make a resolute commitment to the building of a world al last reconciled with itself as a result of its being free from injustice and exploitation  and having relations among peoples based on solidarity and co-operation.54.	How  then  can we fail to regret that such considerations did not inspire all the participants in the eleventh special session  which concluded its work in September. At that session  devoted to development and international economic co-operation  the General Assembly did not succeed in making the decisive breakthrough towards the structural reforms which are indispensable for the achievement of the new international economic order. Some positive results  of course  made it possible to avoid total failure. We are thinking in particular of the resolutions on assistance to the least developed countries and also of the consensus reached on the text of the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade. That Strategy  in which Cameroon would have liked to see the manifestation of a contract for harmonious international development based on solidarity and harmony  does  however  contain weaknesses and ambiguities. While it should  above all  have ensured the promotion of development in the developing countries  the Strategy touches on that fundamental objective only obliquely. Although it should have provided for much more binding commitments by Governments than those accepted in the former development strategies and should have included a precise time-table of objectives to be attained  the new Strategy contains measures of general policy which are so watered down that in the final analysis they amount to nothing more than vague promises to examine or to consider possibilities of action.55.	Instead of being a strategy for speeding up the attainment of the new international economic order  it is directed rather at resolving the problem of development within the existing institutional framework. The reservations or interpretations which accompanied the consensus text make absolutely clear the determination of their authors to maintain at any cost the present imbalanced  ill-adapted and unjust order. Those weaknesses and ambiguities explain our concern about the results of the eleventh special session. We are all the more disappointed as it was not possible to agree on either organizational procedures or the agenda for global negotiations.56.	This is the time to remind certain delegations which for various reasons were unable to associate themselves with the compromise reached on the subject that what is truly at stake here is the affirmation and recognition of the central role of the General Assembly in matters of international economic co-operation. We appeal to them urgently to adopt a more positive attitude so as to enable the international community to take advantage of this unique opportunity offered to us to define and orientâby means of a global  coherent and integrated approachâconcrete action covering all the major sectors of the economy as well as important aspects of the international economic crisis.57.	Global negotiations  by remedying weaknesses contained in the Strategy  could contribute to the process of negotiations provided for in the framework of the new Strategy with the object of reforming relations and existing machinery in the field of economic exchange between developing and developed countries.58.	The various statements heard in the course of this general debate have given us grounds for hoping that the consultations that will be held during this session will make it possible to dispel misunderstandings  smooth out differences and achieve a consensus that will make possible the launching of global negotiations on the date initially scheduled.59.	Persuaded that these global negotiations are necessary and that they can open up for international economic cooperation new prospects that will be commensurate with the requirements of the hour  Cameroon  like other developing countries  reaffirms its political readiness to engage in such consultations.60.	For us  this is a serious challenge of history.61.	Permit me to recall the words spoken by His Excellency President Ahmadou Ahidjo before this Assembly over a decade ago  words which remain more timely than ever:""There is no doubt that mankind finds itself today at a decisive turning-point in its history. This places upon us a very heavy responsibility towards future generations. Our scientific progress may well have little meaning for them if we do not succeed in mastering the human problems with which our societies are confronted  if we fail to bequeath to those generations a world respectful of human dignity  conscious of its unity  and building its destiny in a brotherly dialogue  in peace and injustice  a world which they can possess in peaceful and prosperous security."""
"28",1422,"COD",35,1980,"ï»¿First of all I should like on behalf of the delegation of Zaire  and in my personal capacity  to extend to Mr. von Wechmar heartfelt congratulations on his election to the presidency of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. I am particularly glad to see presiding over the General Assembly the representative of a friendly country with which the Republic of Zaire enjoys excellent relations of cooperation. Mr. von Wechmar's eminent qualities as a statesman  together with his great experience of international problems  are for us the earnest of success in our deliberations.172.	I should like also to pay a special tribute to the outgoing President  Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim  who discharged his duties with such mastery in a very delicate international situation. Throughout his term of office  he embodied with remarkable distinction the truly African meaning of dynamic compromise and the will for peace of our continent.173.	I could not pass over in silence the constant efforts extended by the Secretary General for the cause of peace and the achievement of the primary mission of the United Nations.174.	The birth of a new State is always an occasion for rejoicing; its free accession to membership of the United Nations gives us reason to hope  because it brings us ever closer to the goal of universality that we pursue. Hence I should like today to welcome the arrival in the international arena of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  which in acceding to independence has swelled the ranks of free nations. May it find in this environment the peace and security necessary to consolidate its freedom and to implement its development programmes.175.	The thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly has opened in an international context marked by tension and conflicts which breed disquiet  insecurity  anguish and distrust in international relations.176.	The results of the eleventh special session of the General Assembly  which has just ended  have not denied or invalidated that fact. The failure of that special session  in which we had placed great hopes  is ascribable only to the developed and industrialized countries  which did not demonstrate a real political will for change. That attitude is pregnant with threats to international peace and security.177.	Indeed  peace and the survival of the world necessarily entail sharing world prosperity  compensating for the natural inequalities and redressing the structural inequalities  and the union of all in a new ethic of solidarity. If the eleventh special session now appears to some as an abortive rendezvous with history  it is because that truth was not understood by some of our major partners.178.	My delegation considers that some institutions and international organizations should be more understanding and open-minded towards problems connected with third world development because it is to be feared that in the long run countries which produce raw materials other than oil will themselves also be prompted to take steps which can only worsen the present crisis that is afflicting us so sorely.179.	The spirit of intransigence and intolerance which we note in international economic relations is also to be found in southern Africa.180.	The accession to power of the black majority in Zimbabwe was heralded by the international community as a great victory for democracy and an inestimable contribution to international peace and security in that sorely tried region. Alas  deaf to the insistent clamour of reason and of history  the white minority racists of Pretoria continue to practise the criminal policy of apartheid to disregard the rights of the black majority in South Africa itself and in Namibia  in contempt for the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.181.	Apartheid has been condemned by the United Nations and the international community as a crime against humanity. The authority  the leaders and the public institutions which continue to practise or implement a policy which has been declared criminal according to international law are criminal themselves and deserve no support at all by any member of the international community. All the acts by the white racist minority regime of Pretoria within the framework of the policy of apartheid are tainted with illegality and criminality. This is something which all Members of the United Nations must understand in order further to emphasize the political  diplomatic  economic and military isolation of the citadel of racism and apartheid.182.	The Republic of Zaire unequivocally condemns the policy of apartheid and the savage repression which is being visited upon the oppressed masses of South Africa which are in revolt  for nothing will stop the irreversible march of history. Our country  in solidarity with the independent African States of the region  which have accepted heavy sacrifices for the cause of the liberation of the peoples of South Africa and Namibia  condemn most vehemently acts of aggression perpetrated unceasingly by South Africa against Angola  Zambia and Mozambique and urgently appeals to all countries which have dealings with South Africa to halt all commercial  economic  financial  military and nuclear cooperation with that nation.183.	With regard to Namibia  the Republic of Zaire notes the illegality of the occupation of that Territory by South Africa since the end of the mandate regime and considers that the basic question here is one not so much of negotiating Namibia's independence with South Africa as of implementing the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and the plan for settling the Namibian question approved by the General Assembly and the Security Council and relating to South Africa's withdrawal from that Territory.184.	The Republic of Zaire reaffirms its support for SWAPO as the sole legitimate representative of the people of Namibia and supports the efforts made by the United Nations Council for Namibia as the sole legal authority  with a view  on the one hand  to ensuring the independence of that Territory while respecting its territorial integrity and  on the other hand  to stopping the shameless pillage of Namibia's resources which is being indulged in by certain transnational corporations.185.	My country rejects South Africa's manoeuvres which would create through the so-called Turnhalle negotiations an illegal and arbitrary Governmental Council at Windhoek with the aim of imposing a puppet Government in Namibia and perpetuating its occupation in that Territory  in spite of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and in spite of universal condemnation.186.	The tension which persists in North Africa with regard to Western Sahara is of concern to international and African opinion. My delegation welcomes the decision taken by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU  which met at Freetown from 1 to 4 July 1980  requesting the OAU Ad Hoc Committee of Heads of State on Western Sahara to continue to make the necessary efforts to reconcile the parties to the conflict and to find a peaceful  lasting solution to that thorny question  My delegation is especially pleased by the obvious readiness and will shown by all parties concerned to embark upon negotiations and to take a full part in the work of the Ad Hoc Committee.187.	We voice the hope that the heads of State or Government of the OAU  when they have before them the report and the recommendations of the Ad Hoc Committee  which has just met in Freetown and which had an opportunity to hear all the parties concerned in the conflict  will be able to find a political  peaceful and lasting solution consistent with the legendary wisdom of Africa. We consider that international bodies should refrain from compromising the process initiated by the OAU in July of seeking a peaceful solution to this dispute. All nations of the world and all peace-loving forces should encourage and support the OAU in its efforts towards peace.188.	No one denies today that the situation that obtains in the Middle East is a serious and abiding threat to international peace and security. The question of Palestine is at the very core of the Middle East conflict.189.	 The seventh emergency special session of the General Assembly on the question of Palestine gave us an opportunity to see that the Arab States  which 32 years ago had not accepted the terms of resolution 181 (II) of 29 November 1947 on the partition of Palestine  and the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO] now accept the creation of an independent Arab State of Palestine and the terms of this resolution as guaranteeing their interests and constituting the basis for a final solution.190.	A universal consensus seems already to exist on the following points: first  the legitimacy of the struggle of the Palestinian people for the recovery of its rights  particularly the right to political and economic self-determination  the right to create an independent sovereign State and the right of Palestinian refugees to return to their lands; secondly  the central role of the Palestinian question in the Middle East dispute; thirdly  the representative character of the PLO and its right to participate in all efforts being made and in all deliberations and negotiations to determine the future of the Palestinian people on an equal footing with the other parties; fourthly  the need for respect for the international regime of the City of Jerusalem  the Holy Place of the these great monotheistic religions of the world  and the rejection of any unilateral actions and measures to annex it or alter its geographic  demographic and cultural characteristics; and fifthly  the withdrawal of Israel from all Arab territories occupied by force.191.	Strengthened by this general consensus  we should now seek the implementation of resolution 181 (II)  of which the creation of Israel was a first step.192.	The Republic of Zaire vehemently condemns the policy of annexation of territories by force  the implantation of Jewish settlements in the Arab lands of Palestine  the denial of the right of return of the Palestinians and the unilateral measures for the annexation of the Holy City of Jerusalem recently adopted by the Israeli Government in violation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.193.	The Zaire delegation considers that the new approach which places the question of Palestine at the centre of the Middle East conflict and which advocates recognition of the right to self-determination and independence of the Arab people of Palestine supplements Security Council resolution 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967  which remains an important basis of the quest for a just  lasting and comprehensive settlement of the Middle East conflict.194.	The Republic of Zaire supports respect for the principles of the Charter and the rules of the law of the people. We have therefore said unequivocally to the authorities in Iran that the taking as hostages of persons whose inviolability is covered by diplomatic immunity  guaranteed and protected by the internationally recognized instruments which exist in this field  bears the seeds of serious threats with incalculable consequences for the future of relations of trust between nations and for the peace and security of all.195.	We have reminded the Iranian authorities that we  the peoples of the third world  who are continuing to wage a tireless struggle for the democratization of international relations  for the establishment of a more just and more equitable international order  protected from fear  arbitrary action and the rule of force  must accord great importance to respect for the rights of others and for internationally recognized and established principles governing relations and cooperation between peoples and modern States  bearing in mind the modest means that we have at our disposal  because we believe that we would be the great losers in a world without principles and without law.196.	That is why we have asked them and continue to ask them today to free the American hostages  safe and sound and without prior conditions. The Iranian revolution would emerge strengthened from such action. In saying this  the Republic of Zaire remains fully in favour of the independence of Iran  its sovereignty and the right of its people freely to determine its future.197.	The deterioration of relations between Iran and Iraq is of extreme concern to us  not only because it involves two brother members of the nonaligned movement  but also and in particular because this conflict is taking place in one of the most sensitive regions of the world  where any conflict can degenerate into disaster because of the rival interests of the great Powers.198.	No State in that Gulf region should assume direct or indirect responsibility for the destruction of the precarious balance that is being maintained with such difficulty.199.	We voice the hope that the appeal by the President of the Security Council will be heeded by all parties and that the good offices of the secretary General  who is always ready to mediate in such cases  will be accepted.200.	The situations in Afghanistan and Kampuchea constitute a threat to international peace and security. The invasion of Afghanistan by foreign troops has created a new situation in that part of the world. This region is today in a period of effervescence. The fear of the danger of destabilization has caused an intensification of the arms race and has aggravated tension between States. It is understood  moreover  that the occupation forces are reluctant to evacuate that country for fear of creating an imbalance to their disadvantage.201.	It is in this way that the vicious circle of violence begins  the consequences of which cannot be calculated  because although we know how to get into it  we do not know how to get out of it. It is precisely therein that the threat to international peace and security lies  particularly when the main protagonist is a great Power  a permanent member of the Security Council  with special responsibility under the Charter for maintaining international peace and security.202.	We ask the Soviet Union to abide by the terms of General Assembly resolution ES6/2 of 14 January 1980 and to evacuate its troops from Afghanistan without prior conditions.203.	In resolution 34/22 the Assembly calls for the immediate withdrawal of all foreign forces from Kampuchea and implicitly supports the continued representation of Democratic Kampuchea at the United Nations.204.	The only question that really arises here is whether the United Nations has a choice between endorsing the invasion of Kampuchea by foreign troops by seating the Government installed in Phnom Penh by the invading and occupying troops  and refusing to endorse that invasion and allowing the legitimate Government overthrown by the invading and occupying troops to retain its seat in the United Nations.205.	The delegation of Zaire considers that the United Nations has no choice but to continue to recognize the Government of Democratic Kampuchea if it does not wish to weaken the very foundations of the Charter. Many States which defend this thesis have not necessarily supported the actions of the Pol Pot Government in Kampuchea  nor have they maintained special relations with it. Some Member States have attempted to approach this problem on the basis of the defence of human rights  accusing the Pol Pot regime of genocide.206.	The position of Zaire is unequivocal with regard to human rights. The sacred principle of human rights must be defended by all available means. But certain States and organizations must stop turning this question into a political one  with the sole aim of interfering in the internal affairs of States for the purpose of destabilization.207.	Legitimacy is a matter for the peoples. The United Nations cannot confer any legitimacy whatsoever upon a Government against the wish of the people concerned.208.	According to some statistics  in 1980 $500 billion will be spent on weaponsâin other words  10 per cent more than in 1979. Precisely 10 years ago  in 1970  the figure was nearly $370 billion. Year by year  despite the declarations of intent to stop the arms race  military expenditures increase  thereby decreasing the sums made available for development and to improve living standards throughout the world  particularly the third world.209.	At a time when there is talk of launching the Second Disarmament Decade  we must denounce the hypocrisy of the great Powersâparticularly the nuclear Powersâwhose acts are not always in keeping with their declarations of intent.210.	The aims of resolution 2602 E (XXIV) of 16 December 1969  in which the Assembly proclaimed the First Disarmament Decade  are far from having been achieved. The arms raceâparticularly the nuclear arms raceâis still being pursued; military expenditures  as can be seen  have grown at an alarming rate; hotbeds of tension have been increasing and flaring up  posing additional threats to international peace and security; the cold war is with us again and  unfortunately  the third world region has become its theatre of operations.211.	The great Powers are eyeing one another like porcelain dogs  and their desire for a balance of power constantly prevents them from abiding by their obligations concerning disarmament. One may thus wonder whether they have truly decided to heed the appeal of the former Secretary General  U Thant  who declared in 1970 that any comprehensive disarmament programme must begin with a halt  immobilization or restriction of the nuclear arms race  followed by measures to reverse the process by reducing and ultimately eliminating nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction.212.	Here as elsewhere  we expect the great Powersâand  above all  the nuclear Powersâfully to demonstrate their attachment to the common ideal of peace; because  although disarmament is of concern to all nations of the world  it is only the armed who can be disarmed; indeed  the very possession of weapons can pose a problem to the immediate area or threaten it directly.213.	The Republic of Zaire pursues a policy of peace  good neighbourliness and cooperation  and will spare no effort to contribute  to the extent of its modest means  to promoting disarmament. It supports the establishment of denuclearized zones as an important step towards general and complete disarmament. Those are the tenets of the Declaration on the Denuclearization of Africa. 214.	The international community and the United Nations should pay closer attention to the problem of African refugees. Today  Africa is sheltering on its soil more refugees than any other continent. Of the 4 million refugees in Africa  Zaire alone is sheltering almost 1 million. If the refugees of Africa  who are straining the meagre resources of our developing States  could benefit from the same concern as all other refugees throughout the world that would be an inestimable contribution to our development efforts. But whatever the situation  the Republic of Zaire will share its modest resources with the refugees it welcomes on its territory in the name of human solidarity.215.	My country has sheltered thousands of people fleeing from neighbouring countries during their struggle for independence. Our action was in consonance with a noble causeâthat of freeing long enslaved peoples from the colonial yoke. Unfortunately  a new category of refugees seems to have emerged: refugees guilty of common-law crimes but who  by fleeing from justice in their countries of origin  are enjoying protection and refugee status thanks to the un-avowed desire of the host countries to destabilize young States eager to consolidate their independence.216.	Civilization is rooted in nature  and nature has moulded human culture and influenced all artistic and scientific works. Life in close contact with nature offers mankind the best chances of developing its creativity and of protecting and enjoying its moments of leisure.217.	The destruction of natural systems which results both from excessive consumption and the abuse of resources will surely cause life on our planet to perish. The preservation and protection of the environment thus become an ethical obligation of all members of the international community for the sake of present and future generations.218.	As the President of the Republic of Zaire  General Mobutu  declared at the twelfth session of the General Assembly of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources  at Kinshasa  in September 1975:""We for our part are aware that we cannot do whatever we please with our forests  because they have an influence that goes beyond the limits of national territory. The seas  the oceans  the upper atmosphere are the property of the human community that cannot be considered as belonging to anyone or in which one can do as one pleases.""219.	With that in mind  Zaire has submitted to the General Assembly a draft World Charter for Nature. This document  which is essentially technical  has ecological objectives. We call on all Member States to study it carefully and lend it their support  for what is at stake is the survival of all mankind.220.	I should like to refer to another subject  the law of the sea  a new law  the effectiveness of which depends upon its acceptance by the majority of the members of the international community. Despite the progress made as a result of the resumed ninth session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  the new version of the informal composite negotiating text has a number of shortcomings that impair drafting of the proposed convention. Among other things  the formula proposed for production policies and a compensation system in no way meets the concerns of producer countries  particularly producer and potential producer developing countries the economies of which are based essentially on the export of minerals. We continue to believe that those shortcomings will be remedied during the next stage of the negotiations.221.	Moreover  it is inconceivable that at a time when all the nations of the world are studying global measures to ensure an equitable distribution of what is commonly called the ""common heritage of mankind""  some States are abusing their power and  by means of unilateral legislation  are starting to exploit the seabed for their exclusive benefit  thereby trampling underfoot the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly.222.	In any case  the tendency to replace one unjust order with another is unacceptable to us  to say the very least. In this regard  we consider that every State must make an effort to safeguard the goals sought by the future conventionâ goals which can only complement those enshrined in the Charter.223.	Daily  facts demonstrate that the Charter of the United Nations can be improved by being adapted to the new requirements of evolution. We particularly have in mind those provisions that are related to the maintenance of international peace and security  which concentrate all powers in the hands of a small number of States. The Charter should reflect the new situation that has resulted from an increased democratization of international relations  since it is a fact that the interdependence of States is inconceivable without a sharing of responsibilities.224.	If the initial enthusiasm of the Organization has somewhat diminished because of serious and varied situations that have arisen  that should be no cause for surprise in an Organization that includes States having such diverse economic and social systems and that legitimately aspires to ensuring cooperation among all the States that compose it  great or small  rich or poor  in a world that is dominated by fear  mistrust and inequalities of all kinds.225.	The United Nations constitutes the last bulwark in which peace-loving and justice loving States may place their trustâI am referring in particular to the States of the third worldâand it should be able to accommodate the emergence of young States on the international scene and the consequences thereof.226.	The Republic of Zaire wishes to avail itself of this opportunity once again to proclaim its faith in the principles of the Charter and its devotion to the aims and objectives of the United Nations."
"29",1468,"COG",35,1980,"ï»¿The peoples of the world are profoundly aware of the need to struggle for peace  justice and progress. On all continents they have made laudable sacrifices so as to usher in finally the era of a human society less fraught with conflict and less destructive in which anguish and fear might give way to reciprocal trust  understanding and friendship among all.2.	That awareness has been strengthened more than ever today by the increased risks of conflagration to which mankind is subjected by the unchecked arms race  which has attained a terrifying destructive force. This more and more explosive climate has  alas  been aggravated by the world economic crisis  the consequences of which are most catastrophic for the economies of the countries of the third world.3.	The North South dialogue  a good effort to alleviate the tension between wealthy and poor countries  has so far resulted only in failure and has thus brought the world to the brink of uncertainty and despair.4.	In fact  the conditions are present for the worst to happen: but there are other rather more favourable conditions for the victory of mankind  as  for example  his determination to work for a world of peace  justice and progress.5.	You  Sir  are one of those men on whom the United Nations can count as it forges ahead. That is why the Congolese delegation welcomes your unanimous election to the presidency of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. Indeed  we are convinced that you will use your exceptional qualities of man of action  your intelligence and your long experience in international life in the sacred cause of peace  understanding and cooperation among the different parts of our world.6.	The People's Republic of the Congo welcomes your election  especially as it enjoys with your country  the Federal Republic of Germany  excellent relations of cooperation which were  moreover  recently strengthened and consolidated by the latest visit to the Congo of your Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs.7.	To our brother and friend  Salim Ahmed Salim  we should like to convey our profound gratitude for the quite brilliant way in which he presided over the thirty-fourth regular session and all the special sessions held this year  to the satisfaction of everyone.8.	We are loath to conclude these words of tribute without expressing our esteem and admiration for the Secretary General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  whose tireless efforts exerted to secure the triumph in the world of the ideals of our Charter deserve all our encouragement.9.	As the highlight of the twentieth anniversary of the adoption  in 1960  of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  the independence attained in the meantime by the people of Zimbabwe  now a Member of our Organization  gives particular meaning to the role assumed by the United Nations in the course of the past few years.10.	We repeat here to the valiant people of Zimbabwe the congratulations which the Congo expressed on the occasion of its independence and we fervently hail the wisdom of its leader. Comrade Robert Dariel Mugabe. His political courage and his human abilities redound to the honour of Africa  his genius fascinates the whole world and we are convinced that he will be able not only to put those qualities at the service of peace  unity and progress within his country but also to make a contribution  along with other nations  to the building of a better world.11.	We should also like to salute the entry into the family of the United Nations of the State of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  whose people has managed to rid itself of trusteeship and colonial oppression and to recover its dignity as a free people  independent and sovereign.12.	The People's Republic of the Congo  which has experienced a long colonial period characterized by poverty  domination and repression  expresses its wholehearted devotion to the right of all peoples  small and large  to self-determination and independence  and the need for them to live as fully sovereign people  free to make their own choices and responsible for their own future. For that reason my country is in solidarity with liberation movements and is struggling to make its own independence complete. Independence and sovereignty in fact represent the greatest good to which all peoples profoundly aspire.13.	Lack of respect for or violation of those principles is u source of instability and international tension. It is not enough to recognize that some principles are just; it is necessary also to struggle for compliance with them. And as Comrade Denis Sassou-Nguesso said: ""The international solidarity of all those who arc oppressed throughout the world is the guarantee of final victory"".14.	My country practises an outgoing policy vis-Ã -vis all countries and cooperates with all those that so desire on a basis of equality  mutual respect and reciprocal advantage.15.	My country enjoys relations of good neighbourliness  kinship and active cooperation with quite a number of African countries. Within the Organization of African Unity [OAU] and the nonaligned movement it has helped to establish a climate of peace in the world on the basis of the principle of peaceful settlement of disputes.16.	Our purpose is to build in the Congo a more just society  free from all exploitation of man by man. As a socialist society  united with the socialist community and in concert with other peace-loving and justice loving peoples  the Congo wishes to contribute to the achievement of a new world free from war and tension.17.	Unfortunately  we must perforce note that the situation prevailing in Africa is not one of peace  concord and harmony. The African continent has  of course  struggled for years  and indeed heroically  for its liberation  and the results obtained by that struggle are plain to see. The international community recognizes with satisfaction the dynamism shown by that continent and its organization  the OAU  in their positive contribution to the process of peace and detente.18.	But so many major steps remain to be taken  so much more remains to be done  so many sacrifices must be made before our continent is completely free!19.	We note with bitterness and stupefaction that  while the African continent is gradually achieving freedom  there is an attempt once more to divide it into zones of influence and to protect those zones of influence by the establishment of impressively equipped military bases of a most threatening kind. These bases threaten the peace of the entire continent particularly the neighbouring countries which allow them to be established on their soil.20.	We do not want any military bases in Africa. We urge the African countries facing problems among themselves to seek peaceful solutions through negotiations instead of military force and the establishment of foreign bases on our continent. Africa must really he a zone of peace  where the essential resources should be devoted to economic development and to the progress of the working masses21.	In order to do so we have to make sure that on our continent principles as dear to us as non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries  territorial integrity and the inviolability of the borders of each State should lie respected. Above all  force should not be used as a means of settling conflicts.22.	Since Zimbabwe acceded to independence  the racist Government of South Africa has stepped up its acts of violence and has intensified its savage oppression within the colonized territory of Namibia. It has hurled itself with uncontrollable fury against the neighbouring independent States.23.	Its actions cannot cause the people of Namibia  which has long been aware of its destiny and has organized itself under the direction of the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO] and its leader. Comrade Sam Nujoma  to lose courage; nor can they discourage peace-loving and freedom loving peoples that support this just struggle. South Africa's obduracy with regard to the exhortations of the international community  and its attempts to intimidate  rather give rise to a stronger commitment and more decisive action by all.24.	South Africa is resorting to delaying tactics to bring about the failure of the efforts of the international community directed towards u negotiated solution of this serious problem.25.	The investments of the multinational corporations in the mining activities in Namibia have increased markedly during this decade. The facilities provided to those corporations to repatriate their high profits strengthen the Western economic presence in Namibia  constitute a serious obstacle to the independence of that country and give encouragement to South Africa.26.	As far as we are concerned  acceptance of the idea of creating a demilitarized zone along the Namibian border with Angola and Zambia should be followed by the effective implementation of the settlement plan of the United Nations  as a process whereby Namibia could achieve independence. We firmly believe in such a development. It can no longer be delayed nor can it be sidestepped. The United Nations plan is best because it is negotiated and controlled by the international community.27.	Everybody should be convinced of the lightness of this plan and of its imminence; For South Africa there is no alternative but to respect the will of the Namibian people to become independent. The people of the Congo express solidarity with the heroic people of Namibia in the sacrifices made in the struggle it has waged under the wise guidance of SWAPO  its sole authentic representative  to recover its independence and sovereignty 28.	With regard to the racist regime of Pretoria  the international community is in duty bound  today more than ever  to ensure that the sanctions envisaged by the relevant United Nations resolutions are implemented against that regime  including those advocated under Chapter VII of the Charter.29.	We should not be duped by the soothing words of those wish us to believe that a few homilies on tolerance are enough to do away with the regrettable practice of apartheid. What is involved is quite different. It is not merely a matter of stopping that regime from continuing its killings and its process of dehumanizing a people on racial grounds. That regime must also be prevented from becoming a permanent disruptive clement in the region and throughout the world.30.	At this time  we should like to reiterate our support for the People's Republic of Angola and the other frontline States in view of their courage in the face of the uninterrupted acts of aggression to which they have been subjected by the shameful and iniquitous regime of South Africa.31.	Pretoria could not persist in these barbaric acts without the more or less passive complicity of those industrialized countries that support it economically and politically. Their refusal to implement the sanctions prescribed by the Organization speaks volumes. The process of decolonization of the African continent must be completed.32.	With regard to Western Sahara  there is a problem of decolonization. The denial of the right to existence of an entire people seems to us to be anachronistic and an outrageous challenge to the principles of the Charter.33.	In taking up arms to light the Moroccan colonizer and proclaiming the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic  this people have demonstrated its desire to be free and independent. The People's Republic of the Congo pays a tribute to the courage of the Sahraoui people  supports it in its just struggle and is committed to continue that support until final and complete victory is won.34.	We should like to congratulate the Mauritanian Government  which withdrew from the conflict  on its courageous and lucid attitude with regard to the problem of Western Sahara.35.	The recognition of the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic by a growing number of Statesâ26 out of 50 in Africaâis additional proof  if needed  of the reality and justice of the struggle of the Sahraoui people. In our opinion  this is a sufficient facto: to determine the attitude of the international community with regard to this problem  in conformity with the conclusions of the Ad Hoc Committee of the OAU at the seventeenth ordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU  held at Freetown from 1 to 4 July 1980  which reiterated the need to implement the process of self-determination.36.	With regard to Chad  a tremendous tragedy is taking place in that vast and beautiful African land. A civil war is being waged there  and it is our impression that the tragedy has reached its climax  since it now seems to be out of control37.	However  the Lagos agreement regarding the national reconciliation of Chad  concluded on 21 August 1979 under the aegis of the OAU among 11 trends assembled for the first time and in the presence of 10 African groups  gave birth to a real and legitimate hope that finally peace and harmony would reign among the people of that country.38. That agreement envisaged inter alia  a ceasefire  the establishment of a transitional government of national unity  the demilitarization of N'Djamena and the main cities  the liberation of political detainees and prisoners of war  the establishment of an integrated army  the creation a neutral inter-African force responsible for maintaining peace and a return to democratic life.39.	Implementation of that agreement began with the formation of a government and the establishment of only part of the contingent  made up solely of Congolese. Unfortunately  the resumption of hostilities dashed the hopes placed in the Lagos agreements  and the contingent was obliged to withdraw so as not to be involved in the conflicting trends. Bearing that situation in mind  recourse to financial or other means  as suggested within the OAU or elsewhere  cannot in and of itself constitutes the solution to that tragedy. First of all  the people and leaders of Chad must demonstrate the necessary courage and political will to establish genuine peace and tranquillity in their country; then the OAU and the African countries must show a real desire  without ulterior motives  to assist the people of Chad in emerging from this nightmare. Finally  the international community should express its will to contribute to the peaceful settlement of the problem without seeking to interfere in Chad's affairs  in strict conformity with the sovereignty of the people of Chad.40.	In our opinion  the OAU and the African countries still have sufficient political  diplomatic and material resources to achieve the objectives set by the Lagos agreement. We must make sure that  before having recourse to the United Nations  all African initiatives taken so far have run their course. That is why the Congo abides by the Lagos agreements the validity of which was reaffirmed at the seventeenth ordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of States and Government of the OAU  held at Freetown in July last. For us  legitimacy in Chad resides in respect for these agreements. The Government resulting from the implementation of these agreements is the sole authority in Chad  and any other attitude can only lead to more confusion.41.	We consider the situation in Afghanistan to be an internal matter concerning  first and foremost  the people of Afghanistan themselves: a people may decide to change its country's internal situation and to carry out a revolution. In this respect  the Afghan people cannot be blamed at all. The people of Congo reiterates its solidarity with the Afghan people and expresses support for its revolution. It was a sovereign act and we are opposed to any attempt to invalidate that fact so as to feed international tension. Indeed  the General Assembly's right to discuss questions falling within the purview of international relations should not include any intervention in a field which falls essentially within national competence. For our part  we support the struggle of the Afghan people for its independence  for justice and progress and we are against sacrificing a people's interests to a thirst for domination. The debate on Afghanistan would be distorted if it failed to take account of the real facts of the internal situation.42.	Our wish is that the countries of that sub region may surmount their differences so as to act in concert and thus create a climate of understanding indispensable to all. That is also our attitude regarding the situation in South East Asia; we indeed applaud the efforts being made by the Governments of the People's Republic of Kampuchea  Viet Nam and Laos to establish relations of good neighbourliness and thus promote peace throughout the region. The peoples of Kampuchea  Viet Nam and all the countries of the region  after so many years of wars and destruction  need international solidarity and an environment of peace to devote themselves to the task of national reconstruction. It is regrettable to note that  at a time when the internal situation in Kampuchea is improving and economic and social life is starting to be organized after a painful period of devastation and genocide  that country is not represented in this hall by those who really hold effective power there.43.	We cannot fail to express our solidarity with the people of South Korea and to say how encouraged we are by the popular struggle going on there. It is the struggle of a people against dictatorship and oppression  and for a happier  more harmonious life to which it is only just to aspire. We support the proposals for a peaceful reunification of the two Koreas.44.	There are situations in which recent history should convince us that solutions should be found that are satisfactory to all. Such is the case in the Middle Last. The failure of the Camp David agreements reasonably confirms the correctness of our position: those agreements  which deliberately becloud the essential issueâthe existence of the Palestinian peopleâcannot be viable  effective or lasting. Once more  there can be no guaranteed peace in the region without the participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO] in any process dealing with the fate of the Palestinian people. The idea of the resumption of negotiations should be dominated by that decisive factor. Otherwise  no possible solution to that problem can be positive or effective.45.	The United Nations has just held its eleventh special session devoted to the new International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade and to international cooperation. In other words  once again we have discussed the establishment of the new international economic order. We must face disappointment  unfortunately  because the Third United Nations Development Decade will be very much like the previous ones  the failure of which is well known to all Members of our Organization. The rich countries would still have us believe that the origin of the entire present crisis resides in the insurmountable energy crisis. We should not be misled by that. The current economic crisis cannot be overcome without the necessary structural changes  in which the most realistic approach is that advocated by the Group of 77 in the global negotiations.46.	Hence the current deadlock in the North South dialogue will not be broken unless due account is taken of the discernible need for change in the balance of trade relations  tilt monetary and financial disorder and the disarray in the raw materials market. The United Nations must absolutely be granted the competence and necessary political authority to achieve success in the negotiations. Regional organizations also can provide necessary support for the formulation of specific data concerning the various parts of the world. Regarding the African continent  the Lagos Plan of Action for the Implementation of the Monrovia Strategy for the Economic Development of Africa represents for Africans the basis of their plans for endogenous and self-sustaining development. For Africa  outside of the conventional circuits  it is a question of a new approach in its dealings with the surrounding world. By that  Africans mean taking their destiny into their own hands and thus contributing to the establishment of a new international economic order acceptable to all.47.	Finally  the disastrous economic situation has been complicated by the increased tension in the field of international security  which is evermore rife. The cold war is worse now than ever; the arms race more frenetic than ever  blithely swallowing up  according to official estimates  the astronomical sum of $ I million a minute. This is even more disquieting  given the outbreak of new and serious scattered conflicts  with the constant threat of fearsome foreign intervention. It is time we followed up the recommendations of the tenth special session  devoted to disarmament and that the great Powers resolutely committed themselves to proceed to general and complete disarmament under international control  beginning with nuclear disarmament. We wish to reiterate here our support for the principle of declaring the Indian Ocean a zone of peace  free of all threats  in order to guarantee the security of that nerve centre of the world.48.	This survey of the state of the world may well induce pessimism. Colonialism  imperialism  apartheid and all other forms of domination and exploitation of peoples considerably delay the advent of a world based on justice  freedom  peace and progress.49.	Poverty  misery and underdevelopment should not be natural phenomena to which the majority of mankind must become accustomed for an indefinite period.50.	General and complete disarmament would make it possible to free the necessary resources and energies for social and economic development. It is imperative and urgent to halt the arms race and to put an end to the tension resulting from it in order to accelerate the establishment of a new world economic order.51. By trusting the goodwill of peoples and cultivating solidarity in the face of present difficulties  mankind can triumph. Thus  once more  my country reaffirms its faith in the United Nations and its Charter  which remains the perfect instrument through which we can overcome existing contradictions and bring about a world free from violence and conflicts  which are useless to mankind."
"30",1515,"COL",35,1980,"ï»¿I should like to congratulate you  Sir  on behalf of my Government  on your well-deserved election to the presidency of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. In electing you  this body wished to acknowledge the valuable contribution of your country to the peaceful development of international life in the post-war period and the extraordinary achievements of the Federal Republic of Germany in the building of a highly efficient and equitable society and also wished to pay a tribute to the distinguished human and intellectual qualities which have marked your conduct as representative of the Federal Republic of Germany in the Organization.159.	We should also like to associate ourselves with the expressions of gratitude which have been made by members of the Assembly for the task accomplished by your predecessor in the presidency  Mr. Salim of the United Republic of Tanzania. In a difficult period the Assembly benefited from the effective and judicious conduct of our proceedings by this outstanding representative of generations trained in the struggle for the emancipation of African States.160.	At a time when severe conflicts threaten the peaceful coexistence of nations  we consider it fortunate that our Organization should be able to profit from the enlightenment  experience and vigilance of its Secretary-General.161.	We should also like to welcome the admission of a new State from the Latin American area  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. On behalf of the Government of Colombia  I wish to bid a fraternal welcome to that State and I take pleasure in offering our co-operation in ensuring that its participation in the international arena shall have the scope merited by its people.162.	This session of the General Assembly comes  at a particularly difficult time for world peace when  in a climate of perturbation  we can observe signs of potential conflagration and conflict. The optimism  which seemed to be spreading as a result of the policy of detente  reflected in such a promising way in the Salt II Treaty  and in particular in the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe  signed at Helsinki in 197S  has been replaced by states of war  a situation which we must confront with objectivity and realism.163.	The conflict between Iraq and Iran  the consequences of which we cannot foresee  makes it imperative that the United Nations itself renew its efforts to restore harmony and to ensure that the principles on which world solidarity rests will prevail. These facts have made it clear that the whole complex of international relations must be reviewed and the role of each nation in the face of the conflict defined.164.	The most important thing of all  of course  is not only to rebuild the climate of confidence among all countries  but to give the policy of detente every opportunity to become effective and stable. Colombia has always called for a detente that would not be confined to a few geographical areas but would extend to every continent  but we must not allow the benefits of the agreement between the two super-Powers to be limited to a privileged group of nations.165.	Detenteâunderstood in its essential terms  such as the limitation of strategic arms  economic cooperation transcending ideological barriers  and in particular the curbing of the arms raceâis a goal that is binding on the international Organization  and no country should be allowed to shirk the duties incumbent upon it in the maintenance of peace. In order to achieve these goals  the United Nations must bring its entire institutional machinery into play. More particularly it must strengthen the vocation for peace  which is the most appropriate safeguard for understanding and dialogue.166.	The developing countries wish to see detente become universal. It would be wrong for peace agreements to be worked out by a small group of nations while other countries suffer the tragic consequences of conflicts fostered from abroad.167.	We welcome the preparations for the second review session of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  to be held at Madrid  to follow up the Helsinki Final Act and to adapt its conclusions to the new circumstances. However  detente limited to one continent alone must of necessity transfer many disputes between the great Powers to outlying areas  condemning them to international conflicts with tragic consequences. Universal detente with the participation of representatives from every continent would make a true and sound contribution to international security. It is incumbent upon the United Nations to promote detente by creating  through its operative machinery  the conditions that would bring it about.168.	Within this context  Encouraging disarmament projects is something that should have priority over other matters  Without any doubt  the developing nations are the ones which bear the heaviest burden because of the arms race which diverts basic resources from the well-being of their peoples and  in relative terms  limits economic growth and increases their technological dependence on the major centres of power.169.	It is highly possible that in the institutional field there is already considerable machinery capable of bringing about disarmament successfully. Thus  what is required is the political will to lay the bases for a real limitation of weapons of mass destruction  on which the major risk of a generalized conflagration depend.170.	Another item of concern to the General Assembly at its thirty-fifth session is the question of Afghanistan  a situation that was analysed in the course of the sixth emergency special session held this year. In its resolution ES-6/2 the Assembly called for the immediate  unconditional and total withdrawal of the occupying troops  an appeal that has not been heeded  while the so-called justifications put forward cannot be accepted because they are contrary to international law. The presence of foreign troops in Afghanistan is  from every standpoint  contrary to the Charter of the United Nations. Hence  at the current session the General Assembly should repeat the appeal for the evacuation of the occupying troops  permitting the Afghan people to recover its right of self-determination  free from compulsion and without advantages for other countries.171.	In the Middle East unmistakable symptoms of a disruption of peace persist  and have become more acute. Yet the United Nations has not been able to prevent the situation from worsening.172.	Colombia is convinced that suitable machinery for a stable peace lies in a dialogue among all the countries of the region  and including the PLO  in order to secure through reconciliation of the different viewpoints  effective measures for maintaining the security of all the peoples of the area on a basis of justice and equity. The demand for a Palestinian homeland  a matter the urgency of which my country has emphasized in this very hall on other occasions  cannot be indefinitely delayed. Establishment of such a homeland  besides redressing a wrong  would also contribute to the normalization of relations among the peoples of the area. Guaranteeing the fundamental rights of all the countries in the Middle East requires a search for an appropriate solution to the serious crisis in Lebanon  a nation that has been suffering from very tragic circumstances and whose plight the United Nations cannot ignore if it is to retain its territorial integrity without outside intervention. International action so far has not  in respect of Lebanon  been sufficiently active or effective.173.	The regional balance that might arise from a security conference for the Middle East  for which the General Assembly has on other occasions called  should take into account the very special conditions of the area and base itself on the guiding principle of the United Nations  which is that peace should be based on the rule of law  which in its turn must be the expression of justice. Any unjust attempt  far from contributing to lasting solutions  would open up the field to fresh conflicts with unpredictable consequences.174.	My country favours the creation of the Palestinian State  since its people has the right to a legal  dignified and peaceful existence. Similarly  Colombia defends the existence of the State of Israel  with secure frontiers within territorial limits recognized by the international Organisation.175.	The process of decolonization  for which the United Nations may justly claim the greatest credit ever since its foundation  has met with the obstinate resistance of the South African Government in its attempt to create the necessary conditions for recognition of Namibia as a free and sovereign nation. This is all the more serious if we realize that South Africa continues to pursue its policy of apartheid  a flagrant violation of the most elementary human rights and a vestige of the discriminatory policy of ancient empires.176.	The fact that my country has for more than 12 years belonged to the United Nations Council for Namibia strengthens its authority when it calls once again on the Assembly to condemn apartheid and to require South Africa to comply with its international obligation to permit the complete independence of Namibia with all the prerogatives inherent in the sovereignty of States.177.	Colombia is a country which throughout its history as a republic has maintained unswerving respect for the principles of international law as an irreplaceable rule for peace and coexistence among peoples. Respect for the inviolability of treaties  the security of obligations agreed upon under conventions and  particularly  the principle that international conduct should be governed by the rule of the law of nations constitute the best guarantee for a nation so profoundly committed to the precepts upon which international solidarity is based.178.	The principle of pacta sunt servanda is something that our neighbour  Nicaragua  has tried to disregard. It is unilaterally attempting to repudiate the validity of the Barcenas Meneses-Esguerra Treaty of 1928  which defined the territorial dispute between the two States. Any attempt on the part of the Nicaraguan Government to repudiate the Treaty of 1928 would be unprecedented and would imply disrespect for treaties that have been duly and properly signed. The Treaty with Nicaragua was signed and subsequently approved in both countries with full compliance with all constitutional requirements  and then the respective instruments were solemnly exchanged there having been prior discussions of the document in Nicaragua  with the full participation of the various political parties. The abortive attempt by the present Nicaraguan Government to abrogate arbitrarily the Treaty of 1928 with Colombia simply deserves the repudiation of the international community  because it is an attempt to disregard law and alter the situation of friendly relations between our two peoples. The juridical claim of Colombia is based on prevailing law  which faithfully and fully interprets the principles of uti possidetis juris of 1810  is irrefutable and admits of no argument.179.	This session of the Assembly is being held at a time when the economic situation of the countries of the third world is showing undoubted symptoms of crisis  particularly because of the growing deterioration in terms of trade. The great Powers have been coping relatively successfully with their difficulties  but at the same time the rises in the prices of petroleum and its derivatives are continuing directly and incontrovertibly to affect the financial structures of the weaker nations. Nobody can deny that the fluctuations and increases in the oil prices have been a factor altering the basic conditions underlying world order. It is equally clear that the economies of the developing countries are suffering from a diminution of their real income that alters the priorities of public investment to the point where not only have growth possibilities been restricted but the very political stability of the countries has often been threatened. For the developing countries the oil crisis has reduced the possibilities of proper and appropriate planning to make bold structural changes. To this must be added the tragic situation of countries which export primary commodities  which have seen a dramatic reduction in the volume of their earnings  in contrast to the gradual increase in the prices of the goods they are obliged to insert.180.	The delay in the entry into force of the International Coffee Agreement between producers and consumers has made clear the short-sightedness of the latter with regard to the real impact of the fall in coffee-bean prices as a destabilizing element. The coffee-consuming countries did not want to realize that  with prices below producers' real requirements  the only thing that is achieved is the stimulation of the factors of national and international disorder. The consumer nations did not give their decisive support at the proper time to the negotiation of a coffee agreement  and consequently the producer countries were forced to organize their own defence machinery. The latter is a valid and effective instrument for the free market situation in which the importing countries have placed us  but in spite of the success of the machinery adopted  Colombia is aware that in the long term the Agreement between producers and consumers is the best tool for the management of the coffee trade  and for this reason we have agreed to it. The producer countries insist that the International Coffee Agreement  with all its mechanisms in full force  should function as a forum for the scrupulous analysis of market trends  particularly so that it can act as a regulating instrument and preserve the real income of the producer countries  since nominal pricing is not enough for the defence of our economies.181.	The generalized crisis in international co-operation runs the whole gamut of the financial institutions and clearly shows how the developing countries have been traversing the most troublesome stage of the last few decades  without the international community coming to their assistance. The recently concluded eleventh special session of the General Assembly only left as its corollary a greater distance between the rich and the poor countries  without any speedy possible solutions having been glimpsed. Within the United Nations itself and the specialized agencies there have been initiatives for the protection of primary commodity prices  to restore the balance between the industrialized countries and the raw materials exporters. However  in this field we find an increasingly unjust distribution of world power and an increasingly evasive attitude of the great Powers in regard to the international commitments which should underlie the new international economic order.182.	World public opinion should be made known clearly in favour of strict compliance with the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States  which so far has been only a catalogue of good intentions without any practical effect. Its establishment as a binding rule for the international community is becoming an indispensable requirement for ensuring peace.183.	In the period since the end of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly  the implementation of measures of co-operation for the developing world has been postponed or reduced to absurd terms. The policy of the North- South dialogue remains bogged down in the face of indifference and delay. The demand of the peoples of the world for general and complete disarmament has been met simply with denials or delays. This obviously discouraging picture should be the subject of very serious and alert consideration on the part of the third world countries which have been so sorely afflicted by present economic circumstances.184.	Colombia believes that only a vast movement of unity in the third world can rescue the objective of the new international economic order. As long as the developing nations maintain their casual attitude  their role will always be diminished. We find that the belligerent intentions of some countries are becoming clearer and clearer  and the only response  in order to ensure peace and co-operation  is a movement towards unity on the part of the third world  so that it can become a genuine force of moral deterrence in the face of any nuclear adventure.185.	The unity of the third world  or the developing world  is something that Colombia would adopt as a banner for international action  and it should have as its objective the neutralization of any military provocation and should mobilize public opinion against anything that might give rise to a conflagration. The new international economic order will always be a fallacy so long as we fail to improve the machinery already agreed upon to maintain the prices of primary products. As long as the only lines of credit open to developing countries are for the purchase of armaments  the fate of world peace will be seriously jeopardized.186.	The unity which the third world needs would be the best weapon to promote genuine conditions of detente within a necessary global context. The present situation in the world requires a sufficient determination to see to it that the peace-loving peoples of the world alert humanity as a whole to the dangers which threaten collective security.187.	On behalf of my country  I should like to express best wishes for success in the deliberations of this thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. We are convinced today more than ever that solutions for peace must derive from the institutional framework of the United Nations  which is the strongest instrument ever created in history for settling disputes among States.188.	The call to unity of the third world to become the major peace movement is a call also for it to demand that just and fair conditions be adopted in the economic field so that security should not only be a precarious balance between Powers but also a co-ordinated effort  an harmonious effort  on the part of all nations on earth to achieve better conditions of life  free from the daily more threatening spectre of total war."
"31",1556,"COM",35,1980,"ï»¿Mr. President  it is for me a pleasurable task to congratulate you warmly on your election to the presidency of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. Your election to this responsible post is proof of the general esteem and respect that this Assembly has for you and also of our belief in your ability as an experienced diplomat to carry out this work and preside over our debates. It is also a tribute which the international community is paying to your country  the Federal Republic of Germany  with which many of us have excellent relations.140.	We would also extend our congratulations to your predecessor  our brother Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim  for the firmness and wisdom with which he presided over the various sessions that have been held during this past year. His successful discharge of his functions did credit not only to his country  the United Republic of Tanzania  but also to Africa as a whole.141.	We would also express our appreciation to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  whose tireless work for peace and justice earns him our greatest respect.142.	We welcome to this great family of the United Nations Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and we assure it of our fraternal solidarity.143.	We also congratulate the Republic of Zimbabwe on its admission to this Organization and we hail its gallant people for their brilliant victory over colonialism and racial segregationâin a word  over injustice.â144.	Lastly  we would express our great appreciation to the British Government  the former administering Power  for the considerable efforts it undertook to ensure that the Rhodesia Constitutional Conference  held in 1979 at Lancaster House in London  would lead to the results which now allow the people of Zimbabwe to make their own path towards progress and prosperity.145.	Once more history has demonstrated that our Organization can help to re-establish peace in the world  provided that we are truly inspired by goodwill and courage.146.	We have gathered here in New York once again to consider the progress made by mankind in working towards the objectives set by our Organization when it was established. Alas  we have to confess that the fruits of our efforts have not yet materialized. Of course  it is true that today Zimbabwe has regained its freedom and independence  but there are so many other crises throughout the world that are still without solution! There is the crisis of the world economy  there are crises in Africa  South-East Asia and the Middle East; there are many very distressing problems that require in-depth action on our part if we are to avoid another world catastrophe.147.	For many years now  the establishment of the new international economic order has been on our agenda. There is certainly no doubt but that this question does deserve our full attention  if we wish to break  once and for all  the vicious circle of underdevelopment and abject poverty.148.	The third world has fought for its independence and does not intend to lose it again in the face of the new challenges to it. Economic progress can no longer continue to be the preserve of a minority. We must take care and work to establish a world of equal partners based on the right of all nations and individuals to a life of dignity and decency. Attempts made to that end so far  in particular within UNCTAD and UNIDO  have suffered resounding defeats  for most of the developed countries have not yet agreed to revise their economic policy in respect of the third world. But it is in the interests of one and all of us to remedy this situation  for if recession and inflation persist  the growth rate of all countries  including the most developed  will continue to fall over the next decade.149.	Nevertheless  my delegation welcomes the special session that has just been held on problems of development by our General Assembly. Even though the eleventh special session did not live up to all our hopes  it nevertheless provided the basis for preparing the next round of global negotiations. It also enabled us to restate the urgent need for increasing aid to the least developed countries. However modest the consensus was  it should nevertheless be emphasized  because it is a point of departure for the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries to be held in 1981. We must make active preparations now for that Conference.150.	My delegation is glad to see the international community devoting more and more attention to the very acute specific problems of that category of countries  which includes the Comoros. The least developed countries  in addition to having the lowest gross national product per capita in the world and a growth rate that is virtually zero  also face additional difficulties resulting from the very nature of those countries. This is the case with the Comoros  my country  which  because of the fact that it is an island  suffers from complete isolation and from excessive dependence on the international market. The situation is aggravated still further by an almost non-existent infrastructure as far as air and sea transport and telecommunications are concernedâareas where development requires tremendous financial investment.151.	Friendly countries  on a bilateral or regional basis or even multilateral  have agreed to provide us with assistance  and my Government is indeed appreciative of those offers. However  the fact remains that an even greater collective effort is required from the international community to sup-port our development efforts. To that end  we believe  regional organizations must become increasingly active in this common endeavour.152.	The Organization of African Unity [OAU]  for its part  has now decided to contribute to that effort. It has set up structures for economic co-operation and integration. The most recent initiatives in this area were the Lagos Plan of Action for the Implementation of the Monrovia Strategy  decided upon by the heads of African States in the course of the second extraordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU  held at Lagos last April.  In our opinion  such concrete measures constitute a major contribution to the establishment of the new international economic order and as such  we feel  should be sup-ported by the entire international community.153.	Turning now to the international political situation  I must unfortunately state that it has evolved in a direction that I can hardly describe as positive.154.	My country is seriously concerned over the policy of apartheid that is practised in southern Africa by the Pretoria regime. We whole-heartedly condemn that policy  for it is based on institutionalized racism. A minority can no longer continue to flout the decisions of our Organization and deny the majority the fundamental right to a life of dignity and freedom. The example of Zimbabwe has proved  if any further proof were needed  that it is in no way Utopian to think of a multiracial State based on the equality of all citizens.155.	As far as Namibia is concerned  my delegation continues to consider Security Council resolution 435 (1978) to be a basis for an acceptable settlement. However  South Africa  wishing at all costs to impose an internal solution in Namibia  is responsible for the delay encountered in the implementation of the settlement plan advocated by the United Nations to lead the country to independence. Such delaying tactics and also Pretoria's barbarous repression carried out against SWAPO  the sole and legitimate representative of the Namibian people  can no longer delay the advent of a solution to that tragic problem. We believe that the European group must now adopt a more dynamic attitude in order to encourage the implementation of the United Nations plan. It is the duty of those countries to exert pressure  by appropriate specific measures  on South Africa  so that it will at last realize that it has no option but to accept the decisions of our Organization.156.	In Chad the stream of refugees is constantly increasing  even though the Agreement signed at Lagos on 21 August 1979 had given us great hopes. We support the peace efforts currently being made by OAU. The international community must do all it can to ensure that those efforts are successful  but if they fail the United Nations without further delay must be seized of the matter.157.	As far as Western Sahara is concerned  my country  the Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros  has constantly supported the initiatives of OAU and the international community to find an equitable solution in keeping with law and justice. The ""Committee of Wise Men"" of OAU  to which Africa decided to entrust this matter  seems to be moving towards a compromise that would be acceptable to all the parties involved in the conflict. We continue to believe that it is our duty to make sure that this constructive dialogue continues  in order to safeguard peace in that region and indeed in the world.158.	In the Middle East the situation is more than ever before a serious threat to international peace and security. We are indeed disgusted at the attacks and the perpetual aggression carried out against Lebanon by Israeli troops. Tension in the region is aggravated still further by the establishment of more Jewish settlements in the occupied Arab territories. We condemn such actions  which are contrary to international law. Such a negative attitude can only crush the hopes that had been aroused by certain initiatives taken in the region for peace. Israel can no longer continue to ignore the fact of Palestine  the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and its absolute right to found an independent State on its own land. At its seventh emergency special session  held in July last and devoted to this important issue  the General Assembly reaffirmed that the participation of the Palestinian people is indispensable to all efforts to find a just and equitable solution. I would take this opportunity to reaffirm here my Government's constant support for the just cause of the Palestinian people and the PLO  its sole representative.159.	My country considers that the annexation of Jerusalem by Israel to make it its capital is a serious infringement of international law. Jerusalem must be preserved as a universal holy city. Accordingly we support all the decisions taken on this question by the Islamic Conference and by its Al Quds Committee. More than ever before  our Organization must do all it can to ensure that Israel at last withdraws from the Arab territories it has occupied by force since 1967  including Jerusalem  and to ensure that the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people be respected.160.	Turning to Asia  my delegation would like to express its deep concern over the conflicts which continue to occur there. Afghanistan  a fraternal Moslem country and a member of the non-aligned movement  continues to suffer under a regime that has been imposed by force. Last January our General Assembly adopted by an overwhelming majority resolution ES-6/2  demanding the ending of the occupation of that country by Soviet troops. It is for our Organization to take the necessary steps to enable the Afghan people to exercise its legitimate right to determine freely its own future.161.	Another people in Asia  the people of Democratic Kampuchea  has been stricken by famine and all kinds of epidemics which threaten its very existence. It is the victim of an irresponsible Government imposed by Hanoi.162.	In the name of the sacred principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries  we strongly oppose the presence of Vietnamese troops in Kampuchea. We support the efforts of our Secretary-General and indeed of all peace-loving and justice-loving peoples to help that people regain its dignity and exercise its right to self-determination.163.	With regard to the armed confrontation between Iraq and Iran  we would appeal most urgently to those two fraternal countries to make use of the means of negotiation rather than weapons. If the conflict continues much longer  it will not only run the risk of dangerously aggravating tension in the region but also help to relegate to second place another problem that is still unresolved  that of the holding of the American hostages in Iran.164.	We do not want to interfere at all in the complaints that Iran and the United States of America may have against each other. But diplomatic immunity is one of the very basic principles prevailing in inter-State relations  and in our opinion it would be dangerous to acquiesce in the transgression of that principle by a State Member of our Organization.165.	There is another matter of concern to my country  namely  the explosive situation in the sub region of the Indian Ocean. Like the other States bordering on that ocean  the Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros is deeply concerned at the increasingly active militarization of the area by the major nuclear Powers. Such a situation is a serious threat to international security and  indeed  to the very survival of our States most of which have acceded to independence quite recently.166.	That is why the Government of the Comoros has always declared that it is willing to support any initiative  regional or international  to encourage the implementation of General Assembly resolution 2832 (XXVI) which contained the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace.167.	Accordingly  we support the idea of convening at Colombo in 1981 a United Nations Conference on the Indian Ocean which would  inter alia  be entrusted with the task of studying ways and means of implementing that resolution.168.	Before concluding my statement I should like to refer to one matter which is of paramount concern to my country and to Africa  namely  the question of the Comorian island of Mayotte.169.	At a meeting of the General Committee  my delegation insisted that that item be retained on the agenda of this session so that our Organization could be kept informed of developments. As everybody knows  talks have been held between the Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros and France  in accordance with resolutions adopted by the General Assembly since its thirty-second session. Those talks have made it possible  by common consent  to draw up a series of economic  social and political measures  in order to ensure that Mayotte can gradually and effectively be integrated into the Comoros as a whole. Thus freedom of movement has been restored to the people and visas are no longer required for movement between Mayotte and the other islands. This important measure has indeed  by facilitating communications  contributed to lessening tension among the people of the Comoros. This information has been communicated to the Secretary-General for inclusion in the report on this item. I shall speak on it in more detail when the item comes up for discussion in the Assembly.170. The Government of the Comoros is convinced that the negotiations that have been begun must be continued. We shall do our best to that end. We shall try to avoid any polemical spirit that could damage the negotiations that have been begun with a view to finding a just solution  in keeping with the decisions of our Organization  as soon as possible."
"32",1596,"CPV",35,1980,"ï»¿Mr. President  allow me first of all to extend to you our warmest congratulations on the occasion of your unanimous election to the presidency of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. Your election is a tribute to your country  the Federal Republic of Germany  with which Cape Verde maintains fruitful ties of co-operation  and recognition of your qualities of eminent political and experienced diplomat.191.	It was also a great honour for us  and a cause of deep satisfaction  to co-operate with the former President  Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim. The competence and dynamism with which he conducted the work of the thirty-fourth session demonstrated yet again his undeniable qualities as a politician and a dedicated and skilful diplomat  devoted to the great causes of mankind.192.	We also wish to express our admiration and gratitude to Mr. Kurt Waldheim for the dedication and competence with which he has always endeavoured to serve the United Nations and to transform it into an effective instrument in the search for solutions to the great problems of our time.193.	We express our warmest greetings to the Republic of Zimbabwe  built with the courage of its people and the blood of many martyrs  which has demonstrated the transitory character of all regimes of oppression  however brutal  when confronted with the determination of an entire people to liberate itself. Zimbabwe's leaders  who  during the struggle for national liberation  understood and properly reflected the most profound aspirations of its people and led it to true and authentic independence  have given proof of political maturity  generosity and tolerance  demonstrating also that while Africa makes demands it also knows how to make concessions when its ideals of justice and equity are safeguarded.194.	We also welcome with great satisfaction the admission to the United Nations of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  which has just acceded to sovereignty. The strengthening of our Organization by countries which have recently become independent is without doubt an important factor in the attainment of a better understanding and knowledge of the problems of our time  and represents an inestimable contribution to the enrichment of international relations.195.	In expressing before this Assembly the position of the Republic of Cape Verde with respect to the important items on the agenda of the current session  we cannot fail to note that a number of questions have been discussed year after year  thus proving the intransigence of divergent interests  which  in flagrant violation of the objectives and principles of the Charter of the United Nations  obstinately resist the course of history  perpetuate armed conflicts and situations of oppression and injustice and frustrate the process of economic and social development  which should be the fundamental objective of the efforts of mankind.196.	That situation is a reminder to all nations  and in particular to small countries like Cape Verde  of the global threat that weights over mankind and the long road that lies ahead before peace and security for all men may be regarded as being based on general observance of the principles of equality  mutual respect  peaceful coexistence and cooperation among nations  which arc the true corner-stones of our Organization. As the United Nations embarks on this new decade  it is confronted with a very complex world situation which adds to the burden of its responsibilities.197.	As stated from this rostrum in 1978 by the Prime Minister of the Republic of Cape Verde  Commander Pedro Verona Rodrigues Pires  our country remains loyal to the guiding principles of the policy of non-alignment  in particular the principle of the right to self-determination and independence of peoples  respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity  non-aggression and non-interference in the internal affairs of States and the peaceful coexistence of all peoples of the world.198.	Cape Verde  ever faithful to those principles  wishes to make its contribution to the noble work of the United Nations which  although rendered difficult by a number of limitations  has undeniably contributed to the progress of the idea of justiceâas reflected in the strengthening of the general principles of equality and self-determinationâand to the greater awareness of the sense of solidarity which is a requirement for all States Members of the international community.199.	Step by step  the United Nations is achieving full universality  which is a prerequisite for the full realization of its objectives  namely  to become a forum open to all the peoples of the world represented by independent and equal States  capable of co-operating in discussions of problems that are of concern to us all and in the search for solutions which contribute to the well-being of mankind. Thus  20 years have elapsed since the adoption of the historic resolution 1514 (XV)  which  by reflecting the ideals governing the creation of the United Nations and expressing the aspirations of a large part of mankind  has greatly contributed to the establishment of a new system of international relations directed towards universality of the Organization's field of action and a broader concept of justice and democracy.200.	Soon the task of decolonization to which the United Nations has contributed so much will be completed. However  the few colonial situations still remaining deserve the full attention of the United Nations  not only by reason of the intransigence of those Powers which support them  but also because they risk becoming conflicts which would threaten an entire region.201.	in Africa  where the recent national liberation movements clearly demonstrated the firm will of its peoples to live as masters of their destinies  we are still confronted with the challenge of apartheid  which continues to subjugate and oppress the heroic South African people.202.	Important events last year marked the life of the South African people  who unambiguously demonstrated its total rejection of the regime under which it is kept and its unity in face of that violent system.203.	Faced with the developments in the internal situation  the apartheid regime  while taking so-called liberalization measures  is at the same time intensifying repression against the militants and sympathizers of the national liberation movement  steadily increasing its military potential  in particular through the mastery of nuclear technology  and is making aggression against neighbouring States the keystone of its African foreign policy.204.	It is high time  we believe  for the States Members of this Organization to implement effective measures to assist the South African liberation movement to achieve its objectives with a view to bringing about the advent of majority rule in that country while compelling the minority regime to renounce  once and for all  a policy that  if perpetuated with immunity  could seriously endanger peace and stability in the region.205.	In Namibia  the situation remains tense and uncertain as a result of South Africa's practice of delaying implementation of the United Nations plan for the independence of that country.206.	The aims sought by the international community  which coincide with those of SWAPO  the sole legitimate representative of the Namibian people  must quickly become a reality so that the Namibian people may as soon as possible return to its proper course in history and join other sovereign nations in the international community.207.	In that decisive combat  the Angolan peopleâwho since Angola's independence has paid a heavy toll for its unfailing support to the liberation struggle of the Namibian peopleâdeserves the admiration and firm support of the international community for the sacrifices it is making on its behalf.208.	It is incumbent on the United Nations to take urgent measures to force South Africa to respect international legality and  in particular  the principle of non-aggression and non-interference in the internal affairs of sovereign States. To that end  the establishment of a demilitarized zone along Namibia's frontier with Angola and Zambia would be of the greatest importance.209.	On the question of Western Sahara  we cannot but deplore the continued worsening of the deadly conflict caused by the obduracy of the occupying Power  despite the efforts of Member States and the initiatives taken by the OAU with a view to finding a just and durable solution.210.	The Ad Hoc Committee of Heads of State and Government on Western Sahara  appointed by the OAU in yet another attempt to solve the conflict peacefully  met in September at Freetown  confirmed the recommendations made at Monrovia and declared itself unanimously in favour of a cease-fire and of the organization of a referendum under the supervision of the OAU and the United Nations.211.	However  we are of the opinion that conditions for a cease-fire will be met only by the total withdrawal of the occupying forces from the territory of Western Sahara  which would certainly open up prospects for negotiations between the parties involved in the conflictâMorocco on one side and the Polisario Front and the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic on the other. The United Nations should protect and guarantee implementation of the resolutions on Western Sahara that it adopted  in particular those relating to the self-determination and independence of the Sahraoui people.212.	This session of the General Assembly should pay particular attention to the fratricidal struggle in Chad. If a positive solution is not found soon  as we hope it will be  very serious consequences might ensue  possibly undermining the future of that country for a long time to come. Despite the efforts of the O AU and certain African heads of State  there seems to be no end to the conflict.213.	Solutions involving the help of the United Nations have been proposed and deserve in-depth study in agreement with the Government of Chad.214.	The Middle East continues to be a permanent source of concern for the international community. Israel's intransigence has doomed all peace endeavours to failure and has plunged that region into a situation of instability fraught with serious consequences for world peace and security. The recent Israeli law declaring Jerusalem the capital of Israel and the continued policy of occupation and resettlement of Palestinian lands constitute a new act of defiance and a provocation that the international community as a whole should most categorically reject.215.	The Middle East conflict calls for an over-all solution involving all the parties directly concerned. That solution requires the definitive resolution of the Palestinian question and the restoration to that people of its legitimate national rights  including the right to create its own national State  as well as the total restitution of all Arab territories occupied since 1967.216.	The present instability in Lebanonâanother aspect of the Middle East conflictâshould induce all Member States to make every effort to neutralize those forces which seek to plunge the country into total chaos.217.	In East Timor  the right of the Maubere people to self-determination and independence  as recognized by the majority of Member States  continues to be denied by Indonesia  and every effort made thus far by the international community to overcome the countless difficulties suffered by that people in its struggle for national liberation has proved inadequate.218.	The international community can no longer ignore the tragic situation in that Territory or the determination of the Maubere people  guided by FRETILIN  its sole and legitimate representative  to exercise its legitimate national aspirations. It was with satisfaction that we took cognizance of a recent communique in which the Portuguese Council of Ministers reaffirms its responsibility for the process of decolonization of Timor. We must encourage the Council to carry through its programme of approaching all the parties concerned in order to guarantee  as soon as possible  the exercise by the people of East Timor of their right to self- determination and independence.219.	Concerning the question of Cyprus  we thank the Secretary-General  Mr. Waldheim  for his good offices which led to negotiations between the parties to the dispute. We believe that renewed efforts should be made to bring the two communities on the island to a clear understanding in the interest of that non-aligned country's unity  independence  peace and sovereignty.220.	The tension created in Asia by the state of war between Iran and Iraq is equally disquieting. Aware of the danger this represents for the whole of the international community  'we call upon the two parties to cease hostilities forthwith and to adopt peaceful methods of settling their dispute in accordance with the principles of international law laid down in the Charter of the United Nations with a view to safeguarding international peace and security.221.	With respect to the situation in Afghanistan  an important factor in the crisis now prevailing in Asia and the gravity of which cannot be ignored  we believe that the people of that country should have the right to determine its own destiny and to choose freely its political and social system  thus safeguarding its position in the world as an independent and non-aligned country.222.	With regard to South-East Asia  we continue to be convinced that the conditions for a return to peace and for a climate essential to the pursuit of the development and progress of the peoples in the region require the opening of a dialogue and political negotiation between the various parties involved  on the basis of their legitimate interests.223.	Similarly  our Organization should spare no effort to lead the parties concerned to respect the fundamental aspirations of the coastal States of the Indian Ocean to make it a zone of peace and fraternal co-operation and not a source of tension and destabilization.224.	Despite the encouraging decisions and realistic recommendations of the tenth special session of the General Assembly  devoted to disarmament  and despite the creation of bodies and commissions charged with facilitating the implementation of and ensuring respect for the principles adopted at that time  we are witnessing yet again a dangerous recrudescence of the arms race. It is urgent in this context that the bodies established by our Organization formulate recommendations which are essential for the resumption of negotiations  and do everything in their power to reverse the arms race while contributing to the adoption of practical measures with a view to limiting and eliminating weapons of mass destruction. In this connection  we believe that everything possible should be done to bring about the active and determined resumption of negotiations on the SALT II agreement  which represents an important step towards the objective of peace  which we all pursue.225.	The existing objective links between disarmament and development should thus lead our Organization to develop specific proposals in order to enable the international community to devote an important part of the resources released from the arms race to meet the fundamental social and economic needs of the developing countries  and in particular the poorest among them.226.	The continual and irreversible deterioration of the economies of the poorer countries which prevails in international economic relations calls for the assumption of active and immediate positions in order to avoid reaching a point at which dialogue is no longer possible. All of usârich and poor  developed and developing  industrialized and non- industrialized  belonging to the most diverse political systemsâare aware of the need to redefine existing economic relations. The question of palliatives or fragmentary solutions does not even arise. What we must do is to solve the problem of the creation of new international economic structures which would create new relations. All monetary  financial or economic instruments should be reformulated  some because of their ineffectiveness and the negative role they play in normal relations between States  others because they constitute instruments of domination.227.	The establishment of the new international economic order demands more than resolutions  international conferences or declarations of goodwill. A new international economic order is built through well-programmed and concrete actions but  above all  through committed political will. The choice is between a complex and difficult struggle where undoubtedly there will be no victors but only losers  or the elaboration of a sound project to build a new international economic order which may contribute to the economic and social development of all countries  allowing all peoples decent living conditions  free from hunger  the spectre of disease  premature death  illiteracy and cultural backwardness.228.	The Group of 77 has often made constructive proposals for the definition of a new strategy for development based on global negotiations. Unfortunately  those proposals have thus far found no echo in some of the industrialized countries  which have not yet demonstrated the necessary political will to permit the negotiations to break out of their existing deadlock.229.	This is unfortunate  as we have said  because without that political will the results will be negligible at best  although all the objective conditions have been created by the demands of the international economy itself. Proof of this is the failure of the eleventh special session of the General Assembly. That situation is to be deplored  because a dialogue would be useless without collective concessions and without concrete steps by the developed countries  steps which would revive in us the confidence which has been shaken by so many failures. Without a profitable dialogue the future will be very bleak for the poorer countries but it will also be uncertain for the rich.230.	Manifestations of interdependence  which have become increasingly marked during the past quarter century  give food for thought regarding the possibility of moving forward together. At present it is unrealistic for any country to believe that it can avoid maintaining economic relations with other States  if for no reason other than the fact that it needs to guarantee its supplies of energy  raw materials and a share of the market for its own products. The well-being of all peoples has already begun to depend on the well-being of each one of them. But it is premature to speak of absolute interdependence. Relations of dependency still clearly prevail for the developing countries; this is a factor which must be taken into account.231.	There is no doubt that something must be done at the level of the developing countries. It is true that there are many bridges to be built between North and South. The oil-producing countries possess financial resources which could be placed on a priority basis in the service of the development of the poor countries. Many of the developing countries have enormous reserves of natural resources which  in conjunction with the technology already developed by some of them  would enable us greatly to improve our share of world production. In this connection  the Buenos Aires Plan of Action for Promoting and Implementing Technical Co-operation among Developing Countries and the Arusha Programme for Collective Self-Reliance and Framework for Negotiations' contain very important elements for co-operation among the developing countries.232.	At the regional level  an inventory has been made of these problems  and the measures to be taken have been defined. This is a contribution to the definition of a new international economic order. The Conferences of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at Maputo  Lusaka and Lagosâto mention only initiatives at the African levelâhave already defined the short-term  medium-term and long-term measures necessary for the economic and social development of Africa. However  experience shows us that the co-operation of the developed countries is needed for our just aspirations to materialize.233.	Financial  monetary  scientific and technical re-sources built up in the industrialized and rich countries are indispensable factors for the economic progress of all  and should be placed at the service of all mankind. Contemporary civilization demands this; the creation of a new international economic order demands it. The survival of mankind demands it.234.	When it has created a new order in the regulation of the oceans and their resources  the third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea will have produced a legal document of the greatest importance in the defining of the new international economic order. We are convinced that it is extremely important that the convention  whose text has been under negotiation these last six years  should reflect the interests of all countries  especially the under-developed countries.235.	We know that for the new international economic order to take root  changes in international structures will also call for changes in the internal structures of countries. Ours is a small country which became independent barely six years ago; it is one of the most severely affected countries in the world  with its insularity combining with the problems inherent in its location in the Sahel region. The problems deriving from this situation are sufficiently well known to the international community.236.	Our lack of natural resources and the limitations on our agricultureâboth in the area of arable land and in the availability of water for irrigationârestrict our ability to achieve by our own means the wealth necessary for the requirements of development. Our gross national product is inadequate to balance our economy and does not suffice by itself to reorient our growth rate. However  the development effort of the people and Government of Cape Verde  under the direction of their vanguard party  the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde  to lay the foundations for a viable economy serving the well-being of our people  is well known.237.	In this connection  Mr. Aristides Pereira  President of the Republic of Cape Verde  has affirmed that:""The fact that we have rid ourselves of colonial administration and have regained the fundamental right of independence after long years of glorious struggle  does not prevent us from recognizing that sovereignty has other dimensions  and that the battle for national reconstruction is also a battle for true sovereignty.""238.	In this context  our Government is pursuing an intensive development programme. Our rate of investment in the various sectors of our economy has nearly trebled since 1974  that is to say one year before independence  and has reached the figure of 60 per cent of our gross domestic product.239.	Thus  the Government of Cape Verde has concentrated its investments on the creation of a hydro agricultural infrastructure  the search for and exploitation of underground water sources  the extension of irrigated lands  re-afforestation  the construction of infrastructures for land  sea and air transportation  the building of schools and hospitals: in short  it has concentrated them on the creation of the bases for development and on the fight against prolonged drought and desertification  which constitute an alarming threat for our country.240.	We are happy here to express our gratitude for the important co-operation which the international community and the United Nations bodies have always extended to Cape Verde.241.	We continue to be open to co-operation with all countries which  like us  respect international legality  the sovereignty and the right of peoples to develop in accordance with the social order which best serves their true interests. We uphold co-operation when it is the result of collective responsibility in the struggle against economic  cultural and social under-development.242.	It is with these principles in mind that we call upon the international community and the United Nations organs to continue to grant to our country the technical and material support needed for our economic and social development  and we guarantee that the Government and people of Cape Verde will respond with the effort and dedication which are well known to the international community  so as to make Cape Verde a country of justice  peace and progress.243.	We cannot conclude without reiterating our confidence in the inestimable efforts made by our Organization to bring into being a world in keeping with the cardinal aims and principles of our Charter. The United Nations is showing itself more and more to be the primary framework for international relations. To date it has accomplished a notable task by bringing together the vast majority of the world's peoples to discuss collective problems  in the joint quest for comprehensive solutions to the ills that threaten them.244.	Faced with a future which seems disquieting  the role of the United Nations remains irreplaceable because of the universal dialogue it encourages  the democratic coexistence among nations which it provides  and the progress it fosters towards a new international order oriented towards collective well-being  subject to the profound changes in international morality and law  the result of the effort of all nations  and accepted by them all."
"33",1640,"CRI",35,1980,"ï»¿It is an honour to extend on behalf of the delegation of Costa Rica our warm congratulations to Mr. von Wechmar on his election to the presidency of the thirty- fifth session of the General Assembly.121.	As one who knows and greatly admires the important role played by his country in international affairs  I am not merely extending a courtesy in expressing our firm conviction that  under his leadership and guidance  the deliberations of this General Assembly will be particularly fruitful.122.	Let me also take this opportunity to express our gratitude to Mr. Salim A. Salim of the United Republic of Tanzania for his dedication and energy in serving the international cause. Our warm greetings go as well to the Secretary-General  whose efficiency in the discharge of the complex duties of his high office have earned him our deepest respect.123.	I wish to reiterate my delegation's satisfaction at the recent accession to membership of this Organization by the Republic of Zimbabwe  which has resolved a problem that had occupied the attention of the United Nations for many years. Costa Rica also takes this opportunity to wish a warm welcome to our sister country  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  as a new Member of our Organization.124.	The General Assembly is gathered at a time of hopes and apprehensions. On the heels of the old conflicts which the Organization has been endeavouring to solve  others have followed which are equally grave and which conjure up a picture of grave dangersâdangers about which the Secretary-General has spoken with particular clarity in his report on the work of the Organization.125.	Although the political  economic and social problems of the third world continue to deteriorate daily  we have brought to this General Assembly the conviction that dialogue and perseverance in negotiations constitute the only way to reach the solutions we are seeking. Since the founding of the Organization  my country has faithfully upheld its principles and fulfilled its commitments. Today more than ever we believe in the fundamental importance of this forum for the dignified and peaceful existence of all peoples.126.	My Government has examined with great concern the serious problems facing the international community  and Costa Rica wishes in this respect to set forth its position before this Assembly.127.	We view with particular concern the developments which have taken place this year in the Latin American region  to which we belong for historical  geopolitical  cultural and economic reasons. Despite serious economic  political and social problems which have generated an unprecedented climate of violence in the region  we hold fast to the optimistic view that the peoples and Governments of the countries concerned will prove equal to finding viable solutions to these problems  which constitute the cause and the consequence of the developments I have referred to. We believe that the process of democratic renewal which is arduously but steadily gaining ground in the sister republic of El Salvador will  in the near future  yield positive results.128.	The stabilization and democratic renewal which the people of Nicaragua have experienced during the year are encouraging. The literacy campaign has taken a decisive step towards stability and prosperity for the Nicaraguan people  who have endured the consequences of one of the most ruthless of Latin American dictatorships. We hope that our brothers in Nicaragua will press on along this path of progress and justice and that democracy  political pluralism and the economic and political stability which they enjoy will in turn contribute to the stability and security of the Central American region  for that is the essence of our own security and of that elusive peace for which our peoples yearn.129.	We look forward with particular interest and optimism to the early conclusion of peace agreements between the kindred peoples of Honduras and El Salvador and we have offered our assistance in seeking a final and conclusive solution 130.	I should like now to turn to those issues which are endangering world peace and security  such as the situation in the Middle East  which continues to be one of the most disquieting on the world scene. The Government and the people of Costa Rica observe with concern the excessive tensions which have been mounting in that part of the world. We are firmly convinced that we must begin to focus upon that problem from a universal vantage point  with a view to world peace and international justice as our primary aims. Any sincere initiative which seeks to reduce tension and to create zones of peace will accordingly receive our support. We believe that when international problems take on dangerous proportions  the community of nations should discard inflexible positions and adopt attitudes conducive to achieving stable and true peace.131.	We have on repeated occasions presented our stand in defence of the rights of the Palestinian people to self- determination and sovereignty and to the establishment of their own sovereign State on the territory which was set aside for them by the United Nations. We recognize the right of the Palestinian people to participate in negotiations which affect their future through representatives chosen by them. At the same time  we recognize the right of the State of Israel to peaceful existence within stable and secure boundaries.132.	We believe that the quest for peace should encompass every kind of activity directed towards relieving tensions and that it is necessary to take initiatives which are not initiatives of belligerence.133.	In resolution 478 (1980) of 20 August  the Security Council called upon Member States with diplomatic missions at Jerusalem to withdraw them promptly from the Holy City in order not to give official character to a unilateral act lacking the approval of the General Assembly which could aggravate tensions in the area. My country  scrupulously complying with the recommendations of the Security Council and with a view to averting a worsening of the situation  responded to the Council's request.134.	While recognizing that the Palestinian question is the heart of the Middle East problem  we feel that the problem as a whole may perhaps be more easily dealt with if  agreements attesting to the good faith of the parties could be progressively reached. Brotherhood and peaceful coexistence are the only alternatives; there are no others. But someone must take the initiative in demonstrating that it is possible to achieve dialogue between Arabs and Jews.135.	Israel is the only State created by the General Assembly. It is probable  paradoxically  that the Palestinian State will be the second. The two States will be neighbours. Is it not possible then to begin conversations at once in order to prepare for that eventuality? Both States  with the human and material resources they possess  could be sources of progress and stability for the region.136.	Costa Rica has also with great concern been following the conflict between Iran and Iraq  which constitutes a very dangerous aggravation of the situation in the Middle East. We  in unison with the Security Council and practically all the other Member States  also call for the immediate cessation of hostilities so that an honourable peace may be negotiated between those two States. We applaud the attitude taken by the United States and the Soviet Union of not intervening in this conflict  thus contributing to keeping it isolated and preventing it from further endangering world peace.137.	This Assembly is aware that a lasting peace in the Korean peninsula is essential to the maintenance of stability in north-east Asia and that it has  in turn  implications for world peace. It is for this reason that the Government of Costa Rica takes the view that no effort must be spared to reduce tensions in the region.138.	We believe that dialogue between the two parts of the Korean peninsula is the most positive way to relieve tensions and that it is the way to enable the two parties directly concerned to solve their problems  including the important question of peaceful unification  without outside interference. In present circumstances  my delegation firmly believes that the most constructive way in which the General Assembly could contribute to the solution of the question of Korea would be co-operation designed to create the proper atmosphere in which to encourage a dialogue between North and South. Consequently  we call for the continuation of the dialogue in the spirit set forth in the South-North Joint Communique of 4 July 1972. If substantial progress were to be achieved at the present level  this could lead to eventual contacts at the highest level to the benefit of all. The time has come to urge and promote an independent dialogue between the two parties concerned.139.	My Government cannot shirk the moral obligation incumbent upon it to speak on the situation in Afghanistan. For nearly a year  the invading troops which occupy that country have continued to disregard the will of the majority of the international community which  by resolution ES-6/2 adopted by the General Assembly at its sixth emergency special session  called for the withdrawal of the foreign troops from Afghanistan. Everyone knows that the troops occupying that country are still there  and  for the present  no political solution to the problem is in sight  To the contrary  the foreign forces grow stronger every day  thus denying the fundamental right of self-determination to a martyred people.140.	The situation prevailing in Cyprus continues to be a source of concern to the members of the international community  and we shall support any effort which the Secretary- General may undertake to secure a just agreement that will restore the country's full sovereignty. We hope that  through compliance with repeated United Nations resolutions  the intercommunal talks which recently resumed can lead to a negotiated agreement on the crisis and that the foreign occupation of a part of that country's territory will be brought to an end.141.	We condemn the illegal occupation of Namibia by South Africa  whose obstinate position of disregard for repeated resolutions of the General Assembly and other United Nations bodies constitutes a flagrant violation of its duties as a member of the international community. As we have stated on other occasions  it is time for the General Assembly to recommend  and the Security Council to adopt  stricter measures and even enforcement action to end the occupation that  aside from being illegal  constitutes an open challenge to the mandate of the United Nations in a Territory that was placed under the jurisdiction of the Organization to guarantee its firm and prompt accession to independence.142.	The situation in South-East Asia remains one of the most tense for international peace and security. Serious developments in Kampuchea have had negative repercussions on several countries in the area  and the problem of refugees  as a consequence of the invasion of Kampuchea by foreign forces  remains unresolved  despite the best efforts of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the economic co-operation of the many countries which have contributed generously to the effort to alleviate in part the hunger and suffering attendant upon the displacement of entire populations involved in the conflict. My delegation hopes that a speedy solution will be sought for the sake of thousands and thousands of innocent victims.143.	On 27 September 1978  the President of the Republic of Costa Rica  Mr. Rodrigo Carazo Odio  set forth before the General Assembly for its consideration his proposal to establish a University for Peace.  It is a well-known fact that the General Assembly accepted by consensus  in 1978  the draft proposing the study of this question and that in 1979 it approved the idea of the establishment of the University for Peace and set up an international Commission to prepare the structure and organization of the institution and set it in motion. The Commission  under the co-ordination of Mr. Rafael Caldera  former President of Venezuela  met twice this year  once at Headquarters and the second time at San Jose  Costa Rica  and adopted a report  which has been submitted to the Secretary-General in which it recommends to the General Assembly that it adopt the proposal for the establishment of this academic centre  together with a draft charter for the University and a draft agreement laying down the procedures for its creation  which  in conformity with the provisions of resolution 34/111  are to be considered by this General Assembly.144.	The Secretary-General endorsed the report of the Commission and the procedure recommended therein  expressing in addition his judgement that the conditions established by General Assembly resolution 34/111 had been fulfilled  as was very ably reported to the Second Committee by the Assistant Secretary-General of Secretariat Services for Economic and Social Matters  Mr. Diego Cordovez.145.	At the threshold of the twenty-first century  mankind cannot neglect any prospect for peace. My country's initiative seeks to contribute in some measure to that end. We must resolve to forestall any hint of violence  any form of war  for the perils of a new world war could spell the last conflict in the history of mankind. We hope therefore that our initiative may prove an effective instrument in the pursuit of total peace which will allow mankind to live free from strife and ensure the stability of our world.146.	The world is in a state of crisisâthe crisis of development  the crises resulting from ideological clashes  the crises born of fanaticism. Today  more than ever before  mankind is caught in a dilemma: to survive with justice and liberty or to fall victim to the varieties of totalitarianism  to armed conflicts and to violence.147.	War is a pressing danger. Mankind is living through crucial times and no country  region or area is more important than another  measured by the contribution that each can and should make to achieve peace. Nations  whatever their size  geographical location  language  history  race or religion  have an important role to play in maintaining universal harmony and in ensuring the survival of mankind. No one  therefore  can relegate States to a passive role in this undertaking. Large or small  they have a dynamic mission to fulfil in the quest for new avenues to peace.148.	In this conviction  my Government urges the General Assembly to adopt the proposal for the establishment of the University for Peace. An initiative such as this enhances the fundamental principles of the San Francisco Charter as well as the dignity of the members of this Assembly that approved the idea by consensus at the last session.149.	We are grateful for the interest shown by the Secretary-General  the efficiency of his staff  the dynamic spirit shown by the members of the international Commission  and the enthusiastic support of many Governments for this project.150.	In the conviction that no hindrance can relieve us of the historic responsibility of furthering peace  the Government of Costa Rica will continue resolutely to pursue this undertaking  confident as we are that the University for Peace will provide a mainstay for the realization of the noble principles enshrined in the Charter.151.	The President of Costa Rica  Mr. Rodrigo Carazo Odio  delivered the inaugural address on 9 June this year to the World Congress on Education for Disarmament  held at UNESCO headquarters  and it is worth-while to recall some of his words. Among many ideas of special interest to this Assembly  he said:""War and peace in the coming years will depend upon the pursuit of the arms race or of disarmament  but above all upon our decision to transform education and the communications media into instruments of peace.""Mankind has endeavoured to apply the most varied methods and formulas in an effort to check war  hatred and violence. There remain only two: education and information. If we do not turn these into instruments of peace  there will be no twenty-first century.""152.	At that Congress the President of Costa Rica proposed three initiatives  which I shall summarize as follows.153.	First  UNESCO and other institutions devoted to education for peace throughout the world should pool their efforts to prepare an immediate  interdisciplinary plan of action encompassing all levels of education  informal patterns of education and the complex phenomena of communication. With that end in view  the University for Peace is being formed in order to take an active part in the process.154.	Secondly  serious consideration should be given to the suggestion of the Secretary-General that one tenth of 1 per cent of the resources utilized in the military sector should be earmarked for purposes of education for peace.155.	Thirdly  given the urgency of the situation  and in the conviction that education plays a central role in the attainment of peace  it is proposed that the years 1980 to 1990 be declared the decade of education for peace  and that in view of the close links between human rights  education for peace and disarmament  the right to peace should be recognized and proclaimed a fundamental human right.156.	Recent negotiations on international economic issues have demonstrated the difficulty of modifying the existing international economic order. The tenuous results of the eleventh special session of the General Assembly held here recently clearly indicate the developed countries' aversion to sharing in any restructuring of this obsolete economic order.157.	Although the struggle to transform the conditions prevailing in the world economy and to stem the crisis which it is undergoing is both difficult and time-consuming  we believe that  given perseverance and unity in action  new ideas can be brought to fruition. We are convinced of the need to establish a new international economic order. The present order  built upon injustice  is an indictment against us all. From conviction to a political decision there is a long road to travel. We  the countries of the third world  must make that journey in our struggles.158.	Because we are certain of the effectiveness and necessity of joint action  we have been pursuing a policy of real and effective solidarity with the developing countries. Our efforts have been aimed not only at promoting a united front of developing countries but also at fostering  together with our Latin American and Caribbean brothers  practical means to bring our peoples closer together by strengthening plans for integration and specific programmes of assistance of many kinds with a view to fostering what is termed the ""South-South dialogue"". 159.	We shall firmly support any efforts exerted at the present session for the pursuance of global negotiations within the United Nations  in order to reach workable agreements on the time-table and agenda for those negotiations.160.	We wish to place on record our thanks to the delegation of India for the effective manner in which it acted as chairman and spokesman of the Group of 77 during the year ending 30 September last  and for the dedication  skill and dynamic commitment with which it discharged its difficult task.161.	At the same time  my delegation wishes to express its satisfaction at the election of our sister republic of Venezuela to the presidency of the Group of 77 during the year beginning 1 October 1980. We are sure that the Venezuelan delegation will discharge its commitment with equal distinction and dedication.162.	Among oil-producing countries  Mexico and Venezuela have been the first to take the pioneering step of using petroleum as an instrument in negotiations designed to build a new international economic order and of proposing that petrodollars be recycled in such a way as to benefit the developing countries. These two countries have contributed in a spirit of solidarity  a significant percentage of their oil earnings to the development of other third-world countries  including my own.163.	Convinced of the efficacy and necessity of concerted action  we have commended the policy of solidarity of the kindred nations of Mexico and Venezuela with the developing worldâa policy embodied in the Joint Declaration signed at San Jose  Costa Rica  on 3 August this year by the two heads of State  benefiting Costa Rica and the other countries of Central America and the Caribbean by ensuring the supply of hydrocarbons to the region through new mechanisms of co-operation and financing.164.	It was felt in Latin America that this agreement bridged the gap between words and deeds in international relations. The hope was expressed that actions such as this would be emulated throughout the world  as a sign of active solidarity among sister countries  and that this exemplary attitude might serve as a model to other petroleum- producing countries in their relations with non-petroleum- producing countries which are their clients.165.	It is well known that the question of communications has come increasingly to the fore in international affairs. Costa Rica is of the view that the impact of communications upon modern man is growing daily and that it is of the greatest importance that the States Members of the United Nations give early consideration to the possibility of placing organizations such as the International Telecommunications Union on a sound footing upon which to face the demands of our times.166.	As a technical-political factor  communications have their basis in the natural right of every human being to communication. Principles such as that of ""first come  first served"" in the allocation of frequencies are unacceptable at this stage in history. We also regret the disagreements which arise between United Nations bodies with regard to communications issues  which can be extremely harmful in this sphere.167.	I wish to express our great satisfaction at the fact that the ninth session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea has produced an informal text for a draft convention  After so many years of intense labour and negotiations  the nations of the world  are about to benefit from a universal law of the sea. The importance of such an instrument can surely escape no Government.168.	Costa Rica  together with other delegations  gave its support to the inclusion of the principle of the utilization of the sea for peaceful purposes. This principle  we feel  will contribute to international peace and security. The Government of Costa Rica also welcomes the inclusion of the principle of good faith in the discharge of the rights and duties arising out of this convention  as well as a recognition of jus cogens with respect to the rules governing the common heritage of mankind. However  my Government is concerned by the fact that it proved impossible for the sponsors of the various proposals to arrive at a consensus text on the delimitation of maritime boundaries between adjacent States or those facing each other. The international community should give serious thought to this matter 169.	After so many years of enormous efforts  we are finally able to consider in its entirety the structure of the code of the sea  which shall in truth constitute one of the most comprehensive and important legal instruments in history and a basis for peaceful and harmonious relations among nations. Costa Rica deplores the enactment of unilateral legislation in this sphere by certain developed countries  which have hampered delicate negotiations aimed at achieving a convention which will equitably regulate the exploitation of the resources of the sea. I hope that  at the next and final session  consensus can be reached on this and other outstanding issues so that we can proceed to the signing of the convention at Caracas  Venezuela 170.	The international situation in the field of human rights is not overly encouraging  The persistent and flagrant violation of these rightsâinherent in the human personâis in many cases the cause  and in others  the consequence of international conflicts. Respect for human rights is the corner-stone of peace and harmony among all the world's peoples. Costa Rica  which has made a credo of compliance with and promotion of human rights  is well aware that the best weapon against subversion and social unrest is respect for human dignity. Only to the extent that the individual's rights are respected and that justice is done him  will there be peace and harmony among peoples.171.	Human rights cannot be confined to civil and political rights  but must also include economic  social and cultural rights. It is thus evident that human dignity will not be fully achieved with the mere enunciation or implementation of the traditional political and civil rights. The development of peoples must be intimately linked with human liberation. Only in this way can we achieve the aim of full respect for the dignity of the individual  which requires the simultaneous observance of civil  political  economic and cultural rights.172.	Unfortunately  the elaboration of effective instruments for the promotion and defence of human rights has not attained a satisfactory level. Costa Rica considers that it is necessary to reassert the legal and moral commitment which accompanies membership in this Organization: respect for and promotion of fundamental human rights. In this connection  the Charter of Conduct of Riobamba"" is an achievement of great importance in the development of legal principles on the observance and implementation of human rights and fundamental freedoms.173.	Costa Rica has the honour of being represented by its President  Mr. Rodrigo Carazo Odio  who was invited to that historic meeting by the distinguished head of State of the sister republic of Ecuador. He took that opportunity to add the voice of our country in support of the ideals and principles which were reiterated and strengthened. Costa Rica continues to have faith in them and it maintains a sustained interest in the idea of the creation of the post of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.174.	Having heard the many positive statements of speakers who have preceded me during this general debate  my delegation is encouraged to continue to advocate that idea.175.	One of the issues which causes us the greatest concern is that of refugees  an historical phenomenon which has in recent times reached unprecedented proportions. It can be said that there is not a region in the world today which is not facing this problem and even Central America  which has in the past been a land of refuge for victims of persecution from every continent  has now become a land of refugees  thus converting a noble tradition into a sorrowful experience which affects the destiny and future of thousands of men  women and children  who are more often than not innocent. A few months ago  in order to resolve an unprecedented crisis in the Caribbean  my country provided a bridge for thousands of refugees to gain access to the freedom for which they longed. This undertaking  of which we kept the Secretary-General of this Organization constantly apprised  was a humanitarian gesture devoid of any political intent and aimed solely at mitigating the suffering of many human beings  We hope that members of the international community will hasten to the aid of refugees wherever they may be  but above all we hope that future problems of this kind will be avoided. This can be achieved only if all parties to a conflict accept and abide by the most elementary rules of international law  which afford protection to civilians even in time of war.176.	We must once again reiterate our categorical rejection and firm condemnation of racism in all its forms  especially that which adds insult to crime by seeking to institutionalize itself as a system  as has happened with apartheid in South Africa.177.	When we speak of apartheid we have nothing new to add  but we should consider the time that has been devoted in the United Nations to denouncing one of the most monstrous political ideologies mankind has known  and one of the political systems most incompatible with humanity that has ever been devised. I should like once again to express our solidarity with the views reiterated here by the representatives of African States. For their peoples  the struggle against apartheid is no political slogan  but a vindication of their humanity.178.	During the sixteenth  seventeenth and eighteenth centuries more than 10 million Africans who crossed the Atlantic contributed to the formation of what are now our peoples and our cultures. This is why  when we speak of the problems of the African continent  we are not speaking of something foreign  but of something which is a part of us.179.	The process of decolonizationâa concrete result of the exercise of the right of self-determination of peoples  which is one of the foundations of the United Nationsâis almost a completed task. The process will be effective only if freedom is accompanied by a decent standard of living. Hence  any effort by the international community to assist its new members in their economic and social development is not only advisable  but commendable.180.	My Government supports and will continue to support all just struggles aimed at giving effect to the right of self-determination within the framework of General Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) and 1541 (XV)  which have guided and sustained the process of decolonization; it is now 20 years since they were adopted. We maintain as a matter of principle that it is up to the peoples themselves to exercise their right to self-determination  and that no State or group of States can or should assume the role of a champion of the liberation of peoples without the consent of those peoples. Accordingly  it is our view that the sole and legitimate repository of the right to self-determination is the people  and that no one should deny it  or impose on it  the exercise of this sacred right.181.	Year after year all our delegations gather at this Assembly to discuss the increasingly dire perils to which the nuclear Powers have condemned mankind. At a time when the economic and social situation in the world is one of stagnation and decline  we observe in studies  in statistics  in the reports of the Secretary-General and in the statements of Foreign Ministries the world over a single trend that is for ever on the upswing: that of the military expenditure and budgets of the great Powers and the growth of nuclear arsenals.182.	We have observed also that the technology which makes the most rapid strides is the technology of war  the technology of destruction. Countries such as my own  the countries of the third world  beset for so long by countless economic and social problems  look on with concern as the arms race becomes the only area of competition between the great Powers.183.	There are few who rise up against this tendency and their voices are not listened to. What more can be said at this stage  except to re-emphasize the urgency of stifling that irrational urge to increase and refine instruments of destruction and taking stock of the extreme gravity of the situation we face?184.	Costa Rica  in conformity with its pacifist convictions  believes that only reconciliation and peace can open the way to progress for our peoples. It is time that decision makers throughout the world took cognizance of the issues which year after year have been the object of the attention of this Organization  issues to which no one is indifferent and which are the concern of all peoples.185.	It must be acknowledged that to date nothing has been achieved since the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe  held at Helsinki in 1975  despite the hopes initially aroused by its results. A second review session of the Conference is to take place at the end of this year at Madrid. We earnestly hope that this new effort will be successful in every sense  for in view of the situation prevailing in international relations today it is imperative that the signatories to the instrument which may emerge at Madrid transcend purely rhetorical exercises and determine that deeds must conform to words.186.	Costa Rica has submitted for the consideration of the group of Latin American States its candidature for the seat corresponding to the region in the Security Council which will become vacant at the conclusion of the two-year term served by Jamaica in 1979-1980.187.	The group of Latin American States has not been able so far  by following its established practice  to reach a decision in this regard  as there are two candidates for a single seat. Consequently the problem may have to be resolved in the General Assembly by a vote taken according to the procedure laid down in the Charter of the United Nations.188.	Costa Rica has vigorously argued that the non- permanent members of the Security Council should not only belong to the respective regions  as provided in Article 23 of the Charter  article 143 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly and resolution 1991 A (XVIII)  but  precisely in order to give effect to the principle of equitable geographical distribution set forth in the first of those provisions  should also represent their respective regions objectively and subjectively and should consequently be chosen and proposed to the General Assembly by their regional groups.189.	We have submitted our candidature to the Security Council in the first place because it is our conviction that at least under the circumstances now prevailing in Latin America and the Caribbeanâthe two being inseparably linked by common traditions  history  problems and aspirationsâ Costa Rica is objectively in the best possible position to represent  in the best and fullest sense  the interests and views of the region as a whole. My country not only is at the geographical centre of the Americas but also occupies the centre position among the diverse regimes which make up the vast political spectrum of our continent  It is at the centre also of the various ideological currents in the Americas and at the centre of the continent's different economic realities  standing as it does between the weakest and least developed countries and those which are gaining entry to the group of the rich and powerful. It is at the centre of America's social and cultural differences  it is in satisfactory harmony with all  and it does not represent  by its size  influence or endeavours  a possible threat or source of conflict to anyone.190.	Secondly  we have put forward our candidature because we are also subjectively disposed to accept and discharge the duty of representing our regional group in the Security Council  It is not that we believe it is always possible to achieve within the group the consensus necessary in order to speak on behalf of Latin America or as its representative. On the contrary  we are aware of our differences and believe that they can and should be voiced with regard to the important issues discussed in the Security Council. Nor would we shirk our responsibility in decision-making in the Council for lack of a consensus.191.	The point I wish to make is that within the group of Latin American States there is more that unites us than that divides us  and that our determination to represent the group as a whole would strengthen the proper role of the group itself as a melting-pot of differences and a source of common action.192.	We have resolved  and we undertake  to convene the group to discuss problems which may arise for us as a member of the Security Council  to take into account the reasons advanced by all members  to convey  when it exists  their collective view and  when it does not  their individual views: in short  loyally and gratefully to live up to the honour of being allowed to represent the kindred peoples of Latin America by occupying their seat in the supreme organ of the United Nations system.193.	But we have also been led to submit our candidature by considerations of a universal character related to our very concept of the United Nations in general and of the Security Council in particular.194.	We believe that there is already sufficient cause for concern in the presence and extraordinary power of the permanent members of the Security Council  which represent their own conflicting interests. We must not fail  therefore  to strive to ensure that the non-permanent members refrain from aggravating that confrontation by lending themselves to a game of arithmetical skirmishing in which their role is merely to tip the balance; to ensure that they do not align themselves in any way with any of the various power groups but instead draw their inspiration solely from the principles of the Charter of the United Nations in the interests of the international community as a whole  taking a position not as partisans but as true judges prepared to vote for justice and the law even against their own immediate interests or those of the respective power groups.195.	Obviously  it is not enough merely to say this  or to be subjectively prepared to live up to it without the objective conditions necessary for doing it. Costa Rica not only says it and declares its resolve to do it  but ventures to claim qualifications backed by the complete concordance of those views with our national interest. Costa Rica's credentials in advancing its candidature for the supreme organ of international peace and security include the fact that it is one of the very few countries in the world which has taken the decision to disarm without conditions and without waiting for others to do so first  abolishing its army by constitutional provision in terms such that not even the imminent danger of world war has compelled it to renounce its stand for peace.196.	Costa Rica is proud to be the holder of several important records in international affairs. It is a country which has most speedily ratified the international conventions concluded by the United Nations  the Organization of American States  the ILO  UNESCO and other international organizations. It has accepted all international jurisdictions  such as that of the International Court of Justice  the Commission on Human Rights  the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. It has complied with all the decisions and even with all the recommendations of those bodies. It is also one of the countries which has made the greatest headway in subordinating its internal law to international law and in incorporating the latter into the former  to the extent that international covenants  by express constitutional provision  are applicable immediately as national laws and take precedence over statutory legislation  while the general principles of international law  comprising fundamental human rights and freedoms  whether embodied in formal legislature or not  are recognized as taking precedence over our Constitution itself 197.	It is for those reasons that we feel that Costa Rica can  as a balancing factor  bring to the Security Council its contribution to the maintenance of international peace and security  given its record of voting and actions that demonstrate its true non-alignment  its faithful compliance with the principles of the United Nations  its recognized respect for international law and human rights and also its exemplary stance as one of the few completely unarmed countries in the world.198.	The wide recognition of those circumstances has already warranted extensive support for our candidature. That support has engaged our gratitude and strengthened our will to fulfil honourably our duties in the Security Council  provided that we are  as we trust  honoured with the necessary majority of votes for our election 199.	I should like to conclude by reiterating Costa Rica's confidence in the fruitfulness of our debates and in the spirit of understanding which must guide our negotiations. Since the founding of the United Nations my country has placed its trust in the Organization and today more than ever we believe in the decisive role which the General Assembly can play in making the future of mankind one of peace  freedom and universal justice."
"34",1686,"CSK",35,1980,"ï»¿Mr. President  I should like to congratulate you on your election to the demanding office of President of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. I wish you  and the Secretary General as well  every success in carrying out your responsible tasks  to ensure a positive outcome of our deliberations.129.	I also wish to express appreciation for the work of your predecessor  Mr. Salim  whom we have had the pleasure of welcoming to our country.130.	We welcome to our midst the new Members of the United Nations  the Republic of Zimbabwe and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.131.	This is the thirty-fifth time since the end of the Second World War that this world assembly has been convened. For Czechoslovakia  this post-war period represents years of prosperity and of building an advanced socialist society in conditions of freedom and peace. We therefore understandably strive for the further intensification of the results of the policy of peace  security and cooperation  and of the policy of detente.132.	We are therefore exerting every effort to ensure that at the current session the General Assembly not only reviews the state of world affairs but also strengthens the noble ideal of raising the level of all nations in the spirit of the Charter of the United Nations  at whose birth in San Francisco Czechoslovakia was present; that ideal is as valid today as ever.133.	Therefore  in our foreign policies  side by side with the Soviet Union and the other fraternal socialist countries and as a party to the Warsaw Treaty and a member of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance  Czechoslovakia has consistently been ruled by the principle recently emphasized by the President of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic  Gustav Husak  when he said that in today's world there is only one reasonable  tried and acceptable path  that of peaceful coexistence among States  whatever their social systems may be  which responds to the interests of all nations; the path of political dialogue  of continuing and further expanding the process of detente  of developing international cooperation; a path leading to the halting of the arms race and to disarmament.134.	We feel it necessary constantly to stress that fundamental premise of our policy  especially in the present circumstances in which  following the 1970s  quite rightly termed a decade of detente  the world finds itself  through the fault of the most reactionary imperialist and hegemonistic forces  in a rather complicated situation.135.	However  let us look for the beginning of these complications not in December 1979 but at least as far back as May 1978. And let us look for it not in Afghanistan  but in the nearby city of Washington  in the conclusions reached by the Council of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] in its deliberations. Because it was there and then that an attack was launched against the policy of detente and the existing and generally recognized approximate balance of military forces between East and West.136.	How else can we describe the decision steadily to increase the armaments of NATO right up to the end of this century? What can we say about the fact that those who are already sufficiently armed as it is have nevertheless decided  in addition to flood Western Europe with new medium range missiles? Who started to delay and complicate the ratification of the SALT II Treaty? When did this happen and  especially  why did it happen? Why is the anti-peace and anti-progressive alliance of international imperialism and Chinese hegemonism constantly being strengthened with ever-growing intensity? Do American military bases abroadâfrom Guantanamo in Cuba  across eastern Africa and as far as Diego Garcia in the Indian Oceanâserve the noble idea of spreading detente to all continents? Or is the newly proclaimed nuclear strategy  which fosters the naive illusion of the acceptability of some kind of ""limited"" nuclear war  to be taken as a peace-making gesture and an indication of concern to improve the international situation?137.	There are many such questions one might ask  but there is only one answer. We are dealing here with the result of a reversal in the policies of the United States and some of its allies in an effort to achieve military superiority. It is this reversal that constitutes the primary reason for all the negative phenomena to be observed in current world affairs.138.	Our dearly bought experience  gained in two world wars  tells us that this indisputable fact cannot be concealed by any propagandistic sophistries about a supposed ""threat from the East""  or some ""superiority of the East""  and therefore some alleged ""necessity"" to increase defence capabilities.139.	A process of such vital importance as detente must  in our view  be approached honestly  responsibly and as a matter of principle. It is necessary to strengthen all the pillars on which this process rests; to mobilize to that end both individual and collective efforts by nations and Governments; to put an end to political  economic and military blackmail and intrigues by imperialism against other States and peoples; to put an end to the policy of acting from a position of strength; to tackle boldly everything that disturbs international stability; to desist from risky  and. at the same time quite unrealistic  attempts to destabilize the military equilibrium in the world; to refrain from efforts to replace a system of normal relations by a system of sanctions; to strive for political solutions to even the most complex problems on the basis of equal security and  of course  to revive political dialogue  because only through patient  pragmatic negotiations  not through emotionalism and boycott  can we achieve positive results which will benefit the cause of peace and guide international life into calmer waters.140.	The most recent and striking proof of the real possibility of pursuing this course has been provided by the Soviet Union's talks with France and the Federal Republic of Germany at the highest level  and by their results.141.	Our policy is thus clear  understandable and immutable. It aims at new horizons in detente  which is nowadays synonymous with a universally beneficial policy of peaceful coexistence among States with different social systems.142.	That is why  together with our allies at the meeting on 14 and 15 May at Warsaw of the Political Consultative Committee of the States Parties to the Warsaw Treaty  we proposed a meeting of representatives at the highest level of States in all parts of the world  whose task it would be to eliminate hotbeds of international tension and to prevent war  while paying special attention to European security and the preservation of peace on the European continent. At that time we also submitted a comprehensive action programme consisting of highly constructive proposals for clear and specific measures to promote military detente and disarmament. At the same time  we fully endorsed the thought-provoking initiative taken by Leonid I. Brezhnev concerning the solution of the burning problem of medium range missiles in Europe  which should take place concurrently and in organic relationship with the question of United States forward based nuclear systems.143.	We expect that a positive role in this will also be played by the second review session of the Conference on security and cooperation in Europe to be held at Madrid  In a diligent and constructive atmosphere  it should help to strengthen confidence  security and mutually advantageous cooperation  in keeping with the Helsinki Final Act of 1975. And above all  it should play a part in the decision to convene a conference on military detente and disarmament in Europe.144.	As a State situated in the centre of the strongest military concentration in the world  we are trying to give a new impetus to the difficult Vienna Talks on the Reduction of Forces  Armaments and Associated Measures in Central Europe. We are striving assiduously for progress in these talks; we are constantly submitting innovative proposals; we are offering mutually acceptable solutions. This highly responsible and constructive approach to the question of military detente in Europe has been demonstrated by the unilateral withdrawal of a considerable number of Soviet troops  tanks and other equipment from central Europe. So far  unfortunately  this step has met with no positive response.145.	Only a year ago an important appeal was made here in a draft submitted by Czechoslovakiaâthe Declaration on International Cooperation for Disarmament.  That appeal is perhaps even more urgent today than it was yesterday  because in the current complicated situation it is doubly necessary to strive to secure implementation of the ideas contained in that Declaration.146.	It is in this sense that we interpret the whole set of proposals by the Soviet Union contained in the memorandum entitled ""peace  disarmament and international security guarantees""  and  in particular  the initiative submitted here by Andrei Andreevich Gromyko proposing the inclusion in the agenda of this session of a new item entitled ""Urgent measures for reducing the danger of war"". There is no doubt that the refusal to create new military groupings or expand the existing ones  the refusal to increase armed forces and conventional armaments  the strengthening of the security safeguards of non-nuclear States and the general and complete prohibition of nuclear weapon tests would have a very favourable influence on the international climate and would create conditions for progress in disarmament.147.	We fully associate ourselves also with another important Soviet initiative proposing that at the present session the General Assembly should earnestly deal with the question of the historical responsibility of States for the preservation of the natural environment for present as well as future generations. A thorough consideration of this important proposal and the adoption of the necessary decisions would surely benefit the cause of peace  encourage the spirit of detente and contribute to the development of fruitful international cooperation.148.	We stress the urgent importance for the current disarmament negotiations to be brought to a successful conclusion. We attach paramount importance to practical progress in the work of the Geneva Committee on Disarmament. But one of the most pressing needs of the present time is  in our view  the ratification of the Soviet American SALT II Treaty.149.	We continue to hold the view that it is necessary to convene a World Disarmament Conference as soon as possible  preferably immediately following the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament  to be held in 1982.150.	Unfortunately  this year once again we have not come any closer to a solution of the situation in the Middle East. It is becoming ever clearer that the transparent attempts to present the Camp David blind alley as an avenue to peaceful settlement have been doomed to failure from the very beginning. That is why we reiterate most emphatically that only the withdrawal of the Israeli troops from all Arab territories occupied in 1967 and the safeguarding both of the right of the Arab Palestinian people  represented by the PLO  to self-determination  including the establishment of an independent State  and of the right to sovereignty and security of all States in that region can ensure lasting peace in the Middle East. We fully support the decisions of the seventh special emergency session of the General Assembly on Palestine. At the same time we wish to express our categorical and fundamental disagreement with the illegal annexation of Jerusalem by Israel.151.	Concern has been expressed about the armed conflict that has recently flared up between Iran and Iraq. We firmly believe that hostilities between the two countries will be discontinued and that the existing problem will be resolved by peaceful means.152.	In recent months attacks by imperialist  hegemonistic and reactionary forces have been levelled against the assistance granted by the Soviet Union to Afghanistan  upon the request of its legitimate Government  in the spirit of the Soviet-Afghan Treaty of 1978 and fully in accordance with the Charter of the' United Nations  in defence of its sovereignty. We denounce this undignified campaign  for which even this rostrum is being used. We regard it as yet another attempt at interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign State Member of the United Nations.153.	As Czechoslovakia has constantly emphasizedâand as reflected  inter alia  in the joint communique adopted at the conclusion of my July visit to Afghanistanâthe key to the much needed political settlement of the situation does exist. It is a complete halt to the armed aggression and external interference directed against the Government and the people of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and the provision of reliable and firm guarantees that this will not be repeated in any form. In this connection  we fully support the proposals addressed by the Government of Afghanistan to Iran and Pakistan on 14 May which provide sufficient leeway for all parties who are genuinely interested in negotiating.154.	We are also deeply concerned at the fact that a threat of aggressionâof a so-called military lessonâis still hanging over Southeast Asia and that attempts continue at interference in the internal affairs of the peoples of IndoChina. As was again eloquently demonstrated last February by the important results of the visit by our Party and Government delegation  headed by President Gustav Husak  to Viet Nam  Kampuchea and Laos  we are extending comprehensive support to the peoples of those countries in their just struggle for the construction of a new society and the safeguarding of durable peace in that region.155.	We favour a thorough and comprehensive consideration by the General Assembly of the question of peace and stability in Southeast Asia  as envisaged in the proposals that we have cosponsored. The results of our deliberations should contribute to a political solution of the questions in dispute  a relaxation of tension and the strengthening of mutual cooperation among the countries of that region.156.	We support the statement adopted on 18 July 1980 at Viet Nam by the Conference of Foreign Ministers of Viet Nam  Laos and Kampuchea  which puts forward valuable suggestions concerning the transformation of the entire region into a zone of peace and stability.157.	We welcome the forthcoming talks between the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Viet Nam and Thailand here in the United Nations. We equally welcome the new three point proposal submitted here by the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  in accord with the People's Republic of Kampuchea. In our judgement  this provides an important basis for a truly peaceful settlement of the situation in Southeast Asia.158.	At the same time we condemn the scandalous fact that representatives of the Pol Pot regime  accessories to the historically unique genocide of their own people  are  to the detriment of the Organization  still occupying the seat which rightfully belongs to the legitimate Government of the People's Republic of Kampuchea.159.	While speaking of these matters  we cannot but express our astonishment at the fact that even this rostrum is being misused in order to disseminate fabrications about the use of chemical weapons in Kampuchea and Laos. Indeed  everybody who has been to IndoChina must have seen the terrible consequences of the use of those weaponsânot their current use  which is a complete fiction  but the well-known use of toxic chemicals in the years of the aggressive war against Viet Nam. Is this not a case of a thief shouting  ""Stop  thief""?160.	I wish to stress that we welcomed the resumption of talks between the two communities in Cyprus. However  should this promising opportunity be wasted  then the settlement of that question will undoubtedly be put off for a long time. We therefore venture hope that the favourable atmosphere at the first meeting will result in a successful final settlement  based on the assured independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and nonalignment of the Republic of Cyprus as a united nation.161.	We support the efforts of the People's Democratic Republic of Korea for the peaceful reunification of Korea  and we call for the withdrawal of the United States troops from the southern part of that country  in keeping with General Assembly resolution 3390 B (XXX)  which still awaits implementation.162.	This year  as we commemorate the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the historic Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  we once again speak out resolutely for the eradication of the last remnants of colonialism  in support of the just struggle of the people of Namibia  headed by SWAPO  as their sole legitimate representative  for freedom and independence. We equally support the struggle of the people of South Africa for the complete elimination of the regime of apartheid and racial discrimination which threatens not only its neighbours but also world peace and security.163.	We are aware of the importance of the intimate relationship between the policy of detente and the world economy. The squandering of material resources on insatiable armament programmes constitutes  in our view  the principal cause of the current difficult problems  upheavals  stagnation and other crises  the victims of which are mainly the developing countries. It is therefore necessary to restructure international economic relations and place them on a democratic footing.164.	The recently concluded eleventh special session of the General Assembly  on economic questions  has shown more clearly than ever before the complexity of this entire range of problems and how they are to be solved. Although the special session did not meet our expectations to the full extent  we are convinced that continued negotiations on these problems will culminate in positive results and facilitate equitable international economic cooperation.165.	One measure of the effectiveness of the Organization's work is the strict observance of the Charter  which has amply proved its viability throughout its existence. In our view  therefore  there is no need to change it. Only one thing is necessaryâto abide by the Charter and implement it to the full.166.	We are convinced that at the current session the General Assembly will concentrate on the crucial areas of world politics which determine its main trends  relegate secondary issues to the background and indicate a way to reach a constructive solution to the key questions of international lifeâhow to strengthen peace  security and disarmament. We intend to assist in every possible way the attainment of that objective."
"35",1709,"CUB",35,1980,"ï»¿It had been planned that our Foreign Minister would address the Assembly. However  given the great concern that has been caused by the conflict between Iran and Iraq and the obvious desire of the countries of the non-aligned movementâa desire shared by many other countriesâto see an end to that serious incident  the current Chairman of the Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries  Fidel Castro  decided to send Foreign Minister Malmierca to the countries involved  as his representative  in order to initiate a mission of good offices  which is now proceeding.2.	We earnestly hope that a peaceful negotiated settlement will speedily put an end to that conflict which divides two members of the non-aligned movement and which entails serious consequences for both those countries  the countries of the third world and the interests of international peace and security.3.	On behalf of the Government of Cuba and its Minister for Foreign Affairs  I should like to extend our cordial congratulations to Mr. von Wechmar on his unanimous election as President of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly and to pledge our determined co-operation in the discharge of his important functions.4.	We should also like to express our great admiration for the exemplary manner in which his predecessor  Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim  conducted the proceedings of the thirty- fourth session of the General Assembly and those of the three special sessions over which he presided. His performance in presiding over the meetings of this body does honour to his country  the United Republic of Tanzania  and the entire African continent.5.	We wish also to express our appreciation for the outstanding work which the Secretary-General has done on behalf of international peace and security.6.	I come to this rostrum on a day of special significance for Cubans. Today we commemorate the one hundred and twelfth anniversary of the beginning of our heroic struggle for independence. We are also celebrating the return to our land of the first cosmonaut of Cuba and of Latin America. A few hours ago  the people in the capital  Havana  on behalf of all Cubans  extended to Colonel Tamayo and his companion pilot: the special welcome which that event deserves. That sums up the achievements of 20 years of our revolution and it is our modest contribution to the efforts being made for the development of science and technology in the service of peace and progress for mankind.7.	Today we are completing the general debate of this session of the General Assembly. If anyone could give a precise definition of the nature of our deliberations  it would unquestionably be that the overwhelming majority of those who have preceded me to this rostrum have expressed great concern over the ominous turn of events in the international situation during the last few months.8.	There has not been a greater threat to the peace and security of the world since the time of the so-called cold war and the ""policy of brinkmanship"". Mankind's aspiration to move towards detente  general and complete disarmamentâ especially nuclear disarmamentâdevelopment and international economic co-operation has been frustrated time and again by the re-emergence of a policy of war  the replacement of dialogue by confrontation  the stagnation of negotiations to limit strategic weapons and the non-ratification of the SALT II agreement   as well as by the failure of the eleventh special session of the General Assembly devoted to economic questions and the constant deterioration of the economies of the developing countries.9.	To those factors which have a negative effect on the world situation must be added the emergence of new sources of tension and discord in various parts of the world  the aggravation of problems in the Middle East as a result of the expansionist and colonialist policies of Israel  the increased tension in the Indian Ocean  the Arab Gulf and the Caribbean and Central American region as a result of the escalation of the war-like policies of the United States and the establishment of new bases and imperialist facilities in those areas. Also there has been as increase of interventionism in South-East Asia  encouraged by the hegemonists in Beijing and their new allies in the United States  and in El Salvador and the formation of a reactionary ""holy alliance"" against the revolutionary peoples and countries of Africa  Asia and Latin America.10.	When we speak of peace we must necessarily refer to the one and indivisible peace which the peoples of the world wantâa peace with responsibilities and benefits for all  and not a limited peace  one which is of interest only to some Powers. Peace must be universal and must be based on respect for the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of States  within secure and recognized boundaries. There can be no peace without detente and disarmament. That is why it is necessary for us to concentrate our efforts on achieving an effective relaxation of international tension and continuing negotiations on the limitation of nuclear weapons and general and complete disarmament. Also  there can be no peace without development.11.	The need to establish a just and equitable international economic order  to eliminate unequal exchanges and barriers to the expansion of trade with the developed countries; the need to transform the world monetary system so as to reflect the requirements of our countries; the need to ensure  during this decade  a massive flow of financial and material resources for development; the need to transfer technology in assailable and un-burdensome conditions; and the urgent need to give assistance to the relatively less developed countries and to promote economic  scientific and technological co-operation among our countriesâall these constitute sine qua non conditions for a just and lasting peace.12.	This is not mere rhetoric. The legitimate interests of each of the 154 States Members of the United Nations must be recognized now and no one must be guided solely by narrow national interests  no matter how justified those interests may be. The world will not be capable of tackling or  of course  resolving the grave economic problems which have arisen during the last fifth of the century without broad and deep international co-operation.13.	Cuba hopes that the obstacles and difficulties which we recently encountered when we discussed the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade  and especially the next round of global negotiations  arising from the intransigence and narrow-mindedness of a few developed capitalist countries  will be overcome in the coming months so that we can lay the groundwork for the necessary co-operation which our peoples demand.14.	Twenty years ago the United Nations took a step of historic importance when it adopted the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. In the years since then the political map of the world has changed radically with the attainment of an independent sovereign life by dozens of countries.15.	Today we welcome the entry of the Republic of Zimbabwe into the Organization as a full-fledged Member  following its historic victory over the forces of racism  oppression and colonialism. We also welcome the emergence of the Republic of Vanuatu and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines as new independent States.16.	The disgrace of colonialism and the monstrous outgrowth of the racist mentality that is known as apartheid still prey on the peoples of southern Africa. After years of unfruitful negotiations  which in various delaying tactics have reflected the twisted intentions of South Africa and its Western allies  and despite the firm resistance of the Namibian patriots under the leadership of their legitimate representative  the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO]  Namibia continues to be occupied and the will of the international community has been brutally stifled by the racist regime of Pretoria and the handful of imperialist countries which support it to the hilt by preventing the implementation of the sanctions provided for in Chapter VII of the Charter.17.	In the year of the twentieth anniversary of the Declaration against colonialism  Cuba reiterates its unswerving solidarity with the people of Namibia  with its vanguard  SWAPO  and with the cause of its independence and sovereignty throughout the entire Territory  including Wallis Bay. Our support also goes to the black people of South Africa and to their liberation movement  the African National Congress [ANC] in their just struggle against apartheid and for a majority government of the people.18.	The remnants of colonialism are not limited  however  to southern Africa. Once again we proclaim the right of the Latin American people of Puerto Rico to self-determination and independence; the right of Belize to complete the process of decolonization and accede to independence without further delay and to preserve the integrity of its territory; the right of the Sahraoui people to establish a sovereign  free republic in its ancestral home; the right of Madagascar to recover its sovereignty over the islands of Juan de Nova  Bassas da India  Europa and Glorieuses; and  finally the right of all subjected peoples to emancipate themselves finally from colonial domination.19.	Similarly  Cuba supports the unconditional withdrawal of United States troops from the south of the territory of Korea and the peaceful reunification of the Korean people without foreign interference.20.	We support the right of the peoples of Indo-China and of the whole of South-East Asia to live in peace and security and we reject any interference in their internal affairs. We also condemn the usurpation of the legitimate rights of the Government of the People's Republic of Kampuchea in the Assembly by the genocidal Pol Pot clique.21.	The question of Palestine  the core of the Middle East conflict  has today won the support of all progressive mankind. For more than 30 years the Palestinian people  under the courageous and staunch leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]  it sole legitimate representative  has been waging a battle against the Zionist State of Israel  which has been trying to trample upon its inalienable national rights.22.	It must be repeated that a just and lasting peace in that crucial part of the world can be achieved only by the unconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces from all the Arab and Palestinian territory occupied since June 1967; by the effective exercise by the Palestinian people of its inalienable rights  including its right to return to its home  to receive compensation for the losses caused by the illegal occupiers and to establish its own State in Palestine; and by the participation of the PLO  on an equal footing in all negotiations which may take place to resolve the question of the Middle East. In that context  Cuba reiterates its vigorous condemnation of the so-called Camp David accords  in so far as they claim to provide a solution of the Palestinian question without the PLO  of the unilateral decision by Israel to modify the international status of Jerusalem and to establish its capital there  and of the bandit-like policy of settlements in the occupied territories.23.	In accordance with the decisions of the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at Havana from 3 to 9 September 1979  Cuba considers that the international community must demand the implementation of the most severe sanctions provided for in the Charter of the United Nations against the Zionist regime of Israel.24.	The situation in the Indian Ocean requires the most rapid possible implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace and to that end we support the convening at Colombo of the Conference on the Indian Ocean in accordance with General Assembly resolution 34/80 B  and  as a complement thereto  the summit meeting proposed by the President of Madagascar  Didier Ratsiraka.25.	The irrational forces which pull against the tide of history are attempting to return us to the world of barbarism and fascism that existed before the birth of logic. The creation of interventionist ""special rapid deployment forces"" is compounded by the installation of 500 missiles with nuclear warheads in Western Europe  the interruption of negotiations on disarmament and the threat of non-ratification of the SALT II agreement; as well as the attempt by the United States Congress unilaterally to revise the Panama Canal Treaties  signed only after an historic battle by the people and Government of Panama; and the creation of new alliances and military installations  in this and other continents  with obvious expansionist and counterrevolutionary purposes.26.	Invoking arguments which have been rejected by our peoples  they are attempting to convert the Caribbean into a Yankee lake and plotting all kinds of conspiracies against the revolutionary countries of the area. To their plans to destabilize the Governments of Jamaica and Grenada  we can now add their open support for the Fascist military- Christian Democratic junta in El Salvador through the supply of the weapons and technology of genocide and the repetition of the shameful stages of their collusion with the regimes of Trujillo  Somoza and Batista. The Monroe Doctrine has been resuscitated with the abject complicity of certain Latin American regimes which  betraying the legacy of the liberators  have colluded in the extermination and persecution of the Salvadorian patriots. Our peoples will punish such base cowardice.27.	Cuba condemns the brutal repression of the Fascist military against our brothers in El Salvador  as well as the attempts to intervene  directly or indirectly  in that country  with a view to undermining the inevitable victory of the people  Cuba restates its support for the heroic resistance of the Bolivian people against the military coup  fomented and supported by outside forces  which cancelled out the electoral victory of the People's Democratic Union and has subjected the country to a shady and corrupt tyranny  headed by a group of international traffickers.28.	The policy of harassment against the Cuban revolution is continuing: the blockade persists and new imperialist threats are voiced; fresh terrorist attacks have been made upon our diplomatic missions abroad  such as the attack against a staff member of the Cuban Mission to the United Nations  our unforgettable comrade Felix Garcia.29.	In Latin America some still claim to be defenders of human rights while trampling under foot the memory of Bolivar and taking part in the genocide of the Salvadorian people. In a recent  unprecedented step  they proposed the acquittal of the group of convicted assassins who  in 1976  to the horror of the world  blew up an airborne plane full of Cuban passengers over Barbados  causing the death of 73 persons. The inconceivable actions of the Venezuelan authorities can only encourage in future the carrying out of new and cowardly terrorist acts.30.	Those who once again believe that they can encircle and isolate the Cuban revolution arc mistaken. Today  as yesterday  the acts of aggression and plots of the imperialists and their lackeys will come up against the courage and determination of our people. The voice of Cuba will never be intimidated or silenced. No reactionary force can stand in the way of the victory of the peoples of Latin America.31.	For the peoples of the third world  the existence and strengthening of the United Nations system has acquired growing importance. Created to safeguard peace and to prevent the recurrence of war  the Organization has become an indispensable driving force behind initiatives in support of detente  general and complete disarmament  decolonization and international co-operation. Its universal character must be reaffirmed  as must its primary role in the creation of a new international order that is just and equitable and as an instrument to produce peaceful solutions to conflicts which have convulsed the world in its present phase of upheaval and transformation.32.	The policies and principles of the movement of non- aligned countries have always been primarily aimed at the conservation of the independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and security of our peoples; the elimination of interference and foreign intervention in the internal and external affairs of States and of the use or threat of the use of force; the elimination of colonialism and neo-colonialism  apartheid  racism  including Zionism; the prevention of the division of the world into blocs; the halting of the arms race  especially of nuclear arms and achievement of general and complete disarmament under effective international control; the promotion of solidarity and co-operation among the non-aligned countries; the speedy establishment of the new international economic order with a view to speeding up the development of developing countries  eliminating inequality  hunger  sickness and illiteracy; the establishment of a democratic system of international relations based on the equality of States; respect for and preservation of human rights and fundamental freedoms  If these objectives are to be attained  our movement considers that it is necessary to strengthen our world Organization. We pledged our support of these goals at the Havana Conference and we will spare no effort to achieve them.33.	In the capitalist world undermined by the economic  political and moral crisis which characterizes those societies that are no longer in step with history  the forces that would bring us back to the past may be heard  the dark forces of fascism  expansionism and war may still be found. Let no one be mistaken  the outlook in the next 20 years is discernible. Either the international community will be capable of placing the fabulous resources of the scientific and technological revolution at the service of mankind through cooperation and through the building of a new system of world relations  or mankind's hopes for a world free of the scourge of war  oppression and poverty will be frustrated once again.34.	As revolutionaries we arc not frightened by the idea of future social change being produced through violent means  But if we are not to be remiss  we must realize that tomorrow's world will come about peacefully only if our generation is capable of exchanging weapons for tools of labour; confrontation for dialogue; and pursuit of narrow national interests for fruitful and just collaboration among all nations.35.	Cuba will always be ready to help to achieve these lofty ideals  contained in the Charter of the United Nations."
"36",1755,"CYP",35,1980,"ï»¿181.	Mr. President  I should like first of all to extend to you warm congratulations on your election to the presidency of the thirty-fifth session of this Assembly of nations and express the best wishes of the Government and people of the Republic of Cyprus for a successful outcome of our deliberations under your enlightened guidance. Your unanimous election to this high office not only reflects the confidence of the international community in your personal diplomatic acumen but also constitutes recognition of the role of your country  with which we maintain friendly relations in world affairs.182.	I should like also to express the well-deserved admiration which your predecessor  Ambassador Salim of the United Republic of Tanzania  earned by his outstanding performance during the thirty-fourth and the sixth and seventh emergency special sessions and the eleventh special session of the General Assembly.183.	We wish also to commend for his work and achievements that indefatigable fighter for the cause of international peace  security and justice  Mr. Waldheim  who soldiers on despite adverse conditions and inadequate machinery for the implementation of the resolutions and the attainment of the objectives of the Organization.184.	It is with joy that we welcome the Republic of Zimbabwe to our midst and the admission to membership of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. We assure those new Members of our close co-operation in the years to come. The attainment of independence by new nations bolsters our hope that the world is moving in the right direction  towards the dignity of man. The case of Zimbabwe signals the encouraging message that  after all  reason is powerful enough to prevail.185.	The thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly has begun against the background of emergency and special sessions and of a deteriorating international situation fraught with political and economic tensions and deepening crises. The agenda of this session is loaded with issues of major importance which must be viewed with the necessary will and determination if we are to promote solutions to the problems plaguing humanity and safeguard international peace and security and legal order.186.	The past year has seen a weakening of relations between the great Powers and also of the process of detente. Furthermore  the frenzied escalation of the arms race and the violations of international law and the code of conduct among States do not augur well for the thirty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations.187.	In the face of alarming and unpredictable international developments  the Secretary-General  in his report on the work of the Organization  significantly comments that""It is rightly a matter of general concern that the decisions of the Security Council and the resolutions of the General Assembly often go unheeded  so that problems which should have been brought under control persist  proliferate and pose continual threats to international peace. This failure also has a debilitating effect on the United Nations itself'. 188.	Within this context  the Secretary-General poses the question of whether the concept of international peace and security as outlined in the Charter is still a valid and feasible aim to strive for and  if it is  how to proceed to make the United Nations machinery effective. No doubt the response to the question should be in the affirmative; and  of course  implementation of United Nations resolutions could decisively improve the grim outlook of today. In this regard  the proposal made by the President of the Republic of Cyprus for the holding of a special session of the General Assembly on this issue may be recalled.189.	Peace-keeping and peace-making can also decisively contribute towards the effectiveness of the United Nations and the entrenchment of international peace and security. It is by now accepted that while peace-keeping is in itself very significant  it should be followed by  or combined with  peace-making. Otherwise  it becomes an end in itself and contributes to the perpetuation of a problem rather than to its solution. It acts like a sedative and soothes the pain without curing the disease. In this connection  I consider it my duty to reiterate our appreciation and gratitude to UNFICYP for its commendable task of keeping the peace. It is our sincere wish and objective that its praiseworthy services will be necessary for the shortest possible period.190.	Obviously  international peace and security cannot be attained through an unrestrained arms race. The fostering of confidence among States  leading to a restriction of armaments and to detente  is a sine qua non. The relationship between disarmament and international security  as indeed between disarmament and development  forms the basis of current efforts for the achievement of a more peaceful and balanced international order. Moreover  genuine and lasting peace can only be based on the effective implementation of the provisions of the Charter.191.	The cardinal issue in this field is nuclear disarmament  in the direction of which we have regrettably made only marginal progress what we witness at present is a deplorable escalation of strategic competition and other actions which nullify the contents  and frustrate the objectives  of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.192.	As far as my country is concerned  I would recall the proposal made by President Kyprianou for the complete disarmament and demilitarization of the Republic of Cyprus.193.	Within the general framework of efforts for the promotion of detente  co-operation among States and international security  of outstanding importance is the second review session of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe  the preparatory phase of which is currently in session at Madrid.194.	My country  together with the other non-aligned and neutral European States  will be at pains to bring about a positive outcome of the deliberations at Madrid. Cyprus believes that the implementation of the provisions of the Helsinki Final Act will be instrumental in the strengthening of peace  security and co-operation in Europe  the Mediterranean and the rest of the world.195.	Parallel to that  and of equal importance  are the efforts for the establishment of the new international economic order. It is by now acknowledged that no nation or group of nations can safely prosper in isolation  while others live in poverty  need and deprivation. There is no moral foundation whatsoever to support a world society of haves and have-nots. However  we note with regret that the eleventh special session of the General Assembly failed to make adequate progress towards a just and equitable economic order. While voicing our disappointment  we express the earnest hope that the necessary political will may be forthcoming in the near future so that the iniquitous world economic system will be gradually replaced by a new order and a more balanced distribution of wealth  financial means and potentialities. We should start building on the limited progress achieved by the special session  such as the consensus on the text for the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade. It is our hope that it will prove possible to advance towards an agreement on the global round of negotiations along the lines set out by the Group of 77  which represents the concerns of the majority of the world community.196.	Another issue of major concern to the developing countries is the creation of a new information and communications order  which has been rightly defined as forming an integral part of the wider issues concerning a more just and equitable world order. The United Nations itself  and in particular UNESCO  has a leading role to play in this regard and Cyprus will continue to render steady support to this end.197.	Another area of particular concern to the whole world and one in which progress has recently been achieved is the law of the sea  the economic and political ramifications of which reach far beyond the three fifths of the earth's surface which is covered by the oceans. It is our hope and trust that during the coming year the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea will succeed in resolving the outstanding issues and that it will place before the world the text of a convention which will fairly distribute the wealth of what has been defined as the common heritage of mankind.198.	While we review international problems  particular attention is due to the problem of the Middle East and Palestine  which was the subject of the seventh emergency special session of the General Assembly. Let me state at the outset that  in our view  there can be no comprehensive peace in the Middle East without a just and viable solution of the problem of Palestine  which lies at the core of this grave international problem. Cyprus has consistently supported the inalienable right or the Palestinian people to self-determination  which we consider to be a historical  national and human necessity. Cyprus furthermore recognizes the PLO as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. We firmly support the right of the Palestinians to establish their own independent sovereign State.199.	We deplore the dispersal and displacement of the Palestinian people and the dispossession of their properties  as well as the ongoing creation of faits accomplis in the occupied Arab lands  such as the establishment of settlements and the recent unacceptable action purporting to affect the status of Jerusalem. The occupying authorities must cease their practices and must withdraw speedily and unconditionally from all Arab territories occupied since 1967. Furthermore  belligerency must come to an end and the sovereignty  territorial integrity and political independence of every State in the area must be recognized and respected; and so should the right to recognized boundaries. It is our view that the solution of the problem can emerge only from concerted efforts exerted within the framework of and in compliance with resolutions adopted by the Assembly and the Security Council  and not through partial agreements.200.	The situation in Lebanon  a neighbouring country with which my own maintains close relations  is a source of concern to us. It is our hope that the problems which at present divide its people will soon be solved and that Lebanon's sovereignty  territorial integrity and unity will be maintained and respected.201.	At this point I would voice concern and anxiety over the open hostilities between two neighbouring countries  namely Iran and Iraq  and express the fervent hope that those hostilities will soon end and that the parties will solve their differences through peaceful means.202.	We also maintain that the problems in South-East Asia and in other areas of the world should be solved in accordance with the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations  in such a way as to preserve the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of every State and on the basis of the wishes of every people concerned.203.	It is our hope and trust that the Sahraoui people will soon enjoy the fruits of unhindered national independence throughout the exercise of their right to self-determination. My country calls for the implementation of the United Nations resolutions on Western Sahara without further delay and we voice support for the initiatives of the OAU towards the solution of this problem.204.	Indeed  this year marks the twentieth anniversary of the landmark General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV)  whereby the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples was proclaimed. The United Nations can take justifiable pride in the historic achievements over the 20 years which have since elapsed  in the course of which a chorus of nations emerged from colonial rule to independence.205.	After so many years of debate there appears today to be unanimity in declared positions  although unfortunately not in terms of the action required  about the need for the eradication of racism in southern Africa as manifested by the occupation of Namibia and the practice of apartheid in South Africa. We have to acknowledge that for as long as those situations persist it will be impossible for us to assert that the process of decolonization has ended.206.	Cyprus acknowledges the special responsibility of the United Nations for Namibia and the role of the United Nations Council for Namibia  of which my country is a member  to administer the Territory until its independence. We deplore the constant efforts by the South African Government to impede the implementation of Security Council resolutions 385 (1976) and 435 (1978) and of the United Nations plan for a peaceful settlement of this important question. We condemn any and all unilateral actions by South Africa in violation of any plan  especially those which undermine the unity and territorial integrity of Namibia  such as the attempts to detach Walvis Bay from the rest of the Territory in violation of Security Council resolution 432 (1978). We are also concerned with the possible threat to international peace and security which the prolongation of this problem  coupled with repeated acts of aggression against Angola and Zambia  entails.207.	We take an equally strong stand with reference to the eradication of the evil of apartheid  an anachronism which has rightly been defined as State terrorism and a violation in toto of human rights and values. On that issue as well we join in calling for concerted international action for the implementation of the relevant United Nations resolutions  which can lead to the extinction of this evil.208.	The promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all is an ongoing process  and their universal application should be of global concern. Continuing violations of human rights should be dealt with effectively and the discrepancy between declarations and realities  as well as selectivity in the approach to human rights violations  should be eliminated.209.	It is true that we have come a long way in the field of human rights since the establishment of the Organization. Thus we have seen the idealistic declarations and the principles embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights acquire binding force through the International Covenant on Economic  Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The Human Rights Committee is destined to serve precisely the purpose of seeing to their application. Similarly  the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination  established under the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination  acts as a watchdog  considering the measures taken by the contracting parties to give effect to the provisions of the Convention. I should also mention the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid  which has its own machinery.210.	The Commission on Human Rights takes a more pragmatic approach  with the appointment of special rapporteurs on human rights and the establishment of working groups such as the one on missing and disappeared persons.211.	We welcome those positive developments in the belief that when individuals and nations are deprived of their rights and fundamental freedoms  universal concern should be expressed not by word alone but  more importantly  by deed and concerted action. 212.	The non-aligned movement  to which we belong  today has an enhanced role in world affairs. An impressive array of 95 nations and two thirds of the world's population give it its influential stature. Cyprus will remain dedicated to the movement and to its principles.213.	As the twentieth century crosses the threshold of the last 20-year span of an eventful life  the Government of the Republic of Cyprus  which yesterday celebrated the twentieth anniversary of its independence  presents before the Assembly for the seventh consecutive year its problem; the problem is the same  with the same setting and the same protagonists. This year  however  the tone is different. A ray of hope brightens the scenery: the intercommunal talks have got under way.214.	Although more than six years have elapsed since the tragic events of 1974  Cyprus is still striving for its independence  sovereignty  unity and territorial integrity. The plight of all the people of Cyprus still persists in all its manifestations: the misery of the refugees is rampant all over the country  and the untold suffering of the relatives of missing persons calls for a solution of this purely humanitarian problem.215.	Since 1974  when the Cyprus problem in its present form was first discussed in the General Assembly and the Security Council  a host of other major international issues have piled up. Veteran diplomats confess that the vibrations from the international political turbulence are felt at the United Nations more strongly and menacingly for peace than ever before.216.	In the maelstrom of world events the Cyprus problem has a position of its own. It is the problem of a small country  but the stakes are high. Cyprus lies where three continents meet. The area just outside its periphery is dotted with some of the biggest names in international affairs: Palestine  the problem of the Middle East  the Suez Canal  Middle Eastern oil  the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO]  Greco-Turkish relations  bloc confrontations. Tremors in the vicinity might be as harmful as if they occurred in a porcelain shop.217.	The United Nations has adopted a number of resolutions relevant to the question of Cyprus. Their contents have been the subject of long deliberations amongst Member States. Those resolutions  together with the high-level agreements of 1977 and 1979  constitute the basic material which will be used by the two interlocutors in the Cyprus talks in their quest for a solution to the problem. Another valuable factor will be the climate of good will and understanding which has prevailed since the inception of the talks. In any type of negotiation  good will and understanding are the underlying elements of success.218.	We give our full and unequivocal support to the talks which have started recently in Cyprus. We believe that people must communicate and try to understand each other if they are to obviate difficulties and resolve problems. We are neither optimistic nor pessimistic about the chances of success of the talks. At this stage we consider it more appropriate and constructive to concentrate on the process and to focus our attention on the contents and substance of the talks as they progress than to try to surmise what the eventual outcome will be. We do not lose sight of the fact that on some of the issues the views of the parties are poles apart. This is not a reason for abandoning the talks. It is a reason for trying harder. After all  people negotiate because they differ  not because they agree.219.	The resumption of the talks was achieved after many months of unflagging efforts and as a result of the resoluteness of the Secretary-General and his collaborators and their dedication to the cause of peace. Their task has not ended with the resumption of the talks; it has just begun. They have to travel an uphill road  together with the negotiating parties. The tenacity  the wide experience and the consummate ability of the Secretary-General to grapple with delicate international issues will prove tremendously helpful when the parties come to grips with the problem.220.	The basic infrastructural elements of the federal republic which will emerge from the negotiating table if the talks succeed are set out in the aforementioned high-level agreements and in United Nations resolutions. If there is adherence to the principles enshrined in those agreements and resolutions  if moderation  fairness of mind and objectivity persist throughout the negotiations  and if good will and patience prevail not only when things appear to be easy but at difficult moments as well  then we may look forward to a political miracle in addition to the economic miracle for which Cyprus was given the accolade of economic experts. Political miracles  however  like economic miracles  differ from ordinary miracles in that there is nothing miraculous about them. They are the product of hard and painstaking efforts and of a pragmatic and wise approach to facts.221.	The failure of the Cyprus talks will signify a failure of the whole people of CyprusâGreek and Turkish; there will be no winners. It will further signify failure and setback in the cause of world peace.222.	We shall therefore try as hard as reason permits  not only for Cyprus and its people  but equally for peace and justice  which are so much cherished but at the same time so strikingly missing from today's world."
"37",1823,"DDR",35,1980,"ï»¿Mr. President  please accept my congratulations on your election to your office  which is both a high and responsible one. I wish you and Secretary General Kurt Waldheim success in your functions and I assure you of the assistance of the German Democratic Republic in all endeavours to strengthen international peace and cooperation.67.	The outgoing President  Mr. Salim  also deserves credit for his work over the past year.68.	My greetings and good wishes go likewise to the new Member of this world Organization  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.69.	In the 35 years of its existence the United Nations has helped to make peace more secure and international cooperation more fruitful thus meeting the wishes and hopes of peoples  after the bitter experiences of the war and the first post-war years.70.	In these times of a strained international situation full of complications and tensions  the United Nations is once more rightly expected to oppose those who are again toying with war behind a veil of rhetoric about peaceful intentions  and to encourage all those who are defending peace as their most precious asset.71.	Therein reside the obligation and the responsibility of this General Assembly.72.	The ultimate purpose of peaceful coexistence is to preclude war as an instrument of politics. And that means more than merely the silence of weapons. Peace  as the first and most fundamental of human rights  is to be made dependable and enduring for all time  and conditions should be such as to permit peoples fully to develop their creative power for their own good. A peace of that kind can rest only on the reduction and elimination of the physical means of warfare  on strict mutual respect for the basic rights of peoples and on the readiness of all States to settle controversial issues dispassionately  with a sense of political reason and in a constructive manner  along the lines of the Charter of the United Nations. Those are the objectives underlying the foreign policy of the German Democratic Republic  which will at all times unswervingly steer that course both in its bilateral relations and in its activities within the United Nations.73.	The European peoples and States have every reason to defend resolutely the promising beginnings of peaceful coexistence between States having different social systems. More than three decades of peace is something unprecedented in history. That achievement must not be jeopardized. Detente came to gain ground on our continent because good sense  the recognition of historically grown realities and a sober assessment of self-interest have increasingly determined the conduct of States. The Final Act of the Helsinki Conference symbolizes that.74.	Readiness to seek both dialogue and political solutions has played a substantial part and all have benefited from that. In the face of the worsened international situation  constructive dialogue is now more urgent than ever. The socialist States are ready for it. There is no other way  except that of renewed dangerous confrontation.75.	The German Democratic Republic has always been aware that global and regional measures to strengthen international security are closely interrelated. That interrelationship also explains the worldwide interest in the forthcoming meeting at Madrid of the States parties to the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. The German Democratic Republic is working jointly with the other socialist countries to ensure that the meeting will above all encourage concrete moves to add military detente to political detente.76.	One move of this kind should be the convening of a European disarmament conference. With their declaration adopted on 15 May this year  the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty have submitted a realistic and forward-looking programme for continuing the dialogue and for new agreements to strengthen peace. Arms limitation and disarmament steps are of crucial importance for the peaceful evolution of Europe. Time and again  the socialist States have taken initiatives to that end at the Vienna Talks on Mutual Reduction of Forces  Armaments and Associated Measures in Central Europe. The unilateral withdrawal of Soviet contingents and combat equipment  which was agreed between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic and has since been concluded  shows how seriously the socialist countries pursue military detente in Europe. It is now urgently necessary to enter into negotiations on the problem of medium range nuclear missiles and of the forward based nuclear systems of the United States.77.	The German Democratic Republic seeks good neighbourly and mutually advantageous relations with all Western countries too. It is aware of the great weight that a relationship of peaceful coexistence between itself and the Federal Republic of Germany represents for European security. This derives cogently both from the geographical situation of the two German States and from their historical and legal obligation to do everything so that never again will a war originate on German soil. This justified expectation of peoples establishes a responsibility with which the deployment of ultramodern American nuclear missiles cannot be reconciled. The interests of European peace require political realism. Attempts to call in question the post-Second World War order in Europe  which are again and again noted in this forum too  reflect an illusion that is dangerous  because it ignores the course of history. Such attempts spread insecurity and distrust and encourage those bent on confrontation.78.	There can be no return to the past. The existence of the German Democratic Republic in the centre of Europe is in the interest of all peoples  because it impedes any design to push the peoples into the vortex of another world war. The existence of two German States and the normalization of their mutual relationship have a stabilizing effect on our continent.79.	The German Democratic Republic has displayed and is displaying goodwill so as to continue expanding its relations with the Federal Republic of Germany on the basis of the treaties  agreements and accords  that is to say  of international law.80.	To strengthen detente and to diminish the danger of war is the overriding concern of our time. It requires all our attention and maximum efforts. But it likewise requires clarity of vision as to the causes of the tense international situation  all the more so since there is indeed no lack of misrepresentations of them. The deterioration in international relations has not come overnight; it has a prior history. The preparation and the step by step implementation of the long-term programme of May 1978 of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] can be reconstructed point by point. A modified nuclear targeting strategy has been officially proclaimed which calculates the possibility of waging nuclear war.81.	Time and again official Government statements have declared entire regions of the world to be zones of influence of certain Powers  and rapid deployment forces have been set up to guard so-called vital interests. The latest news confirms such plans for Europe too. Shows of military strength  particularly in the Indian Ocean and in the Caribbean  are becoming more and more frequent. The installation of new bases in foreign territories  chiefly in the Indian Ocean and Red Sea areas  is being hastily pursued.82.	All this is being done in order to upset the existing sensitive balance of power and to regain military superiorityâin short  to obtain the dominance of imperialist and hegemonist forces. The threat and use of forceâa policy of strengthâhave  again  been conceived to replace endeavours for the peaceful accommodation of interests  and political diktat backed up by huge weapon arsenals is calculated to supersede the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. Those policies are directed against the vast majority of States. They must be stopped for the sake of the peace and wellbeing of peoples.83.	Socialist foreign policy is marked by consistency  dependability  prudence and action. This goes for times of peaceful relationships and much more so for times of tension and danger  such as we are experiencing at present. The socialist States have pointed out what needs to be done so that the international situation may rapidly change for the better.84. Indispensable is a firm struggle against the arms race. Ongoing negotiations should be intensified and all useful proposals should be taken into account so that the spate of words about disarmament and arms control will at last be followed by deeds.85.	Indispensable is the will of all States to settle political controversies or conflicts peacefully and with mutual recognition of legitimate interests  and to refrain from any action that could have an exacerbating effect.86.	Indispensable is the definitive liberation of all peoples from colonialist and racist oppression.87.	And indispensable  finally  is an equitable and non-discriminatory cooperation among States. It is the only way to ensure prosperity and security for all nations. It is the only way to alleviate the global problems of mankind and to resolve them in the end.88.	The socialist countries will pursue their policy consistently in order to achieve arms limitation and disarmament. Efforts to resolve this vital question for humanity must not fail because of the drive for hegemony and profit. We share with the nonaligned countries an insistence on practical steps to check the arms race. We reject any policy aimed at enlarging the existing military blocs or creating new ones. We are confident of the growing strength of the public movement for peace and disarmament  as exemplified by the World Conference of the United Nations Decade for Women at Copenhagen   the World Parliament of the Peoples for Peace  held last September at Sofia  and the Conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union which has just come to an end in the capital of our country .89.	Even though disarmament is not a human ideal for all of those in whom government authority is vested  the awareness of the unbearable and incalculable consequences of escalating armaments ought to promote readiness to lower the level of armaments  with due regard for the principle of equal security. Concrete steps against the arms race are an attainable objective in international politics. The agreements reached so far  no matter how limited they may be  are practical evidence thereof. Therefore  the General Assembly at its thirty-fifth session should take decisions calling for the speedy conduct of negotiations directed towards tangible results. Here  one cannot calculate in terms of years; here  quick action is imperative.90.	Arms limitation and disarmament in the nuclear field are clearly of priority importance. We again call attention to the proposal of the socialist States forthwith to enter into consultations and negotiations on the prohibition of the manufacture of nuclear weapons and the reduction of their stockpiles. The conclusion of a treaty on the cessation of all nuclear weapon tests must no longer be delayed. We support the proposal made by the USSR on 23 September that the nuclear weapon States announce a one year moratorium on nuclear explosions.91.	Given a constructive approach  it ought to be possible to draw up an international convention on the strengthening of guarantees of the security of non-nuclear weapon States. Those States  which include the German Democratic Republic  have a right to such security. We plead for the elimination of all other weapons of mass destruction. Of no small importance would be an agreement on the prohibition of radiological weapons. In our view  the project  which is well advanced  could rapidly be finalized.92.	At this session the General Assembly will have to adopt the programme for the Second Disarmament Decade. The climax of the Decade could be a world disarmament conference.93.	The 1970s are justly called the decade of political detente. Let us take that high appraisal as conferring a mandate for the 1980s. May they become the decade of arms limitation and disarmament.94.	The most urgent measures for reducing the danger of war have been proposed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the USSR  Mr. A. A. Gromyko  from this rostrum. Their implementation would be the reliable guarantee of stable international detente and fruitful international cooperation. Only someone who has other interests can refuse that.95.	If peaceful coexistence is to be consolidated it is necessary to eliminate international conflicts. Consequently  the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty called  at their recent meeting  for the settlement of all controversial issues peacefully  that is  politically.96.	Gunboat diplomacy  so-called punitive actions or threats with mobile strike forces are outside the law  justice and morality; they are a relapse into an era when the right of the stronger was the only thing that counted.97.	The history of international relations and the genesis of the United Nations  as well as current international developments  confirm that the use of force to suppress the sovereign rights of States and peoples has been and remains a major source of international tensions and conflicts. The German Democratic Republic therefore urges that the principles of the Charter of the United Nations that States shall not resort to force be strengthened and that a world treaty on the non-use of force in international relations be concluded without delay.98.	There has been no progress towards establishing lasting peace in the Middle East. On the contrary  with increasing armed attacks on southern Lebanon and its decision to annex all of Jerusalem  Israel has drastically and dangerously aggravated the situation. The Camp David agreements6 permit all this  and everything proves  once again  that lasting peace requires a comprehensive settlement and the participation of all sides  including specifically the PLO.99.	The core of the Middle East conflict remains the attainment and exercise by the Palestinian people of the right to self-determination  including its right to establish its own sovereign State. This was confirmed by the seventh emergency special session of the General Assembly  devoted to Palestine. The United Nations has outlined a comprehensive settlement of the conflict on the basis of its Charter. Hence  there is no need for a new concept  particularly if it falls far short of what is necessary.100.	Developments in the Middle East region call yet greater attention to the global problems of securing peace  because that hotbed of tension has expanded territorially. The military intentions of the United States of America leave no doubt about its design virtually to encircle the Middle and Near East in a pincer like operation  with the support of those in other reactionary and hegemonistic quarters.101.	It is for this purpose that the system of military bases is being enlarged. The peoples will resist that because their sovereignty and independence and their right of control over their own natural resources are becoming endangered. Also  the conflict between the United States and Iran is  in the final analysis  the result of an attempt to reverse the Iranian revolution and to make that country again a tool of the United States. Here  too  a solution can only come about through negotiation and respect for the Iranian people's right to self-determination.102.	The German Democratic Republic reiterates its position that the question of Cyprus should be resolved in accordance with the Charter and the relevant decisions of the United Nations in the interests of the people of Cyprus and of international security.103.	Another region where a long simmering conflict imperils world peace is southern Africa. The people of Zimbabwe  which we congratulate from this high rostrum in a spirit of longstanding active solidarity  has won independence and is strengthening its position. Its victory has given new courage to the fighters in Namibia and South Africa. They can be sure of support from the people of the German Democratic Republic. The United Nations has recognized SWAPO as the legitimate representative of the people of Namibia. This decision must remain undisputed. There must be no Namibia which is a protectorate of the South African racist regime.104.	The Namibia issue cannot be isolated from developments in South Africa. As long as it is in power  the racist regime threatens its neighbours and terrorizes the people of South Africa. Therefore we demand stringent sanctions against that regime. Above all  the nuclear collaboration of some States with the representatives of the policy of apartheid must be ended.105.	History teaches that whenever people exercise their right to self-determination  destroy the old exploitative order and strive for national and social independence  that is  for social progress  they encounter the fierce resistance of reactionary quarters. This is also the case in Afghanistan. But the Afghan people has good and faithful friends. Its Government is working successfully for a peaceful life in the country and is defending the gains of democratic revolution. It is offering its neighbours friendly relations and the region its contribution to peaceful coexistence and stable security. When outside interference ceases and its termination is guaranteed  the Governments of Afghanistan and the USSR have declared  the Soviet troops are to be withdrawn. This announcement has already been confirmed by practical steps. Only in this way will it be possible to find a political settlement of the situation that has emerged around Afghanistan. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan has made proposals to that effect  which we support wholeheartedly.106.	The German Democratic Republic disapproves of attempts to misuse the United Nations for interference in Afghanistan. Similarly  it opposes all designs to obstruct the great efforts of the people of Kampuchea to overcome the aftermath of the criminal Pol Pot regime  and it insists that the legitimate Government of that country should occupy its rightful seat in this Organization. The German Democratic Republic supports the initiatives of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  the Lao People's Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of Kampuchea for a solution of the problems in Southeast Asia. Their realization would be a step towards security in the region. We second the proposal to consider the question of peace  stability and cooperation in Southeast Asia as a separate agenda item at this General Assembly session. Likewise  we support the proposals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the solution of the Korean question  including the withdrawal of the United States forces from South Korea.107.	We speak up resolutely against the expansion of military presence and activities in the Indian Ocean  and we support the initiatives suggesting the conversion of the Indian Ocean area into a zone of peace.108.	If it is to endure  peaceful coexistence needs a climate of mutual understanding and the cultivation and dissemination of the great humanist ideals of international understanding and peace. The United Nations has outlawed instigation to war and to national and racial hatred and all other forms of poisoning of the human mind and perversion of human thought. Yet those things have not been uprooted. On the contrary  manifestations of Fascist and neo-Fascist ideologies are increasing and partly growing into organized terrorism. For this reason  the German Democratic Republic believes that concrete action should be taken to check that danger to peace and human rights. In this case  too  there applies the dearly learnt historical lesson that if an evil is to be avoided it has to be nipped in the bud.109.	Worldwide implementation of the principles of peaceful coexistence encompasses the democratic restructuring of international economic relations. The 1960s and 1970s have distinctly confirmed that international political crises tend to develop and become aggravated where and when States are denied their rights to conduct their economic relations on a basis of equality and to exercise full sovereignty over their natural resources.110.	Extortion and the threat of force to secure raw material supplies constitute gross violations of international legal norms. They are sources of dangerous political tensions fraught with the risk of large scale military conflicts. The same goes for all attempts to abuse economic relations for political blackmail against socialist States. The time is ripe for eradicating discrimination and restrictions  ending exploitative relations  containing the disastrous influence of transnational corporations and thus laying the foundations for a democratic international economic order. That conforms to the legitimate interests and claims of the majority of States; that is what international peace and security require. The eleventh special session that has just ended has provided graphic evidence of this.111.	This General Assembly session has before it a heavy work schedule indeed. Yet  regardless of how different the issues are  their consideration must ultimately help strengthen peace and peaceful coexistence. All forces of peace and democracy are called upon to cooperate in solving this difficult task. The problems of today's world demand a clear commitment to peace and detente and  above all  action by each individual State and the United Nations as a whole."
"38",1841,"DEU",35,1980,"ï»¿Mr. President  first of all I should like to congratulate you most sincerely on your election to the highest office in the United Nations and to commend you on your impressive inaugural address. Your election is for us a token of recognition of six years' constructive work as the Permanent Representative of the Federal Republic of Germany to the United Nations. We also feel that it can be seen as a recognition of the active participation of the Federal Republic of Germany in the world Organization. This participation is of great value to our policy  which is directed towards peace.79.	I should like to express our thanks to your predecessor  Ambassador Salim  one of the great representatives of the African continent.80.	I am also very pleased to be able to welcome Saint Vincent and the Grenadines as a new Member State of the world Organization.81.	This first regular session of the General Assembly in the 1980s is dominated by anxious questions about the future of our world. We commemorate the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of resolution 1514 (XV) which contains the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. But the recollection of that Declaration also calls to mind the contrast between then and now. In 1960  newly independent African States became Members of the United Nations. At the same time  the economic development of the third world emerged as a task for the community of nations as a whole. By proclaiming the First United Nations Development Decade  the United Nations launched a great effort to cope with that task as well.82.	At the beginning of the 1960s mankind was resolutely setting out for new horizons  and the rate of progress did indeed increase. The process of decolonization has almost been completed. The number of Members of the United Nations has increased from 100 in 1960 to 154 this year. A number of developing countries became new industrial countries or threshold countries. The per capita income of the third world rose at an annual rate of 3 per cent. And though this average rate may conceal the disparities between individual developing countries  it was an unprecedented growth which only few had thought attainable at the beginning of the 1960s.83.	In 1966 the General Assembly adopted the two International Covenants on Human Rights  and  by specifically defining those rights  imbued them with a force which  despite all resistance  has begun to leave its impression on the lives of nations all over the globe.84.	And  finally  as the 1960s drew to a close  the climate of cold war between East and West gave way to a newly emerging detente. To many it seemed that the time had already come for the States of the world acting as equal partners to concentrate on the great task of our age: the development of the third world.85.	But now  on the threshold of the 1980s  it has become increasingly clear that the path towards this goal is paved with obstacles: the designs of power politics are threatening detente; there is the threat of a new arms race; unresolved conflicts weigh heavily on the third world and the quest for power creates new sources of crisis; and in the mid-1970s the world economy experienced its first grave setback since the war. Oil price explosions are having devastating effects on the industrialized countries and are plunging many oil importing third world countries into a development crisis.86.	Is this the end of the endeavours for a world community of equal States initiated in 1945  with the foundation of the United Nations  and reaffirmed so impressively in 1960? Has the third world struggled for its independence  only to lose it in the face of new challenges? Is economic advancement in parts of the third world grinding to a halt? Will poverty be with us for ever?87.	In view of these challenges it remains our historic task to establish a world of equal partners based on the right of nations to self-determination and on respect for the inalienable rights of the individual.88.	The fundamental task is to secureâthrough an active policy for safeguarding peaceâthe political conditions for mankind's resumption of steady progress.89.	What is required in the first place is to continue undiminished efforts to reduce tensions and foster cooperation between East and West. This policy  on a basis of equality  is of vital importance not only for peace between East and West but also for peace and peaceful economic development in the world as a whole. A policy for safeguarding peace is inconceivable without a general determination for detente and cooperation. Such determination cannot do away with the fundamental conflict inherent in contrasting values and political systems. But it can help to prevent avoidable conflicts and to keep unavoidable conflicts under control by means of diplomacy. It can also build bridges to span the gulf and promote cooperation for mutual benefit. Seen in this way  detente and cooperation constitute a realistic and long-term policy for peace.90.	My country  firmly embedded in the European Community and the North Atlantic defence alliance  has from the outset been among the chief protagonists of detente in Europe. Acting on the basis of shared convictions of freedom and human dignity  these two communities have long been champions of freedom  stability  security and peace in the world. We firmly abide by the policy of detente and cooperationâaware that we share responsibility for peace and that the Germans who have to live in two separate States would be especially affected by a relapse into the cold war.91.	The basic tenet of our policy continues to be to work for a state of peace in Europe in which the German nation will recover its unity in free self-determination. We know that history is on our side.92.	The Treaty on the Basis of Relations between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic"" has established the conditions for cooperation which take account of the responsibility of Germans for peace and pave the way for improvements in the humanitarian sphere for all Germans. We are guided by the goals of this Treaty in our efforts to develop further  wherever possible  our cooperation with the German Democratic Republic.93.	Federal Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and the Chairman of the State Council of the German Democratic Republic  Erich Honecker  have both expressed the view that never again should war originate on German soil.94.	We want to play our part in keeping the situation in and around Berlin stable and peaceful. Berlin is the barometer of detente in Europe.95.	Ten years ago the Treaty between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet Union laid the foundation for the development of fruitful mutual relations. Chancellor Schmidt and I went to Moscow on 30 June and 1 July 1980; that visit was an expression of our will to maintain direct contacts in difficult times and to do everything to keep the way clear for a policy which we regard as long term. We consider the signal given by our visit  after months of stagnation  for the commencement of talks on medium range weapons to be an incentive to continue our efforts.96.	We shall also maintain our efforts to develop cooperation with the Polish People's Republic and the other Eastern European countries.97.	Furthermore  we attach great importance to the multilateral process of detente in Europe. At the Second review session of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe  soon to be held at Madrid  we shall discuss the implementation of all parts of the Final Act of Helsinki in all its parts  in a sincere and realistic manner  but we shall also talk about what remains to be done. We want to achieve even progress in all fields. The Conference should be neither a tribunal nor a forum for empty rhetoric.98.	In the economic field we advocate an East West conference on energy  and in the field of human relations we urge the solution of humanitarian problems  the fostering of contacts .between people in the East and West and a wider exchange of information.99.	Considering the importance which the Madrid Conference holds for the future  we hope that all participating States will  by their policies  make it possible to achieve progress.100.	Disarmament is the great task of the 1980s. We must not be discouraged  despite all the disappointments and setbacks. We know that detente and cooperation between East and West can be lasting only if they are founded on military equilibrium. Seeking a position of superiority only serves to create instability and  hence  insecurity. Disarmament cannot  therefore  mean the preservation of superiority  but rather must mean a stronger commitment to disarm on the part of those in a position of superiority. In the field of armament and disarmament  all States must be judged solely by what they actually do. My country and its allies are striving to achieve equilibrium at the lowest possible level of armaments.101.	The defence efforts of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] are determined exclusively by its own security requirements. The Federal Republic of Germany is not seeking superiority  nor are the other European members of the Western defence alliance  the United States of America or Canada.102.	We are disturbed by the superiority in conventional weapons of the Warsaw Pact countries in central Europe  and we are particularly concerned about the rapid build-up of the Soviet Union's new SS20 medium range nuclear missiles  which are not trained solely on Western Europe. That arms build-up goes beyond the Soviet Union's own security needs. That is a fact which nobody can deny.103.	Since it is our serious intention to achieve equilibrium at the lowest possible level of armaments  the Western defence alliance put before the Warsaw Pact countries  in December 1979  a comprehensive package of arms control and disarmament proposals.104.	The Western defence alliance also linked its decision to modernize its nuclear systems to the offer of negotiations on limiting the medium range land based missiles of the two sides. It is now a question of getting those negotiations under way as quickly as possible.105.	I am glad that the United States Secretary of State and the Soviet Minister for Foreign Affairs will be discussing here in New York tomorrow the commencement of the preparatory talks on this subject. I am also glad that the President of the United States has stated his intention to seek ratification of the SALT II agreement at the earliest possible date.106.	The second review session of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe  to be held at Madrid  should decide on the establishment of a European conference on disarmament with the clear mandate to agree on confidence-building measures for the whole of Europe  from the Atlantic Ocean to the Urals. Confidence is indivisible  also  in geographic terms. The achievement of concrete results at the Vienna Talks on Mutual Reduction of Forces  Armaments and Associated Measures in central Europe can also help to stabilize the situation in all of Europe.107.	Verifiable arms limitation and disarmament are among the primary objectives of German foreign policy. We pursue that objective in Europe and we pursue it worldwide.108.	Success in arms control negotiations is dependent upon openness and sufficient information about military capabilities in the world. For that reason  we should like to see all nations disclose their military expenditures. In that connexion  the United Nations has worked out a matrix designed to make military budgets comparable. The Federal Republic of Germany  other Western States and third world countries have reported on their military expenditures on the basis of that matrix and given an example of its practical application.109.	It is now necessary to encourage all countries to disclose their military expenditures according to that system.110.	Just as in Europe  so also on a global scale confidence-building measures are necessary. In response to a suggestion for which we were responsible  the General Assembly last year appointed a working group to study the possibility of confidence-building measures in various regions and throughout the world. 111.	One crucial task of our active policy for safeguarding peace is to frustrate all hegemonic aspirations. This must apply worldwide. Hegemonic policies and resultant military intervention destroy the right of nations to self-determination. The East West confrontation must not be transferred to the third world.112.	In an interdependent world  one of the foundations of which is respect for the right to self-determination  interventionism is not a matter which concerns only those who intervene and their victims; it is a challenge to the entire community of nations. This is also the essence of the principle of the indivisibility of detente.113.	The signatory States to the Helsinki Final Act expressly declared their intention not only to base their relations with one another on the principles embodied in the Final Act  which include the renunciation of force and respect for equality of rights and for the right of nations to self-determination  but also to conduct their relations with other States in the spirit of those principles.114.	Accordingly  the Federal Republic of Germany and France  in their joint declaration of 5 February 1980  described as unacceptable the Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan and stated clearly that detente would not be able to withstand another blow of that kind.115.	The nonaligned movement is becoming an increasingly important force in international politics. The more all its members associate themselves with the aim of true non-alignment  the greater will be their contribution to stability in the world.116.	The conflicts in the third world must also be resolved through negotiations.117.	The agenda for this session of the General Assembly includes four major crisis areas: the Middle East  southern Africa  Afghanistan and Cambodia. To these must be added the Iraqi Iranian conflict  a source of great concern.118.	In the Middle East  new obstacles have been piled up on the road to a comprehensive peace settlement. The positions of the parties concerned have hardened and tension has again built up to a dangerous level.119.	The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Luxembourg  Mr. Thorn  who is currently presiding over the European Community  has explained the position of the nine member States on all aspects of the Middle East conflict. Together with our European partners  we shall do everything in our power to bring about a comprehensive  just and lasting peace in the Middle East. The Palestinian people must be enabled to exercise fully its right to self-determination. That right must be implemented  just as much as the right to existence and security of all States in the region  including Israel.120.	We are convinced that the Middle East problem can only be solved if all the parties concerned forgo exclusive territorial demands. There must be no ""all or nothing"" attitude. On none of the issues should one side confront the other with a fait accompli. That applies to settlements in the occupied territories  and it applies especially to Jerusalem  of whose importance for the three major religions we are particularly aware.121.	A necessary step on the road to comprehensive peace is the renunciation of force or the threat of use of force by all the parties concerned. This is the only way to create in the area the climate of confidence that is indispensable to a settlement.122.	Our intention to give a new impetus to the Euro Arab dialogue by adding a political dimension to it  and the continuing willingness of the Europeans to participate in international guarantees  indicate our determination to take our share of the responsibility for peace.123.	The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany views with grave concern the armed confrontation which has flared up in the past few days between Iraq and Iran. We appeal to those involved not to add yet another conflict to those already existing in the Middle East  but rather to settle matters at the negotiating table. And we appeal to all States to exercise the greatest restraint so as to prevent the conflict from spreading. The United Nations must shoulder its responsibility for peace.124.	In Africa  the year 1980 has brought crucial progress towards eliminating the remnants of colonialism.125.	The people of Zimbabwe have exercised their right to self-determination through free elections under international supervision  and have obtained their independence. This shows that negotiated solutions to even the most difficult subjects are possible.126.	In Namibia a solution will only be possible  in our view  if based on the United Nations plan for Namibia. Attempts to achieve an internal settlement would have no chance of bringing peace and freedom to the country; Zimbabwe has confirmed that. Security Council resolution 435 (1978) must now be implemented without delay.127.	At the sixth emergency special session of the General Assembly  held from 10 to 14 January this year  the international community condemned by an overwhelming majority the armed intervention in Afghanistan and called for the immediate  unconditional and total withdrawal of the foreign troops. It urged that the people of Afghanistan be enabled to determine their own form of government and choose their economic  political and social systems free from outside intervention  subversion  coercion or constraint of any kind whatsoever. This resolution must now finally be implemented.128.	We welcome the endeavours of the Islamic and other third world States to find a political solution to the Afghanistan problem.129.	It is also necessary to find a political solution to the crisis in Cambodia. Here  too  the United Nations has categorically called for the immediate withdrawal of all foreign troops. Here  too  it has demanded that the people of Cambodia be enabled to choose their own government by the democratic processâwithout outside intervention  subversion or coercion.130.	The conflict must not now be carried even beyond Cambodia's borders. The people of my country are shocked by the terrible fate of the Cambodian people. My Government and the private relief organizations in my country will continue to render humanitarian assistance as best they can. I appeal to all responsible: open up all channels necessary to allow assistance to reach the starving people in all parts of Cambodia.131.	We must tackle the problem of the world's refugees at its roots. It constitutes a growing challenge to our conscience  an increasing disregard for basic human rights and a growing threat to good neighbourly relations between States and to the international order as a whole.132.	Today  all over the world  people are fleeing their home countries and seeking refuge in camps. Their number is estimated at about 15 million. Anyone who has visited a refugee camp is aware of the abject misery suffered by these millions.133.	I refer to the mass exodus from Indochina  Afghanistan and Ethiopia  which has greatly aggravated the refugee problem. In Somalia 30 per cent of the population are refugees  according to government estimates. The development of that country threatens to collapse under this tremendous burden. In the border region between Thailand and Cambodia  refugee problems have led to an acute clanger of war. These examples indicate that the refugee problem has become a threat to peace in many parts of the third world and a threat to the political stability and economic development of the countries receiving the refugees.134.	So far the United Nations has concentrated on the humanitarian task of mitigating the consequences of flight and expulsion. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has rendered an outstanding service in this field.135.	We must increase further the humanitarian assistance for refugees and make it more effective. But we must also face up to the political task of counteracting the causes of their flight and expulsion. We must work together to avert new refugee flows. We must elaborate rules governing the conduct of States. We must prevent racially and ideologically undesired minorities from being forcibly expelled by their Governments or compelled to flee as a result of unbearable living conditions. This  too  is part today of a comprehensive and active policy for safeguarding peace. I therefore suggest that this session of the General Assembly include in its agenda a new and urgent item entitled ""International cooperation to avert new refugee flows"".136.	Without development of the third world there can be no lasting and secure peace. Nor is peace in the world possible if the gap between the rich and the poor countries grows larger  if hunger and want in the developing countries spread further. What we need is accelerated economic development in the third world and the recovery of sustained growth in the industrial countries. Cooperation in the development effort is an indispensable part of a world order based on partnership.137.	The eleventh special session of the General Assembly that has just ended and at which I presented my Government's views unfortunately met only some of our expectations. Admittedly  agreement was reached on the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade. It was also agreed that the aid extended to the least developed countries must be stepped up considerably. This consensus is a good starting point for the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries to be held in 1981.138.	The special session was not  however  able to complete the preparations for the global negotiations. It is precisely in view of the difficult world economic situation that my Government considers such negotiations important and urgently necessary. At the present session  therefore  a consensus must be attained on the procedure and the agenda for the negotiations so that they can start in January 1981 as planned. The Brandt Commission has presented an important document on North South issues.' We advocate a North South summit meeting  as recommended by the Brandt Commission. Such a meeting can give important impetus to the negotiations in the United Nations.139.	Resolution 34/138 establishing the global negotiations relating to international economic cooperation for development  specified five main subjects: commodities  energy  trade  development  money and finance. In all of these fields we must recognize the common interests of industrialized and developing countries. We shall establish a new international economic order not by destroying the existing one but by developing it further. We must preserve free world trade as the driving force behind growth and development. We must solve the world's energy problems and thus safeguard the basis of economic growth and development. We must ensure a stable world monetary system and safeguard the effectiveness of the competent institutions. We must step up the flow of resources to the third world so as to accelerate development and thereby provide important stimuli for growth in the industrial countries and create new jobs there.140.	Despite its adverse budgetary situation  the Federal Republic of Germany has  between 1977 and 1979âthat is  within two yearsâdoubled its official development assistance from 3.2 to 6.1 billion deutsche marks. In absolute terms  my country is therefore  together with France  the second largest donor country. Furthermore  its official development assistance amounts to 0.44 per cent of its gross national product and thus exceeds the average of the industrial countries.141.	An indispensable part of the global negotiations is a comprehensive dialogue on energy between oil importing and oil exporting countries. The energy issue has now become so crucial and has such far-reaching effects on all other economic sectors that the aim of global negotiations would not be achievable without an energy dialogue.142.	Successful cooperation for development in the new decade will also depend  to a decisive extent  on whether all countries participate to the best of their ability. Support for the development of the third world cannot be seen as the responsibility of the Western industrial countries alone. It is the responsibility of the entire international community  and everyone must shoulder his portion.143.	Here 1 appeal particularly to the Communist industrial countries. In recent years their assistance has amounted to only about 0.1 per cent of their gross national product. Almost three quarters of that aid went to just two developing countries.144.	The world's total arms expenditure will exceed $500 billion this year. Military spending is increasing everywhereâ in the East and the West and not least in the third world. The success of development depends more and more also on whether it proves possible to halt the global arms race. What the world needs is not an arms race  but a race in the provision of aid for the developing countries.145.	I consider it necessary to set up two registers in the United Nations. The first should record how much every industrial country spends per capita on armaments and how much on development assistance. The second register should cover worldwide exports and imports of weapons.146.	We must not look on passively while arms expenditure is growing and while expenditure on development aid is lagging behind or even stagnating. We must not remain idle when weapons are poured into developing countries which need not guns but schools and hospitals  tractors and lathes.147.	A world of partnership and an active peace policy call for worldwide respect for human rights. We know how far we still are from this great goal. We have witnessed  especially in recent years  a number of massive violations of human rights. The United Nations has introduced procedures and institutions with a view to promoting the effective implementation of human rights throughout the world. These procedures are still comparatively weak  although their effectiveness is increasing as evidenced by the work of the Human Rights Commission.148.	It is now necessary to strengthen and develop the instruments of the United Nations for the protection of human rights. These instruments must include a United Nations court of justice for human rights.149.	Nobody can overlook the appalling abuse in the imposition of the death penalty in many parts of the world. In his annual report  Secretary General Kurt Waldheim condemned the summary execution of individuals without regard for due process of law.150.	Article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights limits the death penalty. Today  14 years after the signing of the Covenant  it is time to seek the abolition of that penalty. My Government will therefore propose a convention to eliminate capital punishment. This convention could be given the form of a second optional protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.151.	It is stated in the Constitution of my country that ""Capital punishment shall be abolished"". This important decision is the result of painful experiences in our recent past. We know that different historical developments  legal traditions and religious beliefs have prompted different attitudes towards the death penalty in other countries. But this should not make anyone less conscious of the frequent abuses in the imposition of capital punishment. Such abuses can only be eliminated by the total abolition of the death penalty.152.	Our world is in a state of transition. It is moving towards a new order  the first truly global order in history to be founded on the concept of equality and partnership. The outlines of this new order are already discernible  even though reactionary trends are blurring the picture. I should like to emphasize two basic principles of the new order: the self-determination of all nations and the regional integration of equal States to form larger communities.153.	Self-determination means the full development of each country's own potential and independent political  economic and cultural development. This aim must be realized today especially in the third world. There would be no genuine and sustained development in Africa  the Arab States  Latin America and Asia if these vast cultural regions merely tried to copy Western or Eastern industrialized countries. Development must build on a country's own culture and  with due respect for inalienable human rights  must use modern science and technology to enhance these cultural values.154.	Anyone who opposes such independent development and seeks to impose alien  prefabricated concepts upon the third world acts against the interests of the developing countries and the world as a whole. The national  religious and cultural identity of nations must remain intact. Mankind needs a variety of cultures to prevent its creative forces from dwindling. To reject a pluralistic world and to force humanity under the yoke of a single ideology would be tantamount to halting progress.155.	Regional integration is becoming increasingly important as a means of creating political and economic areas in all parts of the world which will ward off hegemonic designs by foreign Powers and permit the development of modern economies. The European Community provides a model of a regional grouping of States on a basis of equality  a union in which no one dominates. We consider the emergence of regional communities of States in all parts of the world  including Africa  Asia and Latin America one of the most important international developments.156.	The European Community promotes this development wherever it can. It has already instituted special forms of cooperation with most of these groupings which provide forward-looking models for cooperation between industrialized and developing countries in a spirit of partnership.157.	The increasing regional cooperation in the third world  the large groupings of the nonaligned countries and the Group of 77 is also developments of great consequence for our work in the United Nations. Without these groupings the political opinion forming process and agreement on solutions in the United Nations would today be almost unthinkable.158.	It is clear that regional and interregional cooperation supplement and facilitate global cooperation  but do not replace it.159.	The universal Organization of the United Nations will be more than ever the centre of a new world order based on equality and partnership. It is our task to strengthen it  to make it more effective and  above all  to make use of it for the good of the whole world and not merely to safeguard individual interests. This is a task which my country will help to accomplish to the best of its ability."
"39",1879,"DJI",35,1980,"ï»¿Mr. President  I should like to fulfil a very pleasant duty  that of extending to you the warm congratulations of my delegation on your unanimous election as President of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. Your election to this important post is a tribute to your country  with which my country maintains very close co-operation. Your election is also proof of your outstanding qualities as a skilled and seasoned diplomat and demonstrates the deep trust your colleagues have in your ability to guide the deliberations of this Assembly and lead them to a successful conclusion. I assure you that my delegation will always be prepared to give you its full support and co-operation.2. I should like to take this opportunity to pay a tribute  on behalf of my delegation  to your predecessor  Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim  the Permanent Representative of the United Republic of Tanzania  who presided over the last session of the Assembly in an outstanding and exemplary manner. Ambassador Salim  with his unremitting efforts  personal talent and exceptional skill  guided the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly to a very positive conclusion.3. I should also like to voice my delegation's esteem for the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  who has shown clear-sightedness and understanding in his constant and tireless search for a constructive and peaceful solution to world problems. We admire the efforts of the Secretary- General to promote peace and understanding among nations; we encourage him and his staff to intensify their activities to speed up the process leading to the establishment of more equitable relations among nations at political  diplomatic  economic  social and humanitarian levels.4.	I am delighted to see the Republic of Zimbabwe take its rightful place as a full Member of the United Nations. The well-deserved admission of Zimbabwe to the Organization has been a joyous occasion for us all. It has marked the triumph of nations in liberating that people from oppression and domination and has strengthened the faith of that whole people in the struggle for its legitimate rights. This long and heroic struggle of the people of Zimbabwe for its independence won the profound respect  solidarity and support of progressive and peace-loving forces in the international community and thus led to a decisive defeat of the dominating minority and to the ignominious collapse of the racist regime in Zimbabwe  as well as to the total emancipation of its people. My delegation is very pleased at the striking victory of Zimbabwe and in that connection I should like to convey to it our sincere and fraternal congratulations on its accession to freedom and independence.5.	Zimbabwe's triumphant victory has once again demonstrated that no one  however strong  can ever oppress a people and flout its sacred rights for ever  and that the last word always rests with the liberation fighters. Let no one have the slightest doubt that the day is not far when we are all going to celebrate a similar occasion for Azania  Namibia and Palestine.6.	I should also like to warmly welcome the admission of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to this Assembly. Since we are ourselves a newly independent country  we feel great sympathy towards that newly independent State and I should like to assure it of our full and complete cooperation.7.	The problem of the Middle East remains just as serious and disturbing. The arrogance of the State of Israel enables us to see its real colonialist and expansionist face. The hasty and arbitrary decision taken by the Israeli Knesset to annex the Holy City of Jerusalem and to regard it as the perpetual and unified capital of the Zionist entity profoundly shocks and wounds the feelings of more than 2 billion believers.8.	Furthermore  the State of Israel once more refuses to implement Security Council resolution 478 (1980)  according to which all Israeli legislative and administrative measures  as well as all actions which purport to alter the character and status of Al Quds Al Sharif  are null and void  and which calls for the immediate annulment of such measures.9.	All the Islamic countries that took part in the special session of the Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministersâon the question of the Holy City of Jerusalemâheld from 18 to 20 September last at Fez  in the Kingdom of Morocco  undertook to meet this challenge. In that connection  I should particularly like to welcome the efforts made by the Chairman of the Al Quds Committee  His Majesty King Hassan II  to ensure the success of the proceedings at Fez.10.	Ai Fez the Islamic countries undertook to commit their entire political  financial  petroleum and indeed military potential in order to thwart that arbitrary and shameful decision. On this occasion we should like to thank those States that have moved their diplomatic representations out of Jerusalem.11.	The Republic of Djibouti reiterates its support for the heroic struggle being waged by their brothers  the people of Palestine  for the total liberation of their occupied territory  including the Holy City of Jerusalem  and for the recovery of their inalienable rights to self-determination and to the establishment of a Palestinian State on their territory.12.	We warn the international community that no peace can be achieved without the participation of the Palestinian' people and its sole representative  the Palestine Liberation Organization.13.	Lebanon  that peaceful State that is constantly under attack by the Zionist entity  is suffering; the Lebanese people are constantly attacked and threatened by Israel. How long are we going to allow Israel to defy the most elementary laws? The international community must find solutions to make Israel stop attacking Lebanon which only wishes to live in peace. We should like the voice of wisdom  of moderation and of realism to replace that of arrogance  of challenge and of historical unawareness.14.	The situation in South Africa is critical. The racist regime of Pretoria defies all the norms of international law by ignoring and denying the great majority of the people of South Africa all their basic human and political rights. The forced displacement of these peoples to bantustans  which deprives them of their means of existence and right to citizenship  the inhuman acts of violence inflicted on peaceful demonstrators  the murder of detainees in jails  the killing of students who reject the inferior system of education  the torture of political prisoners and the persistent escalation of military activities and of subversion directed against the neighbouring independent African States are all acts which the international community can no longer tolerate.15.	We are convinced that apartheid is a vicious system of international racial discrimination directed against the African majority and should be condemned as a crime against mankind. The national liberation struggle of the people of South Africa requires all progressive and peace-loving forces to lend massive financial and material support so as to enable that people to secure its right to self-determination. We deplore the fact that all attempts to punish the racist regime of Pretoria for its crimes have failed  because certain Governments have chosen to give priority to their own selfish interests rather than to act in accordance with the Security Council resolutions on economic sanctions. We appeal to all Governments and States to refrain from any overt or covert collaboration or co-operation with the Pretoria regime.16.	The international community must take all possible steps to make South Africa abide by the decisions of the United Nations so that its illegal occupation of Namibia may be brought to an end.17.	South Africa's policy on Namibia has been unanimously condemned by the international community. The General Assembly has expressed its full support for the struggle of the Namibian people under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO]  its authentic representative. Any negotiated settlement of the Namibian question can be successful only with the participation of SWAPO and within the context of United Nations resolutions  so that total decolonization can be brought about which will lead to real independence for Namibia.18.	In connection with the Afghanistan crisis  my Government has frequently denounced the foreign armed intervention  the dangerous escalation of tension that has been imposed upon an Islamic nation  and the violation of the Charter of the United Nations. We demand the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of all foreign forces from Afghanistan so that its people shall be able to choose its own political destiny and exercise its right to have the government of its choice.19.	Regarding the question of Western Sahara  my Government reaffirms its position. But we should like to express our disquiet at the persistent and growing tension that is endangering peace and security in the region of north-west Africa. In this connection we would urgently demand that all parties concerned avoid any action that would lead to a deterioration of the situation.20.	We should like to emphasize the urgent need for a negotiated and peaceful settlement in accordance with the resolutions of the United Nations and of the Organization of African Unity [OAU] so that the Saharaoui people can exercise its right to self-determination  and we support the resolutions of the ""committee of wise men"" of the OAU aimed at resolving the conflict.21.	The thirty-fifth session has started at a time which is crucial for the international community. In the course of the last few weeks the United Nations has been intensely busy trying to find solutions to the present international economic disorder. The preparations for the conference on global negotiations for international economic co-operation for development cannot escape the attention of the present session. Such attention is more than justified because  as can be seen  the economic problems of more than 75 per cent of mankind have become intolerable. Human privation in all aspects of life has increased tremendously  like a hydra ravaging the resources of the third world and leaving it nothing but abject poverty  illiteracy  malnutrition  hunger and sickness  which have become the daily lot of more than 2 billion people. To these difficulties has been added the scourge of a considerable influx of refugees  which has affected many parts of Africa  Asia and Latin America. These are the economic and social problemsâthe unsolved questions of decolonization  human rights  racism  racial discrimination  apartheid and disarmamentâfor which many of those of us who come to the United Nations believe this Organization can and in fact should provide the best forum in which a new approach to international relations  in all sectors of human activity  will be sought in a climate of tolerance and mutual understanding and a desire to achieve the aims and objectives of the Charter of the United Nations.22.	May I recall the second preambular paragraph of that Charter  which reads:""to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights  in the dignity and worth of the human person  in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small"".All of the articles of the Charter agree on this point: the preservation of the dignity and worth of the human individual.23.	Speaking of human rights  if we heed the cries of the millions who are impoverished  sick  weak  undernourished  illiterate  underemployed and unemployedâthe ""have- nots"" of the developing countriesâhowever human society defines ""human rights""  we cannot ignore a simple truth: that the prime human right is satisfaction of man's fundamental needs  rights of more than 75 per cent of the human population now crushed under the burden of the most abject poverty and flagrant economic inequality.24.	Africa  which contains 20 of the 31 least developed countries of the world and a considerable number of newly independent countries  has suffered most from the present international economic disorder. No concrete development  worthy of mention in the strategies adopted during the course of the last two development decades  has taken place in Africa. Although they are rich in human and natural resources  most African States have been unable to launch any substantial development programme that would help to improve their economies  because they lack the necessary financial and technical means.25.	The problem of refugees in Africa is becoming an acute one  and it affects practically the entire continent. At present the African refugees number 5 million. The assistance required to meet the elementary needs of those refugees is tremendous  and the international community must find ways of solving this human problem.26.	That is why the African countries have seen fit to restructure the basis of their economy in order to bring about a state of collective autonomy that will hopefully lead to self-sufficiency and autonomous growth. My delegation is very pleased that the Lagos Plan of Action for the Implementation of the Monrovia Strategy for the Economic Development of Africa was unanimously adopted at the second extraordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU  which was held at Lagos in April 1980.'27.	It is our hope that the ""Monrovia Declaration of Commitment by the Heads of State and Government of the OAU on the guidelines and measures for national and collective self-reliance in social and economic development for the establishment of a new international economic orderâ will be supported by the international community and will be considered as Africa's contribution to the establishment of a new international economic order.28.	The young Republic of Djibouti is determined to expedite its economic development according to the principles of self-sufficiency. But  at the same time  the economic means available to it are extremely limited. The revenue of the Republic of Djibouti is at present essentially based on a service economy that is subject to fluctuations in the international market. The port  airport and railway services require considerable improvement. At present Djibouti is suffering from an acute lack of foodstuffs  in addition to excessively high food prices because all foodstuffs have to be imported.29.	My Government is deeply concerned by this situation  and in order to remedy it  it has created development projects the purpose of which is to revitalize the dynamic sectors of the economyâthe port  the airport  the railways and telecommunicationsâand to modernize them. Nevertheless  aware of the tremendous difficulties implicit in our economy's dependence upon such services  my Government has spared no effort to seek ways and means of establishing a framework for a diversified economy by promoting and developing the industrial and agricultural sectors  particularly by constructing small factories  by drawing up schemes for irrigation and developing water resources.30.	The economic situation of the young Republic of Djibouti has been further complicated by an influx of refugees  of whom there are now 45 000âthat is  more than 12 per cent of the total populationâand of whom 60 to 70 per cent are children  and the health  schooling  food and accommodation problems are considerable.31.	This situation has been further complicated by the disastrous effects of the drought that has for two years now prevailed in the Horn of Africa  aggravating the food shortage.32.	The problem of the lack of water is at present the most crucial one  both for human beings and for cattle. The lack of water has devastating effects on the sole resource of the population. In fact  between 20 000 and 25 000 persons have lost all their livestock and are at present grouped in nine camps  and the Government must help them to meet all their needs. Water and food assistance must be provided to more than 100 000 persons who have lost a considerable percentage of their livestockâapproximately 80 per cent.33.	Since this drought is affecting all the countries of east Africa  it is necessary and highly desirable for the countries affected by the drought to organize themselves  with the aid of the United Nations  in order to cope with this calamity and to prevent the occurrence of others.34.	Since we desire and are determined to meet the challenge of our international responsibility and overcome our economic and other difficulties  it is also our intention to draw the attention of the international community to our situation so that it may help us to overcome our economic difficulties.35.	The Republic of Djibouti is very much aware of the moral and material support which has been given by friendly countries since its accession to independence. We should like to express our thanks and our deep gratitude for that assistance.36.	With regard to the field of foreign relations  the Republic of Djibouti  aware of its geographical position and its international responsibilities  is pursuing a policy of non- alignment based on the desire to preserve its national identity  safeguard its sovereignty  territorial integrity and independence and act in a spirit of co-operation with and understanding of all nations. We encourage friendly nations to adhere strictly to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and those of the non-aligned movement in all matters relating to human activities.37.	With regard to the principle of non-interference in the affairs of other States  we should like to appeal to all nations fully to respect the sovereign right of each nation freely to determine  without any outside influence  its own political  social and economic system and its relations with other States and international organizations.38.	We oppose and categorically condemn the colonization and oppression of any people  every act of racial discrimination  Zionism and apartheid. We are particularly concerned about the persistent struggle and rivalry among the major Powers to obtain spheres of influence in various parts of the world  thus endangering the peace and security of the regions  particularly at a time when the international situation has become charged with dangerous tension. We condemn hegemonism in all its forms and urgently demand that all States refrain from practising that policy.39.	The Republic of Djibouti is particularly concerned about the conflict which is persisting in the Horn of Africa. In order to alleviate that human suffering and to restore peace  security  mutual trust and co-operation  the President of the Republic of Djibouti  Mr. Hassan Gouled Aptidon  made an appeal in August this year for a negotiated settlement of the conflict. He said:""The Republic of Djibouti is seriously concerned by the persistence of the armed conflict in the Horn of Africa and the danger of its extension.""Since we have very close relations with all the nations in the area and recognise the legitimate right of their peoples to a lasting peace  the Republic of Djibouti exhorts its Ethiopian and Somali neighbours to declare a truce to make it possible to seek a general and negotiated settlement of their differences.""40.	In his appeal  the President of the Republic of Djibouti made a number of proposals  as follows:""Faithful to its policy of international neutrality  which is at the service of the development of the region  the Government of Djibouti declares that it is ready to assist in the negotiations to achieve such a settlement  which could be complemented by conventions on regional development.""Such conventions could provide for and organize: first  the improvement of routes used by nomads and the provision of water supply points; secondly  freedom of circulation and transit of goods and people in the region; and thirdly  the establishment of common economic infrastructures.""41.	The President of the Republic of Djibouti then exhorted the international community to intensify its peace efforts in the region. He said:""Anxious to meet the wishes of the peoples and win the support of international opinion  the Republic of Djibouti expresses its gratitude to the Secretary-General of the United Nations  the current President and the Secretary-General of the Organization of African Unity and the President of the European Community for their continuing efforts to re-establish peace in this part of the world  which is still suffering from hunger and thirst. We urge the major Powers to support these efforts and to ensure that the Horn of Africa and the Indian Ocean will not become the theatre of their confrontation.""42.	With respect to the Indian Ocean  the Republic of Djibouti  as a littoral State  attaches paramount importance to the aims of the Declaration on the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace in General Assembly resolution 2832 (XXVI). Aware of the importance of that Declaration  particularly for the littoral and the hinterland States  my Government has on frequent occasions expressed its support for that Declaration as well as for the other resolutions of the United Nations designed to maintain the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace.43.	In this connection  we are particularly encouraged by the decision in General Assembly resolution 34/80 B to convene a Conference on the Indian Ocean during 1981 at Colombo.44.	We are convinced that the implementation of that Declaration will contribute to the establishment of peace and security in the region. We sincerely hope that that Conference will give absolute priority to the interests of the littoral and hinterland States in order to preserve peace and security in the area. We also hope that that Conference will pay some attention to the very sensitive and specific needs of each country with regard to measures to bring about peace and security in accordance with the geographical  political and socio-economic situation of each country  with a view to safeguarding and maintaining the peace  prosperity and independence of all the States in the region.45.	The United Nations system  with its far-sightedness and its sense of solidarity and co-operation  provides hope and courage and remains a source of power. The United Nations is the most appropriate forum for the consideration of global problems of a political  economic  social and humanitarian nature in a genuine and comprehensive manner and in an atmosphere of tolerance and awareness of the interests of all.46.	In this spirit  we whole-heartedly support the United Nations in its tireless efforts to discharge its responsibilities and to achieve its noble aims and objectives."
"40",1944,"DNK",35,1980,"ï»¿Allow me first of all  Sir  to offer you my sincere congratulations on your election as President of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. For my country  it is a special pleasure to welcome a distinguished representative of a neighbouring country with which we have the closest and most friendly relations bilaterally and within important regional organizations. I see your election  Mr. President  as an obvious recognition of your eminent personal qualifications and of the important contributions which for more than 30 years the Federal Republic of Germany has made to peace  reconciliation  co-operation and security among nations  especially in the context of East-West relations.120.	Next  I wish to extend a most cordial welcome to Zimbabwe and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines as new Members of the United Nations family. Their presence here today offers proof that the world is  after all  still moving forward.121.	We need such proof  for in other respects the present world situation does not give much cause for optimism. In fact  the international situation at the opening of the thirty- fifth session is marked by a number of sinister problems and perspectives  politically and economically  which it will take our most strenuous and constructive efforts to cope with.122.	The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan represented a breach of fundamental principles. It recreated uncertainties which we had hoped belonged to the past. The continuing and growing tension in the Middle East constitutes a serious danger to peace. The detention of American diplomats in Iran  in flagrant violation of international law  poses serious risks. The situation surrounding the grave and unacceptable invasion of Kampuchea by Vietnamese forces remains unchanged. South Africa's illegal occupation of Namibia and its abhorrent apartheid system continue to make the area one of the powder kegs of the world. Let me add that the reported military clashes between Iraqi and Iranian forces constitute a new element in the fragile world situation. Therefore we are relieved that the Secretary-General has taken steps to arrange for consultations within the framework of the Security Council.123.	The world-wide economic recession has become a critical factor. This is even more true of the growing gap between the rich and the poor nations of the world  the so-called North-South problem  which my Government regards as one of the most serious challenges to the international community in the years ahead. The solution of the North-South problem not only is a prerequisite for a more just world economic order but has a crucial bearing on the basic problem of international security and  in turn  on the safeguarding of world peace. Let me  finally  mention the suppression of democracy in various parts of the world and the mounting problems of refugees  hunger and ill- treatment of human beings.124.	I could mention many more problems giving cause for taking a pessimistic view of the current international situation. Many of these problems can be solved only through concerted efforts by all our countries. Where do we find a body that is more suitable for such endeavours than the United Nations? In times of problems  crises and confrontations  we must use the world Organization more  not less. But  in making use of the unique machinery of the United Nations  we must adhere strictly to the purposes and principles of its Charter. We must  thereforeâand I emphasize thisâfirmly reject all attempts to alter the all-important principle of universality of the United Nations.125.	In the midst of all the difficult old and new problems facing us  the most positive development during the past year has no doubt been the negotiated settlement of the conflict in Zimbabwe. At long last the people of Zimbabwe has been enabled to exercise its right of self-determination and to elect the Government in a democratic way. To Denmark  which has a long-standing tradition of active support for the elimination of colonialism and racial discrimination  this development is indeed most welcome.126.	Against this background  it is all the more regrettable that the negotiated settlement of the conflict in Namibia has not yet been implemented. The responsibility for this lies squarely with South Africa. In spite of its acceptance of the United Nations plan for free elections in Namibia  South Africa has obstructed and defied the decisions of the Security Council and the will of the international community as a whole. South Africa should have learned from the Rhodesian experience that a so-called internal solution excluding the national liberation movement is no solution. South Africa's illegal occupation of Namibia must be brought to an early end.127.	My country remains fully committed to supporting the ongoing efforts to achieve early implementation of the Security Council resolutions on Namibia. The United Nations offers us the instruments for securing  in a peaceful manner  the freedom and independence of the Namibian people. Denmark  for its part  is prepared to assist  on the practical level also  in the implementation of any agreement worked out within the framework of the United Nations.128.	As far as South Africa itself is concerned  we must reiterate our strong condemnation of the apartheid system. In spite of all the warnings from the international community and many internal groups and parties outside the National Party  the Government of South Africa refuses to accept a society with equal rights for all. Even the very limited reforms which the Prime Minister of South Africa promised have not been implemented. We can only draw one conclusion from that: the pressure on South Africa must be intensified and made more effective.129.	The conflict in the Middle East continues to have serious repercussions on relationships not only in the Middle East but also in the rest of the world. Despite all the efforts that have been made  the past year has seen growing tension in the region. My Government welcomed the agreements reached at Camp David by Egypt and Israel  with the help of the United States  and the peace Treaty between Egypt and Israel as important steps towards a comprehensive solution of the Middle East conflict. Unfortunately  we have not so far seen a broadening of the peace process towards a comprehensive settlement.130.	Two essential elements are involved in such a process: clear acceptance by all of the right of Israel to continue to exist as a sovereign State within secure and recognized borders and recognition of the fact that full account must be taken of the legitimate rights of the Palestinians  including their right to self-determination.131.	In this perspective  the nine member States of the European Community issued the Venice declaration on the Middle East in June this year and decided to make the necessary contacts with all the parties concerned. We are convinced that the members of the Community are making a constructive contribution towards establishing the under-standing and the climate required to bringing about a comprehensive solution to the Middle East problem.132.	However  this goal will remain a distant one as long as the cycle of violence is allowed to continue in the area  not least in Lebanon. Renunciation of the use of force by all the parties involved is a pre-condition of real progress.133.	Other serious obstacles to the peace process are the Israeli settlements and the unilateral Israeli initiative to change the status of Jerusalem. We urge all the parties concerned to exercise maximum restraint in word and in deed  in order not to hamper the endeavours to bring peace and security to the region.134.	The armed Vietnamese intervention in Kampuchea nearly two years ago and its implications for the neighbouring States remain a matter of serious concern to the world at large. Like the majority of the States Members of the United Nations  Denmark deeply deplores this development and has emphasized the right of all peoples to determine their own future without outside interference.135.	We deeply deplore the sufferings inflicted upon hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians throughout the region. In this connexion  my Government would like to commend the international relief organizations for their accomplishments in alleviating the human sufferings of these innocent people. I should also like to thank the Secretary-General for his report on the Kampuchean question and to pledge our support for his continued efforts to find a political solution that will end the conflict.136.	As I mentioned in my introductory remarks  the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan during the last days of 1979 has caused a regrettable deterioration in international relations.137.	At its sixth emergency session  held from 10 to 14 January this year  the General Assembly adopted by an overwhelming majority a resolution urging the Soviet Union to abide by the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and promptly put an end to its military intervention in Afghanistan. It is deplorable that today  nine months after the adoption of that resolution  there are still Soviet troops in Afghanistan.138.	Various initiatives aiming at a political solution of the crisis have seen the light of day in recent months. But  regrettably  Soviet reactions have so far generally been negative  and they provide no basis for optimism as to an early solution.139.	Denmark believes that the countries in the region  the Islamic countries and other non-aligned countries in particular  can offer important contributions to the search for a comprehensive political solution.140.	The challenge to East-West relations posed by the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan presents a very real and significant problem. It is imperative that all efforts be devoted to preserving what is realistically possible of the achievements of the 1970s  and especially the practice of East-West contacts and dialogue  which has become part of everyday life.141.	Arms control and the process of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe are examples of areas in which it should be in the interest of both sides to secure detente based on a genuine two-way process. We must concentrate our efforts on continuing this East-West dialogue.142.	The continued world-wide arms race is fraught with such dangers and entails such a drain on the world's resources that it must impose on all States of the world a responsibility to contribute to international disarmament efforts. In our age a nuclear conflict would simply mean the end of modern civilization. In this context the ongoing broad dialogue in the United Nations on these central problems is essential.143.	All nations share a profound common interest  transcending all ideological and national boundaries in avoiding warânot just a major war  but also local conflicts which might escalate into a major war.144.	It is sad to note that the present tense international climate has so far impaired the possibilities of progress in international disarmament talks. But we must never give up. It is today more imperative than ever to find an acceptable alternative to a continuing  unrestrained  dangerous and potentially destabilizing arms race. Issues relating to the proliferation of nuclear weapons should be given very high priority in international disarmament efforts. A further spread of nuclear weapons would have far-reaching repercussions on international security and stability. It would obviously alter the entire international environment; it would increase the risk of nuclear confrontation; and it would be a hard blow to all our hopes of curbing the arms race.145.	It is deplorable that the Second Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons failed to achieve consensus on a substantive final document. It should not be overlooked  however  that the Conference did much useful work.146.	In the longer view  the political will on the part of the nuclear Powers to halt the arms race will be a pre-condition of the preservation and  it is to be hoped the strengthening of the present international non-proliferation regime. For that reason  among others  Denmark urges early ratification of the SALT II Treaty.16 We also urge a resumption of the negotiating process on the limitation of strategic arms in order to secure substantial future reductions in nuclear weapons as part of a new SALT III treaty.147.	We warmly welcome the latest developments regarding the beginning in the very near future of preliminary talks on arms control concerning long-range theatre nuclear forces. We expect that such talks may pave the way to early and realistic negotiations  thus making it possible to avoid a new and dangerous nuclear arms race on the European continent. Permit me also to re-emphasize that the Danish Government attaches decisive importance to the conclusion of a comprehensive treaty banning all nuclear tests in all environments.148.	So far I have mentioned only nuclear weapons  but the efforts to halt the arms race must cover all types of weapons  including conventional weapons  which account for more than 80 per cent of total world military expenditure. Issues surrounding conventional weapons should be given urgent attention as well.149.	In the course of the second substantive meeting of the United Nations Disarmament Commission in May and June 1980  Denmark highlighted the problems and principles of conventional disarmament.  The debate showed that there was wide support for the Danish idea of an in-depth study of the entire range of issues involved in conventional disarmament. We intend to pursue those ideas during the present session of the General Assembly.150.	As I have indicated  we are faced with a number of serious political problems  but also as regards economic growth and stability the outlook for the world is gloomy. The poorer developing countries in particular are exposed. The present economic difficulties have  however  more clearly than in previous periods with economic growth  demonstrated the interdependence of our economies. More specifically  it has made us realize more clearly that the economic development of developing countries has a profound and indispensable impact on the growth of the world economy and thereby also on the growth of the industrialized countries.151.	Denmark strongly believes that it is in the common interest of all countries to develop a new and more equitable international economic order. We therefore regret that the eleventh special session of the General Assembly did not make as much progress as we had hoped. We ascribe that to the fact that the global negotiations in themselves represent a new venture which is both ambitious and difficult. Let me make it clear  however  that Denmark is in favour of those global negotiations. That was also reflected in our willingness to accept the compromise text concerning the procedure for the global negotiations which emerged during the last days of the special session. We are prepared to join in the efforts to reach a final agreement concerning the procedure and the agenda for the global negotiations during this session. Our aim is to set the global negotiations in motion as planned early next year. We see the global negotiations as a first step towards implementing some of the recommendations of the Brandt report.  My Government fully subscribes to the thrust of that report. We hope that its findings will be taken duly into account and that they will make an important contribution to the coming round of global negotiations.152.	My Government welcomes the successful conclusion at the eleventh special session of the negotiations regarding the new development strategy for the 1980s. We are now looking forward to the final adoption of the strategy at this session of the General Assembly.153.	Denmark continues to put the strongest emphasis on extending official development assistance to the developing countries as the best expression in practical terms of the solidarity of all industrialized countries  including the socialist countries  with the third world in its struggle for economic development and social progress. I therefore strongly urge all industrialized countries to regard the targets of the strategy as commitments substantially to increase official development assistance so as to reach the 0.7 per cent target within the next few years. However  our ambition should not stop there; 1 per cent must be reached within the foreseeable future.154.	As I have mentioned  the preparatory work on launching the global negotiations is before the Assembly at this session. I am thinking especially of the agenda  which conveys all the major elements on which global economic growth is dependent.155.	My Government has always favoured a more open world trading system. Today  with a grim outlook for the world economy  it is more important than ever for all of us to join in the fight against protectionism. My Government hopes that it will be possible during the global round to find new areas of agreement in order to secure an open trade system that is responsive to the needs of all Member States of the United Nations.156.	The establishment of a Common Fund for Commodities represents a significant achievement of the North-South dialogue. It is to be hoped that the Fund will soon become operational and thus give an impetus to the global round negotiations on how to cope with the many outstanding questions and problems in the commodity field.157.	One of the most important questions on the agenda for the global round is  of course  the scarce supply of certain natural resources. It is therefore essential that the global- round negotiations should bring about a common agreement on trends and predictability in the energy market. In this connexion  it is of great importance to agree on the establishment of a permanent energy forum within the framework of the United Nations system. I should also like to emphasize that the Danish Government attaches importance to the upcoming United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy.158.	Many other items will be discussed during the global round of the negotiations. It is impossible to mention all of them but I should like to point out that the growing food problems and other important matters in connexion with development are among the key problems to be solved during this decade. Let me point out  as a more imminent and pressing question  that in order to restore a high and sustainable rate of economic growth coupled with price stability we must find an effective solution to the problem of recyclingâa solution that takes into account the interests of all parties concerned.159.	I have already dealt with a number of issues that have implications for human rights. During the past decades the United Nations has in particular contributed substantially to a growing appreciation that lasting world peace and security must be based on a world with social justice and respect for human rights. We have all seen how violations of fundamental human rights in many parts of the world cause social unrest  political disturbances or even armed conflict. In such circumstances  individuals whose human dignity and integrity are disregarded are left with only one choice: to take refuge elsewhere.160.	The United Nations has often considered the problems of the millions and millions of refugees in the world. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other relevant organs of the United Nations have made strenuous and persistent efforts to find solutions to these problems. Denmark has taken and will continue to take an active part in the international humanitarian endeavours to relieve the plight of refugees  and the Danish Government sincerely hopes that all Member States of the United Nations will make a truly constructive contribution to these endeavours.161.	We should all recognize that universal respect for and observance of human rights would reduce the refugee problem. For that reason too  Denmark will continue to support all efforts to ensure that all human beings  without discrimination of any kind  enjoy all human rights.162.	A special feature of discriminatory practices is that of sex discrimination  which exists almost everywhere. In this respect  it is important to recall that since its creation the United Nations has agreed that the Organization should be instrumental in both national and international efforts for the advancement of women all over the world. To date  the main achievements of the United Nations in this field are the World Plan of Action adopted by the World Conference of the International Women's Year  held at Mexico City in 1975  and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women  which the General Assembly adopted last year.163.	The World Conference of the United Nations Decade for Women  which was held at Copenhagen from 14 to 30 July 1979  provided further impetus for the implementation of both of these international instruments.164.	Denmark signed the Convention at the Copenhagen Conference  and we find that by far the greater part of the Programme of Action adopted at the Conference represents a most valuable action-oriented contribution to the advancement of women all over the world  and especially of the least privileged groups of women.165.	Within this framework  the Danish Government will be active in contributing to the implementation of the Programme of Action for the rest of the Decade.166.	The proposal of the five Nordic countries concerning effective measures to enhance the protection  security and safety of diplomatic missions has been elaborated upon by my Finnish colleague. In this connexion  I should also like to mention the reference to this subject in the Secretary- General's report on the work of the Organization.167.	Denmark strongly supports the efforts of the Secretary-General to turn the United Nations into a more efficient tool for negotiation  accommodation and cooperation among all peoples and States of our globe. I have noted with great interest Mr. Waldheim's pertinent remarks on this point. I completely agree that the success of these efforts depends on the will of the Member States. Denmark  for its part  is prepared to show that political will."
"41",1989,"DOM",35,1980,"ï»¿As I am speaking in the General Assembly for the first time after having assumed the responsibilities of Secretary of State for External Affairs of my country  I should like to ask the President of the thirty-fifth session of the Assembly to accept the best wishes of the Government of the Dominican Republic  through the delegation over which I have the honour to preside.42.	Mr. President  we are convinced that  with your wisdom and your dedication to the cause of mankind  which is undoubtedly to save the nations of the Organization ""from the scourge of war  which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind""  you will guide our efforts towards the most appropriate solutions to the problems before us  which have even reached the Security Council.43.	I should also like to express to Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim our profound appreciation of his praiseworthy efforts during his presidency of the thirty-fourth session and the successive special sessions of the General Assembly.44.	We are honoured to bid the warmest welcome to the two new Members of the Organization  the Republic of Zimbabwe  a nation which has just ended a long and difficult struggle for its independence  and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  whose participation in the work of the General Assembly will enrich the Group of Latin American States to which it has received a fraternal welcome.45.	From the earliest days of its independence  the Dominican Republic has on numerous occasions demonstrated heroism  courage and devotion to the rule of freedom despite the trials and tribulations to which we have been subjected throughout our history by the vicissitudes of international politics  from which we have been able to emerge with strengthened independence to the extent that it can be said that we are today perhaps one of the few countries in the world that has recovered  without foreign assistance  its status as a sovereign and independent nation  a status that was lost as a result of armed intervention which undermined its republican institutions  but  despite its duration  did not succeed in extinguishing our national spirit.46.	Consequently  we have absolute faith that the people of the Dominican Republic has reached such a degree of maturity that the idea of democracy described by Abraham Lincoln  as ""government of the people  by the people  and for the people""  which has guided it throughout its history is now part of the soul of our nation and is fixed at the core of the defence of our continent.47.	We are a peace-loving nation which has survived the sudden reversals of fortune of internal politics over the years. Nevertheless we. maintain an unswerving policy of neutrality and non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States as the mainstay of our international relations.48.	It is nevertheless surprising that  in the face of adversity  the idea of freedom has survived in our people which  in addition to being subjected to many adverse historical circumstances  has seen various interventions and two major and long totalitarian dictatorships. But the sons of the nation of the Dominican Republic have preserved in their life as citizens this universal ethical value that is freedom  whose deep roots have never ceased to be nourished by the ideals of the selfless and courageous men who in 1844 fought long and hard to found the Dominican Republic.49.	We can be proud that for our country freedom means also the rule of law  the inherent right of men  all men without discrimination. Human rights are firmly guaranteed by our institutions. All have the right to God-given bread  in security and dignity. The solidarity of societies and respect for the dignity of men and nations; solidarity in the constant struggle against barbarity and organized cruelty; and  above all  the constant struggle for justice within a pure and simple democracy  without limitationâthese constitute the legacy of the Divinity.50.	Within this broad context of freedom  there exist all the many responsibilities that have been assumed by the present Government of the Dominican Republicâbut it cannot be denied that ever since the end of the last dictatorship  which lasted for 30 years until 1961  our nation has been shaped and influenced by those dictatorial policies and a civil war  in an intermediate period which preceded the normality prevailing today.51.	In contrast  we have now moved towards the rule of law and the mobilization of our citizens to foster the exploitation of all the resources of our country  notwithstanding the hurricanes which struck in 1979 and more recently  hurricane ""Allen"".52.	We have come a long way in that direction and we are now laying the foundations for a new agararian policy. We are mobilizing all available resources to speed up development  which should lead to greater economic and financial stability.53.	We are also expanding international relations with a new vision of closer relations with other nations and a more practical approach to problems  characterized by the signature of bilateral instruments  as is to be expected of a modern society. We are promoting common interests  open markets  reasonable terms to foster joint investments and other similar programmes which should contribute to a better use of labour and the reduction of unemployment in both urban and rural areas.54.	Furthermore  we are making progress in the communication media  and this is necessary to achieve a bloodless labour revolution  individual security and freedom of the press and all means of expression of thought which is so unlimited that it can appear at times to be excessive  and this is easy to understand when one has experienced limitations on such rights during abnormal periods in the past.55.	During the past two years of our new Government  we have also become convinced that new trends in international affairs require that States not be bound by the glories of the past or wallow in sterile resentment over negative historical events. Only by meeting that requirement can unprofitable isolation be avoided. Progress must be sought in the opposite direction  by endeavouring to promote international relations of a kind that can open the way to understanding  solidarity and peace among nations.56.	With this new opening up of our international policies  the Government of the Dominican Republic has entered a new period of its history in which it has realistic friendly relations with the Republic of Haiti  a neighbour of ours with whom we shareâperhaps uniquely in the worldâ dominion over one island.57.	Encouraged by these new ideas  the island policy that we now have with our sister country has been strengthened with every passing day  and this has created new opportunities for cultural  social and economic exchanges which we hope will lead to the signing of constructive instruments. This will surely lead to the creation of markets more in keeping with the realities of our situation and will provide better opportunities for the achievement of our mutual goals.58.	Within this economic and commercial pattern  a very promising convention on trade between the two countries has been signed. It includes a free-trade zone which applies to products produced in each country  and many facilities will ensue from that. We have scheduled reductions of import taxes on products which are specifically defined in the first and second lists annexed to that convention. Under the same instrument a permanent commission is established to determine which products will be the subject of negotiations  to propose lists of selected products  and to change the schedule for customs reductions. All this is marked by reasonable flexibility.59.	No less important is the convention on land transportation  which is to guarantee permanent communications between the supply centres and the consumption centres  and this covers products which are used in trade and is intended to promote friendship among fraternal countries in the spirit of international co-operation.60.	A new page in the history of our countries began on 30 May 1978  when Antonio Guzman and Jean-Claude Duvalier embraced each other for the first time in Jimani- Malpasse. From that time on our two nations realized that there was nothing to fear and that a new era was dawningâ just as another era ended 17 years agoâand it is an era without heroes perhaps but one also without martyrs.61.	Ever since the first non-indigenous settlers on both sides of the island began to fight for dominion over the island  our peoples had lived in only one of three ways: confronting each other  with their backs turned to each other or on top of each other. That was until the arrival of Antonio Guzman and Jean-Claude Duvalier. Now our two peoples  under the leadership of these two statesmen  have begun a new life: a life of friendship  good will and cooperation  to quote the words  the firm intentions expressed by Antonio Guzman when he welcomed Jean-Claude Duvalier  the President of Haiti  at Jimani-Malpasse.62.	Friendship  good will and co-operation are the ABC of the foreign policy of President Guzman with regard to Haiti and that of President Duvalier with regard to the Dominican Republic. Instead of confrontation  instead of hostile indifference  there is today  along with a firm desire to work  a determination to live in peace as blood brothers.63.	These are glad tidings that I bring to the Assembly. The Dominican Republic is no longer an enemy of Haiti  and Haiti has ceased to be an enemy of the Dominican Republic. If we look at the truth  our peoples have never truly been enemies. Those who have been enemies have been a few of the men that have led our peoples. While the powerful of yesterday chose war  those in power today have chosen peace. The gloom that marked relations between the two countries has been replaced by a ray of light. Between the two nations today not only do we have peace  tranquillity and good understanding  but the future is bright.64.	This great reunion shows that there is no reason for peoples to commit aggression or to destroy themselves in war over problems which could be resolved in a civilized manner. Now with firm stepsâalthough they are often slow ones because of the precariousness of our resourcesâwe are waging an all-out battle against the common enemy of our peoples  the implacable adversary of the developing countries: poverty. It is poverty that prevents us from developing spiritually  politically  economically and socially in human dignity.65.	We have made these references to our relations with the Haitian people and Government  one of the aspects of our present policy  which is in keeping with the international norms which the Charter of the United Nations advocates within the philosophy of peace keeping  which more than ever requires a concerted solution to disputes and conflicts  in which dialogue must be prominent. It is the best and most effective way in which States can deal with each other in this decade.66.	In this context  progress has been made  but backward steps also have been taken. Now there is more reason than ever before to act positively  for international terrorism in many forms has been the source of disturbance and has undermined international public order  creating an alarming situation; that phenomenon increasingly is at variance with human rights  which must prevail if we are aware of the implications of a nuclear warâwhich could be caused by an unbridled arms raceâwhen terrifying weapons of destruction are used which push the outlook for peace further away in our uncertain future.67.	It is certainly disturbingâfor those reasonsâthat terrorism  far from being in decline  is gaining ground in certain very sensitive areas. For various sociological reasons  it has been more intense. Hence  we must be alert. States must stand together in a common effort to end this violence wherever it may rear its ugly head and create a threat to the States themselves.68.	In the past few years international terrorism has taken on a particularly heinous form. My delegation is referring to seizures for the purpose of economic exploitation. Frequently the pretext used is the fight for freedom  but that is often not the true purpose. It is mere lust for money. This is an international crime which cannot be justified and cannot remain unpunished.69.	My country has been tested by such events. They represent a return to savagery which smacks of medieval obscurantism and constitute a challenge and a threat to our country and our institutions.70.	We have ourselves suffered the unfortunate experience of that form of terrorism that uses as weapons the seizure and holding of hostages  who are the innocent and the defenceless victims of that wanton crime.71.	Fortunately  our national dignity has remained unscathed by such trials and we have emerged from them without bloodshed. Such would not have been the case had common sense and providence not intervened in a timely manner.72.	We cannot fail to condemn the repugnant spectacle of human beings held in long captivity in Iran simply because they belong to an institution which is hundreds of years old  the institution of diplomacy that makes possible legal relations among States and without which the world would be uninhabitable.73.	International instruments that punish and prevent such crimes have been referred to here in the General Assembly. A few years ago  when aircraft were being seized and their passengers exposed to risks  the Dominican Republic and Brazil agreed that such criminal acts must be considered as transgressions of juris gentium because preventive action is difficult.74.	When we speak of international terrorism in all its forms as a scourge  we cannot fail also to advocate the elimination of certain legal excesses in which States have engaged in order to repress  exceeding the limits of domestic law and affect the rights of others. In that line of thought  our delegation shares the view of those who believe that human rights are absolute.73. This is not open to challenge; it is enshrined in international law. One of the great achievements of our time is that such rights are a part of juris gentium and they have become part of that law because violations of human rights can lead to conflicts.76.	For these reasons  the Dominican Republic also advocates the abolition of capital punishment. This must become a norm of law in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and a basic principle in the American Convention on that subject.  Although this form of punishment is generally proscribed  it is permitted exceptionally in those States in which it had existed before the signing of the inter-American instrument. Logic  since the days of the Greeks  has taught us that things cannot be and not be at the same time.77.	We are pleased to say that the Constitution of our country sets forth in one of its tenets what must one day appear in all international instruments on human rights. It states the following under that heading:""The inviolability of life.""As a result  there must be no capital punishment  no torture nor any other penalty or procedure implying the loss or diminution of physical integrity or individual well-being.""78.	This idea underlies the observations the Dominican Republic made concerning the American Convention on Human Rights.""The Dominican Republic  as it signs the American Convention on Human Rights  hopes to see the death penalty banned and that principle applied generally in the States of the American region  and we hereby reiterate the observations and comments made with regard to the draft Convention and circulated among the delegations of the Council of the Organization of American States on 20 June 1969.""79.	In this area of human rights  our country  despite our untoward experiences in the past both under dictatorship and at other times  has achieved positive goals and will continue to work towards the rule of law.80.	These considerations would be incomplete were we to fail to recognize that those countries that are still grappling with problems that arise from an insufficient degree of development owing to insufficient economic means must promote education  without which democracy cannot survive. The five freedoms proclaimed in the Pacific region must become a reality. If this is so  we must recognize that the industrialized  fully developed countries  which makeup the established economic institutions  are in duty bound to come to the economic  technological  social and cultural assistance of the developing countries.81.	This recalls the Declaration of Algiers.  We would add that this must be a commitment  not merely an expression of charity or pity. It is an unchallenged fact that today the economic ills of one State have an inevitable effect on others.82.	The thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly coincides with the beginning of a new decade  and this has a very special significance for the international economic order. It is particularly significant for the third world countries that are not oil producers  like the Dominican Republic  countries whose Governments are engaged in an all-out battle against poverty in all its forms and are endeavouring to establish a society ruled by social justice and a broader and more equitable distribution of material goods  as well as to promote the enjoyment of the spiritual values so essential to human dignity and representative democracy.83.	Only a few weeks ago  the eleventh special session of the General Assembly was held to consider an international strategy for development; it is to be hoped that its conclusions will be supported by the industrialized countries  including the United States of America  Japan and the European countries. The results of those deliberations will continue to be considered in relation to general rules as well as to the global negotiations so that we may actually begin the implementation of the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade.84.	The countries of the third world base their demands on the fact that the world distribution of income is very unequal and that internal efforts to improve development levels are being obstructed at the international level and are meeting external forces to minimize them. This can clearly be seen in international trade relations. The need for reform goes far beyond the liberalization achieved by the negotiations within GATT. The quota system  systems of safeguards and various forms of restrictions that affect the export of many products from developing to industrialized countries all contribute to this inequality in income distribution throughout the world and have made it impossible to establish a fair level for prices through trade machinery.85.	The industrialized countries must unhesitatingly recognize that the stabilization of commodity prices represents a reform that will help them as much as the less developed countries. For this reason  the Common Fund for Commodities  as well as the creation of a reserve fund for food grains  will benefit not only the producing but also the consumer countries through a more rational use of resources and the promotion of larger investments.86.	The violent fluctuations in the price of sugar on the world market is a striking example of the enormous difficulties which periodically beset the economies of countries like the Dominican Republic. These ""ups"" and ""downs"" create uncertainties. The 1977 International Sugar Agreement is an instrument filled with good intentions  but its effectiveness leaves much to be desired because price adjustments are not as automatic as one would wish and prices are fixed on the basis of supply  if not by speculation. In the circumstances  our economy  which depends largely on sugar exports  is in a particularly precarious state  which makes it impossible to plan resources. World inflation is making the situation even worse.87.	Consequently  it is not surprising that refinancing of the external debt looms large in the thinking of the third world countries. While it is difficult to assess the benefits refinancing would bring  it would certainly have a stabilizing effect on the financial markets and make it easier for the debtor countries to adapt'. The external debt of 75 developing countries that do not export oil has increased from $44 billion in 1970 to $146 billion in 1977  and in 15 countries of Latin America alone the debt went from $23 billion to $71 billion during that same period. As the external debt increases considerably  there has been  at the same time  a large rise in private loans and a consequent reduction of official loans; higher interest rates and shorter repayment periods thus have resulted. The industrialized countries must give assistance here to the developing countries in the form of donations and loans on easy terms and with fewer conditions.88.	International co-operation for development must be extended to other areas of importance such as industrialization  the transfer of science and technology and the more rational use of natural resources  the expansion of agricultural production and the promotion of food production  as well as the protection of the environment.89.	However  if all these negotiations concerning the inter-national economic outlook are to be productive  it is necessary for the highly industrialized countries to resolve their problems of inflation and the low growth rate of their gross national product. The less developed countries must react to the hostility of the international economic environmentâ which is marked by protectionist tendencies and increases in the price of petroleumâand the difficulties regarding foreign trade and growing external debts  with all the problems that that implies. For our country  the value of our oil imports this year will amount to $475 million; that is  $172 million more than it was in 1979  as a result of the fact that the average price of a barrel of oil rose from $19.85 to $29.13  although consumption remained the same as during the previous year.90.	The cost of payment and repayment of our debts in 1980 is estimated at $333 million. Therefore  those two areas alone will absorb approximately 86 percent of our total export earnings  which are estimated at $1 010 million.91.	The Government of our country  under President Antonio Guzman  in only two years has implemented an economic programme aimed at changing our development pattern and providing incentives for agricultural and livestock development on the basis of agricultural and industrial promotion. Our import substitution programme is expected to increase along with the production and use of our national raw materials and laws that provide incentives for exportation.92.	We have tried to improve our public finances  eliminate luxury investments and above all concentrate on expanding education  health services  agricultural credits  dynamic agrarian reform  the building of secondary roads and the training of businessmen  in small and medium-sized concerns. We are developing our infrastructure through the construction of highways  irrigation channels and dams and energy development; we are endeavouring to expand promotion of the agricultural sector but an accelerated rate of implementation has been difficult owing precisely to our problems of balance of payment and foreign debt.93.	Recent statistics have been given by the United Nations and the World Bank showing that during the first years of the present decade 2 billion peopleâhalf the people of the worldâwill suffer from gastrointestinal disease because the water they drink is contaminated. Yet $1 million is being spent every minute on weapons for war.94.	Many countries destroy food surpluses in order to keep prices high while  at the same time  four fifths of mankind is suffering from hunger and malnutrition  and does not have the basic domestic appliances to make life bearable.95.	I should like to repeat here what so many others have said here and in other forums  namely  that the enemy of peace  the one truly responsible for human misery  fanning the fire of revolution  is injustice in the broadest sense of the word  which is the abuse of authority and the exploitation of man by man. In international relations there are vastly different standards for judging others from the standards which we use to judge ourselves.96.	William Bowdler  Under-Secretary for Inter-American Affairs in the Sub-Committee on Inter-American Affairs  speaking before the Foreign Relations Committee of the House of Representatives  reflected the thoughts of Morgen- thau when he said: ""The real question confronting the foreign policy of the United States ... is not how to preserve stability in the face of the revolutionary process but rather how to create stability as a result of revolution"".97.	In my country development has been slow but it has been inexorable as the result of a genuine revolution which has gone through stages. It is a revolution through evolution. We have a Government that respects human rights. There are no limitations to free expression  except those imposed by law. Freedom of movement is a reality. There are no political prisoners. No one is persecuted for his ideas. There are no exiles. No one simply disappears. We have life in a genuine democracy and there is absolute freedom within order. We have therefore ""created"" our own ""stability"" of which Morgenthau spoke. We have done our part regarding what has been ""confronting the foreign policy of the United States"". Thus  we have the rightâand we have that right- to our guaranteed stability.98.	When Mr. Bowdler accepted the change and said it was ""natural and inevitable""  he was merely adjusting his watch in time with history. When he said that peace and democracy in our region require fundamental political and socio-economic reforms which promote the well-being and strengthen the rights of the individual  he was formulating a thesis that his country can help to bring about in reality. Change and reform will serve no useful purpose if our countries receive the same unjust treatment that the powerful reserve for subjugated peoples.99.	The oil problem  which hangs like a sword over our heads  is a matter that must be dealt with by those who have the good fortune to be oil producers.100.	A new vision in our commercial relations has appeared; a new  more modern approach to justice and equity is needed.101.	If political experiments which have been translated into reality  as in the Dominican Republic  have no immediate success  we run the risk that the enemy forces that beset us will sweep us away. There are some demagogues  who affirm that democracy has already performed its historic function and that the path of the vote is the path of suicide 102.	The peoples of the world love freedom so much  men have such an elevated concept of freedom that in my country everyone is very well aware of the precarious state in which we have been left by the forces of nature and by the devastation caused by those who went before us  and now we are working for the full enjoyment of those values of which we have spoken. The people realize with every passing day that the man whom it has chosen to guide its destiny is multiplying his efforts and will never rest until the most humble Dominican has been rescued from misery  ignorance and sorrow.103.	But the old economic disorder persists and in countries like mine  after centuries of struggle and after the people have succeeded in securing respect for their wishes  now offers us no more than freedom without bread  without adequate housing  without health and without equitable distribution.104.	If we are to speak truly of equitable distribution of the wealth of our country  it is necessary for us to speak of equitable distribution of the profits produced by our wealth for the powerful countries.105.	We must put an end to the imbalance which exists between the enterprises and those employed by enterprises. Once the labour of the workers ceases to be a mere input in large landholdings and in industry to acquire the status that it has in certain powerful countries  then can we speak of respect for human rights  of dignity for human beings.106.	Without equality there can be no fraternity  no good will. Without justice man's enthusiasm and the enthusiasm of peoples for solidarity in moments of misfortune and rejoicing in times of triumph will not be aroused.107.	Aristotle said  nearly four centuries before the birth of Christ  that inequality is always the cause of revolutions. And according to the same philosopher there is inequality when those who are the victims of revolutions are not compensated.108.	But there is also inequality when  among those who contribute to the exploitation of wealth  there exists a great difference in the distribution of that wealth. There is inequality when the greatest wealth of a country is acquired by someone else for speculative purposes and when the true owners of the riches are left in a state of poverty. There is inequality when what is paid in terms of interest is greater than what is received in terms of loans. There will be inequality as long as our tourists are not given the treatment they deserve and as long as our citizens are not treated as masters in their own homes.109.	We need a vigorous energy policy such as has been launched by our President in the face of the oil crisis. For this reason studies have already begun on turning our oil- burning thermo-electric plants over to coal; research work has been started on the drying of cane pulp by solar energy to increase power capacity; we are carrying out feasibility studies on the building of a 100 megawatt electrical plant  also using solar energy; and we have intensified the search for oil in various parts of the country  and among other important studies  we are developing hydraulic energy.110.	All these efforts are designed to promote a more just and equitable society  where political democracy is based on social justice  equal opportunity and the elimination of differences between the poor and the rich. This is the greatest contribution that our country can make to the new international economic order and  in particular  to solving the problems of the Caribbean  which traditionally has been the scene of abrupt political change.111.	We should like to make a few comments regarding the situation in the Middle East  which is a highly sensitive area of conflict. In recent months the picture in that area has become even more gloomy.112.	As a Member of our world Organization  the Dominican Republic took part in the deliberations which led to the creation of the State of Israel. The basis of that historic act was the principle in the Charter on the self-determination of peoples. We share the view that creation of that nation was based on international law. We never failed to recognize all that the Holy Scriptures grant the people of Israel.113.	As a participant in the Inter-American Conference on the Problems of War and Peace  held at Mexico City in 1945 when the Allied Powers saw the end of the Second World War approaching and the spirit of the Yalta agreements inspired the international community re Dominican Republic was anxious to support new visions of a more peaceful world.114.	This spirit also prevailed at the San Francisco Conference and in the debates which led to the signing of the Charter of the United Nations  which for so many years has prevented the scourge of total war and helped to preserve peace.115.	Therefore  when considering the right of Israel to survive as a sovereign State established in accordance with the principle of the self-determination of peoples  we cannot but honour the commitment imposed by the principles of the Charter.116.	For those reasons  we have lent our reasonable support to Israel whenever the legitimacy of that State has been challenged. For the same reasons  our country recognizes the right of the Palestinian people  without diminishing the right to existence of a people which  like Israel  has participated in the great work of peace.117.	We think that this is a just and legitimate position and we consider that peaceful means should be used to settle the situation in the Middle East. With equal conviction we view the Camp David agreements as a firm step towards peace in the Middle East  in an atmosphere of tranquillity and mutual respect and under the rule of law. In this way the States involved can live within permanent  secure and guaranteed borders.118.	The Dominican Republic  which has survived the vicissitudes of history and has always observed a policy of neutrality  believes that this is the right policy for small countries  especially developing countries  within the frame-work of independent sovereign democracy. Thus we cannot fail to mention Afghanistan  which is a member State of the third world movement to which we belong.119.	Because we cherish peace  we deplore the abnormal situation which has occurred there in violation of the fundamental norms of international law and the demands of peace which justify the existence of the United Nations. Consequently we believe that the situation in Afghanistan must return to the status quo ante  and by peaceful means.120.	For the same reasons  which are in keeping with the universal principles of the free nations of the world  the Government of the Dominican Republic hopes that the machinery available to the Organization will make it possible to stop the conflict between the neighbouring countries of Iran and Iraq  countries with the maturity of many centuries of experience  in order to prevent the outbreak of a total war.121.	We say this in a spirit of the strictest neutrality.122.	Let me sum up by saying that in respect for human rights and for the Organization we have an obligation to build a more just world in peace. This is what was said by His Holiness Pope John Paul II in Santo Domingo  the oldest capital in the Americas:""We must see to it that there are no children who are without sufficient nutrition  without education or training; we must ensure that there are no young people who lack suitable training  that there are no peasants without land and unable to live in dignity; we must see to it that workers are not mistreated  that their rights are not violated; we must see to it that there are no systems allowing the exploitation of man by man  or by the State; there must be no corruption; there must be none who through no fault of their own have nothing while others enjoy super-abundance; there must be no broken  disunited  insufficiently cared-for families; no one must be without the protection of the law; the law must protect everyone equally; force must not prevail over truth and law  but truth and law must prevail over force; we must ensure that economic and political considerations never prevail over humanitarian considerations."""
"42",2036,"DZA",35,1980,"ï»¿It gives me great pleasure to express to Mr. von Wechmar the warm congratulations of the Algerian delegation on his election to the presidency of the thirty-fifth session. In choosing him  the General Assembly has done honour to his rich experience of international affairs which  I am convinced  has made him equal to the delicate but most exhilarating responsibility that has fallen to him. Our wishes for full success accompany him in his lofty task.56.	He is taking over from Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim  who presided with competence  authority and devotion over one regular session  one special session and two emergency special sessions  all exceptionally full.57.	The many upheavals that mark our time reflect a need which has now become irrepressible  the need for profound change  for a radical transformation in the framework of our lives so that we can be equal to the renewed aspirations of man  of all mankind. This need has found expression in the dynamic process embarked upon by the peoples of the third world to build foundations of peace in justice and freedom. Our Organization was in duty bound to undertake this great project because it merely re-established the great ideals enshrined in our Charter.58.	If  in this thirty-fifth anniversary year of the United Nations  war and famine are still the lot of a large portion of mankind  the undeniable reason for that is the system of international relations itself  based on institutionalized disorder  supported by positions of strength  built upon power relationships. This intrinsically in-egalitarian system  furthermore  breeds troubles  even among its founders.59.	The present worsening of the international political climate is far from being the product of mere transient misunderstandings or chance conflicts of interest. In fact  it arises directly out of the very foundations of the existing system. It is logical for such a system to concentrate power and prosperity in an oligarchical manner  to the detriment of the vital interests of the third world and  ultimately  to the detriment of the interests of humanity as a whole. It was in order to put an end to such a process  which was beginning to seem irreversible  that the peoples of the third world applied themselves  from the moment they burst onto the stage of history  to promoting a new and expanded vision of international relations.60.	That was one of the goals of non-alignment  nourished by our faith in the common destiny of all peoples. Indeed  our non-alignment has not merely served the will of our peoples to affirm their identity and to take over control of the conditions of their own lives and their prosperity. From its outset  it aspired to go beyond the organization of the world in hostile blocs and to replace that with an international society truly free from power relationships.61.	However  this dynamic perception of international relations is still encountering the resistance of those who support political monopolization and economic domination and do their utmost to perpetuate the unequal machinery and organizations that now exist and therefore to isolate the third world. This is the background of the re-emergence of gunboat diplomacy and the practice of policies of destabilization and pressure on our countries in the name of doctrines based on so-called vital interests and aimed at securing control or even expropriating raw materials in general and energy resources in particular.62.	Non-alignment is not a short-term phenomenon. It has a permanent role that is salutary for the depolarization of our world and for the democratization of international relations. Obviously it is fighting for the abolition not only of bloc rivalry but also of the blocs themselves. Based essentially on the quest for peace and international co-operation  non-alignment could not remain insensitive to the end of the cold war and the positive evolution of East-West relations towards detente  which is considered an important stage on the way to the realization of our shared ideal of peace throughout the world.63.	Therefore we can only deplore the renewed tension in international relations  which has struck a brutal blow at the detente process  at least that which was developing in East- West relations. That challenge  which has been illustrated in a disquieting manner in 1980  has been accompanied by the strengthening of the bloc policy  an acceleration of the arms race and the reactivation of military bases. The growing deterioration which now marks international affairs shows further the fragility and the limitations of the detente process  as it has been conceived thus far  because we can now quite easily see that it is suffering from the repercussions of its own defects. It is the duty of the international community and in particular of the United Nations to make every effort to put an end to this worsening situation that is dangerous for peace in the world and for the security and independence of small States.64.	We have always welcomed detente between the blocs as an important contribution to the establishment of an improved climate which would benefit the entire international community and  therefore  we feel we are quite right in stressing once more today that real peace can only be global and universal and that this implies its indivisibility. This peace cannot be reduced to the preservation of the political and economic status quo in international relations; even less can it permit the transfer of further turmoil to that immense stormy zone that the ever-coveted third world has become.65.	Non-alignment  which in the most critical moments of confrontation between the blocs has amply demonstrated its devotion to peace by a thoroughly principled attitude  cannot today allow certain situations to worsen and is in a position to play its rightful role. A constantly living incarnation of mankind's aspirations to peace and progress  the non-aligned movement is  as in the past  capable of emerging all the greater from every trial  if it takes care that subjectivism does not outweigh the persistent quest for effectiveness.66.	In that regard  the situation in Afghanistan  a non- aligned country to which we are bound by ties of fraternity and friendship  is quite naturally of great importance to us. The disturbing development of the situation  regionally and internationally  emphasizes the urgency of a political solution which would restore peace in Afghanistan and throughout the region.67.	In Korea also  only a political solution  that of its reunification by peaceful means  can ward off the more and more obvious	of the partitioning of that country and guarantee a and final solution.68.	It is with great concern that we have been following the developments in the conflict between two countries of the Islamic community  Iraq and Iran  members of the same political family.69.	Being profoundly pained by these bloody confrontations  we ardently hope that the war will cease  that all differences can be resolved peacefully and that finally  in new trust and concord  our common struggle for the attainment of the objectives and the triumph of the ideals required by the common destiny of our peoples will prevail.70.	We hope that Iraq and Iran  going beyond these present rifts  can meet once more in the real struggle which is ours: the struggle against imperialism and Zionism and for the economic liberation of the third world.71.	In the Mediterranean  the island of Cyprus  which in its inalienable sovereignty has a natural inclination to remain generously and peacefully open to the two peoples that possess obvious ethnic affinities with its own  has for six years seen its independence and national unity placed in jeopardy. The international community  which defined ways and means for a final solution of the problem of Cyprus  is placing great hopes in the resumption of the intercommunal talks. We venture to believe that they will rapidly achieve agreement on the future of that land  whose destiny remains conditional upon the capacity for coexistence of the two communities which formed a nation and a State whose endangerment neither can accept.72.	It is a fact that  thanks to subtle dialectics of calculated risk  an open world war has so far been avoided. However  the danger  far from being removed  has increasingly taken on the disturbing appearance of being inevitable in a world which seems tempted to suicide.73.	Because the exacerbation of tension spares no sphere of international life  because the paralysis of the collective security system has shown that the regulatory machinery of the existing international system is ill-adopted  it is urgent to respond to the elementary need to make the security of the world the concern of everybody. Responding to that positive demand means having the courage to break with traditional approaches  so as to get back to the primary causes of the conflict and eliminate the manifestations of that conflict.74.	This kind of quest for international peace and security requires global solutions which necessarily include the completion of the decolonization process  the full prosperity and sovereignty of States  recognition of and respect for the right of development exercised in independence and freedom and protected from all kinds of interventions and pressures. This obviously presupposes the dismantling of foreign military bases  the withdrawal of foreign troops and the dissolution of military alliances  so as to bring about general and complete disarmament.75.	Whereas general and complete disarmament during the first years of our Organization was the subject of precise and specific negotiations  since that time we have been led more and more towards partial negotiations on limited measures without any significant effect on a real disarmament process. Measures for controlling armaments have been adopted but  to say the least  they have not triggered an irreversible movement towards the halting of production  and the gradual reduction followed by the complete elimination of stockpiles and existing nuclear-weapon carriers.76.	In this respect  while the signing of the SALT II agreement led us to believe that a ceiling would be placed on nuclear armaments  the postponement of ratification portends  on the contrary  that there has been a dangerous acceleration in the arms race.77.	This renewed spirit of confrontation has already been reflected by an increased military presence in regions which are considered to be nerve centres. This redeployment of the forces of imperialism by a feverish quest for new bases  in particular in the Middle East  in Africa and in the Indian Ocean and by the establishment and consolidation of rapid means of intervention  as well as the right that those forces disdainfully arrogate to themselves here and there to protect the maritime routes and supply sources of raw materials and energy  disregarding the sovereignty of States  are harbingers of new attacks upon the security of our countries.78.	The third world places great hopes in the attainment of the objectives  albeit modest  of the first Disarmament Decade  and finds in the reasons for its undeniable failure fresh proof of the inadequacy of any approach bereft of imperative goals in a binding time frame  the effect of which would allow the progressive succession of various stages leading to general and complete disarmament.79.	That is why the second Disarmament Decade  conceived as an operational stage to attain the ultimate objective  must necessarily lead to the conclusion of the ongoing negotiations in respect of the priorities established by the tenth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament.80.	The coincidence of the second Disarmament Decade and the Third United Nations Development Decade shows the close dovetailing of problems confronting humanity  calls for bold and forthright action to establish a climate of peace which would wrench man's genius from his destructive folly and place it at the service of development and the growing prosperity of peoples.81.	Disorder and injustice which mark international relations are reflected even more blatantly in the world economy.82.	The basic demand for a new international economic order  in consonance with the needs of a world in constant flux  has regularly met with a lack of political will among certain developed countries.83.	This attitude reveals tenacious resistance to the re-fashioning of the present structures  refashioning which is seen as an unacceptable challenge. At the same time  this attitude shows a will to perpetuate a system of international relations although it has amply demonstrated its incapacity to promote a fair distribution of well-being and prosperity.84.	It is in this context that we see renewed attempts to conceal the real problems of the new international economic order by actions that would try to focus dialogue on a partial vision  underscoring the warped idea of interdependence and a false approach to development perceived as the mere satisfaction of essential needs.85.	The fact that over the last six years the General Assembly has met three times in special sessions devoted to development shows clearly the will of the international community to make this forum a universal crucible where the new international economic order could take form  a new order based on a new idea of a solitary and united future of our world.86.	The fact that the United Nations has been opposed in its new historic mission by some of the founding Members themselves and that the question of the legalityâeven the legitimacyâof the mandate for the implementation of the new international economic order entrusted to it is being challenged does not at all shake our faith in the ability of the General Assembly to complete  in equity  equality and respect for mutual advantage  a necessary work for the benefit of all.87.	The eleventh special session was held in a critical environment marked in particular by deepening structural imbalances in the world economy and a reaffirmation of an ever obvious phenomenon: the ""development of under-development"" in ever more vast areas of the third world. It was to contribute  on the basis of a calm evaluation  free of complacency  of the implementation of the new international economic order  to bridging the wide gap separating statements of intent from effective action; it was to bring about a qualitatively new stage in international cooperation for development.88.	We had hoped at the time that the special session could launch the process of global negotiations and that an inter-national strategy could be adopted that would lead to real universal action for development. It would have thus breathed new life into the work of restructuring the current world economic order.89.	Once more people failed to see reason  to the great detriment of all.90.	What lessons can we learn from the North-South dialogue and  beyond that  the establishment of the new inter-national economic order?91.	The fact that three countries  by their rejection of a text which went far along the path of compromise  impeded the attainment of consensus on procedural aspects of the global negotiations highlights the disquieting existence of the tyranny of the ""minority of a minority"" exercised against the vast majority.92.	In truth  the process of democratization of the international economic decision cannot remain eternally blocked by a policy of ""enclaves"". Actions which have an impact on all aspects of international economic relations cannot continue to fall exclusively within the purview and competence of private clubs.93.	In the same way  it would be serious were we to take into account only the renewed strength of the world economy as a central element in the global negotiations. While it is true that the crisis is serious and affects all our economies  nevertheless we should not ignore the fact that under-development preceded it and will survive the crisis if the restructuring process and the institutional change which are so necessary are not undertaken.94.	Accordingly  the establishment of the new international economic order  with the need to restructure and recast our institutions  cannot be satisfied with an initiative directed towards meeting essential needs only. Although those problems are important  they should not side-step the main issue  that is  the fact that they are only the most disgraceful manifestations of the state of under-development that this present system of international economic relations has created  perpetuated and aggravated.95.	In the final analysis  the Strategy for the Third Development Decade is in danger of side-stepping its primary vocation  which remains the development of the developing countries. A move is being made to make it seem as if the world economy is being managed jointly; it is part of the initiative to pervert interdependence  because interdependence hides the difference in structure that exists in the economies of various countries.96.	It is an understatement  therefore  to say that the eleventh special session has not lived up to the expectations of the developing world.97.	We remain  for our part  staunchly devoted to the proposal for global negotiations. Likewise  we remain convinced that this initiative  provided that we want and know how to seize the opportunity  can contribute in a decisive manner to the promotion of genuine international cooperation and the establishment of an international strategy restored both in its dimension and its primary vocation. In this respect  coming shortly after the failure of the eleventh special session  the support and commitment pledged by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries [OPEC]â which met recently at Vienna in a tri-ministerial conferenceâto the global negotiations process  within the framework of the United Nations  have assumed a particularly important meaning.98.	In this context we remain ready  for our part  to pursue consultations on the global negotiations during the current session so that those negotiations can be launched on the date originally scheduled.99.	This willingness stems first and foremost from our faith in the capacity of dialogue and concerted action to resolve problems  provided that the necessary political will exists to do so. It also shows our conviction in the capacity of dialogue to promote the quest for the solutions necessary to handle the world economic crisis and to overcome the structural obstacles to development. It proceeds  finally  from our faith in the inevitable advent of what we are fighting for: the establishment of the new international economic order which global negotiations can and must accelerate.100.	Among the great causes that the United Nations has favoured  we must mention specifically the work of decolonization  which has been incessantly fuelled by the vigour and unshakeable determination of peoples fighting for their national liberation.101.	In congratulating ourselves today on the admission to our Organization of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  a country to which we wish a warm welcome to the concert of nations  we are  by so doing  noting with satisfaction both the progress of peoples in the reconquest of their freedom and a new step towards the universality of the United Nations.102.	Twenty years after the adoption of the historic Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  which it would be appropriate to hail in a special resolution of our thirty-fifth session  the restoration of the right of peoples to self-determination and independence has obviously imbued our society. However  there are still peoples today who continue to be deliberately held away from the light of history by force of arms.103.	In Palestine as in South Africa  in Namibia as in Western Sahara  the denial of the right of peoples to self- determination is the direct source of conflict situations which  through bloody confrontation and ferocious repression  condemn men to suffer physically the scourge of oppression and war. Although these colonial wars act as catalysts of the energies of the popular masses determined to shake off the yoke of bondage  they none the less constitute  because of their magnitude and their growth  serious threats to international peace and security.104.	The same is true for the dangerous evolution of the situation in the Middle East. While the Palestinian people continues to be deprived of its inalienable right to independent national existence  while Arab territories remain occupied despite the constantly repeated injunctions of the international community  the pursuit of a partial arrangement flouting the rights of self-determination and sovereignty and the independence of the Palestinian people has only encouraged the policy of fait accompli and increased the intransigence and expansionist appetites of the Zionist entity The international community is more than ever capable of appreciating the fallacious nature of the imperialist-Zionist initiative and the extent of the surrender of the Egyptian regime. The situation which resulted from the Camp David accords and the Washington Treaty is not peace. Indeed  exploiting the neutralization of the human and material potential of Egypt  the Zionist entity has been pursuing with ever greater determination its policy of aggression  conquest and Zionization of the entire Palestinian homeland.105.	Concomitant with the unending attacks by the forces of Zionist aggression on martyred Lebanon with the obvious aim of breaking the solidarity among fraternal Arab peoples  the Zionist attempt to provide a legal foundation for its annexation of the holy city of Al Quds stems from the same ideological and strategic aspirations and shows the utter scorn of the Zionist leaders for the norms of international law and ethics. Coming as it did when at its seventh special emergency session devoted to the question of Palestine  the General Assembly  in its resolution ES-7/2  was setting 15 November 1980 as the date for the withdrawal of the Zionist forces of occupation and administration from all the Arab occupied territories  the annexation of Al Quds quite rightly gave rise to universal obloquy. Once more paralysed by the abuse of the right of veto  the Security Council  whose very credibility called for an energetic reaction  finally  after a hesitation that was scarcely justified in view of the gravity and obviousness of the crime  associated its voice with the concert of verbal condemnations  whereas the situation created required the adoption of mandatory sanctions.106.	In the face of the upsurge of perils in this sorely tried region  the only alternative left for genuine peace with the re-establishment of the national rights of the Palestinian people  seems to be  obviously  general conflagrationâ which is virtually happening  as no one can pretend to be unaware. These gloomy prospects  while they give the lie to the trumpeted optimism of the supporters of the Camp David process  place the responsibility of the international community in its rightful context. The latter  through the voice of the General Assembly  has  moreover  charted the path of a just and final solution by a series of resolutions  the application of which is encountering Zionist obstruction. The Palestinian people  whose just cause has been ever more widely recognized  is resolved  under the guidance of the PLC  its sole authentic representative  to secure its national rights. From its heroic combat  which has already marked a milestone in the epic of the liberation of peoples  victory will inevitably ensue.107.	In the imperialist strategyâwhich by creating hot spots seeks to prevent the peoples from controlling the conditions of their existenceâthe state of insecurity established in the Middle East quite naturally finds its counterpart in southern Africa.108.	The odious policy of apartheid which  in this latter part of the twentieth century  is without question one of the most cruel insults to man's dignity  and the continued illegal occupation of Namibia would hardly have been possible without the complacent attitude in the Western world from which the racist regime of Pretoria benefits. Strengthened by this support  South Africa is still trying to contain the inexorable tide of the liberation of peoples  despite the fact that the brilliant victory of the people of Zimbabwe has reduced the area of colonial domination on the continent and confirms the pointlessness of such persistence condemned by the march of history. The incessant acts of aggression against the territorial integrity of Angola  Botswana and Zambia stem from hegemonistic designs  to which nuclear armament gives a disquieting magnitude  and require drastic measures on the part of the international community so that international law may triumph.109.	In the situation in Namibia there is hardly any movement towards the exercise of the right of self-determination and independence by the people of that Territory. On the contrary  recent unilateral measures  such as the establishment of the so-called ""Council of Ministers"" at Windhoek  confirm the apprehensions that we voiced when a settlement plan was put forward by five Western Powers.110.	Notwithstanding the laudable efforts of the front-line countries to make a contribution to the implementation of United Nations resolutions concerning the decolonization of the Territory and the responsible willingness of SWAPO  the sole legitimate representative of the Namibian people  Pretoria continues to wreck by its intransigence any serious  definitive solution. The dilatory tactics of South Africa and its allies highlight their strategic aimâwhich is  in Namibia as elsewhere  to set up authorities there which give the illusion of change while entrenching their own position of domination and exploitation of peoples.111.	The United Nations Council for Namibia  the sole Administering Authority of the Territory until it attains independence  fully understands this and advocated in its Algiers Declaration  adopted during its last extraordinary plenary meetings held at Algiers from 28 May to 1 June 1980  the use of binding economic sanctions against South Africa.112.	In that Africa which is still marked by the stigmas of colonization and which is making every endeavour to achieve its emancipation  Western Sahara was occupied at the very moment when its people were getting ready to acquire freedom as the fruit of their struggle.113.	In adopting at its thirty-fourth session resolution 34/37 on Western Sahara  the General Assembly  as in previous resolutions  put the problem of thwarted decolonization back into its true context. It has never ceased to recognize the basically colonial character of the situation prevailing in this Territory. Its responsibility  therefore  with respect to a just and final solution  remains complete.114.	In reiterating its unswerving devotion to the right to self-determination and independence of the people of Western Sahara  in recognizing that the struggle that it is waging is legitimate  in requesting Morocco to withdraw its troops from the Territory and in associating with the POLISARIO Front in the search for a just and final solution of the problem  the United Nations has taken upon itself the commitment to see to it that the process of the liberation of that Territory is completed.115.	Already recognized by at least 42 States Members of our Organization  the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic has asserted its existence by its military victories and diplomatic successes  which is striking confirmation of its attainment of the majority required by the Charter of the Organization of African Unity [OAU] for its accession to the continental organization.116.	The OAU outlined the principles for a just settlement of the question of Western Sahara and entrusted an ad hoc Committee  which has already completed its task  with working out the modalities for the exercise by the Sahraoui people of its right to self-determination and independence.117.	The United Nations  whose competence and responsibility in the matter of the decolonization of Western Sahara remain complete  is duty-bound to draw all the necessary consequences from the persistent refusal of Morocco to recognize that the Sahraoui people have a right to self-determination and independence.118.	This thirty-fifth session is an opportunity to engage in a mature and responsible evaluation of our collective experience within this universal body and to reflect on the ways in which we can strengthen its role and enhance its effectiveness.119.	If the primary advantage of our Organization is the fact that it exists  fidelity to the profession of faith of its peoples opened up by its Charter requires that we be ever more exacting with respect to our Organization. As strong as our belief in its ability to fulfil its mission of transforming international relations is our apprehension at seeing it con-fined to the minor function of a mere forum  where the aspirations of the greater number of States are confronting the obstacle of a private club of Powers.120.	The necessary changes in its structure should be made  without delay  as should the indispensable improvements in its working methods.121.	The legitimate anxiety to improve our Organization is justified not only by the fact that its foundations were laid in the absence of two thirds of the present membership  but also by the quest for a new impetus  the need for which is felt with ever greater acuteness. Such an undertaking requires a renewed vision on the part of all Member States  and in particular of those whose dominant position in the concert of nations is established by the Charter. That vision should not be limited by the defence of purely national interests. This should give way to an awareness of the contribution that all can make to building a common peace based on justice and freedom. There is an urgent need  therefore  to redress the imbalances between principles and actions in order to give meaning to the sovereign equality of all States  and therefore  to promote the collective responsibility with regard to the future of mankind.122.	The democratization of international relations pre-supposes  quite naturally  the democratization of the Organization itself. This stage in the life of the United Nations is not merely a moral imperative. It is also the guarantee of a greater scrupulousness and  through a true fellowship of nations  responsibility for the interests of the majority with-out ignoring those of the minority. The effectiveness of the Organization can only be increased by this process.123.	Because it was itself so long oppressed  Algeria has always considered it its sacred duty to give expression in this body to the cries of the oppressed of this world for the establishment of a new international order that would banish for ever colonialism  racial discrimination  the exploitation of man by man and the law of the strongest.124.	We are fully aware that the United Nations directs its action along these lines. But that impetus given it for two decades now by the ""forgotten people of history""  who  directly they became masters of their own destiny  turned to the Unite: Nations  has unfortunately been slowed down by the heavy burden of uncompleted work and imperfect achievements.125.	In a universe where the prodigious conquests of science have given man the means of succeeding in the preparation of a better future for coming generations as well as  alas  in driving mankind to its own destruction  the United Nations has more than ever the duty to meet the aspirations of the peoples.126.	Bearer of our hope because it shows the constancy of the universal accession to the ideals that we celebrate at each of our sessions  this session  which marks 35 years of existence of the United Nations  is an ideal moment for renewing our commitment to work resolutely for the well-being of all in an era of peace  justice and co-operation so as to open up a page of history that is at last human."
"43",2083,"ECU",35,1980,"ï»¿Mr. President  I congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. Your outstanding qualifications and your experience in the world Organization guarantee you full success in your eminent post.2.	We recall with praise the effective and objective performance of the outgoing President  Mr. Salim A. Salim of the United Republic of Tanzania  who so brilliantly marked the imposing presence on the international scene of the peoples of Africa and the new characteristics of the United Nations in the present world political setting.3.	We greet Zimbabwe as it enters upon independent life and as it joins the United Nations  following a strenuous struggle for liberation and the legal consecration of its birth as a free country by the democratic exercise of the popular vote.4.	We also welcome Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  of the Caribbean sub region  which has just joined the group of 30 Latin American countries within the nearly universal fold of the United Nations.5.	We welcome also the Latin American Economic System [SELA] as an observer  an item which already appears in the Assembly's agenda following the recommendation of the group of Latin American States.6.	Ecuador repeats that its international policy is guided by the scrupulous observance of permanent principles that are the basis of international law and of the United Nations system  such as those of non-intervention  self-determination of peoples  the legal equality of States  absolute respect for human rights  ideological pluralism  opposition to all forms of racial discrimination  colonialism and neo-colonialism  rejection of all aggression  non-validity of territorial conquest achieved through the threat or use of force  and the defence and strengthening of the system of peaceful settlement of disputes.7.	In accordance with these principles  the new Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ecuador  Mr. Alfonso Barrera  said  on taking up his duties:""As for relations with neighbouring countries and those of the sub region and the region  the Ministry for Foreign Affairs will make every effort to achieve the best understanding with them and to ensure that the handling of problems is conducted in a most cordial and frank manner  both with regard to the presentation of problems and the search for solutions  in a spirit of solidarity and of respect for our rights"".8.	In connexion with its Amazonian rights  which it will not renounce  and in consistency with its commitment to peace  Ecuador will continue to seek  vis-Ã -vis Peru  a just solution to its permanent claim.9.	The aforementioned principles govern Ecuador's position with regard to the problems of the international community  including  inter alia  those of Palestine and the whole Middle East  Cyprus  Afghanistan  Kampuchea  Namibia and that of the diplomatic hostages in Iran. Ecuador hopes that the appeal made yesterday by the President of the Security Council for a cessation of the military activities between Iraq and Iran will be heeded.10.	Within the United Nations  the universality of human rights should be demonstrated through impartial analysis and firm criticism of their enforcement in each and every country  whether it be a Member of the Organization or not. To censure in certain places what is met with silence in others merely weakens the impartiality of the United Nations system and will reduce its objectivity whenever it takes a stand in the future.11.	The Constitutional President of Ecuador  Jaime Roldds  in the implementation of his programme of government  firmly upholds the defence of human rights  at both the national and the international levels.12.	I have the honour to announce that  in our Andean sub region  the heads of State of Colombia  Venezuela and Ecuador and the Vice-President of Peru  representing that country's President  meeting this month in the city of Riobamba to commemorate the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the first Constitution of Ecuador  approved the Charter of Conduct that was proposed by President Rold6s and which  on this very subject  reads as follows:"" [It] reiterates the solemn commitment that respect for human  political  economic and social rights constitutes a fundamental rule of internal conduct for the States of the Andean Group  that the defence of those rights is an international obligation which is binding on States and that  therefore  joint action undertaken to protect such rights does not violate the principle of non-intervention"". Joining in the spirit of this declaration  the heads of State of Costa Rica and Panama and the personal representative of the President of the Government of Spain have also signed it.13.	Similarly  with the participation of outstanding political personalities and organizations of the region interested in the subject  this past month of August the Latin American Association for Human Rights was established  with headquarters in the capital of Ecuador.14.	The main pillar of human rights and the essence of the system of democratic government is freedom of expression  of information and of communication  which also involves the right to dissent. I am pleased to emphasize that Ecuador scrupulously respects these rights in its institutional life  as well as in its actions within the United Nations Committee on Information  where  in order to strengthen the world Organization  and in order to extend more effectively the economic  social and cultural spheres of action of the developing world  we have given our support to the new world information and communication order  while at the same time defending the widest use of the Spanish language and a better geographical balance in the composition of the Secretariat of the United Nations.15.	Furthermore  in line with its principle of respect for ideological pluralism  Ecuador has  from its clearly democratic position  widened the scope of its diplomatic and commercial relations in the course of the past year  establishing such relations with Albania  the People's Republic of China  Cyprus  the Congo  Cuba  Equatorial Guinea  Indonesia  Jordan  Liberia  Malta  Saint Lucia  Senegal  Thailand  Togo  Tunisia and Viet Nam.16.	My country  which maintains its unswerving commitment to the struggle against all discrimination and the need to extend rights to all social sectors  has been supporting the participation of women and youth in the responsibilities of development. The women of Ecuador  with the backing of the public authorities  are making constant progress towards the full exercise of their rights  not because of concessions of a paternalistic nature  but as an expression of maturity in the social evolution of our country. At the World Conference at Copenhagen  Ecuador took a stand at the highest level demanding maximum training facilities for women  in order truly to open up equal opportunities at all social levels and in order to eliminate discrimination as to race  sex  religion or political belief throughout the world.17.	Ecuador has faithfully supported the resolutions relating to disarmament and has pointed out the catastrophic economic and social consequences of the arms race. The expenditure on armaments could  if transferred to development  effectively generate a climate of trust and peace. Ecuador hopes that the progress recorded in General Assembly resolution 34/71  concerning the signing and ratification of Additional Protocol I to the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin will be matched by parallel initiatives for the denuclearization of other regions.18.	Ecuador has continued to protect its natural resources  which constitute a part of its sovereignty; it has consequently supported resolutions 2692 (XXV) and 3281 (XXIX) of the General Assembly  relative respectively to the declaration on the permanent sovereignty over natural resources of developing countries and the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States. Together with other equatorial States  it has also defended its rights over the corresponding segments of the geostationary orbit. The latter represents a sui generis and limited natural resource  which must serve the development aims of Ecuador as well as those of all developing countries in general. Ecuador will also continue to uphold its rights over the 200mile width of its territorial sea.19.	Ecuador attaches importance to its cultural possessions  which  as its artistic heritage  constitute its national roots and its contribution to universal civilization. In that regard  we shall continue to support  at the General Assembly and within UNESCO  international action for the restitution or return of cultural property to its country of origin.20.	In consistency with its status as a developing country and as a member of the Group of 77  Ecuador supports the firm and reasonable proposal put to the industrialized countries in a consensus of great political value since it resulted from a meeting of the minds of 120 countries  which represent two thirds of the world's population. That proposal  concerning both global negotiations and the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade  was made in the light of the imperative need to establish the new international economic order without which we would end up facing a regrettable confrontation and would not be able to guarantee permanent peace.21.	Turning a deaf ear to the voices of that majority of the human race and sowing difficulties with a view to bringing about a breakdown in the North South dialogue would be dangerous for the course of history and for universal coexistence. The presence of those 120 countries on the international scene is the most significant historical fact of our century in which peoples expect social justice and economic development in the national and international fields.22.	The world of justice that we seek must be found in the United Nations  in response to the inescapable challenge of history. The time has come to find new forms of understanding  which are likely to help to accelerate the establishment of the new order. The global negotiations are intended to treat  not only in a centralized and coherent manner but also simultaneously  the essential aspects of the areas which the developing countries have identified  while corresponding political will on the part of the industrialized countries is required for the conduct and success of those negotiations. It is encouraging to realize that practically all Member States now share the view of the Group of 77 and we trust that the support of the three countries that have not yet joined in the desired consensus will be forthcoming as early as possible.23.	We have to admit that the scale of development is also the scale of world poverty. We  the countries on that scale  are actively promoting measures and programmes in favour of the least developed countries. The United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries  which is to take place next year  will provide the opportunity to show in a concrete manner what the international community is capable of achieving  on the threshold of the Third United Nations Development Decade  in the process of reducing the deep structural problems which affect our sister countries in greater need.24.	In South South cooperation  the field of action is broadening  thanks to the eagerness of the developing countries to move forward in joint activity which can contribute to the attainment of collective self-reliance. Ecuador  like the other Latin American countries  is participating in several measures to promote economic and technical cooperation among developing countries. In the organization of its own economy  Ecuador has adopted a National Development Plan based on democracy involving the participation of all national sectors and on responsibility for progress  in economic development and social justice  which are expressions of dignity and freedom for the individual. Undeterred by the magnitude of the task  we give preferential attention to the rural sector  which is among those in greatest need within our social context.25.	Outstanding areas of action in the United Nations system are the operational activities in the transfer of technology for the promotion of development. Aware that the technological gap is the most serious of the disparities between rich and poor peoples  Ecuador  together with its sister nations in Latin America  has maintained that it is necessary that UNDP should preserve its original features of universality  the voluntary nature of its programming and financing and its access to and permanence in the system.26.	Our country has rejected the attempts to paralyse the efforts for development by trying to reduce the UNDP allocations in the intermediate levels of the system. But it has supported the earmarking of 80 per cent of UNDP resources in the next five-year cycle to countries having a less than $500 per capita income and opposed any trend of a neo colonialist nature left over from the old order  which would tend to exclude those who strive hardest  penalizing them for the meagre achievements of their progress and trying to make the Programme in some way reimbursable  whereas it should rather be an initial  however modest  example of the new international cooperation.27.	The decolonization process must be completed and the last traces of the wrongful and intolerable scars of the past  which the present has changed for the better  must be eliminated. The ignominy of racial discrimination  in all its forms  must disappear  and particularly the shameful policy of apartheid.28.	As a member of the Andean Group  Ecuador honours its responsibility with regard to economic cooperation among developing countries and the staunch defence of democratic principles  the continental promotion of which is one of the objectives of the sub region  as reaffirmed in the Lima Declaration  signed on 29 July this year and in the Charter of Conduct  signed on 11 September at Riobamba.29.	Ecuador reaffirms its faith in the United Nations and supports action aimed at strengthening it in the opinion of the world through education for international peace and understanding  which carries with it the obligation of Member States and of the agencies and the programmes of the system to defend the world Organization and the principles which inspire it  in order that it may fully discharge its responsibility and fulfil the hopes placed in it by all peoples."
"44",2128,"EGY",35,1980,"ï»¿I should like at the outset to convey to you  an able  creative and experienced diplomat representing a great country with recognized distinction  my delegation's heartfelt congratulations upon your unanimous election to the presidency of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. It attests to the increasing role played by your country in Europe and in the European community as a whole. We are confident that your country will thus contribute to a better future for mankind.32.	I should like also to pay a special tribute to Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim for his skilful leadership of the deliberations of the General Assembly at its thirty-fourth session. He represented not only his great country  the United Republic of Tanzania  but also the whole African continent  with admirable competence.33.	May I also take this opportunity to welcome  on behalf of Egypt  the admission of a sister African country  Zimbabwe  to the United Nations  an event of particular significance. Zimbabwe's success in its heroic struggle stands out as glowing testimony to the triumph of a just causeâ namely  the exercise of the inalienable right to self-determination  a right that  notwithstanding the viciousness of colonialism  foreign occupation and racism  will always triumph and assert itself in every corner of the world. The independence of Zimbabwe is a valid example of how perseverance in struggle  coupled with wisdom  can bring about a peaceful solution that satisfies the legitimate rights of peoples  while not losing sight of the practical considerations involved.34.	I should also like to extend Egypt's congratulations to the people and Government of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines on its admission to the United Nations.35.	In reviewing the present international situationâin particular  the events of the past year since we met at the thirty-fourth session of the Assemblyâthe delegation of Egypt would like to single out a number of major issues that pose serious threats to the world and which require particular attention and continuous sincere efforts so that we may be able to safeguard the very essence of international relations.36.	International economic relations  particularly in the light of the eleventh special session of the General Assembly  were given primary importance at the special session and at the second extraordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity [OAU] held at Lagos in April. However  we must intensify our efforts in order to establish a new international economic order based on justice and efficacy.37.	The eleventh special session was convened with a view to evaluating the present stage of international economic relations. It was hoped that agreement could be reached to begin serious global negotiations to resolve the acute economic crisis that confronts our contemporary world  in particular  the developing nations  which suffer from such serious problems as increased indebtedness and the obstacles which hinder socioeconomic development. There is no doubt that the special session of the General Assembly showed how much we need dialogue in order to resolve the difficulties inherent in present economic relations.38.	Whether in the African or international sphere  Egypt upholds the position espoused by the developing world that economic development is both a right and an obligation; it should be one of the basic results of rational and equitable relations. As a member of the Group of 77  Egypt realizes full well that its economic salvation must ultimately lie in self-reliance. Nevertheless Egypt realizes that certain complementary factors  such as economic cooperation among developing countries and interdependence between developed and developing countries  are essential. There exists  in fact  a wide area in which developing countries can satisfy one another's needs  thereby effecting change in the pattern of international economic relations.39.	In that connection  I wish to cite as an example Egypt's latest endeavour in establishing a fund for technical cooperation designed to launch a new era of multilateral cooperation with its sister African countries. That fund started operating following the seventeenth ordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU  which was held at Freetown from 1 to 4 July. While giving priority to enhancing its indigenous capabilities  Egypt at the same time considers that the role of the developed countries  particularly their political will  is essential in bringing about genuine solutions to the present economic crisis.40.	By dealing first with international economic relations and  in particular  the new international economic order  I have merely sought to emphasize the important role the economic situation plays in contemporary international life. I am  however  of the view that it is primarily political will that can bring about change in the present pattern of international economic relations. Political will derives from and is closely related to the existing international political order  which  in my view  requires our serious consideration.41.	The recent alarming developments that have challenged the Charter and the international order that we have subscribed to and adhered to since 1945 have not only created a perilous situation of political upheaval sometimes even bordering on chaos  but have also accentuated the disparities between the powerful and the weak countries. Moreover  such challenges have resulted in the continuance and exacerbation of racist policies and ideologies  the use of force in international relations  the acquisition of territory by war  the denial of legitimate national rightsâforemost among them the right to self-determinationâand last but not least the aggravation of the situation which has caused the efforts to achieve disarmament to become locked in a vicious circle.42.	The continuance of such policies and the situation resulting therefrom have had a negative impact on the conduct of international relations. The time has therefore come for us to intensify our efforts to put an end to the problems posed by such policies and to explore means of satisfying the requirements of the international community and therefore the interests of the peoples and nations.43.	Suffice it to mention that  although the Charter has existed for over 35 years and despite the purposes and principles embodied therein  the Palestinian people have not been spared the yoke of occupation and the agony of the denial of their rights; the invasion of Afghanistan has not been prevented and the people of southern Africa have not been protected against the evils of occupation  racism and apartheid. It is relevant to note that full-scale war has been avoided thus far not as a result of respect for the Charter of the United Nations and its purposes and principles but rather as a result of the existence of a balance of nuclear deterrence. If this balance were disturbed or if development drastically altered the status quo  the world could be threatened by a nuclear holocaust.44.	Unfortunately  the use of force in international relations has recently emerged once again  to resume a prominent place in the conduct of contemporary international relations. If the international community does not take a firm stand on this issue  the events that have taken place in Afghanistan could be the precursor of similar happenings elsewhere in the world  and in particular in the third world. By taking such a stand  the peoples and nations of the third world can defend themselves against a massive invasion similar to that to which Afghanistan has fallen prey.45.	Events in Kampuchea are a further manifestation of recourse to the use of force in international relations. Regardless of the excesses attributed to one regime or another in that country  no justification of military intervention and external interference to impose a certain regime on a people is acceptable.46.	I should like also to refer to what is taking place in southern Lebanon  where Israel continues its armed attacks on the people of that sister country. Its policies constitute a grave threat to the security of the region and a serious obstacle to peace.47.	The policies of the Government of South Africa  whether in Namibia or in South Africa itself  and South Africa's recurrent attacks on Angola bear witness to the use of force for the purpose of the subjugation of a people.48.	The use of force has proliferated in such a way that it has now come to constitute a definite pattern of conduct in interstate relations  a fact attested to by recent conflicts between Iran and Iraq and between Morocco and Algeria.49.	In this connection  we wish to emphasize the importance of adhering to the principles on which the United Nations is based and implementing the United Nations resolutions on the question of Korea so that the legitimate aspirations of the Korean people may be realized.50.	Another most disturbing phenomenon  parallel to the use of force  that undermines the fabric of international relations is subversionâthe flimsy pretext of an invitation to foreign troops  inciting armed conflicts  and the intensification of the arms race for the narrow benefits of the armaments manufacturers and merchants. In various parts of Africa we see attempts at foreign intervention  which we deplore regardless of its origin. It is not our intention  however  to confine ourselves merely to condemnation but rather to focus attention on the dangers that surround the international situation.51.	After 35 years of a unique international experiment  the time is ripe to undertake an objective appraisal of the existing political order and  in particular  of the role of the existing international machinery. Accordingly  the Government of Egypt will in the near future propose the convening of a special session of the General Assembly to take up this whole matter.52.	In making that proposal we are not forgetting that progress towards international detente  which is of such importance  is halted because there is no firm foundation on which to build. Detente must apply to all countries so that the aspirations of all the peoples of the world may be realized and their rights guaranteed; it should not be for the benefit of the two superpowers alone.53.	In this connection  I would call upon the countries of Asia  Africa and Latin America to initiate a dialogue on the present international situation. The timing of this initiative is all the more appropriate in that it coincides with the twenty fifth anniversary of the Bandung Conference  which called for the end of colonialism and was therefore a milestone in the development of the international order. May the memory of Bandung inspire this group of nations to agree on a common position for the third world in preparation for the proposed special session and in order to protect coming generations from the ordeals of an uncertain future. It is  after all  the responsibility of those peoples to unite in the defence of their sovereignty and freedom in the face of the dangers confronting the world today.54.	We call for political interdependence  economic cooperation  recognition of the need to establish justice on the basis of sovereign equality in international relations and for detente not to be pursued to the detriment of the third world. We solemnly urge that the renewed strategic conflict should not be carried out at the expense of small countries and the aspirations of their peoples.55.	This brings me to the question of the polarization in the present international situation. The increasing competition between the superpowers brings the threat of a new cold war  which would consolidate the policy of occupation and sacrifice the interests of the peoples to those of the world strategists.56.	In the Middle East we suffer from a volatile situation resulting from dangerous strategic rivalry which day by day comes clearly and aggressively closer. In the Arabian Gulf looming external threats are endangering the freedom and sovereignty of the Arab people in the region. By such threats I do not mean the reported threat to the oil wells  for in Egypt we espouse a different approach based on our keen interest in safeguarding the integrity  rights and riches of the Arab nation. From this rostrum I declare most solemnly that Egypt is willing and able to carry out its historic role and shoulder its responsibility for safeguarding the sovereignty of the Arab people in the Gulf in accordance with their wishes.57.	In this regard  we are following with the utmost concern and dismay the ongoing war between Iran and Iraq. This outbreak of armed hostilities not only adds a new dimension to the already precarious situation in the Middle East  but has resulted in much bloodshed and destruction in two neighbour countries to which Egypt is bound by history and the common heritage of Islam.58.	The situation in the area is fraught with inherent danger  compounded by clear external strategic ambitions detrimental to the interests of its people. We therefore urge self-restraint and call for collective action to bring about a climate conducive to the resolution of the problems that resulted in the present conflict that would take into account the necessity of bringing the bloodshed to an end and safeguarding the stability of the region.59.	As a littoral State of the Mediterranean Sea  Egypt is closely following  in conjunction with efforts undertaken within the context of European security  the effects of the serious international developments on the security of the States in the region. Egypt therefore urges that at the second review session of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe  to be held at Madrid  a greater role be accorded to the non-European Mediterranean States so that those States may present and be able to discuss their security problems  thereby protecting their legitimate interests in the face of the ongoing rivalries and in order that no international agreements should be concluded without their active participation.60.	The issues of polarization and the stagnation of detente lead us perforce to the role of the nonaligned movement in the relaxation of global tension and safeguarding the interests of the people of the third world. Egypt  as one of the founding members of the movement and a pioneer in projecting  elaborating and developing its principles and underlying concepts  is determined to strengthen and bolster the movement through active and responsible participation. The rapid international developments  the heightened international tension and the challenges that confront non-alignment necessitate joint and sincere efforts by all its members.61.	The nonaligned movement was established to secure the freedom and independence of States at a time when the cold war and the rivalry between major Powers dominated the international scene. The movement is now called upon to pursue its goals without distraction and to perform an increasingly more decisive role in defending mankind against the spectre of polarization.62.	Unfortunately  at present the nonaligned movement is the target of vicious and sinister attemptsâoblivious either to the genuine interests of the movement as a whole or even to its possible extinctionâto divert it from its true and original path and to inject alien concepts capable of turning the movement into a weapon to be exploited by a superpower. Such attempts cannot but undermine the basis of the movement and wipe away its accomplishments realized through many years of struggle in defending freedoms and safeguarding the security and sovereignty of the peoples and countries of the third world.63.	The nonaligned movement was conceived and has been developed at Belgrade  Cairo  Lusaka  Algiers and Colombo as a movement that embodies great and lofty ideals. Nonalignment Us for peaceful coexistence  the realization of justice a peace  intensification of cooperation among peoples  an end to interference in the affairs of States and respect for human rights. In essence  the movement was designed to protect nations against recourse to force and the evils of polarization. It is on this premise that we cannot tolerate the manoeuvres of certain forces from within the movement to transform it into a tool of a certain superpower  thereby defeating the very purpose of its existence.64.	We did not establish the nonaligned movement so that it might be exploited by either of the rival blocs or end up as part of the system of competing political alliances  or for that matter as an appendage to a particular military pact. Rather  we established that movement as a sound moral and spiritual force to play a positive and effective role in international affairs. On behalf of Egypt  I declare that we shall resist with all vigour the destructive roles that countries play within the movement. The nonaligned movement will not be permitted to be a tool in the hands of any blocâI emphasize ""any bloc"". It will continue to be a vigorous and free force. Whoever aspires to lead the movement  or merely to assume its leadership  not only should possess the political skills and moral values to prevent him from being a puppet of either superpower but also should retain his intellectual independence and his political and economic freedom.65.	The time has come for the nonaligned movement to resist sliding into the abyss of polarization and to confront the negative forces that seek to push it into the labyrinth of regional conflict and use it for settling petty accounts or serving ambitions to leadership  and should energetically pursue its genuine goals. The movement should overcome attempts to destroy it from within and safeguard its existence. Its creation should be considered as a landmark amongst the greatest political developments that have effectively contributed to peace and progress in the last two decades.66.	I should like now to turn to one of the most important fields of international activity  namely  disarmament. The continuation of the present arms race  whether in the conventional or nuclear sense  poses grave dangers for both the present and the future. It is a foregone conclusion that the exacerbation of the arms race  in particular in the nuclear field  in the present areas of potential conflict and the escalation of strategic rivalry enhance the possibilities of global war.67.	Nuclear disarmament  because of its implications for mankind  should be accorded the greatest priority. Therefore  during the Second Disarmament Decade the utmost attention should be given to arresting the qualitative development of nuclear weapons  ceasing the production of fissionable materials for military purposes  preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and destroying stockpiles of such weapons. In this connection  we call for a collective commitment to the goals and objectives of the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. By such a commitment the nuclear weapon States would discharge their obligations to undertake accelerated measures for nuclear disarmament and cooperate with the non-nuclear weapon States in the field of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes  while the latter fulfilled their obligations under that Treaty.68.	The position of the nuclear States at the second Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  in refusing to take positive steps towards nuclear disarmament made it imperative for the nonaligned movement to respond by requesting firm guarantees for the security of the nonnuclear weapon States and to reject the restrictions imposed by some nuclear fuel exporters  restrictions that have impeded the international transfer of nuclear technology for the benefit of the development of the countries of the third world.69.	In this context we should also like to emphasize the importance of creating nuclear weapon free zones. To complement the efforts undertaken to that end in Latin America  where a treaty is in force  and in Africa  whose leaders  with the support of the United Nations  have declared it a nuclear free zone  Egypt strongly urges the adoption of practical and effective measures for the establishment of a nuclear weapon free zone in the Middle East.70.	Effective international supervision and an unambiguous legally binding commitment by the States of the region to respect the provisions of the Non-proliferation Treaty under international supervision and control and international safeguards under the auspices of IAEA are the only guarantees against a nuclear arms race in the areaâa race which  if not arrested in good time  may negatively affect the chances of realizing a comprehensive  just and lasting peace and stability in the area.71.	Nuclear technology is no longer the monopoly of some. Egypt  a country that has produced a substantial crop of nuclear scientists  will work towards saving the Middle East from the perils of nuclear destruction. In this regard  Egypt will submit to the First Committee a draft resolution which we hope will continue to command the unanimous support similar resolutions have enjoyed during the past six sessions.72.	Egypt would also like to declare  in the clearest terms  its total support for the creation of a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean. Such a zone should be created only after a careful and integrated study of the situation in central and west Asia  so that we may avoid the strategic rivalry we are now witnessing in the waters and shores of that area. We are fully aware of the implications of such developments. Our primary concern is the interest of the peoples and States of the region  their independence and their nonalignment and with safeguarding them from hegemony and domination and keeping them out of the arena of rivalry and conflict. It is therefore our hope that the Conference on the Indian Ocean  which is expected to take place at Colombo in 1981  will result in agreement to safeguard the interests of the region.73.	I have dealt with the major problems that face the world in its quest for peace. I shall now deal with the problems of southern Africa and Palestine  problems that continue to pose serious dangers that by far transcend the confines of their respective regions and thereby endanger international peace and security.74.	The situation in southern Africa will continue to be explosive as long as the racist regime in South Africa persists in its vicious policy of apartheid  a policy doomed to failure. The racist policies of the Government of South Africa must be totally eradicated so that an acceptable and humane order may emerge.75.	On the same basis  the situation in Namibia should not be permitted to continue. The obstacles South Africa scatters in the way of the implementation of the United Nations plan make it imperative to employ the stern and effective measures called for in the Charter so as to force that country to comply with the relevant United Nations resolutions. Egypt's position in this regard is a matter of principle: it is total support for the Namibian people in their struggle for self-determination and independence. On the basis of this position of principle  Egypt strongly deplores the request made by the Government of South Africa to the Secretary General on 13 May for the United Nations to withdraw its recognition of the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO]. Egypt views this request as a useless effort by South Africa to disregard reality in a futile attempt to stop the wheel of history.76.	The question of Palestine was considered by the General Assembly only a few weeks ago at the seventh emergency special session. At that session an international consensus was vividly manifested in support of the national legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. A just resolution of this problem is urgently required.77.	The problem of Palestine  more than any other problem  has suffered over the past quarter of a century from international indifference. It was only after the Ramadan October 1973 war  and as a direct consequence of it  that definite and effective movement on the road towards a peaceful settlement of this problem occurred.78.	Notwithstanding the unanimous support on the part of the international community  obstacles continue to obstruct the right of the Palestinians to self-determination. On the other hand  attempts persist to drown meaningful efforts in a sea of rhetoric. As a result of these attempts and in spite of the principles enshrined in the Charter and the various resolutions of the United Nations on this question  the Palestinian people continue to be deprived of their right""  to suffer under the yoke of oppression and the agony of displacement and foreign occupation  without a glimmer of hope of the feasibility of their freedom and the exercise of their inalienable and legitimate right to self-determination without foreign interference on their own land.79.	Egypt considers the Palestinian question an Egyptian  Arab and African problemâa problem that relates to and affects the third world as a whole. Consequently  Egypt has embarked on the solution of this problem  first by shattering the status quo which some have tried to perpetuate and then by ushering in a transitional period which could be utilized as a preparatory phase for a comprehensive negotiation of the final settlement in which the Palestinian people will participate on an equal footing with the other concerned parties.80.	This has been the rationale of the successive Egyptian initiatives over the past 13 years  starting with the acceptance of Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  then the welcoming of and cooperation with the Jarring mission  the war of attrition  the acceptance of the Rogers plan of 1970  the mission of the African Wise Men in 1971  the glorious October war  President Sadat's initiative in November 1977 and the signing of the Camp David accords.81.	In all its endeavours  Egypt has never overlooked or ignored the fundamental premises laid down by the international community in the United Nations  the OAU and the nonaligned movement for a settlement of the Palestinian problem. The essence is always the rights of the Palestinians to self-determination and return.82.	On these fundamental premises there can be no compromise. No one has the right to make concessions in their regard for they constitute the only real guarantee for achieving a just peace  as well as being the core of the peaceful settlement.83.	It is universally recognized that the Palestinian problem is a complex one  comprising many intricate and intertwined components. All efforts for its resolution must therefore focus  first of all  on terminating the foreign occupation of Palestinian territories in the West Bank  Arab Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip  and the restoration of the inalienable and legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. Egypt's signing of the Camp David accords is a step in that direction. The Camp David accords represent a concrete step towards the implementation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  a step that would usher in a transitional arrangement in preparation for the exercise of self-determination by the Palestinian people. The accords are also designed to foster Palestinian Israeli coexistence. Once Israel respects the rule of international law and legitimacy  the two peoples can appreciate the mutual advantages of peaceful coexistence and cooperation in the future. When we embarked on the negotiations to establish the transitional arrangements  we had much hope that despite the vilification campaign  it would be possible to proceed to alleviate the plight of the Palestinian people in the occupied territories and to enable them to exercise full authority over their territory and later participate on an equal footing with the Israeli Government in negotiations aimed at determining the present as well as the future. However  Israel's vacillation and obstructionism  together with its settlements policy and the illegal measures it is undertaking in Jerusalem  have all  more than once  resulted in stagnation and stalemate. Egypt  in spite of being the first to condemn such Israeli policies  still believes that an opportunity exists to achieve tangible progress towards a comprehensive settlement.84.	To surmount the obstacles posed by Israel's procrastination in the negotiations and its policies in the occupied territories  obstacles that impede any meaningful movement towards the interim objectives stipulated in the Camp David accords  namely  the establishment of full autonomy in the West Bank  including Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip  for a period not exceeding five years  President Sadat proposed the convening of a summit meeting with the President of the United States and the Prime Minister of Israel after the United States presidential elections. The purpose of the summit is to discuss these obstacles with a view to resolving them and thereby paving the way towards the establishment of the interim period in which the Israeli military Government will be replaced by a Palestinian authority  and the Israeli armed forces will commence their withdrawal from the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.85.	Egypt's perseverance in resolving the Palestinian problem within a practical and effective framework  away from irresponsible rhetoric  stems from its conviction that security  peace and stability in. the Middle East hinge upon solution of the Palestinian problem. Egypt in no way suggests that it monopolize the settlement of this problem but  on the contrary  it encourages all efforts towards that end. We encourage and support the European initiative  a sentiment transmitted to Mr. Thorn  the Chairman of the European fact-finding mission  on his recent visit to Cairo. Equally  we support the ideas advanced by the Romanian President  Mr. Ceausescu  which call for the convening of an international conference  a proposal previously put forward by the Secretary General  Mr. Waldheim. I take this opportunity to pay a special tribute to him for his tireless efforts and dedication to enhance the cause of peace. Egypt's Vice President  Mr. Mubarak  has only recently concluded a tour of Europe in which he presented Egypt's position and expressed its total support for any initiatives that might contribute towards a just settlement of the Palestinian problem.86.	Meanwhile  it is relevant to recall that since the efforts of the African Wise Men in the early 1970s  the question of Palestine  since it is also an African problem based on the unity of struggle for liberation and independence  has been and continues to be the subject of intensive contacts among African leaders.87.	It is necessary to state in the clearest terms that all these initiatives  ideas and proposals should take two basic considerations into account  namely  completing the efforts made and those to be made for the peaceful settlement of the problem; and basing those efforts on the following principles: first  the legitimate and inalienable right of the Palestinian people to exercise their right to self-determination without external interference; in addition  the recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to establish their own independent State in Palestine as an undisputed right  equal to that of all peoples  to independence; secondly  any settlement should provide for the implementation of all the principles embodied in Security Council resolutions  and in particular resolution 242 (1967)  which stipulates the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force and respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States in the region; thirdly  the right and the obligation of the Palestinian people to participate in all the stages of negotiations leading to a just settlement; fourthly  the rejection of all the Israeli measures which are contrary to international law  the Charter and relevant resolutions of the United Nations and the binding international conventions  in particular those measures relative to the building of settlements in occupied territories; fifthly  the security of the area is indivisible and therefore does not relate to Israel alone; genuine security cannot be realized for one party at the expense of the security and rights of the others; and sixthly  the necessity that Israel immediately undertake certain confidence building measures to bring about a climate of understanding and coexistence between the Palestinian and Israeli peoples  a climate that would  on the basis of international legitimacy  pave the way towards friendly relations between the two peoples in the future.88.	As stated by President Sadat  if the question of Palestine is at the centre of the Middle East conflict  Jerusalem is the essence of it. It has become absolutely clear that any attempt on the legal status of Jerusalem will be rejected and any bilateral attempt to change it will be denounced and rejected by world consensus. Security Council resolution 478 (1980) on the inadmissibility of the measures taken by Israel affecting the status of the City of Jerusalem  states that those measures are null and void. The resolution best represents the unanimous opinion of the world on the subject. We in Egypt are strongly opposed to any measure taken by Israel to integrate Jerusalem and express our gratitude to the countries which have withdrawn their embassies from Jerusalem as a sign of opposition to Israel's policy and in compliance with that resolution. We call upon all States to affirm the inadmissibility of any measures taken by Israel to dominate Jerusalem or likely to strengthen its claim thereto.89.	Egypt has chosen the path of peace. Egypt will spare no effort in its quest for peace because it believes in the lofty principles and objectives of the United Nations and the principles of nonalignment  for which it has struggled and will continue to struggle until they have become the established norms for the majority of nations.90.	Egypt's foreign policy should be seen as a manifestation of the historical role it has played since the dawn of civilization.91.	Egypt will continue  together with other peace-loving nations  to strive for the elimination of the spectre of war  the development of friendly relations and fruitful cooperation among nations in order that an international order with justice and peace may prevail."
"45",2198,"ESP",35,1980,"ï»¿Mr. President  I should like first of all to express my satisfaction at your election to the presidency of this thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. At the same time  I should like to affirm  through you  my friendship and respect for the Federal Republic of Germany and for the noble  striving German people. Despite the fact that their histories have been different  our peoples have been able to understand one another and maintain the bridges between them in the vital knowledge that friendship and comprehension are the necessary concomitants of peace and freedom.104.	I should like to convey to our Secretary General my thanks for his dedication and skill in carrying out his important and delicate tasks  guided as he always is by what will best serve the Organization and enhance understanding among nations.105.	I am pleased to welcome the representatives of Zimbabwe  whose people recently achieved their independence  which Spain defended unreservedly and constantly. Zimbabwe's presence as an independent and sovereign State in the United Nations is an example of how pending problems of decolonization can be resolved: with an up-to-date understanding of history  with decisiveness and without premature slackening in the negotiations.106.	Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  a country whose deepest roots unite it with the great family of Ibero-American peoples  is the most recent Member of the United Nations  and I welcome it to this Assembly and transmit to its Government and people Spain's wish to strengthen the relations of friendship and cooperation between our countries.107.	It is clear that we are going through a time of profound crisis. The ""Development Decades""ânow several in numberâthe successive ""International Strategies"" adopted thus far in that connection  the ""Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States"" and the special sessions of the General Assembly have not been able to balance an economic order which is in increasing disequilibrium. World tensions and confrontation between opposing global strategies have multiplied the points of conflict. The technological revolution runs the risk of creating disturbing burdens  ignoring  in its inexorable advance  the very preservation of the ecosystem. Never in recent years have we found ourselves in such serious situations in all areas. It is clear that we must correct our bearings. We must change the codes of international conduct  balance dissuasion with detente  foster effective arms control  seek a real renewal of structures and achieve new frontiers in the protection of human rights.108.	The magnitude of the disorder  however  must not paralyse us or cause a petrified pessimism. Indolence and insensibility  according to a Spanish classic  can never be regarded as political subtlety  but rather as ""detestable negligence"" to which must be opposed  in the words of that classic  the intention to ""remedy injustices"". At this time the only sensible course is that of international solidarity  which would mobilize endeavours and adjust corrective mechanisms.109.	Spain  which because of its geography  its history and its culture belongs to the Western world  maintains close solidarity with the West in defence of the values and principles held by some nations  which consider freedom  justice and a democratic  pluralistic form of Government to be the very foundation of their coexistenceâa foundation which has recently been recovered in our country.110.	It is up to Spain and only Spain  in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations  the Helsinki Final Act and its own constitutional rules  to decide on the future course of that solidarity. Among other things it will also include the search for detente  which we regard as essential to overcome the present difficulties in international relations. In this connexion the second review session of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe  whose preparations have just begun at Madrid  offers an opportunity that cannot be overlooked to create conditions making it possible to re-establish confidence and make progress towards dialogue  cooperation and better understanding between East and West.111.	We are establishing a policy of cooperation with Europe and of participation in its institutions because we believe in the values  the democratic political systems and the historical role of Europe  of which we have always been and continue to be irrevocably a part. No one claims that our particular historical traits have set us apart from the great European current. On the contrary  as a liberal historian said: ""Our history is not 'uncommon' or 'particular'; the historical tragedies of Spain are an integral part of the historical tragedy of Europe"". Hence we are ready to make an enthusiastic effort in the collective task of building the unity of Europe through full partnership in the Communities.112.	As has recently been said in Luxembourg by His Majesty King Juan Carlos I:""A new impetus must be given to the Communities in order to broaden their geographical area  enriching them with some of the most fruitful and original contributions of European culture and making possible the building of a stronger and more balanced Europe  which would be in a position to make an effective contribution to the well-being of all its peoples  the consolidation of all its democratic systems and the cause of peace.""113.	Finally  looking to the future we have to meet the political challenge of broadening the Communities. Only thus can Europe's ideals prevail against selfish interests.114.	This European and Western aspect of our foreign policy is enriched by and finds its full expression in our relations with the peoples of Ibero-America  to which so many deep links unite us. It is precisely in the dialogue between Europe and Ibero-America that Spain can carry out an important task: that of contributing to make Europe more and more responsive to Ibero-America as it is. Its problems  its concerns  its expectations.115.	We are witnessing a process of the affirmation and awakening of the Ibero-American world whose voice  above tension and undeniable divisions  is being heard with growing authority and firmness in international bodies  and which is aware of its increasingly relevant role in the events of our time. And that is not only because of its strategically important geographical location and demographic potential  its abundance of raw materials and energy resources. Above all  Ibero-America finds its strength and its future development in the enormous vitality of its peoples and the strength of their cultural values  which we share as our own.116.	Spain  a full member of ECLA and taking an active part in the work of the Andean Group   in which it has observer status  is in full solidarity with the currents of integration that are gaining strength in Ibero-America. All rhetoric apart  my country is seeking in this connexion the development of specific kinds of cooperation so as to serve the interests of our peoples.117.	It is from that position of solidarity  to which I have referred  that we must with an open mind tackle the problems affecting peace and security  by renewing political approaches and restoring negotiating machinery capable of facilitating the solution of conflicts for which  as with regard to the problem of the Middle East and the many tensions affecting the Mediterranean  satisfactory solutions are far from having been conceived or worked out.118.	The Middle East  the tense and vital nerve centre of ever impending catastrophe  is the inevitable and natural concern of a country such as Spain  which is so closely linked to the Arab peoples and situated at the westernmost point of the Mediterranean.119.	The continuing policy of illegal settlements  the adoption of the ""Basic Law"" on Jerusalem  the repetition of acts of aggression against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon and other events increasing tension in that area give rise to concern and require that the vicious circle of lack of understanding and intolerance be broken  if we wish to avoid new confrontations of unforeseeable consequences. The time for action has come.120.	The Spanish Government considers it necessary for a further attempt to be made to open the door to a solution. Spain will spare no effort to that end.121.	The ultimate goal we must espouse can be none other than peace in the region. It must be a just peace; a comprehensive peace taking account of the interests of all concerned and bringing a definitive solution of the historical tragedy of the Palestinian people by recognizing and implementing its national legitimate rights  including the right to a homeland: not an imposed peace  which would simply be war postponed; finally  a peace without winners or losers  making cooperation between Israel and its Arab neighbours possible  since their peaceful coexistence is the key to development in an area that has traditionally been the prey of foreign appetites and the play of foreign interests.122.	To attain that peace  the Spanish Government believes that it is necessary to arrive at a new political formula whose centrepiece must be mutual recognition by Israel and the PLO  as the parties directly concerned in the conflict  and the need for both to give up their extremist goals and agree to negotiate. One cannot try to wipe Israel and its people from the map of the Middle East  for no one can deny them the right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries; but there can be no basis for including within those boundaries the annexed Arab territories occupied by force in 1967. Neither can the Palestinian people be disregarded or left out of any negotiation on the substance of the conflict. One cannot deny a people its rights  leaving it no course other than despair  because that path will only lead to violence and chaos  for which we would all be responsible and whose victims we would all become  if we did not break the impasse of the conflict. Neither the United Nations nor the great Powers can substitute rhetoric for action and  at the same time  live with conscience undisturbed.123.	Beyond that area  Spain wishes to increase cooperation with the other countries of Asia and to make clear  in speaking of this vast geographical region that it is concerned at the serious situation in the heart of that continent. Indeed  the situation in Afghanistan is a source of deep preoccupation for the Spanish Government because the fundamental rights of that Islamic and nonaligned country have been seriously violated. It has been said many times from this rostrum that detente is global and indivisible and  hence  I believe it necessary once again to recall our unequivocal position on this matter.124.	Just as detente is indivisible  so respect for the basic rules of international law is the minimum prerequisite of any peace strategy. Hence  in mentioning this area  it also appears necessary to recall the attitude of the Spanish Government with regard to the taking of hostages in general and in embassies in particular  specifically in Iran.125.	Detente and the basic principles of international law are also being trampled underfoot in the present situation in Kampuchea.126.	Spain cannot view with indifference the fact that the Mediterranean  which has traditionally been a vehicle of culture and prosperity and the cradle of civilizations  has today become a centre of rivalry and the scene of conflict and tension threatening the security and affecting the well-being of its coastal States.127.	In this regard we view with hope the discreet and constant efforts of the Secretary General to have the inter communal talks resumed in Cyprus. We hope that through those talks  in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations  a negotiated solution can be achieved ensuring the territorial integrity and political independence of Cyprus and the peaceful coexistence of its two communities.128.	But throughout the Mediterranean area there is still a long way to go  not only to deepen and broaden cooperation among the coastal States but also to give a new dimension to our approach to the problem of security which  as stated in the Helsinki Final Act  is closely linked to the security of Europe.129.	Cooperation  concerted action for development and security are the ingredients of a global framework  which we have to put together and implement.130.	The repetition of stereotypes  like that of aphorisms  simply increases incredulity. But it is a verifiable and visible fact that Spain is the European country closest to the African continent. Spain's foreign policy will give greater emphasis to this fact and place it in a proper perspective.131.	Spain's interest in Africa is nothing new. The line of Afro-Mediterranean countries to which we have always been linked by close neighbourhood and common history makes this clear. To strengthen Spanish cooperation with Africa south of the Sahara is one objective of my country's present foreign policy. We have to find new formulas for such cooperation and give special attention to those States where our industry  technology and trade can best link up with the aims of those countries  with scrupulous respect for their sovereignty and their own identity. The most important symbol of that interest is to be found in recent visits by Their Majesties  the King and Queen of Spain  to several friendly African countries south of the Sahara.132.	In the history of Spain there is one particular African country in which our language has put down roots and grown. The Republic of Equatorial Guinea is an African nation which speaks Spanish. Thus it is not strange that our collaboration is a close one and that  after the years of turbulenceâtoday forgottenâour reconciliation has been rapid and intense. Spain will continue to help the people and Government of Equatorial Guinea as it has been doingâas long as the people and Government of that nation so desire. On the other hand  I must place special emphasis on the fact that the Spanish Government will maintain this cordial relationship without interfering in any way and with the strictest respect for the independence and sovereignty of that country.133.	Spain also follows with interest and concern existing tensions in southern Africa. The continued occupation by South Africa of the Territory of Namibia  contrary to the resolutions of the United Nations  is a persistent element of conflict in the entire region. We consider that that illegal occupation must be brought to an end as quickly as possible  and therefore we have supported the most recent resolutions reaffirming the right of the Namibian people to self-determination  freedom and independence  and the territorial integrity of a united Namibia. We are also concerned at the continuance of the policy of apartheid and territorial segregation by South Africa  which gravely affects the human rights situation and is a challenge to the international community.134.	The Spanish Government is also following closely the development of the situation in the Maghreb  with whose peoples Europe is closely linked because of geographical proximity and strong historical  cultural and human ties. We wish to maintain and develop those close relationships of friendship with all the Maghreb peoples  based on principles of balance  cooperation and good neighbourliness  and we continue to be ready to collaborate actively and disinterestedly in any endeavours to secure detente and peace in the region.135.	The Spanish Government wants to see an end to violence and suffering in the Western Sahara and hopes that that problem will find a just solution based on respect for the principles and resolutions of this Organization and of the136.	This is  and will continue to be  our position on a dispute in which Spain ceased to be a party when it irrevocably and definitively terminated its responsibilities as administering Power of the Territory of Western Sahara. Indeed  on 26 February 1976 Spain terminated its presence in the Territory and the administrative role that it had carried out there. The Spanish Government at that time communicated this fact officially to this Organization  and has made it clear ever since to all the parties. Spain seeks no advantage for itself or for anyone; it seeks peace  stability and harmonization of the legitimate interests involved. Neither appeals nor pressure  whatever form the latter may take  will divert us from our unswerving  consistent line. We are sure that this is the only way in which Spain can help in achieving peace: by absolute impartiality in dealing with the parties to the conflict and resolute adherence to our principles. I have mentioned pressure  and I cannot but protest most energetically at the violence which is being directed against innocent citizens of my country who  contrary to international law and with utter contempt for human rights  are being used as hostages.137.	When the Charter of the United Nations was signed at San Francisco 35 years ago  no provision was made for the prompt liquidation of colonial empires. On the contrary  machinery for international trusteeship was established through the trusteeship administration system provided for in the Charter  bearing in mind that there were still territories which were not independent. But new nations developed  going beyond the political and legal system which  after the adoption of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV)âthe twentieth anniversary of which we shall celebrate this yearâhad become completely invalidated. The result has been the gigantic work of decolonization  which is one of the most notable achievements of the United Nations. But that work is not yet completed  because there are still colonial situations  such as that of Gibraltar.138.	The British and Spanish Governments made a preliminary step towards a settlement of that dispute when they adopted at Lisbon  last April  a joint declaration in which both parties undertook  in a spirit of friendship and in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations  to begin negotiations to solve the problem of Gibraltar. 139.	This will not be an easy task. What is important is the convergence of the political will to embark upon a course which has only one goal: the settlement of the dispute  so that Gibraltar  once again part of the Spanish fatherland  will never again be an obstacle between Spain and the United Kingdom.140.	The balance of terror is a negative concept which destroys real peace and coexistence among peoples and which has not been able to achieve the absence of war. Therefore  disarmament is still for us an unalterable objective. We must check the race to stockpile and develop nuclear weapons  which consumes incalculable skills and resources and injects suspicion and mistrust into the relations between the great Powers.141.	My country also considers it necessary to limit conventional weapons to the levels necessary for the preservation of a country's security and to that end we have made constructive proposals for the regulation of the fraudulent traffic in conventional weapons.142.	A few days ago there ended the eleventh special session of the General Assembly  devoted to the new International Development Strategy and to global negotiations. Thus it would be premature to make any evaluation of the results achieved. None the less  we should like to state our satisfaction at the consensus attained on the far-reaching subject of the new International Development Strategy  although we deeply regret that it was not possible to take account of the concerns of the industrialized developing countries which import energy  among which Spain figures.143.	As to the balance of what was achieved in the preparations for the global negotiations of 1981  I cannot but express our disappointment. When the Group of 77 put forward its proposal on global negotiations  Spain was the first Western country favourably to welcome that initiative  as it publicly proclaimed in this hall  reaffirming the traditional position of our country in favour of a North South dialogue  which would be institutionalized and ongoing  and the agenda for which would include the crucial subject of energy. However  despite the long and intense efforts made  we were unable to reach unanimous agreement on the way in which the negotiations would be conducted; nor did we deal with the way in which the agenda would be drawn up.144.	There was not the political will to break the vicious circle of rhetoric and demagoguery and to implement an effective plan which would make it possible to carry through the necessary changes in international economic and financial structures and make it possible to establish a new  more just and humane order which would ensure greater and more balanced economic and social development for all peoples. In a word  what was lacking was true solidarity in the planning and winning of the war against disease  ignorance and poverty.145.	The Spanish Government believes that the final basis of true peace can be found only in respect for and protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual. We have legal instruments which define those rights on the world and regional levels. But we need effective machinery for safeguard and protection because totalitarian regimes continue to exist  and new ones arise  under which men are persecuted or discriminated against because of their race  ideas or beliefs and because human rights include not only civil and political rights but also  as a harmonious and inseparable whole  economic  social and cultural rights.146.	This Organization must bring to bear its ideas and initiatives so that those rights can be guaranteed and effectively protected.147.	In the social field  one of the constant concerns of the Spanish Government continues to be the protection of the human rights of migrant workers and their families. We view with interest the work which the General Assembly is to undertake this year in drafting a convention on the effective protection of those rights.148.	With regard to progressively better training of women and their necessary legal equality with men  the Spanish Government took an active part in the World Conference of the United Nations Decade for Women: Equality  Development and Peace  held at Copenhagen from 14 to 30 July this year  in the course of which we signed the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.149.	All of us in this Organization must pursue in solidarity energetic action in the struggle against terrorism  which has declared an implacable war against freedom  democracy  the servants of law and order  and innocent  weak and defenceless people. No one can support terrorism. No one can support it because terrorism constitutes the ultimate form of totalitarian barbarity  which must be eradicated by us.150.	The rights of others are inseparable from our own rights. Terrorism therefore affects everyone because it attacks our own human status. Only with that understanding can we join hands in solidarity to do battle against terrorism and win.151.	Epilogues are often favoured occasions for platitudes  but I shall confine myself to reaffirming the confidence of Spain in the capacity of the United Nations to mobilize and unite and in its lofty potential for encouraging and alerting mankind. The United Nations carries out a function which is fundamental to survival. Spain intends to strengthen the Organization as far as it is able to do so  and to be attentive to its call.152.	This Organization came into being so that peoples of succeeding generations might be saved from war  domination  injustice and oppression. That calls for true solidarity  wisdom in action and tenacity in endeavour. It requires that we give up  in the words of one of the great contemporary Spanish poets  ""that second innocence which leads to not believing in anything"".153.	It is not opportunism on my part if today I mark the commitment of the renewed Spanish democracyâevoking the memory of one of its oldest inspirations  the knight of La Manchaâto righting wrongs; or  in the language of our times and our circumstances  to lending a hand in reducing intolerance  lessening tragedy  alleviating catastrophe and supporting the aspirations embodied in the Charter of the United Nations."
"46",2270,"ETH",35,1980,"ï»¿I should like  on behalf of the Ethiopian delegation  to congratulate Ambassador Wechmar on his unanimous election to the presidency of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. We are confident that  with his wide experience  he will effectively guide the important deliberations of this session to a positive and fruitful conclusion.84.	My delegation would also like to take this opportunity to convey  through him  to his predecessor Ambassador Salim Ahmed Salim  our profound admiration for his efficient and able guidance of the thirty-fourth session and the special sessions held this year85.	I wish also to pay a tribute to Mr. Kurt Waldheim  who  in the discharge of his responsibilities  continues to display tireless efforts to further the aims and purposes of our Organization.86.	It is with joy and pride that I welcome  on behalf of the Ethiopian delegation  the newly independent States of Zimbabwe and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines into the family of nations. Nothing could be more gratifying than to see among us here the delegation of the African State of Zimbabwe  symbolizing the triumph of a heroic people which went through a gruelling experience in their bitter and determined struggle for freedom and independence. We hail their resounding victory as our own  just as we hailed their arduous struggle as a common African struggle for freedom  equality  justice and social progress.87.	The banner of hope for freedom in southern Africa is now flying higher than ever before. With each passing day the noose around the neck of apartheid is getting increasingly tight. Nevertheless  obstinate as it is  the racist regime in Pretoria is not disposed to heed reason and abandon its repugnant practices easily. Futile attempts continue to be made by the architects of apartheid  in collusion with their imperialist collaborators  to perpetuate this vile and pernicious system. We have no doubt that  had it not been for the overt and covert political  economic  technological and militaryâincluding nuclearâcollaboration by well-known Western Governments and their transnational corporations  the criminal gang in Pretoria would have long ago been a thing of the past.88.	Despite such wide-ranging collaboration  the struggle of the people of South Africa and that of the Namibian people  under the leadership of their respective liberation movements  is gathering momentum. Ethiopia is convinced that Pretoria's obdurate resistance to the exercise by the Namibian people  under the leadership of their sole authentic and legitimate representative  SWAPO  of their rights to self-determination and independence  will only contribute to the further intensification of the determined armed struggle  which  in the case of Zimbabwe  is destined to be crowned with resounding victory.89.	This year  as we observe the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the historic Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  we strongly urge the Security Council to take action on enforcement measures against the South African regime  under Chapter VII of the Charter  with a view to ending the illegal occupation of Namibia.90.	With regard to Western Sahara  Ethiopia strongly believes that the OAU  which is already seized of the problem  should be given full support in its efforts to achieve a just solution within the framework of its relevant decisions and those of the United Nations.91.	The conspiracy to deny the people of Palestine the exercise of their inalienable rights and imperialist encouragement of the illegal occupation by Israel of Arab territories continue to pose a grave threat to international peace and security.92.	That the belligerence and intransigence of Israel have continuously increased is  indeed  amply demonstrated by the proliferation of new settlements in occupied Arab lands  culminating in the annexation of the eastern part of Jerusalem as part of the ""eternal capital"" of the State of Israel.93.	Ethiopia reiterates here its long-standing position that no just and durable peace can be achieved in the Middle East until Israel complies with the numerous relevant resolutions and decisions of the United Nations  including the resolution adopted at the seventh emergency special session of the General Assembly.94.	Ethiopia would like to reiterate that only the complete withdrawal of Israel from all Arab territories occupied since 1967 and the exercise by the Palestinian people of their inalienable right to self-determination and a homeland in Palestine will ensure durable peace in the region.95.	Similarly  Ethiopia supports the unity and territorial integrity of the non-aligned countries of Cyprus and Lebanon as well as the peaceful reunification of the Korean people.96.	We extend our solidarity to the peoples of Kampuchea  Laos and Viet Nam and fully support the joint formula advanced by them for the normalization of relations and the maintenance of peace and security in their region.97.	We reiterate our unreserved solidarity with the revolution of Afghanistan  aimed at demolishing an oppressive and archaic feudal system and replacing it by a new progressive order. We stand by the side of the Afghan people in their determined struggle to defend the gains of their revolution and preserve their sovereignty  territorial integrity and national independence.98.	The problem of economic growth and social development has both internal and external dimensions. We in Ethiopia are at this very moment striving to build a just and equitable system that will correspond to our actual needs and aspirations. Indeed  the fundamental structural changes we have been implementing ever since the onset of our revolution in 1974 have been aimed at effectively ensuring the basic human rights of the formerly downtrodden Ethiopian masses and raising their standard of living.99.	The Ethiopian people  having organized themselves effectively  are today exerting maximum efforts to bring about wide-ranging economic  social and cultural development. I am proud to say that we are encouraged by the concrete results attained so far in the sphere of economic and social development and in the all-out war we have declared against illiteracy. In the short span of less than two years  over 7 million Ethiopians have been enabled to read and write. It was  therefore  with modest satisfaction that Ethiopia accepted the UNESCO medal of merit for 1980 in the field of combating illiteracy. While our objective is completely to eradicate illiteracy from the face of Ethiopia within the next seven years  judging by our achievements so far  we have every hope of accomplishing the task well ahead of the deadlines we have set for ourselves.100.	The holding of the First Congress of the Commission for Organizing the Party of the Working People of Ethiopia and the official launching of its activities is a historic land-mark in the progress of the Ethiopian Revolution. In addition to the All-Ethiopia Peasants' Association and the All- Ethiopia Trades Union  which have been established at the national level in the past few years  the establishment of youth and women's associations has provided a firm and unshakeable foundation for our popular revolution.101.	Our objective to speed up the social and economic transformation of our country has  however  been impeded by incessant acts of aggression perpetrated against our country  which have unavoidably forced us to divert scarce resources from development projects to national defence. Furthermore  recurrent drought and other natural calamities have also severely affected our people.102.	Despite our best efforts  we have come to the conclusion that the reconstruction of a war-devastated economy and the repatriation and resettlement of refugees and war- displaced people are beyond our means. In this regard Ethiopia's needs and requirements have been assessed by various United Nations missions  whose reports have become documents of the United Nations.103.	Over and above its efforts at the national level  Ethiopia is widely co-operating with practically all of its neighbours. In this connection  I am happy to note that we have established mutually beneficial joint development projects with Kenya  Djibouti and the Sudan. Nevertheless  it remains a hard fact of life that  unless corresponding changes are made in international economic relations at the global level  not much appreciable headway can be made in transforming the internal structure of the vast majority of the developing countries.104.	The international monetary disorder  the deepening global recession  rampant inflation  severe unemployment  adherence to restrictive international trade policies  persistent problems of imbalance in international payments and - sluggish world economic growth are some of the symptoms of the state of economic affairs which characterize the external structure.105.	Moreover  a gloomy scenario in international economic relations was underlined by the failure of the eleventh special session of the General Assembly to reach agreement on a new global round of negotiations on which much hope had been pinned.106.	The economic and financial situation of the least developed countries has increasingly and dangerously been deteriorating  to the point where many of them face economic disruption and chaos. Most of them have  in fact  been kept out of the mainstream of international economic activities as a result of their structural handicaps and other serious limitations.107.	The grim situation of the least developed countries is further aggravated by the energy problem and by natural and man-made calamities. All these cast a dark shadow of peril and catastrophe over the future of a large portion of mankind. That is why we continue to insist on the restructuring of the existing unjust international economic order.108.	The year 1980 has been marked by a dangerous reversal of the process of detente  the escalation of tension  the revival of the cold war and an ever greater risk of nuclear confrontation. As the General Assembly is about to adopt a declaration on the second Disarmament Decade and launch preparations for the second special session devoted to dis-armament  to be held in 1982  the disquieting reality of the world today is that the arms race  particularly in the nuclear field  has continued unabated.109.	Ethiopia strongly supports the proposal made by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and strongly urges that the international community redouble its efforts to reduce the present level of global tension and to avert a nuclear catastrophe by taking concrete and urgent measures.110.	Currently  imperialism is deploying all types of sophisticated weapons systems in many parts of the world. The Indian Ocean has never before been so congested with warships  aircraft carriers  their escorts and assault troops. The Persian Gulf area  the Middle East region and the Red Sea have also become the depots of the deadly weapons of imperialism. Alliances are being hastily formed  existing bases expanded and new ones acquired to serve as springboards for encirclement  destabilization and outright military aggression  in contravention of the decisions of the OAU  the United Nations and the non-aligned movement declaring the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace.111.	The imperialist circles not only have intensified the arms race but also have defiantly arrogated to themselves the right to declare any region of the world a zone of their vital interest. Consequently  extensive military preparations are under way  including the formation of a quick intervention force.112.	Thus  an ominous development is in the offing in the regions of the Red Sea  the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean. Having as its main target the States of the Red Sea  the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean region  the quick intervention force poses a grave threat to the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of those States and to their right freely to engage in international economic activities.113.	In pursuit of its imperialist objectives  the United States of America has recently acquired new military bases in Berbera  Kismayu  Mogadishu and elsewhere within Somalia  just over 100 miles from Ethiopia's borders. This dangerous development not only aggravates the already explosive situation prevailing in the Horn of Africa but also poses a direct and imminent threat to the sovereignty and territorial integrity and to the popular revolution of Ethiopia. With contingents of its quick intervention forces concentrated at Berbera  Kismayu and Mogadishu  the United States has in effect taken a direct-assault position against Ethiopia and all those countries in the region which refuse to submit to imperialist domination and pursue an independent path of social and economic development.114.	While no one could be surprised at Mogadishu's outright betrayal of African and Arab causes  we consider the United States' military collaboration agreement with a fanatic  expansionist regime as nothing less than open abetting and encouragement of expansionism and war in the Horn of Africa. Clearly  this is an insult and a challenge to the collective will of Africa  whose unequivocal opposition to foreign military bases was eloquently stated to the Assembly on 24 September by Mr. Siaka Stevens  President of the Republic of Sierra Leone and current Chairman of the OAU.115.	Despite the strongest protest which my Government had lodged with the United States Government against the newly established Washington-Mogadishu military axis  only yesterday it was reported that Washington had decided to proceed with the delivery of weapons to the expansionist aggressors in Mogadishu. The United States Government is pursuing this hostile policy against Ethiopia in full knowledge of the fact that  even as I am speaking now  Somalia's regular troops are engaged in wanton acts of killing and destruction. In the circumstances  I wish to underscore that socialist Ethiopia will hold the Government of the United States fully responsible for the consequences of its ill- advised decision. The United States will be held entirely responsible for the tension  conflict situations and actual wars that it is promoting in the Horn of Africa.116.	As a country that is still being victimized by aggression instigated and financed by imperialismâan aggression in which thousands of Ethiopians have been killed and maimed  billions of dollars' worth of property destroyed and over 2 million people displacedâEthiopia has already alerted the international community to these grave developments. My head of State  Comrade Chairman Mengistu Haile Mariam  has expressed his serious concern over these ominous developments by dispatching high-level delegations to the current Chairmen of the OAU and the non- aligned movement and to several Governments around the world. We have also apprised the Secretary-General of the United Nations of the implications of these developments for international peace and security.117.	With the introduction of the United States intervention force into the Horn of Africa  the age-old struggle of the Ethiopian masses in defence of their independence has entered a new and critical phase. The territory of Somalia  which was used by Italian fascism as the staging ground for aggression and invasion against my country  is today being used as a spring-board for imperialist intervention against Ethiopia.118.	With the ending of colonialism in Africa and  more specifically  with the creation of Somalia as an independent State in 1960  Ethiopia hailed and welcomed the new African State in the earnest belief that the tragic episodes of expansionist wars perpetrated in our region by the colonial Powers for far too long had  at last  been permanently removed. Regrettably  however  Somalia  inheriting a legacy of expansionist dreams from its colonial mentors  devoted its entire human and material resources to the realization of that dream. It is a supreme irony that members of the present ruling clique of Somalia  whose loyal and active services in Mussolini's invasion forces for the colonization of Ethiopia are well known  should make the ludicrous allegation that Ethiopia  whose impeccable anti-colonial struggle is a matter of record  has collaborated with colonial Powers. The truth is that Somalia's active and fanatical pursuit of the policy of expansion and territorial aggrandizement has been and remains the root cause of repeated tension and wars in our region. All the three immediate neighbours of Somalia  namely  Ethiopia  Kenya and Djibouti  have been and remain the targets of Somalia's expansionist policy.119.	During the 20 years of Somalia's existence as an independent State  a ceaseless campaign of slander  repeated wars of aggression and countless acts of terror  subversion and sabotage have been unleashed by Somalia against its neighbours  more particularly against Ethiopia. Each time  Ethiopia has exercised maximum restraint. Successive regimes in Mogadishu  however  continued the infiltration of their soldiers into Ethiopia for the purpose of wanton destruction of human life and property.120.	Africa's position on the grave situation obtaining in our region has been clear and unequivocal. As reported to this Assembly by the current Chairman of the OAU on 24 September  Africa has fully grasped the gravity of the situation and its implications for the maintenance of international peace and security. The specific conditions for peace and the normalization of relations between the two countries  as outlined by the OAU Committee and as subsequently reported to this Assembly  are the following: recognition of territorial integrity  non-interference in domestic affairs  peaceful settlement of disputes  prohibition of subversion  and inviolability of borders inherited on decolonization.121.	Expansionist Somalia  however  has once again arrogantly rejected the principled and wise counsel of Africa. It has  in fact  shown its defiance of the African family of nations by intensifying its acts of armed aggression. Its impudent and persistent violations of the cardinal principles of state sovereignty and territorial integrity enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations  and its repudiation of the very resolution of the United Nations to which it owes its creation within its present borders  lead us to question the legal basis of the State of Somalia and its continued membership of this Organization.122.	Somalia's membership of the non-aligned movement  whose primary objective of peace it has trampled upon by offering military bases and facilities to a superpower and in the service of a military bloc  should be seriously reconsidered. The fact that some Arab States have already questioned its membership of the League of Arab States is a clear manifestation of the unprincipled  irresponsible and mercenary nature of Somalia's ruling clique.123.	The short-term and the long-term interests of Somalia lie not in contemptuous disregard and impudent violation of the norms and principles governing international relations but rather in adherence to  and full compliance with  the cardinal principles of the Charter of the. United Nations and that of the OAU  as well as the policy of non-alignment.124.	As a founding Member of the United Nations  the OAU and the non-aligned movement  Ethiopia has a record of scrupulous compliance with the principles of the Charter and the decisions of these organizations. We come to the United Nations to contribute to the collective efforts of Member States aimed at advancing the causes of peace and international co-operation and not to engage in polemics with the representatives of the irresponsible ruling clique in Mogadishu. Ethiopia has exercised maximum restraint in the face of constant provocation and aggression. War drums are again beating in the Horn of Africa  and Ethiopia's patience and restraint are not without limits. We urge those Powers bent on using the bellicose regime in Mogadishu as an agent of destabilization to weigh the consequences of their odious acts  which could have serious repercussions on international peace and security. Ethiopia cannot and should not be expected to endlessly divert its scarce human and material resources from development needs to fend off continuously an expansionist adventurer and its imperialist allies. Ethiopia will  indeed  be compelled to take such necessary measures as will ensure durable peace and security and preserve its sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity.125.	With respect to the question of refugees  the regime in Mogadishu  which has lost all credibility  claims that it is harbouring 1.5 million so-called ""Ethiopian refugees"" in its territory. A regime that so dramatically demonstrated its ability to convert its entire regular army into what it conveniently calls a liberation movement is now engaged in parading its nomads  orphans  widows and drought victims in relief camps and labelling them ""Ethiopian refugees"". The assistance it receives by such devious means from well- intentioned members of the international community is then shamelessly diverted to feed its army of aggression. The international community is thus duped into indirectly supporting Somalia's wars of expansion. My Government categorically rejects this sinister machination and denounces it vigorously.126.	As the international community is well aware  Ethiopia has declared a general amnesty for all its nationals who happen to be in neighbouring countries. In this regard  thanks to the good offices of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the unfailing co-operation of the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Sudan and that of the Republic of Djibouti  the process of voluntary repatriation of genuine Ethiopian refugees from the two neighbouring countries is being implemented. Whereas Ethiopia has asked for the prompt release and speedy repatriation of those Ethiopians who were forcibly abducted by the invading forces of Somalia  the question of repatriating those falsely labelled ""Ethiopian refugees"" by Somalia  however  does not arise  for the obvious and simple reason that they are nationals of Somalia herded into concentration camps for the sole purpose of extorting funds from the international community.127.	In conclusion  permit me to make a brief reference to a recent remark by my head of State  Comrade Chairman Mengistu Haile Mariam  who  in articulating Ethiopia's policy of peace and co-operation  said:""As has been repeatedly emphasized at various United Nations forums and the conferences of the non-alignedmovement and the OAU  our struggle is always to foster friendship and co-operation based on justice  equality and peace among governments and peoples  non-interference in each other's internal affairs  respect for the independence and territorial integrity of all countries  and the peaceful resolution of conflicts among nations...""128.	This is the clear policy to which socialist Ethiopia is unswervingly committed. As I pointed out earlier in my statement  that policy of peace and co-operation is continuously being translated into practical action in Ethiopia's relations with her neighbours  namely Kenya  Djibouti and the Sudan.129.	It would be unrealistic on our part to hope that the present ruling clique in Mogadishu would see reason and join the co-operative network that is so happily developing among all the other States of the Horn of Africa. We are  however  gratified by the knowledge that the people of Somalia  whose genuine desire to live in peace and active co-operation with their Mothers and sisters in the neighbouring countries has been momentarily distorted by the deranged Merihan clique  will continue to strive for the achievement of the noble aspirations of harmony and prosperity.130.	To those who might mistake our commitment to peace and co-operation for docile submission to persistent provocations  let me clearly and unambiguously sound a solemn warning. Ethiopia has so far consistently exercised patience and restraint. But its patience and restraint should not be presumed to be inexhaustible. Inasmuch as the preservation of its independence  sovereignty  national unity and territorial integrity  and of its revolution  is the sine qua non of its national survival  Ethiopia will not hesitate to take all and any measures necessary to ensure their protection."
"47",2316,"FIN",35,1980,"ï»¿It is a particular pleasure for me  as a representative of a member country of the group of Western European and other countries  to convey to you  Mr. President  our congratulations and best wishes. Among many common bonds  the Federal Republic of Germanyâ a principal European Powerâshares with mv country firm dedication to detente in Europe.75.	The efficient performance of the duties of the President of the General Assembly demands exceptional personal qualities. You  Mr. President  are uniquely equipped in that respect. You bring to your high office a remarkable combination of skills  determination and patience. The thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly will be well served by its highest officer.76.	Finland welcomes Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  the newest Member of the United Nations.77.	We are facing a new decadeâthe 1980s. In retrospect  the past decade may well be remembered for many positive achievements of detente and disarmament. While detente is centred on Europe  its benefits have been perceived in a wider context. Disarmament negotiations produced a number of limited yet significant arms control agreements. Progress was made in the peaceful dismantling of the last remnants of colonial empires. In the economic field  the initiation of the North South dialogue marked the beginning of a process towards a negotiated solution for the benefit of all. All the same  towards the end of the 1970s  the international political atmosphere began to deteriorate.78.	The assessment of the international situation which I presented from this rostrum in the name of the Finnish Government last year was not optimistic and referred to the fact that the positive trends of detente and disarmament had lost their momentum  that the patterns of peaceful cooperation were eroding and that the use of force between nations as well as within them was on the increase. Subsequent events have not dispelled our fears.79.	Thus  the immediate prospects for the 1980s are not encouraging. The relations between the major Powers are far from satisfactory. The persistent conflicts in the Middle East and southern Africa  which breed frustration and violence  still await a peaceful solution. New sources of tension with global political impact have appeared in western and south-eastern Asia.80.	Disarmament negotiations are at a standstill. The implementation of the SALT II Treaty  so painstakingly negotiated  is at best uncertain. Military expenditure has reached hitherto unimaginable levels and cuts even deeper into the resources which should be available for peaceful purposes  including development. The beginning of yet another round in the arms race  unprecedented in intensity  is already a fact. While it covers all arms  its emphasis is on the most deadly kindânuclear weapons. Its implications are of legitimate concern for the security of all. Once again I must reiterate: security lies not in arms but in disarmament.81.	While the hard realities of the present international situation seem to give little cause for encouragement  this should make us more aware of our duties as Members of the United Nations. The United Nations is the principal instrument available to the international community for the maintenance of international peace and security. It is the only universal forum where the nations of the world can unite their efforts for this purpose. The Charter of the United Nations is not only an expression of the aspirations of the international community. It is a legally binding document through which nationsâbig and smallâhave accepted a code of conduct for the relations between them. Those obligations transcend the considerations of political expediency which only too often lead to their violation. During its 35 years of existence  the United Nations has proved its viability as an international institution to prevent conflicts and assist in the peaceful settlement of disputes whenever it has been given the opportunity to do so.82.	Finland has been a Member of this Organization for 25 years. Our attitude to the United Nations is simple and clear. As a small country pursuing a policy of neutrality  Finland has a vital interest in actively promoting the development of a peaceful and rational world order based on the universal collective security system provided by the Charter of the United Nations. Our ambition has always been to conduct ourselves with objectivity and restraint  to stay consistently outside conflicts between the great Powers and to maintain good relations with all countries. Thus we hope best to serve the organized and joint efforts of the world community and also the interests of our own people.83.	Finland has invested much political will in trying to work for the goals of the United Nations. In our opinion  those universally proclaimed goals can best be served in an atmosphere of confidence and cooperation. That has been our experience  particularly in Europe. For the peoples of Europe  the benefits of detente are so tangible  both politically and materially  that they will not be easily abandoned. The efforts not only to preserve but to enhance the results of detente on the basis of the Helsinki Final Act must therefore continue. The Madrid follow-up meeting to the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe is of utmost importance in the light of the present international situation. We believe that that meeting can lead to concrete and constructive results aimed at strengthening the continuity and vitality of the whole process of the Conference  thus increasing confidence and reducing tensions.84.	The security of Europe is today faced with serious challenges. The Government of Finland therefore welcomes the various initiatives which clearly demonstrate an increased willingness to promote arms control and disarmament in Europe. For its own part  Finland last year outlined in the United Nations an initiative aimed at examining whether a special disarmament programme for Europe should be worked out.  Subsequently that matter was pursued in consultations between Finland and other States of Europe and North America.85.	We now look forward to important decisions at Madrid reflecting the widely felt need for a comprehensive approach to disarmament in Europe.86.	At the same time we are  of course  particularly aware of the recent controversy over nuclear weapons aimed at or deployed in Europe. Whatever the merits of the claims or counterclaims concerning balance or imbalance in the field  the end result is added insecurity for all  inside and outside the alliances. There is only one way out: negotiations in good faith  the sooner  the better. We hope that those will now materialize  as indicated by the parties concerned  and lead without delay to agreed limitations and reductions.87.	We are concerned about arms control and disarmament  not only because they are inherently important but also because efforts in those fields contribute politically to the process of detente. Even those political results are now in peril.88.	The SALT II Treaty is a case in point. It is the latest product of the strategic dialogue between the leading nuclear Powers. It should be put into effect without further delay and succeeded by further  not only quantitative but also qualitative  limitations of nuclear weapons.89.	While the SALT Treaty awaits implementation  the arms race  particularly the nuclear arms race  continues and is assuming new dimensions technologically  conceptually and geographically. Weapons of increased accuracy and versatility are being developed and introduced. The increased sophistication of nuclear weapons should not delude anyone into believing that nuclear war could be kept limited or made winnable.90.	Continued and unrelenting efforts are therefore needed in order to stem nuclear proliferation  both horizontal and vertical. In spite of certain disappointments at the recent second Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  we are convinced that the Non-proliferation Treaty remains pivotal in averting the threat of nuclear war. The work of strengthening the regime of the Non-proliferation Treaty must go on.91.	However unpromising the immediate outlook  the search for security through disarmament must continue. For that purpose  it is important that the United Nations disarmament machinery pursue its work. The agreed priorities  in particular a comprehensive test ban and a treaty on chemical weapons  retain their validity.92.	The Charter of the United Nations enjoins Members to settle their international disputes by peaceful means and to refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force. Yet the use of force in the form of local conflicts has plagued this Organization since its inception. Not only does the use of force bring death and destruction  it also has a tendency to exacerbate the conflicts between the major Powers. The events in south-eastern and western Asia are only the latest instances of this tendency. Intertwined with the explosive situation in the Middle East  events in western Asia may further increase the threat to international peace and security.93.	The search for a comprehensive  just and lasting peace in the Middle East has to be pursued in accordance with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  which continue to be the only viable basis for a durable peace in the region. At the same time  the weight of events has made it increasingly clear that the full cooperation of the Palestinians is crucial for the implementation of a durable solution.94.	We fully support the right of the Palestine Liberation Organization to participate in the negotiations on the implementation of the legitimate rights of the Palestinians in the context of a comprehensive solution of the Middle East problem.95.	The basic principles of a peaceful settlement remain immutable; the acquisition of territories by force is inadmissible. Israel must therefore withdraw from Arab territories occupied since 1967. Likewise  it is imperative that the right of Israel and all other States of the area to exist within secure and recognized borders be guaranteed.96.	A major obstacle has been the settlements policy of the Government of Israel in the occupied territories and similar measures undertaken by Israel. Unilateral actions designed to change the status of Jerusalem are universally considered illegal and have been declared such by the Security Council in its resolution 478 (1980).97.	An essential condition for progress in the Middle East is a courageous willingness to compromise on the part of all parties to the dispute.98.	On the basis of our own good relations with all those parties  Finland has been able to make a contribution to the United Nations peacekeeping operations in the Middle East. We deeply deplore the fact that the cycle of violence  particularly in southern Lebanon  has put in jeopardy the functioning of UNIFIL. The United Nations peacekeeping forces are not a substitute for peaceful solutions. However  where those forces perform their valuable task mandated by the Security Council  it is imperative that all concerned give them the necessary cooperation and not obstruct their operations.99.	This is a part of the code of conduct in all United Nations peacekeeping operations. If respect for those fundamental rules is not observed  the future of United Nations peacekeeping operations in general is put in jeopardy.100.	The eradication of colonialism and racism has been the main preoccupation of this Organization for more than two decades. This particularly deep concern for the nations of Africa is shared by us all. With few exceptions  the evil of colonialism has been done away with. This is one of the lasting successes of the United Nations. The case of Zimbabwe  one of the newest Members of the Organization  combines the elements of the abolition of colonialism and racism with the birth of a democratic system created through free and fair elections. Zimbabwe now has a unique opportunity to set an example of racial harmony worth emulating.101.	The attainment of independence by Zimbabwe has solved one aspect of the problem posed by southern Africa. Two others remain as pressing as ever: Namibia and the apartheid policies of South Africa.102.	For Namibia  the time has come. For too long Namibia has been a frontal challenge to the very credibility of the United Nations. Security Council resolutions 385 (1976) and 435 (1978) stand. The patience of the international community is wearing thin.103.	The prevarications of South Africa must come to an end. The Government of Finland remains ready to assist the United Nations in the implementation of the United Nations plan for Namibia by providing peacekeeping forces. An independent Namibia will be a main recipient of Finnish bilateral assistance.104.	Apartheid remains the root of the evil in the southern part of Africa. It constitutes a systematic violation of the most elementary human rights. It leads to repeated acts of violence and aggression. The neighbouring States bear a heavy burden for the sake of the liberation of the oppressed peoples of southern Africa. Increased aid should be channelled to those States  and at the same time the international community must bring unrelenting pressure to bear on South Africa itself.105.	The convening of the eleventh special session of the General Assembly on international economic questions was yet another demonstration of the need for international economic cooperation to assume proportions well beyond its traditional dimensions.106.	The Government of Finland welcomes the consensus on the new International Development Strategy as an important step in the implementation of the new international economic order. This agreement is important in three respects. First  it strengthens confidence in the capability of the international community to tackle the crucial economic issues which it will face in the 1980s through negotiation rather than confrontation. Secondly  the new Strategy contains new commitments by industrialized countries in favour of developing countries  notably in the area of official development assistance. Thirdly  from Finland's point of view  the content of the new Strategy corresponds well with our concept of the development process. Finland shares with other Nordic countries the view that economic and social progress must be parallel. It must involve the entire population. It must take into account the requirements of sound management of the human environment. To adopt ecologically sound development plans is part of our responsibility to present and future generations.107.	My Government also attaches importance to the adoption at the eleventh special session of two resolutions bearing on the grievous problems of the least developed among the developing countries as well as the oil importing developing countries  The stark reality today is that close to 1 000 million people live in abject poverty with no hope of improving their lot through their own means. The elimination of this reality is the ultimate objective of our endeavours.108.	The Assembly was not able to reach full agreement at the special session on how to launch the new global round of negotiations on international economic cooperation for development. Yet  the results must be seen in their proper perspective. The Assembly came close to an understanding on how the United Nations and its family of organizations will tackle the crucial issues at hand. In its magnitude this task has no precedent in the history of North South economic relations. If the results of these negotiations are to have lasting value  they must be based on the principles of equality and common interest which the United Nations was established to promote. They also require the firm political will of the Governments of Member States. I pledge the full support of my Government in this effort.109.	On earlier occasions  I have at this rostrum expressed the concern of my Government for human rights. In our opinion  peace  security and prosperity in the world are closely related to the promotion of human rights.110.	The record of the United Nations in creating a code of conduct for nations in the field of human rights is impressive. The international community should now concentrate on more effective implementation. The observance of the agreed norms of human rights should be complemented by the supportive activity of providing aid to the victims of abuses and failures. In the first instance this relates to refugees  as defined in the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. 111.	The international community has been able to alleviate the suffering of refugees and displaced persons. However  only partial solutions have been achieved so far. The dimensions of the refugee problems are widening in Asia  Africa and Latin America. The problem of refugees has become the permanent and joint responsibility of all States. Refugees are the product of either external aggression or internal oppression. The responsibility of the international community does not absolve the States which have created the problem. They should be called upon to promote and encourage human rights and fundamental freedoms  as well as to seek peaceful solutions to political crises.112.	The World Conference of the United Nations Decade for Women was another significant step towards full equality between women and men at all levels and in all spheres of life. However  my Government regrets that  owing to extraneous issues  the Programme of Action could not be adopted by consensus. Yet we fully subscribe to the principles and recommendations embodied in parts two and three of the Programme of Action and consider them a valid contribution to improving the status of women. My Government has every intention of taking the necessary measures to implement them fully.113.	We have also committed ourselves to early ratification of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women  which we signed at the Conference.114.	The ninth session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  which concluded its work at the end of August in Geneva  resulted in what can justly be described as the final political breakthrough. The Conference has now reached substantial agreement on practically all of the issues standing in the way of the adoption of the Convention  which is to govern virtually all human uses of the oceans. The Government of Finland greatly values the progress achieved by the Conference and hopes that the Convention on the Law of the Sea will finally be adopted at Caracas in 1981.115.	On the initiative of the Nordic countries  the General Assembly will at this session consider the question of the protection of diplomatic missions and representatives. Our action was prompted by the weight of events familiar to all. In recent years there have been increasingly frequent violations of international law governing diplomatic intercourse  in particular diplomatic inviolability. Failure to safeguard the orderly and secure conduct of diplomacy jeopardizes the very fabric of international relations. The Governments of Denmark  Iceland  Norway  Sweden and Finland hope that this initiative will lead to appropriate measures to remedy the situation and to increased respect for the rules of international law relating to diplomatic and consular relations.116.	We are convinced that Member States will join us in this effort to fulfil the pledge of the Charter ""to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained""."
"48",2361,"FJI",35,1980,"ï»¿Mr. President  on behalf of the Government and people of Fiji  my delegation would like to join with other delegations that have already spoken in congratulating you very warmly and sincerely on your election as President of this body. Your election as President of the General Assembly during this its thirty-fifth session is a reflection of the very high regard in which representatives hold you personally and  equally important  of the deep commitment of your Government and your people to the continued observance of the high ideals of the United Nations. My delegation wishes to express its fully support to you in your task  which we know is not an easy one.50.	Fiji also wishes to put on record its gratitude for and warm appreciation of the excellent and constructive leader-ship shown by the immediate past President of this Assembly  Mr. Salim of the United Republic of Tanzania. His record is a credit to himself and his country.51.	We wish to thank also the Secretary-General and his staff for their dedication and devotion to duty in their thankless job of translating the many resolutions of the United Nations into action.52.	Just over three weeks ago this community of nations welcomed to its ranks Saint Vincent and the Grenadines as its one hundred and fifty-fourth Member. The Fiji delegation  representing another island State  extends a very special welcome to the island State of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. My delegation is certain that  with the admission of this island State to the world Organization  the needs of island economiesâsome of which are very fragile indeedâand the aspirations of their peoples will be given the support they richly deserve and the attention from this world body that they have persistently sought. Fiji looks forward to working closely with Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and wishes it fruitful and beneficial interaction in this community of nations.53.	We also wish to acknowledge the achievement of independence by Vanuatu  a sister nation in the Pacific  on 30 July this year. The Fiji delegation notes the positive roles played by the administering Powers of this former condominium and the encouragement given by the South Pacific Forum countries and the United Nations in regard to the attainment of self-determination and ultimate independence by this country. Vanuatu  soon after independence  became a member of the Commonwealth of Nations and  as another island State and a Pacific State  Fiji looks forward to the day when Vanuatu will take its rightful place in this world body.54.	Ten years ago today Fiji became independent after peaceful and constructive discussions with its then administering Power  the United Kingdom. The peaceful process of dialogue which led to the attainment of independence in Fiji on 10 October 1970 has continued to be the corner-stone of our independence and national life and the foundation upon which our relations with other nations are based. The tenth anniversary celebrations which the people of Fiji are holding today bear testimony to the democratic and peaceful process that has been the chief characteristic of our social  economic and political developments to date. Our abiding faith in the value of peace and peaceful and constructive dialogue in resolving problems is also the major motivation for our membership in this international community.55.	At the outset I should therefore like to reiterate Fiji's unequivocal commitment to the Charter of the United Nations and its hope for peace and security in the world.56.	This session is significant in the history of the United Nations as it marks the beginning of yet another decade in the continuing efforts of this Organization to provide a global framework for the maintenance of peace and security  for promoting respect for human rights and freedom and for improving the social and economic well-being of peoples the world over.57.	As we begin this new decade it will not be inappropriate  in the view of my delegation  for Member nations of this global body to remind themselves afresh of their obligations to maintain and uphold these aims and principles for which the United Nations was created 35 years ago. It is the view of the Fiji delegation that such a reminder cannot be over-emphasized and will not be misplaced in view of the threat to international  regional and local harmonious coexistence arising from ruthless expansionist policies which are insensitive and oblivious to the national pride  self-respect and feelings of peoples in small  weak and divided countries; the apparent relaxation of detente among super-Powers with its consequent adverse effects  implied and real  on global peace and stability; the current impasse in international and North-South economic relationsârelations between the third world and the industrialized countriesâ because of the inability of both groups to arrive at a consensus; the lack of respect for international law  agreements and treaties that Member nations individually and/or collectively subscribe to as a basis for international relations; and the increasing proportion of the mass of humanity which is denied its birth right to life and its right to self-determination and independence because of political oppression  religious persecution  cultural subjugation and ideological intolerance.58.	Fiji believes that those are some of the key issues which at the beginning of the decade of the 1980s are threatening the work and the very existence of the United Nations.59.	Fiji is a small independent country in the South Pacific which is proud of its tradition of harmonious multiracial living  orderly socio-economic development  stable political evolution and peaceful coexistence with its neighbours. But as a part of an increasingly integrated and interdependent world community  Fiji views with the greatest concern the continuing escalation of unresolved conflicts in many parts of the world.60.	The situation in the Middle East  for instance  remains one of our dominant concerns  primarily because of its implications for international peace and security and the economic future of the world. The search for a just and lasting peace in the area has continued for several years now. This year  there was the seventh emergency special session of the General Assembly  devoted to the question of Palestine. Efforts have also been made to revive the stalled talks on the issue of Palestinian rights. A noteworthy initiative has been undertaken by the European Community  which sent an exploratory mission to all the parties this year  in an effort through dialogue to promote peace in the region. While the prospects for an immediate solution appear uncertain  there is no doubt that the question of Palestine is at the core of the Middle East conflict.61.	A negotiated settlement  in the view of my delegation  could be based on the following principles: Israeli withdrawal from all territories occupied since 1967; recognition by the parties concerned of each other's legitimate concerns  including the right of the Palestinian people to self- determination and a homeland and acceptance of Israel's security needs; and the involvement of PLO in negotiations leading to the self-determination of the Palestinian people.62.	We further believe that all actions that discourage the attainment of a just solution through a process of dialogue and consultation must be abandoned. In this regard  the deliberate policy of creating settlements in occupied Arab territories and the unilateral decision by Israel to change the character and status of Jerusalem create serious impediments to the peace process in the Middle East. However  we remain convinced that  given goodwill and understanding on all sides  an amicable solution can be found for the complex Middle East question.63.	The course of events in the Middle East continues to affect the situation in Lebanon  a small country whose peaceful and secure existence has been seriously compromised. To our deep regret  the practice of pre-emptive strikes and armed activities has continued. For normalcy to return to the area  it is imperative that the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon be scrupulously respected. It is because of Fiji's abiding commitment to the principles of the Charter concerning international peace and security that we have decided to participate in the United Nations peace-keeping operations in southern Lebanon. Our involvement also stems from our belief that  while peace-keeping is no substitute for peace-making  they are not mutually exclusive. Moreover  in the case of UNIFIL  there is wide agreement that it is performing an absolutely vital peace-keeping function. It is therefore crucial that there be co-operation from all sides  so as to permit UNIFIL fully to discharge its mandate.64.	It is indeed regrettable that  despite the fact that peace-keeping operations like UNIFIL have proved their usefulness  their financial situation remains precarious. We fully concur with the following observations made by the Secretary-General in his report to the Assembly on the work of the Organization:""This situation places a heavy burden on the troop- contributing countries which  if allowed to continue  may adversely affect the future of such operations.""The troop-contributing countries  and particularly developing countries such as mine  continue to suffer from the failure of some to share the financial burden of peacekeeping. Since the maintenance of international peace and security is a collective responsibility  we hope that all will fulfil their financial obligations in this regard.65.	Moreover  my delegation recalls that the General Assembly  in its resolution 34/166  requested a United Nations study this year on ""the existing standard rates of reimbursement  with a view to ensuring an equitable rate of reimbursement to the Governments of troop-contributing States"". My delegation looks forward to that important report. We further hope that this Assembly will be able to take action that will provide for more regular and fairer rates of reimbursement to the troop contributors. Failure to act could mean continued absorption by the troop- contributing countries of escalating costs for the maintenance of their national contingents on United Nations peace-keeping assignments.66.	The conflicts in Indo-China and West Asia remain unresolved. Despite efforts to defuse the situations in Kampuchea and Afghanistan  no political solution acceptable to the parties directly concerned has emerged. Because of the serious implications of these conflicts for peace and security  and for humanitarian considerations regarding the plight of the refugees  urgent solutions are necessary. It is therefore our very earnest hope that General Assembly resolution 34/22  in respect of the situation in Kampuchea  will be expeditiously implemented  with the co-operation of the parties concerned.67.	In the case of Afghanistan  we remain convinced that General Assembly resolution ES-6/2 provides the basis for a satisfactory solution. Even though various efforts to resolve the crisis have not yet yielded results  it is crucial that a search for a negotiated settlement should continue.68.	My delegation supports the implementation of these resolutions essentially because they provide for the withdrawal of foreign forces  which in turn could facilitate the act of self-determination by the peoples concerned. We firmly believe that it is for the people themselves to decide their own future without any external interference in any form.69.	A problem which faces the United Nations each year  and which is not dissimilar to the problems in South-East and West Asia that I have just alluded to  is the question of decolonization.70.	Many members who have spoken from this rostrum have drawn our attention to the commemoration this year of the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples.71.	While we welcome the independence attained by many countries since 1960  we are nevertheless aware of the plight of the many that are still seeking to control their own destiny  including those in Africa  the Caribbean and  indeed  our part of the world.72.	My delegation supports the inalienable right of all colonial peoples to exercise self-determination in accordance with the important principles that are enunciated in the Charter and in resolution 1514 (XV). Having attained our own independence in 1970  and following our accession to membership of this Organization and of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  we have been guided by those principles in our approach to various cases of decolonization. Mindful of the fact that the Charter recognizes the well-being and interests of the colonial peoples as paramount  we fully subscribe to the view that it is for the people themselves freely to choose their own destiny. We would therefore monitor closely the positive assurances from those concerned that they will be guided by the wishes of the people as regards their future. For we remain convinced that no self-centred interests or narrow considerations  such as those based on race  creed or colour  should be allowed to impede the decolonization process.73.	Concerning the international Territory of Namibia  we note that the prolonged search for an internationally accept-able solution has not yet resulted in Namibia's freedom. It is indeed regrettable that the carefully devised United Nations plan for the peaceful decolonization of Namibia remains unimplemented because of the continuing intransigence of South Africa. My delegation earnestly hopes that South Africa will speedily end its illegal occupation of the Territory and accept a solution based on the important principles outlined in Security Council resolution 385 (1976) and 435 (1978) which  in brief  entail the acquisition of genuine majority rule by the Namibian people based on free and fair elections to be held under the auspices of the United Nations. Moreover  SWAPO should continue to participate fully in the processes leading to independence. Such steps should bring to fruition the attainment of the peaceful solution that the people of Namibia fully deserve and have long been denied.74.	As for South Africa itself  the abhorrent practice of apartheid and racial discrimination remains the concern of the international community. Repression should give way to genuine changes aimed at majority rule and the full realization of the principles of human rights.75.	Addressing the General Assembly in 1976  my Prime Minister said that the practice of ""apartheid is anathema to us"". We continue to subscribe fully to that position. We remain convinced that in multi-racial and multi-cultural societies all can share  without any distinctions  the fruits of progress  peace and prosperity. Our own experience in Fijiâas indeed experience elsewhereâhas shown that that is possible.76.	On the question of human rights  my country is fortified by our election to membership of the Commission on Human Rights  with effect from next year. It is our intention to honour the trust placed in us by the world community through a constructive contribution to the deliberations of the Commission.77.	Although great progress has already been made in the field of human rights  the efforts of the international community are being continuously tarnished by human-rights violations in many parts of the globe. Political persecution  racial discrimination  torture and arbitrary sentences are still a painful reality today. It is extremely important to understand that in the final analysis individual human rights must rest on the foundation of collective human rights. National liberation and self-determination create the frame-work for the latter  and only after they have been achieved can one think of ensuring human rights for individuals.78.	My delegation believes that concrete and effective measures should be urgently adopted by this Organization in order to meet and fulfil its obligations in the human-rights field by seeing to it that those who on various pretexts have pushed waves of refugees across their national borders or out to sea show more moderation and responsibility. Whether in Africa  Asia  the Middle East or elsewhere  these refugees suffer the most inhuman treatment. My delegation appeals to this Assembly to support the efforts of the United Nations and other organizations to relieve the misery of these fellow men. We sincerely hope that the inscription on this session's agenda of the item entitled ""International co-operation to avert new flows of refugees"" will bring us closer to a solution of the refugee question.79.	We remind this Organization again that stability of newly gained freedom is essential for ensuring socio-economic development and for widening and deepening the ambit of human rights. That needs to be properly institutionalized  for only then will there be a safeguard against their possible abuse or suppression  or even total eclipse.80.	We in Fiji are very concerned about our society because it is multiracial  multi-religious and multicultural  and in such a society great care and sensitivity are needed to ensure that no segment of the society is deprived in any way. The dignity of man expressed through the equality of all is what we believe in.81.	The World Conference of the United Nations Decade for Women  held at Copenhagen last July  is only one of the many facets of our international efforts towards the achievement of equality for all in the field of human rights. Although the Programme of Action for the Second Half of the United Nations Decade for Women7 was not adopted by consensus  my delegation is of the opinion that the document contains frameworks which are acceptable to all and within which Governments and organizations can successfully pursue the aims and objectives of the Decade. This  together with the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women  adopted by the General Assembly last year  must now form the basis of our efforts towards the advancement of women  who after all constitute half of mankind.82.	The progress we have made in Fiji on the general question of human rights and respect for others and its consequence in bringing about harmony and peace can perhaps be summed up in the following passage taken from my Prime Minister's address this morning to the people of Fiji on the occasion of our national independence day:""We have been fortunate in Fiji. We have enjoyed peace. We have made progress  and there is stability in our country. Our endeavour for the future is to maintain this stability. Our aim is to establish in our country a truly multiracial society where the welfare of all is our collective concern.""Given the tolerance and goodwill and the hard work and dedication through which we have been blessed with peace  progress and stability  I believe there is great promise for our country in the future. As we look to the next decade of our development  let us remember that our greatest contribution to our country and to the world at large is to maintain a united and harmonious multiracial society.""83.	Many speakers who have preceded me have spoken of the current trends in the world economy and the grave economic problems facing the international community today. The eleventh special session of the General Assembly  which ended recently  focused on the realization by the international community of the urgent need to establish the New International Economic Order. A significant part of that economic restructuring process envisages emphasis on the development of the small  less endowed  geographically handicapped and poor nations of the world. My delegation is pleased that a consensus has been reached on the question of the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade. We hope that the text will be adopted and the recommendations in it expedition implemented. We are  however  disappointed that the special session failed to reach a consensus on the global round of negotiations  but we hope that the preparation for the global round will be finalized during the current session.84.	The international community is mindful of the interdependence of the economies of our nations. It has also shown through many resolutions adopted within the United Nations system that it is fully aware of the economic plight of island developing countries like my own. In our statement to the recently concluded special session on the New International Economic Order   we emphasized the problems of high inflation  the increasing cost of energy fuel and protectionism. We shall not repeat that here. What is needed is not repeated declarations and resolutions on avowed intentions  but a genuine and honest political will to assist those nations in need.85.	However  my delegation has always emphasized its views on trade as the vehicle for economic growth. Most island developing States like Fiji are faced with limited resources  small domestic markets  heavy dependence on imports and high transportation costs. Having made that point  I must say that we have  in the course of our decade of independence  assumed full responsibility in resolving that problem.86.	We believe that equitable terms of trade with developed and developing countries constitute the best form of aid. We are convinced that the best form of assistance that countries can give us is the provision of assured markets for our exports.87.	We have therefore been encouraged by the positive response demonstrated by the industrialized European Economic Community [EEC] countries in their improved economic relations with the African  Caribbean and Pacific countries and in their willingness to give guaranteed access for an assured quota of our sugar to their markets at guaranteed prices. We are grateful to the EEC for the substantial aid and technical assistance given to us under the Lome II Convention.  We are also appreciative of the positive steps taken towards regional trade agreements and economic co-operation among South Pacific countries providing for duty-free and unrestricted entry of a wide range of products on a non-reciprocal basis. My delegation is pleased at the noteworthy progress made in UNCTAD  where agreement has finally been reached on establishing a Common Fund for Commodities. 88.	The island States in the South Pacific have their own regional identity in the South Pacific Forum. The member States of the Forum have come a long way  since its inception in 1971  in their desire for increased mutual cooperation among themselves. At regular meetings  the South Pacific countries have come to grips with such problems as assisting member countries in providing for their needs in economic assistance  specialist skills  manpower  technical co-operation  regional shipping and fishing. Indeed  the South Pacific Forum is regarded as a respected international organization fully consistent with the Pacific tradition of mutual help and self-reliance and also in keeping with the United Nations concept of increased cooperation among developing countries.89.	Earlier in this address I mentioned that a major cause for concern in the world today is the lessening of detente resulting from the lack of respect for international law  agreements and treaties  to which Member nations subscribe  some individually  some collectively  as a basis for peace and harmonious international relations. In that connection allow me to make some brief comments on the topic of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the South Pacific  in the context of general and complete disarmament.90.	At its thirtieth session  the General Assembly adopted resolution 3477 (XXX) endorsing the idea of the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the South Pacific. In inviting the countries of the region to carry on consultations about ways and means of achieving this objective  the resolution also expressed the hope that all States  in particular the nuclear-weapon States  would co-operate fully in achieving the objective of a nuclear-free zone in the South Pacific.91.	Whilst the heads of Government of the independent or self-governing States of the South Pacific Forum have issued various communiques since the adoption of resolution 3477 (XXX)  reiterating the importance of keeping the South Pacific region free from the risk of nuclear contamination and of involvement in a nuclear conflict  the co-operation they had hoped to receive from nuclear-weapon States of the region has not been forthcoming.92.	Encouraging progress has been made in the declaration and the establishment of nuclear-free zones in the Indian Ocean  the Middle East and South Asia  as well as in the denuclearization of Africa and Latin America. Sadly  the largest and  from its name  supposedly the most peaceful of oceans remains the hub of nuclear testing and related nuclear activities. We therefore call on the States concerned to refrain from any action contrary to the objective of establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the South Pacific and urge them to enter into dialogue and negotiations with the States of the region for the achievement of these objectives. Everyone recognizes that the establishment of a nuclear-free zone in the Pacific would contribute not only to the security of our region but  more important  to the prevention of the proliferation of nuclear weapons  and would bring us a step closer to the goal of general and complete disarmament.93.	The numerous appeals by the General Assembly in its equally numerous past resolutions for an end to all nuclear- weapon tests in all environments must be heeded and heeded by all. In the present international climate  in which nearly all our disarmament negotiation efforts have reached an impasse  the call for the cessation of all nuclear testing and of the nuclear arms race is even more imperative than ever before. The highest priority must be accorded to the adoption of effective measures towards nuclear disarmament and the conclusion of an agreement on general and complete disarmament.94.	A necessary corollary to the Pacific island nations' call for the cessation of all nuclear testing in the region is our protest at the dumping of nuclear waste in our waters and on our islands. In July this year the heads of Government of the South Pacific Forum in their meeting in Kiribati unanimously adopted a resolution condemning any action that represents further exploitation of the Pacific for nuclear purposes to the disadvantage of the people of the Pacific. That was a follow-up to a similar resolution adopted at the previous year's meeting regarding the storage in the Pacific of spent nuclear fuel. While we note in that regard the assurances by the States concerned of the high safety standards laid down for those projects and the minimal threat they pose or will pose to our people  experiences elsewhere remind us that accidents have occurred and are bound to occur. In any case my delegation is not convinced that there exists at the present time any nuclear storage system that can provide an absolute guarantee against accidents as well as against future seepage.95.	The question of global disarmament remains the most basic and is of immediate concern to this world body  whose very foundations appear threatened not only by the stalemate reached in both multilateral and bilateral negotiations towards agreement on general and complete disarmament but also and even more by the increase in the military budgets of all major Powers  which aggravates further the constantly spiralling arms race. Even previous calls for the freezing and reduction of military budgets  including the one issued last year by the General Assembly in resolution 34/83F  which was adopted without a vote  appearâin the light of the major Powers' military budgets for the coming yearâto represent mere drafting exercises. Perhaps the General Assembly's decision in resolution 34/75 last December to declare the 1980s as the Second Disarmament Decade is indicative of the rate of progress we have achieved so far in this area.96.	The World Disarmament Conference envisaged to take place after the second session on disarmament would  in my delegation's view  be the most appropriate forum  in which all the peoples and nations of the world should participate  for everyone to make an all-out concerted effort at reaching some consensus on ways and means of achieving our goals. For such a conference to be effective  it requires the political will and participation of all nuclear-weapon Powers. For such a conference to have any meaningful effect it must be convened at the earliest possible time.97.	Why  it may well be asked  is the issue of the urgency of global negotiations on disarmament raised by one of the smallest Member nations? For a variety of reasons. In addressing the General Assembly 10 years ago on Fiji's admission into the United Nations  our Prime Minister said"" that Fiji's remarks on world affairs and events were made with an appreciation of our isolated geographical location  which in turn gave us a perspective different from that of many nations closer to the pulse of international affairs. For that very reason alone  and given the endless search for alternative avenues and ways and means of achieving any progress in many of our international strivings  it may be worth our while to take some of the views expressed by small and medium-sized countries into consideration. Fiji sees the impasse reached in many of our disarmament negotiations as not only dangerous for our immediate future but equally undesirable  given the latest regional conflicts in South-East and South-West Asia as well as in the Middle East.98.	A further reason why my small country has seen fit to comment on global disarmament is our over-all responsibility to the world community. The question of disarmament is  in my delegation's view  not a matter for the major Powers alone. It is a problem that affects each and every member of the international community  touching not only on their security interests  but also on their very survival. It would be irresponsible on our part  as it is on the part of other small countries  to remain silent or indifferent on the issue of disarmament. Super-Powers and the other major Powers cannot arrogate to themselves the role of custodian of the fate of mankind at a time when its future and its very survival are at stake.99.	My delegation is mindful and appreciative of the untiring work of the Committee on Disarmament in this area. Its report  setting out the various stages the negotiations have reached concerning the elements of a comprehensive programme on disarmament  and its recommendations should form the basis of our future efforts. In this connection  the report of the Disarmament Commission to be placed before this session and incorporating the report of the Committee on Disarmament  should again emphasize the need for our efforts to be co-ordinated and concerted and to receive serious consideration by the General Assembly.100.	The second Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of N clear Weapons  held at Geneva from 11 August to 7 September this year  noted that ""considerable progress"" had been made in some key areas on peaceful uses of nuclear energy. But again we note with deep concern the inability of the Conference to reach an agreement on issues pertaining to nuclear non- proliferation  disarmament and international peace and security. This again underscores the urgency of the call my delegation and those that have preceded me make to the major Powers to co-operate fully with the negotiating processes aimed at establishing peace and security.101.	If there is a ray of hope about what political will and co-operation between nations can do  a hope that so far has eluded the world community in our efforts to reach agreements in areas of global disarmament and in the last special session concerning the global round of negotiations to launch the New International Economic Order  it is to be seen in the success achieved at the recently concluded ninth session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea at Geneva. The hard-core issues which had plagued the Conference over the years and which now have happily been resolved amply illustrate one fundamental fact  namely  that the international community can arrive at a consensus in any areas of international endeavour if there exists a genuine will and determination to do so.102.	The draft convention that has emerged  and that is to establish a new order to govern the ocean space based on international social justice is of particular importance to the small island countries and territories of the Pacific which rely to a very great extent on the resources of the sea for their daily needs. For archipelagic States like Fiji  it is particularly gratifying to note that the concept of an archipelagic regime is firmly entrenched in the draft treaty and has now won universal acceptance.I OS* Mention of this major achievement leads me to refer to our added apprehension about our vast ocean areas. We have already alluded to the danger that nuclear testing and the dumping of nuclear wastes in our ocean poses for our people. Coupled with this is the very real danger and the magnitude of damage that such nuclear spillage and seepage can cause for our environment  especially for our marine resources. Whilst nuclear testing and dumping are carried out outside our territorial waters and economic zones  that does not prevent the adverse consequences from flowing into our areas and affecting our marine life. It does not prevent highly migratory species of fish  like tuna  which are affected by nuclear activities  from moving from testing and dumping areas to ours where they are harvested. We highlight these points  if only to dramatize the over-all undesirability of nuclear testing and dumping of nuclear wastes that are carried out in our region.104.	The main theme of what we have said is the peace and security of this world. Without it there is little hope for mankind  as indeed peace is necessary as a precondition for the fulfilment of our hopes for a better world."
"49",2407,"FRA",35,1980,"ï»¿In electing you Sir  to the presidency of the thirty-fifth session of our General Assembly  the United Nations wished to pay tribute to the great democracy of the Federal Republic of Germany and to Europe  of which it forms one of the pillars. The United Nations has conferred a distinction on a diplomat whose competence  experience and human qualities are appreciated by one and all. In the name of the friendship which unites our two nations and the trustful cooperation which they have established  allow me to say. Sir  how glad I am to see you presiding over the work of this Assembly.161.	I should also like to express once again my gratitude to our Secretary General for the distinguished services he has constantly rendered to the United Nations  and for his skill  his authority and his talent.162.	Finally  I am happy to greet the young State of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines as it enters our Organization.163.	Last year I began my address here by stating that in spite of the upheavals and dangers that had threatened it. The global peace of the world had been preserved for over 30 years. In addition to being a statement of fact  my words were also grounds for hope and an act of faith in the future.164.	Why does this observation today appear almost unseemly? Why has the hope it brought us given way to a mute feeling of uneasiness?165.	The reason is of course  the events taking place at this very moment on the Iranian border which  quite rightfully  are in our minds and deeply concern each and every one of us. But in realityâsince the uneasiness reaches further backâit is above all because the world has witnessed a number of serious events over the past year  because disturbing trends have developed and  although world peace has not been broken  the confidence we placed in the soundness of its foundations has been shaken.166.	In fact nothing  unless it be peace itself  is more important than that confidence. It is that confidence that has deteriorated. It is that confidence which must be restored; no task is more urgent.167.	Never  perhaps  have our peoples and our States been more keenly aware of the solidarity of their destinies and the fragility of peace. Similarly  never before has it seemed so necessary to counter the blind workings of fate with clear-sighted analysis  courageous action and effective structures for international cooperation: a clear-sighted analysis in order to assess  without empty complacency  the gravity of the crises besetting us  and also to acknowledge that  directly or indirectly  those crises affect us all; courageous action in order to reject the dangerously simple recourse to force and to seek with determination the only solutions that are valid  namely  those of law and justice; lastly  effective structures for international cooperation in order to ensure that  at all levels of responsibility and organization within the international community  selfish interests and ideological preferences make way for the higher needs of peace.168.	It is to this threefold aim of clear-sightedness  courage and cooperation that I have come here to make France's contribution.169.	It would be both simplistic and incorrect to attribute the critical world situation to a single factor. The new element introduced into the situation by the current military confrontation between Iran and Iraq should be sufficient to remind us of this. We know well that whether longstanding or recent  political or economic  there are many causes of tension. We are aware that they are responsible for the proportions and gravity of the critical world situation. We should not  we cannot ignore any of them.170.	The critical situation has taken on a very special significance since the intervention of the Soviet army in Afghanistan. The Afghan crisis is not simply an addition to other crises; it is of a different order of gravity and so are its implications  for three main reasons.171.	Looking beyond the tragic suffering it is inflicting on 15 million Afghans  the crisis calls into question  first and foremost  respect for a fundamental and universal principle  namely  national independence  the right of a people to determine its own destiny. This cannot be concealed  however artfully the situation is presented.172.	The issue is also the fate of a country and a region whose security and stability are essential to world equilibrium and peace.173.	Lastly  the issue involves the conduct of one of the two Powers which alone have the means to start a global conflict and on which special obligations devolve by virtue of this fact.174.	The crisis in Afghanistan also has other implications. One has only to look at its consequences in East West relations: the course of detente has changed for the worse and momentum has been lost; a shadow has fallen over the prospects of the Madrid Conference; efforts towards disarmament are at a standstill in some places and have been interrupted in others.175.	It is pointless to think that the crisis in Afghanistan can be reduced to local or regional proportions. By degrees it has come to affect international relations as a whole. It has repercussions on other crises; it increases their dangers and makes them more difficult to resolve.176.	I am thinking in the first place of the Middle East. The conflict which continues there and which is growing more acute is as old as our Organization itself. How many hopes have been disappointed over the past 30 years  how many paths explored that led nowhere? To limit myself to the last 12 months  how can one fail to note once again  with sadness  that in spite of the efforts made and even in spite of the progress accomplished  thanks to the evacuation of a large part of the Sinai  when it comes to fundamentals the end is far from being in sight.177.	What is more  the unilateral and illegal decisions of the State of Israel  whether in regard to the West Bank or more recently to Jerusalem  are new impediments to the search for a peaceful settlement.178.	Lastly  what can one say of the attacks on Lebanon's sovereignty and territorial integrity  and on the mission and authority of the United Nations Force in that country? The friendship that links France to Lebanon and my country's role in UN IFIL make these actions all the more abhorrent to France.179.	Is it conceivable to imagine the situation in that region of the world continuing without presenting the gravest dangers to peace?180.	As regards Southeast Asia  last year we deplored the occupation of Cambodia by the Vietnamese army. This occupation continues. The Cambodian people have escaped annihilation only thanks to the massive humanitarian effort by the international community. The conflict of which they have been the unfortunate object has even recently threatened to spill over Cambodia's very borders.181.	Concerning southern Africa  the satisfaction we feel at welcoming the presence of the delegation of an independent Zimbabwe to our Assembly should not blind us to the slow pace of progress in Namibia's decolonization nor to the obstacles still blocking its path. Moreover  it should not cause us to forget that in South Africa the system of apartheid maintains millions of human beings in a state that is an offence to human rights and to the dignity of Africa.182.	I shah not dwell on the latest developments in the crisis between Iran and Iraq  except to say that it is vital to avoid interventions that might widen the conflict  to prevent interference in freedom of navigation in the Gulf  which is of worldwide importance  and lastly to foster the Â«;arch for a political solution. That is what France requests. That is what the European Community requests. That is what we expect of the consultations currently taking place on the initiative of our Secretary General.183. Afghanistan  the Middle Fast. Cambodia  southern Africa  those major areas of crisis are by themselves sufficient to warrant the most serious concern.184.	The picture would  however  be incomplete if I did not mention the formidable problem which forms the backdrop to them all  namely  the problem of hunger and development.185.	The recent debates of the special session of the General Assembly on that subject are fresh in all our minds. They did not enable us to reach complete agreement. That was a serious disappointment. We must not resign ourselves to that setback  however. What is at stake is  indeed  far too important. It commits us all  morally  economically and politically.186.	Hunger  poverty and underdevelopment do more than breed misery. They feed frustration and lead to despair. They are felt to be the worst injustices of all and are a permanent factor of instability.187.	Such  then  is the state of the world. We should not be lulled by the comforting illusion that crises will take care of themselves and problems will be solved of their own accord. But we must not give way to discouragement either.188.	Because there are  indeed  solutions to those problems. I should even venture to say that they are within our grasp. They are based on the principles that form the foundation of our international community. Those principles are embodied in our Charter. They give us the law as our rule  and dialogue and consultation as our methods.189.	Law implies self-determination for peoples  independence and security for States  dignity and equality for mankind. Dialogue and consultation mean the refusal to accept unilateral action and the condemnation of recourse to force.190.	In the light of current events  those time-honoured words  which we mistakenly view as worn out acquire an immediate practical value. They provide a much needed compass that can guide us through the turbulent waters the world has entered. That compass will show us that  despite differing circumstances in the four crises that  in the long term  weigh most heavily on international relationsâI refer here to Afghanistan. Cambodia  the Middle Cast and Namibiaâthe same causes lead to the same effects  the same obstacles stand in the way of the same goals  the same problems call for the same solution.191.	In Afghanistan the goal is the right of the Afghan people freely to determine its own future. What are the obstacles? The first is the intervention of a foreign army; the second is the temptation to turn that country into a stake or a threat. The first obstacle must be removed and the second avoided. The two things must go hand in hand. So the States that are in a position to influence Afghanistan's destiny by virtue of their close proximity or power must agree to eliminate those two obstacles. If they pledge to respect Afghanistan's sovereignty  if they cease trying to bring it into their zone of influence and. more importantly  if they refrain from introducing military forces into that country on maintaining them there  that will be enough to restore to the people of Afghanistan their freedom and independence  to give equilibrium and calm to the region  and to give security and hope to the world.192.	In Southeast Asia the goal is to lead ill-fated Cambodia out of the hopeless impasse in which it has been locked by a conflict that is beyond its control and foreign to it. The Khmer people did not escape the barbaric oppression of a bloodthirsty tyranny in order to submit to the protector-ship of someone else. That people is entitled  after all its tribulations  to live in freedom and stand on its own feet. The countries of the region are entitled to have among them a partner that wants to practise peace and friendship with all its neighbours. France has known that people long enough to realize that  left to itself  it would aspire to no more than that. The military occupation still has to end and an agreement has to be reached if Cambodia is to re-emerge free  peaceful and neutral. Providing those two conditions are met  the accumulation of physical and human ruin can be rebuilt and a lasting peace restored throughout Southeast Asia.193.	As far as Namibia is concerned  no one can any longer dispute the fact that that country is entitled to accede to international sovereignty  or that the genuine independence it seeks can come only from the free choice of the peoples living there. To create the conditions to make that possible  here again  the obstacles standing in the way must be cleared. In this case  that means neutralizing those forces which  by their presence or their action  could unfairly influence the outcome of the national elections. The example of Zimbabwe shows that stability in southern Africa could only gain thereby.194.	What is true in all those cases is also true of the Arab Israeli conflict. Complex though the many factors in that situation may be  the basic facts are still analogous. Two rights are in conflict in the territories now under military occupationâwhich occupation neither confers legitimacy nor provides a basis for peace: they are the State of Israel's right to security and the Palestinian people's right to self-determination. Neither can be affirmed by negating the other. Passionate and violent confrontation must be replaced by rational and fair reconciliation. It will then become clear that those rights  far from being incompatible  can become complementary  providing that the guarantee of one and the exercise of the other are equally ensured in the framework of an overall settlement based on withdrawal from the territories occupied since 1967 and the universal recognition of Israel's boundaries. The way must be paved for the indispensable negotiations in which all the interested parties  and therefore the Palestine Liberation Organization must necessarily participate.195.	In every case  in view of the dangers raised by crises  there can be only one response: the rule of law  and not the rule of force  is the key to peace.196.	That applies just as clearly to the threat weighing on the future of the world in the shape of underdevelopment which is persisting and in some cases  is growing worse.197.	The eleventh special session of the General Assembly  which was held in this same hall a few weeks ago  made no mistake about that subject. True  the session did not come to an agreement; but lei us at least give it credit for having emphasized the importance of the subject and for having pointed the way for us to proceed on the crucial subjects.198.	While there was no formal adoption of a text  the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade won a consensus. Aims were defined  main lines mapped out and pledges made. There is no need for these to be modified. France  for its part  will uphold them firmly.199.	Next  resolution S-11/4 which was adopted by the Assembly with regard to the least developed countries expressed a deep-rooted  widespread conviction. The new international economic order must operate to the benefit of all but primarily to that of the poorest and the most impoverished. This priority and the concrete measures it implies can no longer be forgotten. They will serve to guide France's actions.200.	There remains a last obstacle before global negotiations can be opened and the balanced text proposed by the Chairman of the negotiating group provides us with the means to overcome it. My country  which within the framework of the European Community has consistently directed its efforts towards compromise  believes this text should be acceptable to all. It invites this General Assembly not to disband without arriving at the agreement that is indispensable on this point if global negotiations are to begin by 1981. Indeed  my country could not understand how procedural differences could prevent or delay what must constitute a major step in the construction of a new international economic order.201.	The critical period we have entered calls for a longer term effort to strengthen the structures of international cooperation at all levels: first  the world level  then the level of East West relations and. lastly  the level of regional cooperation.202.	The world level is pre-eminently the level on which  within the framework of our Organization  universal law is both defined and affirmed. All States are equally called upon to play a part in shaping that law. No State can escape its duties.203.	That is why it is so important for the membership of our Organization to be enlarged by the entry of new States and why its activities benefit from their participation. In particular  that is win my country is glad to see China playing a more and more active role in the work of our Organization after having been for too long unjustly kept outside.204.	The law we want to see become the norm must henceforth be a universal one.205.	This law must be universal with regard to human rights  which it defines and protects and whose progress it untiringly ensures  That is also why the World Conference on the status of women  ""held at Copenhagen  has evoked such a wide response in all quarters. That is also why so many countries  among them France  have taken and are continuing to take a standâin spite of the friendship they continue to bear towards the Iranian peopleâagainst the violation of law constituted by the holding of American diplomats as hostages in Teheran. By liberating them  Iran will once again assume its place within the international community.206.	This law is universal  also  with regard to defining a new international economic order and with regard to the question of disarmament. It applies even beyond the context of the global negotiations which  as 1 have already said  France firmly expects to see started in 1981  and the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea is a good and important example of this universality. On this subject  I should like to welcome and express the great hopes aroused by the progress that has recently been achieved in this area and that augurs well for a favourable conclusion in the near future. By the same token  France  which has pleaded more strongly than any other country for disarmament to become the concern of us all  is extremely pleased with the new impetus given to the work of the Committee on Disarmament at Geneva  from 5 February to 29 April and from 12 June to 9 August this year  and with the birth of the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research  which is now assured.207.	Finally  the law is universal in the political area. False realism cannot make us accept as irreversible situations which have been created by force alone. When law is violated  silence acts as an accomplice. One cannot support the self-determination of peoples in one area and show indifference to it in another.208.	Law  like peace  is indivisible. It would be a mistake to think it is powerless when it expresses itself through the unanimous voice of the international community. In this respect  the role of our Organization is one that cannot be replaced. Its effectiveness is in direct proportion to the support we give it.209.	However important it may be to strengthen the structures of international order on a world level  we cannot forget that the relationship between Fast and West remains  in many respects  one of the key elements of that order.210.	At this level the main factors hinge on two States  which are called superpowers precisely because they alone have the power to thrust the world headlong into general conflagration. These factors hinge first on their conduct and next on their relations with each other.211.	As far as their conduct is concerned  my country is the friend and ally of one of them. Looking beyond ideological differences  it has with the other relations of cooperation which it values and hopes to be able to maintain and develop. In the past my country did not conceal its feelings about United States policy in Viet Nam. Today it is compelled to say that the Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan is unacceptable; that no security considerations can justify such action and that it is essential  in the interests of everyoneâand that includes the Soviet Union itselfâto find a political solution to the crisis that is consistent with the legitimate aspirations of the Afghan people and the requirements of international peace.212.	Next  as far as the relations between the two superpowers are concerned  it is in the first place up to those that possess the most formidable arsenals and are constantly striving to increase and perfect them to put an end to the arms race. Last year  the conclusion of the SALT II agreement offered some hope in this direction. Although this undoubtedly was not genuine disarmament  it at least constituted a beginning  and I said at the time that France recognized the importance of the step that had just been taken. Even though I understand the extent to which the international climate puts a strain on that agreement  I should like to repeat here that my country hopes to see it take effect as soon as possible.213.	In addition to the world dimension and the East West dimension of international relations  there is increasingly nowadays a regional dimension.214.	There are  of course  large continental organizations such as the Organization of American States and the Organization of African Unity  and they are constantly reaffirming their vitality and usefulness.215.	But there are also other new associations which arc demonstrating their solidarity and taking common initiatives and actions on a more limited scale. The phenomenon is too widespread not to reflect a profound need. We may rest assured that these groupings  associations and communities will be the pillars of peace and the relay stations on the road to the development of the world of tomorrow. Many examples show that they have already begun to do just this and that the hope is already in the process of becoming a reality.216.	We all remember that the so-called frontline States made an essential contribution to the decolonization of Rhodesia at its most delicate stage. We all remember the initiatives taken by the Islamic Conference and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations [ASEAN). I also have in mind the efforts made by a number of West African countries to help recreate the conditions needed for national reconciliation and civil peace in Chad. I should also like to pay a tribute to the appeal made recently by the President of the Republic of Djibouti for a truce and a negotiated settlement in the Horn of Africa.217.	Lastly  in mentioning the role of the European Community  I should like to recall that France was one of its founding members. The nine member countries are not satisfied merely to cast a brotherly look towards those new associations. They have established direct contacts with several of them  with ASEAN in particular and the Andean Pact.  The nine Community members are preparing to take new initiatives. As a European community  they have long devoted the main part of their efforts to contributing to development. They will continue to do so. But their action is increasingly directed also towards detente and peace. They are less able than ever before to retreat into indifference or a wait and see attitude in the face of the increased dangers. They are no longer satisfied simply to make their voice heard. They have decided to make their presence felt. The mission that Mr. Thorn  current President of the nine members of the European Community  recently undertook to the Middle East on their behalf both implies and announces that decision.218.	Periods of crisis are not the time to stay on the sidelines or abdicate responsibility; they are  on the contrary  a time for responsibility and initiative. The State on whose behalf I speak is the first to be aware of this. France is committed to the free determination of peoples  both for itself and for others; it has shown this many times over the past 20 years. It respects the free choice of the peoples for which it has responsibility. It did so only recently by terminating  on the date arranged  the condominium it had administered with Great Britain in the New Hebrides. It would not allow this free choice to be dictated by others either. France would not allow predetermination to take the place of self-determination.219.	France has experienced the oppression and the trials of war. It understands the suffering caused by violence  intolerance and poverty  and it opens its borders wide to refugees of all origins who seek asylum on its soil.220.	France is party to no conflict and has claims against no one. But it knows the price of security and it is determined to pay it. Having formed many faithful friendships on five continents over the course of a long history  France is open to cooperation with everyone. But it will never compromise on its independence.221.	Do not be surprised if France speaks in grave tones today. Conflicts are multiplying and becoming entrenched; international dialogue  when it is not actually interrupted  does not even manage to get started; and whether the subject is detente  disarmament or peace  it looks as if the world does not dare either to deny these principles or to advance them further.222.	In concluding today on a note of warning and an appeal. France is remaining true to its tradition and its calling. France  like every other State  has national interests to protect  but it recognizes no higher interests than those of peace  justice and progress for mankind."
"50",2477,"GAB",35,1980,"ï»¿It is an honour for me once again to address this Assembly on behalf of my country  Gabon.83.	This new mandate was entrusted to me by the President of our Republic after he had been given a further term of office as head of State of Gabon  last December  by the people of Gabon  unanimously rallying behind its great Party  the Democratic Party of Gabon. It gives me an opportunity to join preceding speakers in addressing to Mr. von Wechmar  on my own behalf and on behalf of the delegation of Gabon  my heartfelt congratulations on his brilliant election to the presidency of the current session of the General Assembly.84.	I should like to take this opportunity to say how pleased I am that his country has made detente one of the keynotes of its foreign policy  a policy which resolutely pursues the same objective as the policy of dialogue endlessly advocated by the head of State of Gabon  El Hadj Omar Bongo  and which has been a cornerstone of his own political action. It is therefore no coincidence that our two countries long ago established fruitful ties of cooperation.85.	We are experiencing an era of total change  prone to upheavals and tension of all kinds. Because of this  Africa today  more than in the past  is truly at a crossroads  and is called upon to play a predominant role in the search for peace and security in the world.86.	In the same context  I should like to commend the highly positive contribution of Mr. Salim A. Salim  of the United Republic of Tanzania  President of the thirty-fourth session  for the remarkable work that he did during his term of office.87.	A year ago  from this very rostrum  I deliberately made hope the watchword of my intervention  and I am pleased to point out that that hope was not altogether unwarranted  since today we rejoice at the admission of two new Member States to our Organization: Zimbabwe  which joined the international community during the eleventh special session  and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  which we welcomed just a few days ago.88.	We are extremely pleased to express to those two fraternal States our heartfelt welcome. We are convinced that their participation in our discussions will make a positive contribution to the work of our Organization which  in the face of serious events of the day  more than ever needs the goodwill and efforts of all  in order to ensure the triumph of reason and wisdom  the safeguarding of peace and the realization of our common objectives. As an African country  we are particularly gratified at the presence among us of Zimbabwe which  following a bitter struggle against injustice  oppression and blatant colonialism  has recovered its dignity and its sovereignty over that portion of our African land.89.	My country also wishes to commend Great Britain for having finally realized that it had to accept its responsibility and guide that country to independence. In this context  we cannot fail to mention the unremitting and highly commendable efforts of our Secretary General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  in the defence of just causes.90.	There can be no doubt that  following this new victory won by Africa  the strategy devised by the OAU for the liberation of Namibia and the elimination of racial segregation from South Africa  together with the work of the international community  will achieve the same decisive results.91.	That is the lesson that the Government of South Africa must draw from the Zimbabwe experience. To those who still refuse to face up to reality and to understand that Africans are sufficiently mature to accept responsibility for their own future  Zimbabwe's attainment of independence has just provided irrefutable evidence that it is not possible to curb or stem the irreversible course of history  and that the African people  more than any other  knows how to practise the policy of extending a helpful hand.92.	The Pretoria Government must  before it is too late  accept the fact that  if it really s to escape from that isolation to which it has been confuted by universal condemnation  it must restore to the whole of Namibiaâin other words  including the port of Walvis Bayâits legitimate rights usurped and confiscated in defiance of United Nations decisions. Likewise it must grant to the South African people  and I am speaking of the black majority  the rights inherent in the very nature of human beings  which continue to be denied them because of their colour.93.	How many resolutions must international forums such as ours adopt  how much longer must nations that cherish justice and peace be patient before the Pretoria Government comes to its senses?94.	This question is addressed to the Government of South Africa  a sector of whose white population does not necessarily approve of the policy of apartheid  as well as to the Governments of countries that would have us believe they are in a position to induce it to see the light.95.	More than ever before  evil seems to have taken hold of the human race. And we  as defenceless guinea pigs  have no alternative but to voice  in confusion  anguish and fear  our protest in the face of the catastrophe towards which we are irremediably headed  as new weapons  ever more sophisticated and deadly  are produced.96.	Interplanetary satellites are being placed in orbit day after day to monitor our every movement and to prepare holocausts  while thousands of men  women and children are dying of hunger and poverty each day. It is true that for the most part the victims belong to the third world and that their death makes it possible to reduce the population explosion which some believe to be at the root of all our ills; however  these same individuals do not attempt to reduce other explosions  namely nuclear ones.97.	There is reason to believe that racism  underdevelopment  poverty and many injustices are in fact but the different facets of one and the same evil  that is  lack of consideration by wealthy peoples in the East and the West alike for the peoples of the third world  because with any sense of logic  one would endeavour further to reduce and then eliminate the scourges that afflict and decimate our mankind  scourges such as war  hunger  disease and poverty and thus save life rather than destroy it.98.	Allow me to dwell a little on this aspect of North South relations  the relations between those that die of hunger and those that die of opulence; between those that die of boredom  disgusted because they have nothing further to wish for since the world in which they live has willed everything to them  and those that die of despair  aware that they will never be able fully to realize their aspirations because of a lack of means. These are just a few of the sad contradictions of our world  contradictions that I should like to place before you for reflection.99.	I should also like to state that  faithful to our policy of dialogue for the establishment of peace  we believe that any initiative likely to promote or consolidate peace is commendable  as long as it makes it possible to alleviate hardship in our world. That is precisely why we intend to support any initiative taken  in particular by our Organization  with a view to restoring peace wherever armed conflicts have arisen and wherever the freedom and dignity of man are trampled underfoot and existing tension has degenerated into or might become open conflict. The list of such conflicts is very long: from Africa to the Far East  via the Middle East where the Arab people of Palestine continues to be denied its right to self-determination and to existence as a nation and where it sees its cultural and religious values trampled on  as is borne out by the attempts of the Zionist State to annex the eastern part of Jerusalem. We cannot remain insensitive to its cry of despair. That is why we condemn Israel and urge it to understand that it is in its own interest to work towards the restoration of peace in the region.100.	Indeed  be it in sub-Saharan Africa  the Maghreb  the Mediterranean  the Arab Gulf  western Asia or South-east Asia  be it a regional conflict or a conflict between countries that are far apart  law and dialogue must prevail over force and violence  in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and that of OAU  so that we can prevent the establishment of the law of the jungle.101.	I should like to recall here that my Government's stand on questions of international policy stems from the fact that Gabon has made dialogue a fundamental principle of its internal policy and a choice tool for the solution of conflicts among States.102.	Unfortunately  at the international level  certain countries seem to get carried away by their ideology and to seek confrontation rather than agreement  even with those that  in spite of undeniable ideological differences  have proved to be excellent partners at the bilateral level. It is true that many States give the singular impression that they have real respect only for those who vie the most with them.103.	The indifference  even the selfishness  of the rich countries should prompt us in the third world to redouble our efforts to attain that collective self-reliance which seems to have established itself as a mode? within South South technical cooperation.104.	In that connection we are gratified that after the Buenos Aires Conference in 1978  devoted precisely to that question  the African countries in particular have become aware of its importance. Indeed  following the Monrovia Declaration of Commitment of the Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity on Guidelines and Measures for National and Collective Self Reliance in Social and Economic Development for the Establishment of a New International Economic Order  those countries met first at the highest level in their second extraordinary session  held at Lagos on 28 and 29 April 1980  where they adopted the ""Lagos Plan of Action for the Implementation of the Monrovia Strategy for the Economic Development of Africa"".  They then met again at the ministerial level at Nairobi last May. All those initiatives are a demonstration of the political will of Africa to denounce the mimicry and extroversion of a recent past and to assume its own identity  its own personality  rather than having them imposed on it from abroad. In this way  Africa has resolutely declared itself in favour of an endogenous development aimed particularly at guaranteeing food self-sufficiency.105.	What can be more logical than granting priority to rural development? Indeed  although the objectives of the developing countries should not be confined to ""the attainment of certain minimum thresholds""  especially in the area of food  the essential priority in the life of man is  after all  to meet his nutritional needs  hunger in the world being the main scourge of mankind.106.	The problem of food in the developing countries has not in any way lost its seriousness since the World Food Conference  held at Rome in November 1974; unfortunately it has worsened. Any analysis of that question brings us to the need for increased and effective efforts  both in connection with food production and with malnutrition  efforts without which there can be no prospect for peace and stability in the world.107.	Thus the activities of FAO  especially its programmes of technical cooperation and food security  deserve further attention and increased support by all.108.	While all developing countries are endeavouring  relying on their own meagre resources  to step up action to increase agricultural production  foreign aid in real terms shows a disturbing decline. This is not a groundless statement.109.	Indeed  not only has the target accepted for the First United Nations Development Decade of devoting 0.7 per cent of the gross national product to development not been reached  but that percentage was as low as 0.31 per cent in 1977. This is clear and unassailable evidence of the indifference and selfishness of the developed countries that we denounced just a moment ago and which we witnessed during the eleventh special session  devoted to development and international economic cooperation.110.	On that occasion  with just a few exceptions  the representatives of the two blocs developed their usual reasoning  some casting blame on the countries members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries [OPEC] for the present world economic crisis and thus for the decline in aid  the others invoking the colonial heritage to justify their own negative attitude to development aid. But we know that  as far as the OPEC members are concerned  there is really a skilfully orchestrated campaign by the media in the developed countries to find a scapegoat for the economic crisis. We know that in connection with development aid the members of OPEC have by far exceeded 0.7 percent of their gross national product and that they intend to devote $4.4 billion to that end by 1982  through the OPEC special fund  which is financed by voluntary contributions.111.	But  while some denounce the ""excessive profits"" in foreign exchange made by oil producing countries  they ignore or knowingly conceal the exorbitant profits made by the foreign companies that exploit that resource and that turn many developed countries into oil producers whose importance is equal to if not greater than that of certain OPEC countries.112.	It is true that the industrialization of the developed countries  long based on the shameless low-cost exploitation of energy sources  experienced a certain slackening because of increases in the cost of oil. But  before that energy crisis  what did those countries do for the industrial development of the countries whose natural resources they were exploiting? They did nothing  or virtually nothing.113.	I should like to stress here that for the third world countries the search for relative self-reliance requires a true change in mentality  which means no longer considering as valuable only the products marketed by the former metropolitan countries. It is even more necessary that the North South dialogue proceed on the basis of such a change in the collective mentality of the developed countries and the abandonment of their policy of economic domination because  I repeat  agreement must prevail over confrontation.114.	For their part  the developed socialist countries should change their approach to aid to the third world and no longer take refuge  in order to justify their attitude  in the argument that it is the responsibility of the former colonizers alone to help the developing countries and thus redress the injustice done to them.115.	That is the price that must be paid for the establishment of a new  more just and more equitable international economic order  the idea of which the developed countries accept in word but not in deed  as is proved by the failures or semi successesâwe do not quite know what to call themâ of all international economic conferences from the fifth session of UNCTAD  held at Manila in 1979  to the eleventh special session  which was devoted to development  and including the United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development  held at Vienna in 1979 and the Third General Conference of UNIDO  held at New Delhi in 1980. At all those abortive meetings  the developed countries consistently played the part of a blocking minority whenever that power existed  and struggled to achieve it when it did not  as in the case of the negotiations within the framework of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea.116.	However  to conclude on a positive note  let us hope that at the dawn of the third United Nations Development Decade those partisan and selfish demonstrations which we have denounced will give way to a growing awareness of the ideals and principles of the Charter  the only guarantors of the peace and security to which mankind so fervently aspires."
"51",2522,"GBR",35,1980,"ï»¿Mr. President  may I first congratulate you on assuming the presidency of the General Assembly at this thirty-fifth session. You have taken on a task which demands many qualities  not least stamina  firmness and tact. It is a task for which your distinguished record at the United Nations has shown you to be well qualified. I offer you the best wishes of the British Government and of its representation at the United Nations in the weeks and months ahead.2.	In so doing  I wish also to join those who have expressed their appreciation of the efficient and statesmanlike way in which your predecessor  Ambassador Salim of the United Republic of Tanzania  conducted the business of the presidency over the past year.3.	Since I last addressed this Assembly 12 months ago  many terrible things have happened in the world. There has been much cruel and cynical defiance of the principles on which our Charter is based. It would be difficult to say that the world is a safer  more prosperous or happier place today than it was a year ago. Indeed  within the last few days the emergence of a fresh conflict in the Middle Eastern region has given us further cause for anxiety. The tasks confronting all of us remain formidable.4.	But what has happened during the last 12 months has not all been bad. The great majority of the States Members of this Organization have observed the Charter. And things have happened to inspire us and to persuade us  if persuasion were needed  that conflicts can be resolved; that peaceful negotiations can uncover compromises on which warring parties can settle their differences; that perseverance  goodwill and realism  here at the United Nations and elsewhere  can end wars and save human lives.5.	When I last addressed the Assembly  war was still raging in that country which is now called Zimbabwe and which  last 25 August  was welcomed as the one hundred and fifty-third Member State of this Organization. That conflict had been going on for 14yearsâ some  I suppose would say longer. But long  complex and  at times  painful negotiations succeeded in finding a basis on which it could be ended and on which the people of Zimbabwe could be given the opportunity to decide for themselves how and by whom they should be governed. I should like to suggest that  as we enter this thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly  the example of Zimbabwe should inspire us to search all the harder for peaceful  practical and realisticâ and I cannot emphasize the last adjective too muchâ solutions to the major problems that confront the world today.6.	Before briefly surveying those problems  I should like to say a word about the eleventh special session  devoted to development and to international economic cooperation that has just ended. The United Kingdom supported that collective attempt to set a framework for development over the next decade. It was a positive act that accorded well with the ideals of our Charter. Britain accepts  as we all do  that many developing countries face immense social and economic problems. A common effort is essential to ensure that the world economic system evolves to meet the needs of all. But  in making that effort  we must not weaken the foundation of the world's trading  monetary and financial system which has been built up gradually over the years and which has seen an increase in world prosperity unprecedented in human history.7.	I am glad that the special session was able to agree on an International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade and on a resolution concerning the least developed countries . I am disappointed that it proved impossible to reach agreement on procedures for global negotiations. But discussions will continue during this General Assembly. We shall work for a successful launch of the global negotiations on a generally acceptable basis.8.	Meanwhile  I should point out that  despite our own domestic economic problems  the aid programme of my own country is substantial. It is the fifth largest among the aid programmes of the industrialized countries and the seventh highest as a percentage of gross national product. But aid is only one factor in the development process. Private investment and private flows are also essential. In 1978  for example  net private flows from the United Kingdom to developing countries amounted to $8.7 billion  or 2.8 per cent of our gross national product. Trade too is vital. In 1979  18 per cent of Britain's total imports came from developing countries. They were worth $19 billion  or 4.6 per cent of our gross national product. In addition  we continue to work with our partners in Europe to increase aid  trade and investment for the benefit of developing countries. For example  through the Second ACPEEC Convention of Lome signed at Lome on 31 October 1979  the European Community has given to 59 countries in Africa  the Caribbean and the Pacific guaranteed access to our markets for an assured quota of their products. That Convention has also provided and does provide aid and. technical cooperation on a very large scale.9.	I should now like to refer to some of the major conflicts which are on the agenda of this session and to offer some ideas  which I promise will be brief  about how  in the view of the United Kingdom Government  progress can be made towards peaceful solutions.10.	The Middle East conflict is  above all  one which  in our view  cries out for negotiations leading to a peaceful solution. The violence has gone on far too long. Negotiations are bound to be a lengthy and complex process  and they can hardly succeed unless a calmer atmosphere can be created than that which prevails today. Britain appeals again to all concerned to refrain from inflammatory acts and statements. Such restraint would be a major contribution to the attainment of the goal of peace.11.	The British Government welcomes the news that the leaders of Egypt  Israel and the United States are to meet again before long. In the meantime Europe has not been inactive. Britain and its partners in the European Community committed themselves to search for common ground and to gain acceptance of the principles set out by their Heads of Government in the declaration which they issued at Venice on 13 June this year. We believe that these principles  and only these principles  can form the basis for a just and lasting settlement.12.	I said earlier that the great majority of States Members of the Organization had been faithful to the Charter. I wish I could say ""all"". We are pledged to respect the sovereignty of others. We are pledged to refrain from the threat or use of force in international relations. Nine months ago both of those principles were violated by a country which is a permanent member of the Security Council. I refer  of course  to the invasion of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union. One hundred and four Member States voted in this Assembly to condemn it. Nine months later  no end to the conflict is in sight. One million Afghans have sought refuge outside their own country. Tens of thousands of Soviet troops remain there; but they have failed to subjugate the people of Afghanistan. Here  too  let there be a political solutionâa solution which will remove Soviet forces from Afghanistan restore to the people of that country their sovereignty and their independence and enable them to choose for themselves how they shall be governed.13.	The occupation of Afghanistan is not the only violation of the United Nations Charter that we have seen in Southwest Asia in the past 12 months. The detention of the American hostages in Iran is another. International law and common humanity require their immediate release. I take this occasion to remind the Iranian authorities of their obligation under international law to protect the rights of all foreigners residing in their country. I am  of course  especially concerned for those British subjects who are at present detained in Iran and to whom my country's representatives have been denied any access.14.	Speaking of violations of the Charter  the United Nations surely cannot ignore the grave situation that has developed in the past 48 hours between two Member States. Judging by what they themselves have announced  Iran and Iraq are now in a state of undeclared war. I share the view and the fear expressed yesterday by the Secretary General that this conflict could have serious and unpredictable consequences and I echo his call for the utmost restraint  for an end to the fighting and for a negotiated settlement. This surely is no more than the United Nations has a right to expect from two of its Members. Therefore I welcome the fact that  on the Secretary Generalâs initiative  the Security Council will be meeting in informal consultations here this afternoon.15.	Acts of terrorism against diplomatic and consular premises and staff have increased alarmingly in recent years. They threaten the basic fabric of international relations. It is our common duty and our common interest to condemn such acts and to ensure that international terrorism  whatever form it may take  is never allowed to achieve its objective. The British Government is glad that this session's agenda includes proposals to enhance the safety of diplomatic and consular representatives.16.	An increasingly worrying phenomenon in recent years has been the mass exodus of refugees from their own countries. When the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees was set up as a ""temporary"" organization nearly 30 years ago  there were 1.2 million refugees in the world  mainly in Europe; there are now nearly 16 million refugees and displaced persons  principally in Africa and Asiaâthree decades of achievement by the international community. We cannot undo the tragedies that have occurred  but it is not too late to remedy their consequences.17.	Let us take just one case  that of Cambodia. That country is a picture of the human misery that results if the Charter of the United Nations is not respected. The Vietnamese invasion and occupation of Cambodia have created tension and conflict in Southeast Asia. The stand taken by the countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations [ASEAN] has my Government's full support. We believe that there must be a political solution but that there cannot be such a solution without the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Cambodia. That must be the first aim of any negotiations.18.	Meanwhile  the United Nations is doing what it can to alleviate the plight of the people of Cambodia and of the refugees. I pay a tribute to the efforts of the United Nations agencies  the International Committee of the Red Cross [ICRC] and the many nongovernmental organizations which have mounted the relief programme in Cambodia  often in conditions of personal danger. By the end of this year  the joint UNICEF/ICRC operation alone will have spent some $500 million  or $100 for each Cambodian. But there are limits to what we can achieve by humanitarian means. So long as there is no political solution  so long will the suffering continue.19.	Another area of tragic armed conflict is Namibia. Here too a political solution must be found by negotiation. But  unlike the position in the other area  here there already exists a plan approved by the Security Council and negotiations are already well advanced. The British Government remains firm in the belief that the United Nations plan provides the only sure route to a peaceful and democratic settlement with general international recognition. We shall continue to work with the Secretary General and the African States most closely involved to achieve the long overdue agreement on implementation of this plan.20.	I have already referred to Zimbabwe's advance to independence and to membership in the United Nations. That has given my Government great satisfaction  which 1 know is shared by every Member of this Organization. But this new Member of our Organization needs more from us than congratulations. It needs substantial aid to rebuild its economy from the ravages of civil war. My own Government has pledged $180 million of aid to Zimbabwe over the next three years. We have cancelled $53 million of official debt and rescheduled the remainder on favourable terms.21.	Although a number of other offers of assistance have been made  I do not believe that the international community as a whole has yet done enough to put Zimbabwe back on its feet. The damage resulting from years of isolation and of war is enormous. The expectations raised by the peace settlement are high. An international effort to underpin the political and economic stability of Zimbabwe during its first few years as an independent State could secure its future prosperity and enable it to play an influential part in Africa. I believe it to be of the highest importance that such an effort should be forthcoming in the months ahead.22.	As regards South Africa  the British Government's view is clear. We consider apartheid to be morally indefensible and politically unworkable. But if change is to come peacefully in South Africa  it will have to be a step-by-step process. We shall not achieve change  peaceful change  by increasing South Africa's isolation  or by ostracism  or by threats. We cannot know how fast changes will come to South Africa  but there are voices inside the country calling for change and we should not ignore them. What the United Nations can and must do is to continue to remind South Africa that apartheid is a system repugnant to all Members of the Organization and incompatible with its ideals and those of the international community as a whole.23.	I should like to turn now to the efforts which are being made to deal with the larger and more general threats to international security.24.	Mr. President  a few days ago you made an eloquent appeal for new efforts to halt the arms race. As you reminded us  the hopes attached to the Disarmament Decade of the 1970s were cruelly disappointed: global military expenditure continued to grow and arsenals of weapons multiplied. This is a field in which there are no short cuts. In arms control  above all  realism is called for. A comprehensive and step-by-step programme of attainable measures covering both nuclear and conventional weapons is the only realistic approach. Declaratory measures are of very little value; what matters is concrete results. The British Government will continue to work for agreements based on balanced and verifiable agreements. As we do so  we shall remind those with whom we negotiate that in military matters the key to building confidence between nations often lies in a readiness to publish information on such matters as budgets and force levels. The more is known  the less is feared; the more is concealed  the more is suspect.25.	Arms control agreements depend on the existence of a climate of trust; they cannot create it. That too is a matter of realism. Arms control must go hand in hand with security. This hard fact is reflected in the outcome of the Second Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.  I know that progress in negotiations on nuclear disarmament has been slow  and that is frustrating. But I see no reason why our common interest in preventing nuclear proliferation should be diminished in any way. The British Government remains fully committed to the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and is playing a full part in the search for solutions to the outstanding problems and for a renewed consensus.26.	We remain committed to the undertakings we gave in 1975 under the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.  We believe that the Conference process can and should play a valuable role in the management of international relations in Europe. But popular faith in this process has been shaken by the actions of the Soviet Union  not least its invasion of Afghanistan  which violated at a stroke all the principles of the Final Act. We approach the second review session of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe  due to begin at Madrid in November  determined  first  to conduct a thoroughgoing review of the way in which the Final Act has been implemented and  secondly  to examine proposals for its future development.27.	It should be clear from what I have said that the British Government continues to believe that the United Nations has an important role to play in the search for political solutions to the many problems that we all face. But if the Organization is to play that role  we must pay due regard to its structure and its management. We must be careful not to tamper with its institutions in such a way as to impair their ability to perform the functions assigned to them by the Charter.28.	The Organization must set itself the highest standards of good management and economy. Here  obviously much depends on individuals. The United Nations is fortunate to have in its Secretary General someone who justly enjoys the respect of all Members and who in his tenure of office has set the highest standards. We must ensure that efficiency  competence and integrity remain the prime considerations in every appointment to the Secretariat. We must exercise restraint over the proliferation of meetings  which often only consume money and effort with no hope of practical results. We must make the best use of the institutions we have. And  at a time of worldwide economic difficulty  we must eliminate wasteful expenditure and curb the constant expansion of the Organization's budget. If new programmes are to be set up  we must find room for them by first identifying and then bringing to an end other programmes which are now obsolete or of little value.29.	It is easy to expect too much of the United Nation  and it is too easy to decry its achievements. The United Nations provides the forum where ideals and realities come face to face. Our Charter embodies the ideals to which we should continue to aspire. The world supplies the yardstick by which to measure our progress. Our task is simple but gigantic: to seek year by year to bring the reality closer to the ideal."
"52",2593,"GHA",35,1980,"ï»¿The many speakers who have preceded me to the rostrum have already warmly congratulated you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly and paid you a well-deserved tribute on your outstanding qualities of leadership and statesmanship. My delegation also has the greatest pleasure in expressing to you  on behalf of the Government of Ghana  our hearty congratulations on your election. We are gratified to note that you bring to this challenging task the wealth of experience and wisdom which has characterized your long and distinguished career. We are confident that your tact  ability and sober judgement will be a great asset during your tenure of this high office. Your country and mine share historical bonds of friendship enriched and reinforced by mutual respect and fruitful cooperation. We should like to assure you of our ready and sincere co-operation in the discharge of your onerous responsibilities.3.	My delegation was also privileged and proud to have worked under the guidance of your predecessor  our brother Ambassador Salim Ahmed Salim. The firm and able leadership which he gave to the Assembly during the past year's unusually heavy schedule will long be remembered and associated with his presidency. His excellent conduct of the affairs of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly and three special sessions lived up to our highest expectations. To your predecessor  then  we express our appreciation for the excellent work done.4.	To our tireless Secretary-General and his selfless lieu-tenants in the Secretariat we also register our sincere thanks for their priceless dedication and sense of purpose; without them the Organization would not have accomplished so much.5.	Please allow me at this juncture to pay a tribute to the revered memory of our beloved brother Sir Seretse Khama  the late President of Botswana. By his untimely death not only Botswana but Africa as a whole has lost a distinguished patriot  a mature counsellor and an elder statesman who against heavy odds fought courageously  together with the other leaders of the front-line States  against colonialism  racism and apartheid. On behalf of the Government and people of Ghana  we convey our heartfelt condolences to the Botswana delegation and to the friendly Government and people of Botswana on their irreparable and grievous loss.6.	We should also like to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the memory of the late President Josip Broz Tito of Yugoslavia. President Tito was a world statesman who will long be remembered for his unshakable devotion to the cause of peace and international co-operation. He was one of the founding fathers and  until his death  a major pillar of the non-aligned movement  to which my country remains irrevocably committed. President Tito has left an indelible mark on history and his memory will long endure.7.	The accession of new States to membership of the Organization is always an occasion for rejoicing as the event underscores our inexorable progress towards universality. It is in this spirit that Ghana extends a very special welcome to the Republic of Zimbabwe which now takes its rightful place within the comity of nations after years of oppression at the hands of a racist minority regime.8.	We salute the gallant people of Zimbabwe. Theirs was a sacrifice which should remind those who would deny to others the freedom they themselves enjoy that the right to self-determination cannot forever be suppressed.9.	We also extend an equally warm welcome to our brothers and sisters of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines on their accession to nationhood and membership of the United Nations. It is our sincere conviction that the membership of those new States will enrich the world Organization and render it better able to serve the cause of peace  equality  justice and progress.10.	United Africa does not consider the victory in Zimbabwe as an end to the liberation struggle on the continent. We are all the more resolute in our determination to launch the final onslaught against apartheid  bigotry and oppression. No subject has been more thoroughly discussed nor any social system more universally condemned than this obnoxious doctrine of apartheid which the Organization has officially declared a crime against humanity. That apartheid is evil cannot be questioned; that it is a threat to international peace and security cannot be denied; that it is an affront and disgrace to the human race cannot be contradicted. Yet Pretoria continues to treat the decisions of the United Nations with contempt and to act with impunity simply because of the support both economic and military  which that minority regime enjoys from some of the most powerful States Members of the United Nations. The apartheid regime has developed its present military strength and nuclear capability through the direct purchase of equipment from those collaborators in contravention of United Nations decisions.11. Botha even boasts that South Africa has a powerful enough arms industry to surmount an international embargo against it and to put up a fight that will astonish opponents seeking to end white domination in South Africa. We in Africa are prepared to take Botha on and fight to the finish  despite his nuclear bluff. We call upon South Africa's supporters to halt immediately any further military  scientific  technical  commercial  cultural or any other form of collaboration with South Africa and rather support the liberation struggle for a better world order. For our part  we in Ghana remain irrevocably opposed to the doctrine of apartheid since the right to self-determination is inalienable and non-negotiable.12.	Following the high-level consultations held under United Nations auspices  we had sincerely hoped that the independence arrangements for Namibia set out in Security Council resolution 435 (1978) would have been put into effect by now. On the contrary  the Pretoria regime's reaction to the request to co-operate with the Secretary-General and the Security Council for the peaceful transition of the Territory to genuine independence and nationhood has remained dilatory and disappointing. South Africa has shown every type of insensitivity to international opinion and the true aspirations of the people of Namibia. South Africa continues to commit wanton acts of repression within Namibia and to carry out unprovoked attacks against neighbouring African States in a desperate effort to discourage legitimate support for the liberation struggle.13.	South Africa's forcible and illegal occupation of Namibia has lasted much too long. The United Nations is under an obligation to create favourable conditions which will foster peace  stability and friendly co-operation among all the races in South Africa and southern Africa. The Government of Ghana therefore wishes to express sincere support for the initiative taken by the Secretary-General and also calls upon South Africa to co-operate with the current international effort to ensure Namibia's peaceful transition to independence. As we enter upon this new phase of the negotiations  it would be in South Africa's own interests to lend such co-operation since a failure to do so can only lead to an intensification of the armed struggle.14.	My delegation is equally concerned about grave threats to international peace and security in other parts of the world.15.	The Middle Hast situation is still potentially explosive because of the doubtful historical claim by one party to territories it has occupied by force of arms and its determination to settle its citizens in those occupied territories in total disregard of international opinion. We reiterate  in this regard  our opposition to the forcible acquisition of territory as the prize of war. Israel's policies in the occupied territories are inconsistent with international law and constitute an obstacle to comprehensive peace in the region. Particularly disturbing is the ill-conceived decision of the Israeli parliament to merge Arab Jerusalem with the Jewish half of the city in a so-called eternal capital of Israel. That action only helps to heighten tensions and exacerbate feelings.16.	Meanwhile the tragic conflict in Lebanon drags on without any prospect of an early solution. We are apprehensive that  unless urgent and immediate measures are taken  the situation might easily lead to a resumption of hostilities with tragic consequences for an area of the world that has endured so much suffering. We are determined  through our contribution of troops  to assist the United Nations efforts in keeping the peace in southern Lebanon. Our participation in those peace-keeping efforts stems from Ghana's tradition of firm support for the United Nations and our commitment to the global search for international peace and progress. But the success of those operations will continue to depend largely on the forbearance and good will of all the parties involved and on the extend of the co-operation enjoyed by the United Nations troops in the field.17.	In this connection  we wish to recall the concern expressed at the meeting of troop contributors held in Dublin in May 1980 on the initiative of the Irish Government following the harassment of the UNIFIL troops and the casualties they sustained. Such incidents hinder UNIFIL in carrying out its mandate as defined in Security Council resolutions 425 (1978) and 426 (1978).18.	We believe that for UNIFIL or any other United Nations field operations to achieve their objectives it is absolutely imperative that all parties to the conflict be made to co-operate fully with the United Nations troops. They are peace-makers and must be regarded and treated as such. Ghana will welcome any new initiatives which this Assembly may take in order to ensure that UNIFIL's peacekeeping role is clearly understood and supported by all.19.	The Middle East problem continues to be a grave threat to international peace and security. No durable peace in the area is possible without due recognition of the right of the Palestinians to a homeland and the participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO] in any negotiations affecting their future. We gladly welcome  in this context  the decision of the European Community that the PLO be associated with such negotiations. We regard that encouraging decision as an important step forward in the search for a just and durable peace in the Middle East. We commend that initiative and call upon the international community to make every effort to build upon it.20.	My delegation calls on the Assembly  therefore  to reaffirm its desire for peace in the Middle East  to demand the total withdrawal of Israel from all occupied Arab territories and to adopt immediate measures aimed at protecting and preserving the international character of Jerusalem.21.	Since the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly new conflicts have developed in various parts of the world  the latest example of which is the current war between Iraq and Iran. My delegation wishes to appeal strongly to the two warring neighbours to heed the call of the Security Council  in its resolution 479 (1980)  for an immediate cessation of hostilities and to settle their differences by peaceful means. A continuation of the conflict will not only impose unnecessary suffering on their peoples but will also endanger peace and stability in the region. In the same vein  we call upon all other countries to refrain from direct or indirect involvement in the situation.22.	The conflict situations on the African continent are of particular concern to the Government of Ghana. ! refer especially to the current civil war in the Republic of Chad. Unfortunately  the mediation efforts of the Organization of African Unity [OAU] have not succeeded in bringing hostilities to an end. Our own view is that the Lagos Agreement of 21 August 1979 recognizes the Government of National Union and we therefore call upon the various factions in that sister Republic to agree to a cease-fire as a first step in the search for peace. Here again  my delegation hopes that the international community will effectively forbid any type of involvement by outside Powers  so as to create better conditions for an early cessation of hostilities.23.	The world is now witnessing a very tragic phenomenon in the form of an unprecedented refugee problem in the continent of Africa. It is estimated that there are today well over 4.5 million refugees and displaced persons in the continent. The destitution they face is definitely among the most serious anywhere. What is more  host countries have suffered unprecedented aggravation of their own socioeconomic conditions through the influx of those refugees. My country warmly appreciates the work of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other United Nations bodies  such as UNICEF  which are striving hard to resettle those refugees and displaced persons. It is our hope  therefore  that the proposed International Conference on Assistance to Refugees in Africa  which is to deal comprehensively with that phenomenon  will be convened at an early date so that the international community can spell out solutions for that tragedy in Africa. The Ghana Government stands ready to contribute its efforts in that direction.24.	Another issue of grave concern to the international community is that of disarmament and arms control. At the tenth special session  which was expressly devoted to the question of disarmament  the General Assembly in its resolution S-10/2 laid down a programme of action and identified priority areas to which the international community must pay urgent attention if the desired goal of disarmament is to be achieved and the threat to the survival of the human race removed. Furthermore  at its two substantive sessions held in May 1979 and May 1980 the Disarmament Commission identified elements for a comprehensive disarmament programme and recommended goals which the international community should endeavour to reach during the Disarmament Decade. The Disarmament Commission specifically restated the urgency of halting the nuclear arms race and highlighted the special responsibility of the major nuclear Powers in that regard.25.	Yet the arms race is accelerating by leaps and bounds and reliable sources have estimated that total expenditure in that field amounts to the staggering figure of approximately $500 billion per year. Such expenditure is not only wasteful but demonstrates insensitivity to the plight of mankind  the majority of whom live below the poverty line.26.	It is therefore a matter of deep regret that practically all bilateral and multilateral negotiations on disarmament have come to a virtual standstill  except perhaps for negotiations taking place within the Committee on Disarmament at Geneva. Even the modest ceilings agreed upon under the SALT II Treaty have now been put in serious jeopardy by recent developments in the Middle East and Asia. My delegation is of the view  however  that we must not despair and that it is even more urgent now than ever before that the United Nations should strive relentlessly in exploring all possible ways and means of defusing the present situation so that we can march forward resolutely towards the achievement of the goal of disarmament.27.	About two decades ago our Dr. Kwame Nkrumah said  ""Seek ye first the political kingdom and all else shall be added unto it"". To us in the developing world the struggle for political independence was not merely an opportunity to reassert our birth right and exercise our sovereign will; it also signified the beginning of a greater struggle for our economic emancipation. We have no illusions about the magnitude of this struggle  compounded as it is by the worsening international economic situation  which is characterized by inflation  recession and high rates of unemployment.28.	In the light of the growing interdependence of nations we have all sought solutions to a variety of global problems through international co-operation. We launched the First and the Second United Nations Development Decade with great hopes and in the belief that our interdependence had imposed on us a responsibility for mutual self-help and assistance. It was with the same high hopes and in the same belief that we also launched the new international economic order some seven years ago  only to find that our efforts had not been matched by the requisite political will and international commitment that would enable us to achieve those structural changes necessary for the establishment of a fair  just and equitable order. The eleventh special session  in which  once again  we placed high hopes  fell short of expectation as it failed to achieve the important objectives of adopting the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade and launching the global negotiations on international economic -cooperation for development. My delegation regrets that the largely negative results of those international initiatives cannot but undermine the prospects of a fruitful North-South dialogue. We none the less remain confident that the current session of the General Assembly provides yet another opportunity for a veritable breaking of this stalemate.29.	The food and agriculture situation has worsened in an increasing number of developing countries. Today hunger and famine are wreaking untold havoc in many parts of the developing world  especially in the least developed countries. The drought situation in several of those countries forcefully demonstrates that no marked improvement in the lot of the affected peoples is possible without the willingness and determination of the international community to adopt bold and far-reaching measures to stem the tide of this growing crisis.30.	In our view  a realistic solution does not lie solely in a perpetual provision of food aid  which in reality amounts to nothing more than a postponement of difficult answers and the prolongation of dependence on others  when self- reliance is so obviously essential. Our strategy should be to encourage sustained food production in the developing countries to enable them to be self-sufficient as regards their basic food needs.31.	It is clear that the success of any programme to feed the starving millions will to a large extent be determined by our capacity to cope with the energy crisis and to develop alternative sources of energy. It is in this regard that we anxiously look forward to the forthcoming United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy to be held at Nairobi. We trust that the decisions which result from the deliberations of the Conference will inspire a firm international commitment to provide adequate financial and technical resources to assist the developing countries to explore and exploit their energy potential to the full. In this connection my delegation appreciates the value of the Energy Fund to be set up by UNDP.  We are also greatly encouraged by the discussions taking place within the World Bank system aimed at instituting similar measures for the benefit of the poorer members of the international community.32.	The thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly holds a very special significance for my delegation since it coincides with the first anniversary of my country's return to civilian rule after seven years of military administration.33.	The events which preceded that change-over and the complexity of the social and economic problems bequeathed to my Government are already well known to the international community  which has shown much sympathy and understanding. My Government assumed the reins of power on the basis of a full commitment to democracy and the promotion of human rights. Those concepts  which are enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations  are also embodied in the Constitution of the Third Republic of Ghana. As we mark this first anniversary  therefore  my Government wishes to rededicate itself to the noble ideals which inspired the founding fathers of this Organization.34.	Experience has taught us in the developing world that our salvation lies essentially in our own hands and that our progress and prosperity can be guaranteed only if we concert our efforts through collective self-reliance. The convening at Lagos of the second extraordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU  devoted solely to economic problems  demonstrates Africa's collective determination to pursue a course of self-reliance. My delegation renews the appeal to the international community to lend maximum support to the Lagos Plan of Action for the Implementation of the Monrovia Strategy for the Economic Development of Africa  in order to supplement Africa's efforts to achieve its social and economic goals.35.	The problems which face the international community are as grave as they are varied. It is none the less true that we possess the means of resolving them all. What is required is the unequivocal political will and determination on the part of the international community to find solutions which will bring real benefit to every one of its members. All of us are concerned about the survival of the human race. We must therefore strive together to remove all sources of fear  prejudice and injustice and to establish a world order which will guarantee the peace and progress of all nations. I need hardly assure the Assembly that in this task the Government of Ghana will continue to play its full role."
"53",2639,"GIN",35,1980,"ï»¿Allow me to extend to you  Mr. President  the warmest congratulations of the delegation of the Revolutionary People's Republic of Guinea on the occasion of your election as President of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. Your election is fully justified by your qualities as a statesman  your knowledge of the special problems of the developing countries and the attachment of your country  the Federal Republic of Germany  to the policy of detente and international co-operation. All of these factors  we are convinced  offer the best guarantee of the success of our work. We should like to assure you of the full co-operation of the Guinean delegation.51.	We also wish to express our deep gratitude to your predecessor  our brother Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim of the United Republic of Tanzania  who has won the admiration of Africa  the third world and the international community by the effectiveness he demonstrated in accomplishing the delicate mission entrusted to him at the thirty-fourth session and the three important special sessions that followed it.52.	We wish to thank him for his remarkable contributions to the establishment of international relations based on justice and understanding among States.53.	Lastly  may we express to the Secretary-General the entire confidence of the Government of the Revolutionary People's Republic of Guinea and in particular that of President Ahmed Sekou Toure for his continued devotion to the realization of the principles and objectives of the Organization.54.	Our delegation is also happy to extend a welcome to the new independent State of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines which has just been admitted into the United Nations  and to express our sincere wishes for its full success in the task of national construction.55.	In my delegation's view  the current problems with which we are concerned today appear to form a pressing and organic whole  in which any isolated sectoral measures would be futile. Thus  in Africa and elsewhere  we note with a certain amount of satisfaction that peoples subject to colonialist and imperialist exploitation are throwing off the yoke of domination.56.	The thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly will be marked by the commemoration of the twentieth anniversary of the historic resolution 1514 (XV)  the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  of which Guinea is honoured to have been one of the initiators.57.	With the victory of the brave people of Zimbabwe over the retrograde forces of colonialism and apartheid  the realization of universality within the Organization  which is one of its major bases  will cease to be a Utopian dream. It will also be proof of the fact that the progress of history towards the complete liberation of colonized peoples is inexorable.58.	However  we are compelled today to note that in southern Africa the repression by the supporters of apartheid is implacably continuing against the South African people. Men  children  women and the aged  who are being denied the most basic rights to life and dignity  are dying each day as martyrs.59.	This is the occasion to point to the permanent danger to independent Africa represented by the possession of nuclear weapons by the Fascist Government in Pretoria  which is guilty of such acts before history.60.	In tackling the question of Namibia  we realize that the imperialist Powers  while pretending to be sympathetic to the question of the flouting of human dignity by the supporters of the system of apartheid  are in fact concerned only about the dividends that result from the investments made in that country by multinational corporations. The South African presence in Namibia no longer has any justification in law. The international community should attempt to rehabilitate itself by making an effective  worthwhile contribution to decolonization in that African territory.61.	Faced with the heinous crimes perpetrated by the minority Fascist regime of Pretoria  our delegation addressed an urgent appeal to the entire international community to provide increased material and moral support to the liberation movements in South Africaâto the African National Congress of South Africa [ANC] and the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania [PAC]  as well as to the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO]  which remains the sole and legitimate representative of the Namibian people.62.	The delegation of the State-Party of Guinea calls insistently for the application of the sanctions provided for in Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations against the Fascist regime of Pretoria. It is in this spirit that we support the holding of an international conference on sanctions against South Africa as decided at Monrovia at the thirty- third ordinary session of the Council of Ministers of the Organization of African Unity [OAU] and reaffirmed at the seventeenth ordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU  which was held at Freetown.63.	Everywhere in the world hotbeds of tension persist  whether in Africa  in South-East Asia  or in the Middle East.64.	In Africa  the question of Western Sahara has been the object of important recommendations by the Ad Hoc Committee of Heads of State of the OAU  called the committee of wise men  aimed at finding a final solution to that painful conflict. In the view of my delegation  my country being a member of that Committee  it would not be timely for the United Nations to take a decision which might compromise the possible chances of success in achieving an acceptable solution.65.	Experience shows that the solution of a problem as complex as that of Western Sahara does not necessarily lie in the simple adoption of resolutions or in condemnation but rather in the concrete demonstration of good will and the exercise of loyal co-operation on the part of all the parties concerned and involved.66.	The civil war which continues in Chad is claiming new victims each day  and is creating a truly chaotic situation which is a dangerous threat to that country's unity. In spite of the hostilities in Chad and in its capital  N'djamena  African heads of State  among them those of Togo  Congo  Benin and Guinea  continue to make laudable and constant efforts to bring the parties to agree to a cease-fire with a view to the proper implementation of the Lagos agreement of 21 August 1979 which remains the sole basis for the proper settlement of this problem.67.	Our delegation urges the General Assembly to take note  at the current session  of the fact that the question of Chad  which remains an African problem and must therefore find an African solution  should not be the object of the adoption of any decision apart from those on humanitarian aid to be given to that country and to neighbouring countries which suffer from the heavy burden of the thousands of refugees and all the consequences that such a situation can entail.68.	The situation of the people of the Comoros  arbitrarily divided  is also a source of constant concern to the delegation of the State-Party of Guinea  which calls for the return of Mayotte to its motherland.69.	With regard to the situation in the Horn of Africa  in the coastal States of the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean  the existence of foreign military bases and the new tension brought about in the region are a source of great concern to us.70.	We wish to draw the attention of countries in the sub-region of the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean to the fact that the installation of foreign military bases always compromises the progress and independence of a country. The Revolutionary People's Republic of Guinea condemns the existence of military bases on foreign soil as running counter to the Charter of the United Nations and to the principle of non-alignment.71.	The solution of the Middle East crisis calls for the following: recognition by all States of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to independence and to national sovereignty; the withdrawal by Israel from all occupied Arab territories; the end of repeated aggressions against Lebanon and respect for its territorial integrity  and participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]  the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  in all discussions relating to the settlement of the Middle East conflict.72.	These proposals of the international community  which have a just basis  unfortunately come up against the permanent obstinacy and aggressiveness of Israel.73.	It is timely for us at this point to reiterate the appeal to the effect that the international community take decisive measures with a view to bringing about the repeal of the unilateral decision taken by the Knesset proclaiming Jerusalem the capital of Israel.74.	We are of the opinion that our world Organization should adopt sanctions against any State which supports or endorses the unilateral and unlawful decision of Israel to make Jerusalem its capital  thus violating the international status of the Holy City  the sanctuary of Islam  Christianity and Judaism.75.	Despite the efforts of the Secretary-General  the situation in Cyprus is still tense as regards relations between the two communities  Greek and the Turkish.76.	We sincerely hope that the forthcoming peaceful meeting between the two communities will be crowned with success and we reaffirm our support for the cause of the Cypriot people  for respect for its territorial integrity and its national independence without foreign interference.77.	The situation prevailing in the Asian continent reveals the existence of hotbeds of military confrontation which threaten to grow larger.78.	Our insistence at this session  as at the thirty-fourth session  on the restoration of Kampuchea's seat to the Government of Phnom Penh bears witness to our desire to be realistic. We think it is contrary to international practice for a Government which does not exercise authority in its country to continue to represent that country in the Organization.79.	In Afghanistan  peace and stability call for respect for the will of the Afghan people freely to decide their destiny without any intervention or foreign interference.80.	Moreover  the Iraqi-Iranian conflict cannot leave the Moslem revolutionary people of Guinea indifferent. The United Nations should abstain from any attitude which might complicate that already serious situation  which is a threat to international peace and security.81.	Our delegation supports the steps now being taken by General Zia-ul-Haq of Pakistan  Chairman of the Organization of the Islamic Conference  to use his good offices in this fratricidal conflict.82.	As for the situation of the divided Korean nation  in our view it is necessary and urgent as a pre-condition for the peaceful reunification of the country to transform the present armistice into a durable peace treaty with the withdrawal of the foreign troops stationed in Korea under the United Nations flag.83.	In addition  we reaffirm our full support for the struggle for self-determination waged by the people of East Timor under the leadership of FRETILIN.84.	Latin America  like the Caribbean region  is not spared the attempts at provocation and destabilization being directed by foreign forces against many States in the region.85.	Our delegation remains convinced that foreign intervention  interference in the internal affairs of other States  and the permanent occupation of territories by force are undertakings that will always be doomed to failure. All violations of international law are closely linked with the obstinacy of the imperialist Powers in wishing to maintain an obsolete world order.86.	The solution to the question of disarmament has become an imperative need not only because of the astronomical sums allocated by the great Powers to the arms race  but because of the threat that those weapons pose to mankind. As has been said so rightly by President Ahmed Sekou Toure: ""The unbridled race for the acquisition of means of mass destruction only perpetuates inadmissible differences  discriminations and inequalities as regards the conditions of life of peoples and the relations established between States"".87.	Our delegation subscribes to the measures advocated at the tenth special session of the General Assembly  devoted to disarmament  and also supports the convening of the World Disarmament Conference.88.	The decade that is ending was for us  a developing country  characterized  from the economic point of view  by an aggravation of economic and social underdevelopment: inflation  unemployment  an increase in the foreign debt  malnutrition and many other evils  to which we must add the disasters that weigh heavily on the living conditions of our peoples.89.	This bleak picture is the consequence of the present economic order that is chronically unfavourable to the developing countries. It is thus that at the second extraordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU  which was held at Lagos in April and was devoted to economic matters  President Ahmed Sekou Toure stated:""Let us ask ourselves the question: Who today determines the price of our raw materials? Who today determines the price of goods and equipment? It is foreigners as far as we  a developing country  are concerned.""Is this a service rendered us by foreigners? Not at all. It is always our clients who set the price of what we have to sell to them. It is our suppliers who set the price of what they sell to us. This is a description of poverty  and it is this that leads to the continued impoverishment of our peoples.""90.	Indeed  we continue to believe that negotiations on the major questions already identified on the restructuring of the international economic system should be carried out within the central framework of the United Nations and not elsewhere  with the effective participation of all Statesâ small  large and medium-sized. This forum  which would have all necessary powers and competence for deliberation and decision  would have the advantage not only of allowing for centralized discussions  but also for a coherent co-ordination of all development programmes in favour of the developing countries.91.	Unfortunately  this legitimate aspiration of the developing countries continues to come up against the lack of political will of the industrialized countries. We note in this connection that the results of the eleventh special session of the General Assembly devoted to development questions were rather disappointing.92.	Africa has objectively learnt its lessons from the last two decades. It is a bitter experience. The Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU  for its part  adopted the Monrovia Declaration 10 at the sixteenth ordinary session  in July 1979  and the Lagos Plan of Action for the Implementation of the Monrovia Strategy for the Economic Development of Africa "" at the second extraordinary session in April 1980.93.	The Lagos Plan of Action clearly defines the policies and means of action for development and co-operation as regards our continent. Henceforth  it would be desirable for any aid or assistance to development in Africa to be placed specifically at the service of the implementation of the Lagos Plan of Action  which  in fact  contains the programme for the third development decade for Africa.94.	Without turning the Lagos Plan into a panacea and in order to avoid its becoming inoperative  we address a solemn appeal to the industrialized countries to contribute sincerely to its effective implementation.95.	As is the case in other fields  the agriculture sector has not escaped the crisis. Quite to the contrary. The already meagre results  compromised by the drought  have led to an increase in food dependency and the precariousness of the balance of payments. We must draw the attention of the international community to this serious drought  which exists in certain regions which up to now had been spared by that phenomenon.96.	The remedy to this disaster has consisted so far in the palliative of sending food. But if we want to eradicate the evil and all its effects  what we need now are enormous re-afforestation campaigns in our main river basins  and in particular the re-afforestation of the Fouta-Djallon massif  which is the main source of water for western Africa.97.	That is why our delegation is addressing an appeal to the United Nations  the specialized agencies and all those of good will in order that one of the pilot projects of UNEP  the one relating to the Fouta-Djallon massif  be carried out as soon as possible.98.	The world is characterized by events which occur pell-mell and whose effects on international relations  especially regarding peace and security  are very often negative. It is we  the developing countries  who suffer the most. In order satisfactorily to resolve those problems in the light of this disturbing situation  we must give greater effectiveness to the means available to the United Nations.99.	While the Charter of the United Nations is essentially part of the historical undertaking of mankind to work towards the establishment of an era of true freedom  international economic justice and the effective preservation of peace and world security  it is today necessary  more than in the past  to envisage the adaptation of its structures and performance to the expanding framework of international relations. The vitality of any institution resides in its capacity for adaptation to the times and to events.100.	Thus  the revision of the Charter  as well as the equitable representation of all the regions of the world in the decision-making bodies  in particular the Security Council  become imperatives.101.	Convinced as we are of the importance of the role assigned to the United Nations for the safeguarding of international peace and security  my delegation reiterates its sincere willingness and readiness to work  together with all States  to improve the climate of disquiet and insecurity which prevails in the world today  thus favouring the advent of a world of peace  justice and social progress."
"54",2681,"GMB",35,1980,"ï»¿I should like first of all to extend to Ambassador von Wechmar my sincerest congratulations on his election to the high office of President of this important regular session  the thirty-fifth since the General Assembly first convened more than three decades ago. His election coincides with a momentous period in the history of the United Nations and  indeed  of humanity  when the dangers and challenges facing nations  individually and collectively  are unprecedented in the second half of the twentieth century. However  with his brilliant record and experience in international affairs  and his country's exemplary record in the field of development assistance to developing countries like the Gambia and its contribution to world peace  we are confident that the momentum of progress generated at the preceding session will continue and even accelerate at this session.208.	At this juncture  I should like to pay a tribute to the outgoing President  Ambassador Salim  whose brilliant performance and enlightened leadership at the thirty-fourth session have enhanced the image of Africa  the third world and the United Nations as a whole.209.	We also thank the Secretary-General for the excellent services he has continued to give the Organization and for his deep understanding of current international problems  particularly  the special problems of the poorer members of our family of nations.210.	Many  if not all  the speakers who preceded me have  as a previous sessions  brilliantly dilated on the current international situation and  as the debate continues  such questions will receive the close attention of representatives at various levels. The significance of this coincidence of thought and approach in so diverse a group is that it demonstrates and underscores the common concern of all States  big or small  powerful or weak  to sensitize mankind to the urgent need for peace as the only alternative to conflicts. It also brings into sharp focus the fact that we are not lacking in ideas and that what we need is action and the firm will to act before it is too late.211.	It was 35 years ago that the nations of the world  horrified at the devastation of a war that had never been equalled in dimension and intensity  committed themselves  through the Charter  to ""save succeeding generations from the scourge of war"". Yet  as we meet today  we know that the legacy from the old to the new generation is an estate of insecurity  conflicts and stagnation. Indeed  as the year 2000 approaches faster than we realize  the earlier expectations of a better life are eluding humanity  which is caught in a web of escalating tension and conflict  economic dislocations  food crises  energy problems and the contagion of inflation.212.	The history of the United Nations has shown that its first two decades were significantly dominated by political issues which represented residual problems for which peace in 1945 did not adequately provide. Today  it is very clear that the greatest threat to world peace is caused by economic problems affecting  on the one hand  the internal stability  especially of developing nations and  on the other hand  aggravating the already inequitable relations between the industrialized countries of the North and the third world countries of the South. It is natural  therefore  that at this session the Assembly will need to focus attention on the current economic issues that underlie the more visible and explosive political crises.213.	In this regard  it is important to stress the need for a general awakening to the evolved state of international economic relations. Today  we live in a world in which there is no room for domination and power. Rather  there is growing interdependence in which global interests must be decided by consensus. It is inevitable from this mutual dependence that new economic arrangements and relationships must be forged to consolidate that kind of interdependence between the industrialized and developing countries that will be based on the sharing of power and responsibilities. This new situation is born out of the fact that since 1945  over 100 new countries  mainly from the third world  with over one billion people  have become involved in international life. This calls for new dimensions of international thinking and action. Indeed  we are in an era of negotiations.214.	What is Africa's position in this evolving and complex economic framework? The problems and preoccupations of Africa in this regard  and indeed in every sphere of international relations  have been eloquently stated by the current Chairman of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU  Mr. Siaka Stevens of Sierra Leone  in his keynote address at this session. I can only  therefore  modestly give complementary support to that eminent spokesman for our continent.215.	While we do not ignore the universality of contemporary economic problems  it is equally incumbent upon the community of nations to recognize the special plight of the developing countries in general  and Africa in particular. The case of Africa is illustrated by the stark fact that our continent is the least developed  with gross domestic product stagnating at 2.7 per cent of the world level  and per capita income averaging $166. Perhaps these economic indicators are the ominous reflections of the fact that 20 out of the 31 least developed countries of the world are African countries. Yet the picture should not have been so bleak for Africa  for the continent has immense human and natural resources that should ensure its development. This was eloquently highlighted in the report of the Secretary- General of the OAU at the second extraordinary session of the OAU Assembly  devoted to economic matters  in which it is stated that""In addition to its reservoir of human resources  our continent has 97 per cent of world reserves of chrome  85 per cent of platinum  64 per cent of manganese  25 per cent of uranium and 13 per cent of copper; 20 per cent of hydro-electrical potential  20 per cent of traded oil ... 70 per cent of cocoa production  one third of world coffee production  50 per cent of palm produce.""'7216.	Is it therefore not a paradox that with all this wealth  Africa remains the most underdeveloped region of the world  despite all the efforts made by its leaders to emerge from such a state of underdevelopment? It was in search of an answer to this question that African leaders met at the first OAU economic summit at Lagos on 28 and 29 April 1980 and adopted the Lagos Plan of Action. As stated by the current OAU Assembly Chairman  the plan is a ""priority action programme"" and is born out of the frustrations and unfulfilled promises and expectations of successive global strategies over the last 20 years  more sharply felt in Africa than in any other continent.217.	The Plan of Action is an African option for collective self-reliance that must have primacy over other protracted negotiations which have not made any significant progress. It can be called an African order based on horizontal cooperation leading to the establishment of an African Economic Community by the year 2000. We believe that it is only through our combined economic strength that it will be possible to establish a new universal economic order in which domination and power will give place to equality  justice and solidarity.218.	It is no less ironic that the preceding two development decades have witnessed a marked aggravation of the world food situation  especially in Africa  where it has been accentuated by drought and other natural disasters. The food crisis in the Sahel is one of the most serious effects of drought in Africa in recent times. This problem was eloquently brought into the limelight when our head of State  Alhaji Sir Dawda Kairaba Jawara  addressed the thirty- third session of the General Assembly in his capacity as Chairman of the Conference of the Heads of State and Government of the Permanent Inter-State Committee on Drought Control in the Sahel. The Assembly  as well as the entire international community  was sensitized to the drought and its long-lasting effects on the Sahel. It is my duty  therefore  to remind the international community that despite national efforts and international intervention  the situation in the Sahel has not improved significantly. This year  the rains came very late  and most Sahelian countries have been hit by drought. Consequently  by mid-August  the Sahel had an estimated deficit of 800 000 tons of cereal grains needed to feed its populations. We therefore call upon the international community to rally to the timely appeal made by the current Chairman of the Inter-State Committee  President Moussa Traore of the sister Republic of Mali.219.	Apart from the direct effects the shortage of food has on the populations of our agrarian economies  food insecurity is a major constraint on the development of our countries. It causes increased food imports  resulting in a loss of much-needed foreign exchange earnings. The magnitude of the problem is illustrated by the disclosure by FAO that Africa's grain imports will increase from 11 million metric tons in 1978 to 15 million metric tons in 1985. Imports had already risen from 4.2 million metric tons in 1970 to the 1978 level. Thus  our foreign exchange earnings  already eroded in real terms by the increased worsening of the terms of trade  are consequently being consumed by this rising import bill  instead of being augmented through domestic investments for economic development.220.	Because we recognize that the primary responsibility for increasing food production is ours  our aim is an immediate improvement in the food situation and to lay the foundations for the attainment of self-sufficiency. To this end  we in the Gambia continue to pursue  as a matter of priority  the execution of the Trans-Gambia Barrage Project within the framework of the Gambia River Basin Authority  an organization that brings together Guinea  Senegal and the Gambia in a collective effort to develop the entire basin of the River Gambia. As President Jawara said here in 1978  we see the development of our entire water resources as the solution in the matter of increased food and cash crops in the region.221.	Our own efforts  however  need to be complemented by international assistance on a scale that will induce a real breakthrough in this important matter of human need and economic development. That is why we appreciate food aid only in the context of emergency relief. What we really need in the Gambia and in the Sahel in general is greater financial participation in infrastructural projects such as dams which  once operational  will reduce and perhaps eliminate total dependence on the weather. Indeed  by enabling us to harness our water resources for agricultural self-sufficiency objectives and for our energy needs  food aid will significantly decline or even disappear and thereby make available scarce resources for more development projects.222.	While food and armaments occupy the opposite extremes in the international spectrum  their relationship was brought out in staggering clarity in the Brandt Commission report.  The Commission found that one modern tank costs $1 million  an amount that could provide storage facilities for 100 000 tons of rice  and that 1 Vi per cent of one year's world military expenditure could pay for all the farm equipment needed to increase food production and approach self-sufficiency in food-deficient low-income countries within a decade. These facts call for a halt in the arms race so that the resultant savings could be channelled to productive economic activities in the more disadvantaged regions of the world.223.	It is against this unfavourable economic background that the eleventh special session of the General Assembly convened here just a few weeks ago. I recall that on the eve of that much-heralded session the ministers of the Group of 77 expressed the hope that  in a spirit of co-operation  interdependence and mutual benefit  the industrialized countries would approach the negotiations with a new sense of purpose and with the political will indispensable to the success of the special session. The appeal was not heeded and  as we all know  the eleventh special session did not achieve its objectives. It only confirmed that the main impediment towards progress in the establishment of the new international economic order is the opposition of many developed and industrialized countries to measures for the restructuring of the international economic system in a way that will ensure equity  justice and stability in global economic relations. The failure of the session is not only a great disappointment but also a matter of serious concern  as it has far-reaching adverse implications for international cooperation  world peace and security.224.	Despite this unexpected setback and the present stale-mate  new efforts should be deployed during the current session for the resumption of meaningful negotiations in January 1981  which will  significantly  coincide with the coming into operation of the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade. Already our expectations have been raised by the consensus that emerged from the eleventh special session of the General Assembly in regard to measures to meet the critical situation in the least developed countries. We trust that the measures called for in General Assembly resolution S-11/4 will be accorded the speedy implementation which they deserve and that concrete steps will be taken in the current session to ensure the success of the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries  which will launch the substantial new programme of action for the 1980s.225.	In this regard we must stress again that only a massive flow of official development assistance  in real terms  as untied grams to least developed countries  will help the least developed countries to surmount their structural problems and achieve the desired levels of socio-economic development. The proposed establishment of an international development fund  through which substantial disbursements of official development assistance resources for the least developed countries will be channelled  should significantly facilitate the successful implementation of the substantial new programme of action called for in UNCTAD resolution 122 (V).226.	This is the bleak economic climate in which the General Assembly at its thirty-fifth session is debating world issues. I now turn to political matters.227.	While economic questions have dominated the world scene in the last decade  serious political problems continue to threaten world peace. The international situation in the past few years has been characterized by widespread unrest  conflicts and crises which have threatened the survival of some States and the very foundation of our community of nations. Even as we meet now to discuss world problems  many of our populations  especially in the third world  are living in fear and insecurity and under the spectre of war. In Africa  the Middle East and Asia particularly  the evil forces of militarism and war have already been unleashed to the detriment of our peoples and our development objectives.228.	The African scene has already been effectively represented by Africa's spokesman  the current Chairman of the OAU Assembly  Mr. Siaka Stevens of Sierra Leone. Permit me  however  to refer briefly to some of these burning issues.229.	Against the gloomy political climate that prevailed in parts of Africa  we have scored a major success in southern Africa. The date 18 April 1980 will long be remembered in Africa'^ long struggle for freedom as the date on which Zimbabwe was born out of the blood of its martyrs and the indomitable character of its valiant people. We hail the independence of the fiftieth member State of the OAU under the enlightened leadership of that great statesman and son of Africa  Prime Minister Robert Mugabe. Indeed  the victory of the Patriotic Front over the forces of colonialism and racism is a great triumph for Africa and a major step towards the total decolonization of our continent  an objective that is entrenched in the OAU Charter. It is also a victory that demonstrates the iron will of the people of Africa to be free  and an inspiration for the oppressed peoples of the rest of southern Africa to continue  with our support  their legitimate struggle for freedom  justice and human dignity.230.	Zimbabwe is a lesson that demonstrates the magnanimity  generosity and virtue of the African who  in the hour of victory and glory  can forgive the defeated oppressor and extend the hand of co-operation to a minority in the task of national reconstruction. That is the essence of the African struggle: love of freedom in fraternity and equality for the good of all. It is also a lesson to South Africa's friends.231.	As we celebrate the birth of the one hundred and fifty-third Member of the United Nations  let us not be led into complacency and the consequent relenting of the momentum and intensity of the struggle in Namibia and South Africa. Our steadfast aim must be the attainment of independence by Namibia at the earliest opportunity. To this end we urge the Security Council to take effective action to terminate South Africa's illegal occupation of Namibia so that our brothers and sisters there  led by SWAPO  their true and authentic representative  may exercise their inalienable right to self-determination and independence. At this juncture I must remind the international community that  as long as any portion of African territory  even as little as a square metre  remains under foreign domination  the independence of Africa will be incomplete and insecure. The struggle will therefore continue.232.	With regard to inter-African problems in Western Sahara  Chad and the Horn of Africa  we  especially in the Gambia  are satisfied that OAU is the only machinery that can effectively resolve them. Extra-African interests must therefore desist from interfering  in any manner  in the process of mediation and reconciliation already started by the OAU.233.	Another success that marked the African calendar this year is the significant progress made in the important area of human rights. When African leaders meeting at Monrovia in 1979 decided to have an African charter on human and people's rights  many were the cynics outside Africa who doubted our will  our seriousness and even our ability to implement decision 115 (XVI) adopted at the sixteenth session of the Assembly of the OAU.  Yet by December 1979 African legal experts had met and elaborated at Dakar a draft charter  to the surprise of the enemies of Africa. This was the context in which  together with our firm commitment in the Gambia to respect for and promotion and protection of human rights  we were privileged to act as host to the first OAU Ministerial Meeting to study the draft African Charter on Human and People's Rights.234.	Although the Banjul conference of June 1980 did not complete its work  much progress was made  given the magnitude and importance of the task and the expeditious manner in which the Monrovia decision was implemented. Furthermore  we must recall that  while the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted by the United Nations in 1948  it was only recently that the very important International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic  Social and Cultural Rights were adopted and brought into operation. But Africa is not going to delay the adoption of the draft Charter  and already the OAU Ministerial Meeting will reconvene in Banjul in the coming months with the mandate of the Council of Ministers of the OAU at Freetown to finalize the draft for submission at the eighteenth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU.235.	The significance of this development is that it shows the importance that Africa attaches to human rights. We in the Gambia are firmly committed  under the leadership of our great son and humanist  President Jawara  to the protection of and respect for human rights. It is a commitment that is built upon the solid foundation of our domestic laws and that is the major determinant of our foreign policy. Respect for fundamental human rights being the cornerstone of Gambian democracy  it is also the catalyst for our socioeconomic development  for we firmly believe that it is only in an atmosphere of freedom and security that the individual can effectively contribute to the collective good of all. Indeed  the struggle against colonialism  oppression and racism is one for human dignity.236.	The situation in the Middle East has deteriorated since we assembled here a year ago. Contrary to the expectations of peace through dialogue  Israel has now escalated its expansionist and oppressive policies. In total disregard of and contempt for international law and morality  the Zionist regime of Tel Aviv has not only been establishing settlements in occupied territories  but has decided to make Jerusalem the undivided eternal capital of Israel.237.	On the fundamental question of Palestine  we must reiterate that only the PLO  the sole representative of the Palestinian people  can negotiate on behalf of that people for their inalienable right to self-determination and independence. If a durable peace is to come about in the Middle East  there must be an independent Palestinian State established through the restitution of their ancestral lands usurped by Israel. We therefore feel that there should be a negotiated peace between the parties directly concerned  that is to say  the PLO must be involved at all stages as an equal partner.238.	But if we  especially in the Islamic Conference  are to attain our objective of reversing the status quo in the Middle East so that lasting peace may return to the region  we cannot afford to dissipate our efforts on fratricidal conflicts. Such armed confrontations will merely weaken our collective action and strengthen the enemies of Islam. I therefore add my own voice to the appeal made to Iran and Iraq  especially by the Islamic Conference and generally by the United Nations and all peace-loving nations  to normalize their relations.239.	This is the background against which the thirty-fifth session is being held. It is a period unprecedented by economic uncertainty  in which the gap between the rich and poor is not narrowing. It is a time of political crises when the peace  however fragile  that has prevailed since 1945 is now seriously threatened. Yet there is hope of overcoming these difficulties  since those who genuinely want peace outnumber the forces of evil. And as I said at the beginning  we have the United Nations  whose machinery can be strengthened and better used  together with our regional organizations  to translate ideas inspired by the quest for development and peace into action for the common good of humanity."
"55",2719,"GNB",35,1980,"ï»¿In accordance with tradition  this year Europe follows Africa in the presidency of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. That is a sign of our times and confirmation of a form of complementarity which  because it is indispensable  calls for close and dynamic co-operation among nations and continents.249.	I am therefore pleased to extend to Mr. von Wechmar the congratulations of my delegation and to greet him as a worthy representative of a friendly country. My delegation assures him of its co-operation  and extends to him our best wishes in the exercise of his exalted functions.250.	I should also like to extend greetings to his predecessor  our brother and my great friend  Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim of the United Republic of Tanzania. My delegation is most grateful to him for having represented our continent  Africa  so successfully. Each time he was called upon to preside over the work of the General Assembly  he gave proof of his competence  modesty and high sense of responsibility.251.	My delegation warmly welcomes the admission of the Republic of Zimbabwe to the United Nations and wishes to express to the representatives of that new State the friendly feelings of the people of Guinea-Bissau and its profound desire to develop and consolidate the fraternal links of co-operation which unite the people of Zimbabwe with the people of Guinea-Bissau. The heroism  the spirit of sacrifice and responsibility which characterized the national liberation struggle in Zimbabwe augur well for the positive and beneficial contribution which that country will make to the Organization  with the objective of totally liberating southern Africa from the domination of the apartheid regime 252.	It is also a pleasure for me to welcome Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and to convey to it our best wishes for the progress and prosperity of its people.253.	The accession to independence of those new States bring us closer to the principle of universality proclaimed by the United Nations and the presence among us today of their worthy representatives comforts us and bears witness to the success of the Organization in its struggle for the liberation of all the peoples of the world 254.	Those successes of the international community are in part the result of the contribution of the Secretary- General and of his very devoted staff. That is why I am happy to congratulate them on behalf of my Government as well as to renew our encouragement for their tireless efforts on behalf of the maintenance of peace in the world.255.	As everybody knows peace in the world is indispensable for the progress of our peoples because in truth it is all mankind which is threatened with extinction if the deadly rivalries and confrontations we witness and deplore do not give way to understanding and co-operation among nations.256.	The past year has not registered major progress in the solution of the problems which are faced by the international community. The victory of the freedom fighters in Zimbabwe  it is true  has altered the balance of power in southern Africa and created new hopes in Namibia and South Africa. Despite political assassinations and an intensification of repression  the people of South Africa continue to struggle courageously against the racist and inhuman regime of apartheid. The South African Government seems not to have learned from the victory of the Patriotic Front in Zimbabwe and is striving desperately to invent every kind of subterfuge to lend credence to a new flexibility in its racial policy and a so-called will to change. The persistence of terrorism and oppression nevertheless brings us back to the sad truth  namely  the poverty and the suffering of which the people of South Africa are victims. That is a scandalous fact  the impact of which goes beyond the borders of South Africa to challenge the conscience of every human being. That challenge to the international community would have been taken up more vigorously and more rigorously had the efforts of that community not been weakened by certain complicity which makes difficult  if not ineffectual  the imposition of a total economic embargo against South Africa.257.	The sanctions decreed against the apartheid regime have not put an end to repression or even attenuated the suffering of the South African people. And yet one still hears cries that racism is inhuman and all vehemently proclaim that they are in favour of equality between races and men  But everyone knows that the South African regime still stands thanks to its close economic relations with Western countries and that its repressive system expands in proportion to the injections of foreign capital the origin of which is also known.258.	In our opinion it is high time to put an end to soporific hypocrisy. There is an obvious reality which cannot be denied  least of all lengthy speeches and paternalistic acts. Justice will not be restored in South Africa by the consolidation of the South African economy for the benefit of the white population alone or by participation in the exploitation of black workers. Nor will human rights be respected if we close our eyes to the brutal repression practised against the militants of ANC. Nor is it by the looting of Namibia's wealth that the process of achieving the independence of that country will be accelerated. The hearings on uranium here at United Nations Headquarters yielded proof of the true intentions of the transnational corporations  which will stop at nothing to loot the natural resources of Namibia.259.	The racist regime of South Africa  strengthened by the economic support and complicity of the Western countries  can thus with greater scorn and arrogance defy the international community and further extend its domination over Namibia. Its obstinate refusal to comply with United Nations decisions no longer surprises us  because it continues to find support among international financial groups  as well as attentive ears and generous hands to strengthen its repressive power and domination.260.	Everybody knows that the decision by the racist apartheid regime of 1 July 1980 to transfer power to the members of the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance was a step towards the establishment of a puppet Government entirely under its sway. Furthermore  the fact that South Africa has illegally extended its territorial sea and proclaimed an economic zone along the Namibian coast obviously proves the absurd and deceitful nature of such a step  which is simply the new tactic of the apartheid regime to ensure the perpetuation of its occupation and so to satisfy its Western clients  which are greedy for cheap raw materials.261.	Defying the relevant decisions of the United Nations  the Western countries through the medium of transnational corporations acting on their behalf  are deliberately participating in maintaining the illegal occupation regime  trampling under foot Decree Number 1 for the Protection of the Natural Resources of Namibia  which was adopted by the United Nations Council for Namibia on 27 September 1974. In thus violating the economic and social interests of the Namibian people  the accomplices of the racist apartheid regime are strengthening the latter's repressive power and blocking the process of achieving independence by the Territory. They are preventing the Namibian people from exercising its right to self-determination in accordance with decisions of the United Nations  compelling that people to have recourse to armed struggle as the only alternative to defend its imprescriptible right to freedom.262.	In the face of the acts of aggression and barbarity by South Africa against the People's Republic of Angola  acts which we vigorously condemn and whose only objective is the destruction of the Angolan economy so as to forestall any logistical support for the freedom fighters  SWAPO has no choice but to intensify its armed struggle. The sole and legitimate representative of the Namibian people  SWAPO cannot participate in the peace process from a position of weakness. Nor will it plan its own suicide by accepting the conditions made by South Africa or by trusting solely in the smooth words of the five Western countries. As with Zimbabwe yesterday  we are witnessing today to the same holding back and the same scenario  in a perfidious attempt to prevent the accession to power of the genuine nationalists grouped within SWAPO and thus to turn aside the course of history and set up a puppet Government in the pay of those who defend apartheid and transnational corporations.263.	The responsibility of the United Nations in the decolonization process remains and must be assumed in its entirety. The international community must envisage urgent measures capable of putting a final end to South African domination in Namibia. It will only be by applying the enforcement measures provided for in Chapter VII of the Charter against the apartheid regime that we shall see concrete results  The Western countries friendly to South Africa have to assume a double responsibility in that context  which requires  on the one hand  respect for the embargo against the racist regime and  on the other  a constructive contribution to the coming into being in Namibia of democratic power which derives from the people. Any other attitude would undermine the chances for a peaceful solution of the problem and uselessly prolong the war  the victims of which now number in the thousands.264.	Recognized and supported by the United Nations as the authentic representative of the Namibian people  SWAPO is  we know  prepared to participate in the peace process  on the condition that that process take into account the interests of the Namibian people and that it have no objective other than the satisfaction of its legitimate aspirations to true independence.265.	On the other hand  the SWAPO fighters remain opposed to any proposal for a solution which does not respect the real facts of the problem and which does not envisage an alternative to the establishment in Namibia of a puppet regime under the sway of the racist apartheid regime and its Western allies. In that they will enjoy  as in the past  the complete support of the international community  including that of my country  Guinea-Bissau.266.	The recognition today of the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic by more than 40 States Members of the United Nations is the result of an obstinate struggle born of courage and sacrifice. It shows that the strength of a people cannot be gauged solely by the number of cannon or aircraft in its possession. In a war of national liberation  more than any other  it is motivation which matters and is therefore more important than the technical quality of weapons. The knowledge that he is defending so noble a cause gives each freedom fighter an incalculable dimension to his person. One can then understand why the militants of POLISARIO show so much courage and endurance and why they are able to strike such deadly blows against the enemy.267.	Africa  seasoned by its experience of struggle against colonialism  is opposed to Morocco's policy in Western Sahara. The OAU declared itself in favour of the self- determination of the Sahraoui people and has for several years sought to find a peaceful way to solve this conflict. We know that such a solution must include withdrawal of the Moroccan troops from Western Sahara and recognition of the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic as an expression of the will of the people of that area.268.	That is what the OAU Ad Hoc Committee on the question of Western Sahara advocated on the basis of irrefutable facts and taking into account the opinion of the vast majority of African Governments.269.	In the meantime  current Chairman of the Assembly of the OAU  Mr. Siaka Stevens  in his statement before the Assembly  which was remarkable  faithfully reflected the desire of his peers  the eminent African heads of State  to see the Moroccan Government return to the path of wisdom and renounce its policy of expansion by recognizing the Sahraoui people's right to self-determination in accordance with the principles of the Organization and in the interest of peace and harmony in the region.270.	In Chad  the war continues despite the repeated appeals for a cease-fire made to the opposing factions. The OAU  as everyone here knows  has for several months been working hard to find a solution to this conflict which sets the descendants of a same people separated by often irreconcilable political ambitions against one another. It is difficult  in a situation which plunges Africa into mourning  to refrain from mentioning the lack of wisdom of the leaders of Chad. The unnecessary suffering of their people should have induced them to show a greater sense of responsibility.271.	In this fratricidal war  how far  it may well be asked  can anyone claim to be defending the interests of a people and at the same time take part in their destruction? The people of Chad must regain its balance and strength in order to build its future  and the political groups or factions contending for power know this and should take it into account because they certainly cannot wish to govern a ruined  soulless and lifeless country.272.	On behalf of my Government  I should like to invite my brothers in Chad to make every effort to consolidate that which unites them rather than to widen further the gap that divides them. The leaders of Chad should use their intelligence for the benefit of their people to reject any foreign interference  regardless of its source  the effect of which is to undermine their unity and cause the death and destruction of their people.273.	Apart from the material destruction and innumerable victims caused by this armed conflict  there is the problem of the refugees and displaced persons created by any war situation. It is estimated that today there are 5 million of these unfortunate people in Africa  5 million human beings fleeing death in tragic circumstances and compelled to live more often than not in indescribable poverty. This state of affairs  already alarming in the Horn of Africa  is today aggravated by the massive flow of refugees from Chad and Uganda into neighbouring countries  which are trying hard to help them.274.	Here we must congratulate the African countries which have given succour to these refugees in spite of the material and financial problems that such action implies  and also to thank the Governments and organizations which  in a show of international solidarity  have helped to ease the sufferings of all those unfortunate people.275.	The continued conflicts in Africa and their harmful effects on the development of our continent is of concern to African States and to the international community in general  It is  indeed  the upheavals in that continent that directly affect international peace and security. Conversely  the rivalries between the great Powers  in particular when reflected in the installation of foreign military bases  gravely threaten the national sovereignty and territorial integrity of our young States.276.	The situation in the Indian Ocean is alarming for a number of reasons  and the present difficult international situation has confirmed the gravity of a state of affairs which the United Nations wished to prevent by adopting General Assembly resolution 2832 (XXVI)  the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace. My country  being perfectly aware of the dangers threatening the coastal States of the Indian Ocean and world peace  understandably supports our Organization's efforts to bring that about and welcomes with interest President Ratsiraka's proposal that an international conference be convened in Madagascar for the purpose of creating  in a common effort  conditions which would ensure the success of the Conference on the Indian Ocean to be held at Colombo in 1981. We are all the more pleased to lend our support to the initiative of the Malagasy head of State  since in our opinion it is based on a clear perception of the problem and stems from a sincere will to contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security.277.	While it is true that the seventh emergency special session devoted to the question of Palestine enables us correctly to assess the support of the international community for the Palestinian cause  it is nevertheless undeniable that we have become increasingly aware of the injustice from which the Arab people of Palestine has been suffering for decades. The General Assembly  by convening that special session  intended certainly to unblock a situation created in the Security Council by one of its permanent members whose abuse of the veto is inadmissible. But it was intended  above all  to offer an exceptional opportunity to the international community to expose the real enemies of the freedom of peoples.278.	There has for several years been unanimous agreement on the aggressive and expansionist nature of Israel's policy. We can therefore expect the United Nations to do more that simply adopt resolutions. It could  for example  take concrete and effective steps to break Israel's obstinacy and arrogance.279.	On the eve of the twentieth anniversary of the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution 1514 (XV) on the inalienable right of every people to choose its own destiny  it is both inadmissible and regrettable  that Member States upon which their power confers special political and moral responsibilities  can endorse and encourage Israel's policy of occupying Arab territories and denying the Palestinian people their right to exist. It is dishonourable to proclaim oneself the defender of human rights and to ignore the elementary rights of millions of Palestinians.280.	The Palestinian people should  like any other people  be able to enjoy its right to be free and to create an independent State. It is common knowledge that any solution of the Middle East crisis  to be viable and final  must meet this essential requirement. The events of the last two years have shown that any attempt to reach a partial settlement that does not take this reality into account is doomed to failure. The PLO  which represents the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people  must be brought into any peace negotiations for it would be absurd to ignore the political  military and moral force it represents if one sincerely intends to help establish peace and stability in the Middle East.281.	The international community should draw its inspiration from the principles stated in the Charter of the United Nations and take measures capable of promoting Israel's withdrawal from the Arab territories occupied since 1967 and the recognition of the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to live freely in a sovereign State. The urgent application of these measures  as provided for under Chapter VII of the Charter  is today essential as a means of curbing Israel's inhuman policy in the occupied Arab territories and to break the Israeli Government's ill-advised arrogance. That Government has once again defied the United Nations by deciding to make of Jerusalem the capital of the Israeli State  The gravity of such a decision which  bearing in mind the importance of the Holy City of Jerusalem for the three major monotheistic religions  constitutes a real sacrilege  must be clear to all. The United Nations must compel the Government of Israel to respect the faith of millions of believers whose contribution  at least moral if not political  is essential if world peace is to be safeguarded.282.	The repeated Israeli aggressions against Lebanon constitute yet another flagrant violation of that country's independence and territorial integrity. My Government strongly condemns them and wishes to reiterate to the G government and people of Lebanon its brotherly feelings of solidarity.283.	Acceptance by every Member State of the principles set forth in the Charter and consequently of the obligations arising there from constitute the fundamental basis for con-temporary international relations. The use of force as a means of repression and domination of peoples is contrary to recognized standards of international law. The Charter states that all men are equal and proclaims the right of every people  large and small  to live freely and to decide its own fate.284.	The Maubere people of East Timor  after several centuries of suffering under a colonial regime  has acquired that inalienable right which was recognized 20 years ago by the community of nations. A people does not fight against foreign domination to accept freely the confiscation of its dearly won freedom. This explains the extent of the resistance of the FRETILIN fighters to the Indonesian forces of aggression and their determination in an unequal and difficult struggle.285.	The attitude of the Government of Indonesia is all the more unacceptable since the Government of Portugal  the administering Power  in a communiquÃ© issued on 12 September 1980"" has again reaffirmed its responsibility in the matter of the complete decolonization of East Timor. The United Nations  in condemning the Indonesian invasion in its relevant resolutions  should not confine itself to a mere verbal rejection of the policy of fait accompli. The international community must not lose sight of the fact that this is a flagrant violation of human rights and that the indescribable sufferings imposed on the population of a small country by a neighbouring State  powerfully armed and motivated by an expansionist policy  is contrary to the law of nations. The international community must demand the withdrawal of all the Indonesian forces from East Timor  and the United Nations and its specialized agencies  and particularly the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  should continue to intervene so as to help the Maubere people to recover the right to independence. The Government of Guinea-Bissau encourages the Portuguese authorities to pursue their efforts and thus honourably discharge their debt to history 286.	One of the cardinal principles of the Organization is the settlement of disputes by peaceful means. The negotiations begun between the Government of the Comoros and the Government of France on the question of the Comorian island of Mayotte lead us to believe that a just solution  taking into account the territorial integrity of the entire Comoros and the unity of its people  will be found. We also hope that the same spirit of accommodation will lead the Government of France to establish with the Government of the Democratic Republic of Madagascar a fruitful dialogue concerning the problem of the return of the Malagasy islands of Glorieuses  Juan de Nova and Bassas da India.287.	The armed conflict that for some days has been going on between Iran and Iraq is grave and concerns us particularly because these are two fraternal countries and  above all  members of the non-aligned movement and of the Islamic Conference  to which my country  Guinea-Bissau  belongs. We sincerely hope that wisdom and a spirit of conciliation will prevail in the relations between these two friendly countries and that  with the sincere and constructive contribution of all  an atmosphere of harmony and friendship will be restored.288.	In a world in constant change because of the political upheavals which are sometimes beyond control  dialogue among peoples remains a sine qua non for the maintenance of peace. The efforts of the Secretary-General to promote direct intercommunal talks in Cyprus are in accordance with this objective which  in our opinion  is essential. My Government believes in fact that only negotiation among the parties concerned can lead to a just and lasting solution. Such a solution should take into account the national independence and territorial integrity of Cyprus and its character as a non-aligned country. I would avail myself of this opportunity to pay a tribute to the United Nations Forces stationed on Cyprus and to congratulate the Governments which have made them available on their valuable contribution to the establishment of an atmosphere of peace in that region.289.	The peaceful reunification of the two parts of Korea had already reached an encouraging stage but now it is encountering inadmissible obstacles because of foreign interference. The Korean people must be able  in accordance with its legitimate aspirations  to achieve its unity freely  an essential prerequisite for which must  be the withdrawal of all foreign troops stationed in Korea.290.	Cambodia  which was once the model of a ""positive neutralism""  is today undergoing a prolonged tragedy. The humanism that some countries vaunt to justify their excessive zeal in regard to this dramatic question seems to us to be doubtful. It is difficult to solve the problem of the Cambodian refugees without a realistic approach to the situation  and the international community is too mature to deceive itself. In this matter the United Nations should observe the rules and international practices and admit to its deliberations representatives of the Government that effectively exercises power.291.	The World Conference of the United Nations Decade for Women  held at Copenhagen last July  provided an opportunity for the women of the world to remind the international community of the many forms of inequality from which they are suffering and their firm determination to place the state of their creative abilities on all important decisions bearing on the peace and well-being of mankind. Guinea-Bissau  a country in which women are from every standpoint equal to men  actively participated in that Conference because it wished to emphasize the preponderant role of women in the liberation and development of African societies and their responsibilities in the building of our young nations. My Government welcomes the adoption by the Conference of the Programme of Action for the Second Half of the Decade and will participate with conviction and interest in achieving its aims.292.	At a time when mankind is uncertain as to its destiny which  under the pressure of economic crises  seems to be heading towards an uncertain future  military expenditures are approaching the astronomical figure of $500 billion. This is both revolting and scandalous when one considers the poverty from which most of the countries of the world suffer. A measure of relief came about in May 1978  after the adoption of a disarmament strategy  the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly  but  unfortunately  this was not followed by any other measures  except an irresponsible escalation of the arms race.293.	The pressing development needs of the third world  which the members of OAU have described with conviction in the Lagos Plan  are thus relegated to the background because the organic link between security and development has been ignored for the sake of a peace which  since it is not based on an equitable redistribution of the wealth of the world  must be precarious if not unattainable. The security needs of our respective peoples  although legitimate  cannot justify the fact that almost 6 per cent of the world's product is spent on armaments  to the detriment of the balance of human society. Thus the international community  particularly the nuclear countries  must again read the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session  the better to give practical effect to the solemn commitment they have entered into and to renew  in these early days of the Second Disarmament Decade  their commitment to work for total disarmament  an essential condition for the security of our peoples  if not for the very survival of mankind.294.	The eleventh special session of the General Assembly  which dealt with development  led to a realization of the true scope of the problems regarding the establishment of a new international economic order. The hope of the developing countries to find among the industrialized countries a new concept of interdependence of peoples and of their solidarity was bitterly disappointed. No doubt the impatience of some  together with the stubborn attitude of others  limited the possibilities for success of that session  which concluded  nevertheless  with the preparation of an International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade. Although meagre  this result should encourage us to pursue global negotiations in such important fields as raw materials  energy  development  monetary and financial questions and trade. In this specific case  my country welcomes the important measures taken recently by UNCTAD leading to the establishment of a Common Fund and the adoption of a series of rules and principles regarding restrictive trade practices.295.	The ninth session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea ended  as is well known  on a note of optimism. The importance of these negotiations for the strengthening of international relations confers on the results already achieved colossal dimensions  and my country attaches particular attention to this  the imminent adoption of a convention will certainly fill a gap and at the same time sweep away with many disagreements among States. In the meantime  Member States should refrain from taking any unilateral legislative measure which might undermine the chances for success of that convention.296.	My country  Guinea-Bissau  is a non-aligned State deeply devoted to the ideals of peace and social justice. The actions of our Government since the accession of Guinea-Bissau to national sovereignty have always tended to promote sincere and friendly co-operation among peoples and an atmosphere of confidence and mutual respect. My country is determined to pursue this conception of international relations  because it is in accord with the principles of our party  the PAIGC [Partido Africano da Independencia da Guini e Cabo Verde]  and it is in conformity with the aims and objectives enunciated in the Charter of the United Nations. Guinea-Bissau is a peace-loving nation. Our people  who during its struggle for national liberation enjoyed the support of international solidarity  will continue to back all just causes throughout the world. It will spare no effort to consolidate the historical and fraternal links which unite it with the other peoples of the world and intends to leave its own imprint as an African people on mankind's march towards progress."
"56",2758,"GNQ",35,1980,"ï»¿May I begin by extending to the President  on behalf of Lieutenant-Colonel Obiang Nguema Mbasogo  President of the Supreme Military Council  his Government and my delegation  and on my own behalf  our warmest congratulations upon his election to the presidency of the thirty-fifth session. His outstanding qualities as a diplomat  added to his skill and experience in international political affairs  are sufficient guarantees of the success of our deliberations.128.	May I also avail myself of this opportunity to pay a well-deserved tribute to Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim  outgoing President of the thirty-fourth session  for his valuable contribution to the solution of the pressing questions that arose during his tenure. Mr. Salim discharged with dignity  impartiality  dedication and dynamism the arduous task of con-ducting the debates of this General Assembly.129.	May I likewise extend my congratulations to Mr. Kurt Waldheim  Secretary-General of this Organization  for his exhaustive  objective and lucid presentation of the report on the activities of the United Nations during the period under review. As always  Mr. Waldheim has spared no effort in his search for solutions to the socioeconomic problems and international disputes besetting the world today. Our tribute to the Secretary-General is based on the fact that he has honoured with his presence in Africa  Europe  Asia and America all those international events that made his presence necessary and where his contribution was always highly appreciated.130.	I should like to take this opportunity to convey our sincere congratulations and to extend a welcome to the representatives of the fraternal peoples of Zimbabwe and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  whose countries have increased the membership of the great family of the United Nations. We are convinced that their presence not only reaffirms the universality of our Organization  but also will help to strengthen its effectiveness.131.	A year ago  the delegation of the Government of the Supreme Military Council informed this Assembly of the changes that had taken place in Equatorial Guinea after the blow struck for freedom on 3 August 1979. Today we have come here to reaffirm before this Assembly our deep satisfaction with the peace  calm and harmony which at present reign in the Republic of Equatorial Guinea.132.	We must not forget that our country was bankrupt  without economic reserves  without international credibility  because it was unable to meet its commitments  and with its best cadres either in jail or in exile. That was the situation which we had to confront with determination and in an orderly manner. For that reason  it is no secret to anyone that our country  in this initial period of hopeful national reconstruction  is encountering serious difficulties of every kind: administrative  economic  financial  social  and so on. It is precisely within this context that we wish to present to this Assembly an account of the efforts being made by the Government of the Supreme Military Council to rehabilitate and rebuild our people.133.	In the educational sector  in order to restore an organized system of education in the country  we have resumed activities and intensified them with the signature of co-operation agreements with a number of friendly countries and international organizations.134.	In the field of health  my Government  barely one year after it took office  has rehabilitated all hospitals and dispensaries. In the context of these efforts  a bill was enacted to regulate free medical and pharmaceutical assistance to various sectors of the population  in particular children and pregnant women. We have intensified and improved considerably our relations with international organizations  such as UNICEF  WHO and many others in the health field. We have received humanitarian and medical assistance from the World Food Programme and WHO. Lastly  may I point out that  after overcoming great difficulties  given the scarcity of our present financial resources  but constantly bearing in mind its social duty  the Government of the Supreme Military Council has made purchases of medical supplies and hospital equipment amounting to over $2 million.135.	As we are primarily an agricultural country  our action has focused on the improvement of the rural sector  which we regard as indispensable for our economy if we are to ensure the viability of this vital activity which was abandoned during the last decade. We have reached the conclusion that a coherent agricultural programme is basic to the economic development of our country. Thus the Government of the Supreme Military Council has granted credits to farmers amounting to $5 million for the purpose of restoring our plantations. Bearing in mind the importance we attach to the recovery of agriculture  we have also decided to return to their former foreign owners their agricultural properties. With the help of FAO  the Government of Equatorial Guinea has begun to restore the poultry farms which were in a state of great neglect. In the context of these endeavours  we must however emphasize the enormous difficulties that the shortage of labour causes to the effectiveness of our work in all sectors.136.	We attach equal importance to the fundamental right to information  and in this connection the Supreme Military Council has decided to inject new life into the media of social communication  especially the press  radio and television  which had remained silent during the decade of dictatorship.137.	In the labour area  and to redress the shortcomings  and arbitrariness which prevailed in this sector  the Government has enacted a decree on the general organization of work. Thus  workers' salaries have been considerably increased and labour conditions improved.138.	I n the industrial sector  we are laying emphasis on the restoration of installations which were inactive during the last decade  and the city of Malabo  the capital of the nation  which had been plunged into darkness for eight years  has been electrified and illuminated. In this same context  a hydroelectric plant is being built on our continent.139.	In the social sector  we are beginning the task of national reconstruction by imposing scrupulous respect for human rights and social justice. Thus  the first question tackled by the Government was the reorganization of the State and  within that spirit of reconciliation  it ordered the immediate release of ail political prisoners who filled the jails and concentration camps in the country; the reinstatement in their jobs of all civil servants dismissed from their posts for political reasons; the reopening of all churches  thus restoring freedom of worship; and  in particular  it decreed a general amnesty  allowing the return to our country of all those nationals who had taken asylum abroad as a result of the brutal oppression  the persecution of every kind  the hunger and the poverty that then prevailed in Equatorial Guinea.140.	In the public works  housing  urban planning and transport sectors  major infrastructural work is being carried out  such as the repairing of the road network  airports and ports  the building of new houses and urbanizing of the main towns; and similar efforts are being made to endow the country with sufficient means of transport by land  air and sea.141.	As regards the integration of Guinean women into the national reconstruction process  the Government of the Supreme Military Council has set up a State Secretariat for the promotion of women and their integration into Guinean society. We intend thereby to express in practical terms the importance we attach to the participation of Guinean women in the national development process.142.	In the private sector  we have restored to Guinean and foreign citizens the property which was taken away from them by the former regime. At the same time  we have adopted a policy of free trade and granted important credits to Guinean and foreign citizens engaged in trade.143.	I have provided a brief summary of the efforts made by the Government of the Supreme Military Council in the short span of the one year of its existence. However  I should like to take this opportunity to draw the attention of this Assembly to the fact that  despite our efforts  the crisis continues and this demands our unflagging pursuit of the line of conduct we have set ourselves and requires that  in a spirit of solidarity  we request international collaboration and co-operation in the quest for a solution to our problems.144.	Thus  from this rostrum  I wish to express the pro-found and sincere gratitude of the Government of the Supreme Military Council to all the friendly countries and international organizations whose valuable assistance is making a significant contribution to the process of national reconstruction that we have undertaken.145.	Despite the persistent efforts of the Supreme Military Council to overcome the difficult situation that our country is experiencing  there is still much to be done. The various problems confronting my Government in its efforts to achieve the normalization and reconstruction of my country are so many and so acute that  for lack of time  we shall refrain from giving an exhaustive list of them here. However  for your information  I should like to refer to the report prepared by the United Nations mission headed by Mr. Farah  Under-Secretary-General for Special Political Questions  who recently visited my country. That report  contained in document A/35/447  clearly and concisely reflects the situation actually prevailing in Equatorial Guinea at present. May I therefore take this opportunity to express on behalf of my Government our sincere gratitude to Mr. Farah and his delegation for the quality of the work he has submitted to us and for the great dedication with which he endeavoured to become personally acquainted with the difficulties of every kind that at present beset my country. The sacrifices made by Mr. Farah in the fulfilment of his mission have won him the praise and admiration of the people and of the Government of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea.146.	The Supreme Military Council  an institution born of the will of the people to improve the image of Equatorial Guinea which  for one long decade  had been the symbol of anarchy and of a retrograde policy of total isolation  has set itself the priority task of regaining for our country  through a sincere  coherent and objective foreign policy  sufficient credibility in the community of nations  so as to be able to return to it proudly as a free nation  free not only because of the fact of its independence  but because it seeks the freedom of all its citizens as a priority.147.	From the very first moment the Government of the Supreme Military Council undertook  with firm determination and conviction  the process of opening fruitful relations with all peace-loving countries  while scrupulously respecting the principles and objectives proclaimed in the Charter of the United Nations  that of the OAU and that of the non-aligned movement.148.	We wish to make special mention of the importance that the Government of the Supreme Military Council attaches to the continued development of fruitful good- neighbourly relations with the fraternal peoples of Gabon  Sao Tome and Principe  Cameroon and Nigeria  with whom we feel indissolubly linked by tradition and history. These age-old relations of brotherhood deteriorated sharply under the former regime. For this reason and in order to revive peaceful coexistence among our peoples  the President of the Supreme Military Council paid state visits to Gabon and Cameroon and took part in the second extraordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU  held at Lagos on 28 and 29 April 1980.149.	In parallel to the fraternal and good-neighbourly relations which I have mentioned  the policy of rapprochement of the Government of the Supreme Military Council is invariably directed towards all the other sister African nations  while at the same time we are establishing fruitful relations of co-operation in other continents with countries  which are determined to contribute to the national reconstruction process that we have undertaken.150. We must praise here the great encouragement that the people of Equatorial Guinea have drawn from the presence and active participation of the Kingdom of Spain in the work of reconstruction that we have undertaken.151. Spain provided valuable assistance to our country in all sectors after the changes that took place on 3 August 1979 and the future prospects for our co-operation appear to be very promising. I cannot fail to state from this rostrum the sincere gratitude of the people and the Government of Equatorial Guinea to the people and the Government of the Kingdom of Spain for this fraternal gesture that they have made and arc still making in our regard.152.	In the context of Hispanic integration and as was emphasized by the President of the Supreme Military Council during his visit to the Kingdom of Spain last May  Equatorial Guinea has undertaken to work for the establishment of relations with the Ibero-American countries  while at the same time advocating the doctrine of Afro-Ibero- Americanism.153.	We likewise highly appreciate and attach great importance to the political credibility and confidence that the Government of the Supreme Military Council has earned for itself in international bodies  at the political  economic and social levels. At the economic level  we must stress here the valuable aid  credit  subsidies and technical assistance granted by UNDP  IMF  the World Bank  UNESCO  WHO  UNICEF  FAO  the European Economic Community  the African Development Bank  the League of Arab States and OPEC  all of which contribute considerably to the national reconstruction process.154.	The international situation as a whole is one of our greatest concerns  as a result of the serious and many problems that characterize it at present. The hotbeds of tension and hostility that exist in vast areas of our planet; the injustice that persists in trade systems; the increasingly unfavourable imbalance in our balance of payments; the galloping inflation which assails our economiesâthese  in our opinion constitute the fundamental causes of the alarming situation we have mentioned. We believe that the elimination of that situation of generalized crisis should be one of the priorities of our Organization. The solution of this international crisis could depend to some degree on the sincere political will that should govern negotiations between the industrialized nations and the third world.155.	We reaffirm that our foreign policy will in no way change in its orientation and its concept of scrupulous respect for the principles of peaceful international coexistence and the establishment and strengthening of more just and effective relations of friendship and co-operation among nations.156.	Despite the moderation shown by the leaders of the nationalist movement SWAPO  in accepting the United Nations plan for Namibia  South Africa obstinately continues its illegal occupation of the Territory and the perpetuation of its ignominious policy of apartheid and racism  with the creation of puppet movements as instruments used by the racist South African Government to continue its illegal occupation of the territory of Namibia. The Government of the Supreme Military Council strongly condemns the dilatory manoeuvres of the racist South African Government to hinder the implementation of the United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia. We resolutely support the armed struggle to which SWAPO is committed as the only means of establishing the sovereignty and independence of its people.157.	We also condemn most strongly the military incursions made by South Africa into Angola  using the territory of Namibia as a launching ground. In view of the continued refusal of the racist regime of South Africa to respect the relevant resolutions adopted by the United Nations  the OAU and the non-aligned movement  the delegation of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea considers that this Assembly should adopt much more vigorous measures against the apartheid regime of South Africa. The Government of the Supreme Military Council and the people of Equatorial Guinea are in full solidarity with the Namibian people in its just and legitimate struggle for its sovereignty and independence. In this connection  we resolutely support the resolutions adopted by the International Conference in Solidarity with the Struggle of the People of Namibia  which was held at Paris from 11 to 13 September 1980.158.	The continuing demonstrations and demands in Soweto  as well as in other South African cities  are eloquent testimony to the suffering of the people of Azania in their struggle against apartheid and the abominable racial system established by the white minority in South Africa.159.	Massacres of the peaceful people of Azania  brutal racist repression  imprisonment and the persistent violation of human rights to which our brothers in Azania are subjected have not prevented them from intensifying unhesitatingly its authentic struggle to win its emancipation and abolish the odious system of apartheid. We express our unconditional support for the struggle waged so courageously by the nationalist movements  the African National Congress of South Africa and the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania.160.	In the context of this struggle for liberation and for the recovery of honour and dignity  I should like to express again our feeling of joy at the recent victory of the heroic people of Zimbabwe  in the belief that its example will bring about a radical change in the obstinate attitude of the racist regime of Pretoria regarding the oppressed people of Azania. The independence of Zimbabwe represents one of the greatest lessons of patriotism of recent years. To that brave people  from this historic rostrum  I extend our warmest congratulations on behalf of the Supreme Military Council and the people of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea  and especially of its President  Lieutenant-Colonel Obiang Ngu-ema Mbasogo.161.	Our continent is passing through crucial moments in its history  with the intensification of hostilities which threaten the destruction and annihilation of our peoples: from the situation in Chad  through that in Western Sahara  to that in Ogaden  we are witnessing a great scenario of fratricidal wars which threaten not only the existence of the peoples of those regions but also the stability and security of our continent.162.	In connection with these hotbeds of tension  the Government of the Supreme Military Council considers that our efforts should be concentrated on the search for an African solution to those problems.163.	With regard to the Middle East  we are convinced that we shall be unable to achieve a just and lasting peace in the region as long as the rights of the Palestinian people continue to be trampled underfoot by Israel. My Government considers that stable peace in that region will be possible only through a comprehensive solution to the problem  with the participation of all the parties involved  including the PLO. The continued unlawful occupation by Israel of Arab territories and its refusal to recognize the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to establish a State on its own territory constitute the greatest obstacle to the achievement of a viable settlement of the Middle East conflict. This situation was aggravated again by the recent decision of the Israeli Government to make Jerusalem the eternal capital of its State. This constitutes a flagrant violation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and defiance of international conscience and morality. On the other hand  we recognize that the comprehensive solution of the Middle East problem requires the recognition by all States of the region of the legitimate right of Israel to national existence within secure boundaries.164.	The peaceful  negotiated resolution of international disputes and the non-use of force or the threat of use of force for the solution of conflicts continue to constitute one of the bases on which rests United Nations action to guarantee peace  stability and peaceful coexistence among nations.165.	For this reason  the Government of the Supreme Military Council of Equatorial Guinea expresses its concern at the latent situation prevailing in Afghanistan  which is likely to bring about a crisis with unforeseeable consequences for mankind.166.	In this context  we also view with concern the holding of American hostages in Teheran  an act which not only constitutes a flagrant violation of international law but also represents an ostensible failure to respect human rights. We consider that the immediate release of the hostages would make an important contribution to the just cause of peace and respect for fundamental human rights.167.	I cannot fail to draw attention to something which I believe is on all our minds at this meeting. Simultaneously with the opening of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly  a new situation of conflict arose which threatens world peace and security. I am referring  of course  to the conflict between two countries  Iran and Iraq  whose peoples  however  are united by a common faith.168.	My delegation has confidence in the machinery of the United Nations which it hopes will suffice to restore peace to the region. But I cannot fail to applaud and support the prompt initiative taken at the Islamic Conference in its quest for a rapid settlement of this serious conflict  which adds to the long list of situations endangering world peace and security.169.	Last  and no less disquieting  is the problem of Kampuchea. My country considers that the restoration of peace and stability in South-East Asia and the consequent establishment of a climate of mutual confidence among all States in the region would enable the people of Kampuchea to decide on its future freely  without interference.170.	Every day the international economic situation becomes more alarming. We are witnessing a progressive and unbridled deterioration in trade relations between rich countries and developing countries. Our countries  the non- oil-producing developing countries and in particular the least developed countries  are in a desperate situation. These countries are the victims of all kinds of difficulties: balance- of-payments deficits  considerable increase in their external debts  galloping inflation in their economies  and so on. And  given the insufficient progress achieved in the search for a just and equitable world economic situation  we consider that it is more than ever necessary that this Assembly work out new formulas which will enable the developing countries to reduce and even eliminate the trade inequities which exist today in their trade relations with the industrialized countries.171.	It is regrettable to note the manipulations of the industrialized countries in the North-South dialogue with regard to the Integrated Programme for Commodities; it is essential to have a balanced relationship between the price of manufactured goods and the price of raw materials.172.	A new international economic order will never be achieved until new systems of financing are established  which allow for the continued and independent development of our economies. Such financing should be for long terms and at low interest; it should be placed at the full disposal of the least developed of the developing countries  which would enable us to establish in our development programmes those priorities that would help us overcome our dependency on the industrialized countries.173.	As we stated earlier  trade imbalances  balance-of- payments deficits  the progressive increase of external indebtedness as well as the galloping inflation besetting our economies originate in the international monetary system which currently governs the world. It is clear and obvious that the monetary system imposed over three decades ago no longer meets the current situations since the conditions which then prevailed have disappeared. For that reason  it is imperative to establish a new international monetary system which will prevent the disastrous fluctuations and the cataclysmic economic and financial consequences to which our currencies are today subjected: a new system  not of confiscation or subjugation of the sovereignty and independence of the countries of the third world  but a new international monetary system  with participation by all States in the elaboration and in the implementation of those norms which should govern the relations between rich and poor countries.174.	As regards industrialization  from the seventh special session of the General Assembly on development and inter-national economic co-operation to the Lima  Vienna and New Delhi  Conferences  we have always reaffirmed that the industrialization of the developing countries could make a valuable contribution to the raising of the living standards of our peoples. We have repeated in all international forums that  in order to achieve the objective of the industrialization of the third world by the year 2000  the question of the financing of industrialization should take priority in the policy of international development. We have stressed that there should be an increase in the volume of North-South  East-South and South-South financial contributions necessary for the achievement of the general objectives of development that we have set ourselves.175.	In the African context  we are gratified at the success of the Lagos economic conference  which is the first demonstration of the African will to economic emancipation. We are convinced that the Plan of Action adopted at that conference   represents for the United Nations a valuable contribution to the working out of a new international economic order to which we are committed and which will meet the true aspirations of all countries.176.	Despite all the joint efforts and despite the moderation and understanding shown by the developing countries during the current negotiations on the establishment of a convention on the law of the sea  the industrialized countries are still showing their arrogance in attempting to create a selfish law of the sea  by placing their technological potential above the just claims of our peoples. A new international economic order cannot be fair or just until such time as the sovereignty of States over all their natural resources is reaffirmed.177.	Economic justice should be the slogan of the decade which is beginning. So long as injustice and the present economic disorder continue  all our efforts with the objective of establishing a new international economic order will prove fruitless.178.	As regards the recent eleventh special session  devoted to economic problems  we regret to note the abyss that still separates the intransigent and arrogant position of the industrialized countries and the just claims of the developing countries. However  we consider that that special session will no doubt mark a new milestone towards the balanced readjustment of international economic relations and will certainly represent a decisive and laudable step in our collective efforts to establish the new international economic order we have sought to bring about.179.	I should not wish to end this statement without reaffirming on this solemn occasion our conviction of the imperative need to intensify co-operation among nations in the quest for adequate solutions to the problems of development raised by the characteristic features prevailing in each of our countries. We believe that the time has come to move on to the implementation of the principles and ideals we have proclaimed: the ideals of freedom for all  co-operation at all levels  sincere solidarity within reciprocal respect for the independence of each State  and the establishment of a new  more just and more balanced world."
"57",2803,"GRC",35,1980,"ï»¿Permit me first of all  Sir  to extend to you the warmest congratulations on behalf of the Greek delegation on your unanimous election to the presidency of the General Assembly. This important post could not have been entrusted to a more experienced diplomat  a diplomat more committed to the ideals of the Charter and more aware of the serious responsibilities entailed in this task. Furthermore  you represent a country which is linked with mine by ties of close friendship and a longstanding common cultural heritage  and which belongs to the great European family  to which Greece will shortly be admitted.67.	We should also like to congratulate the outgoing President  Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim  a worthy son of Africa  who conducted the proceedings of the General Assembly throughout a particularly difficult period with a skill  flexibility and efficiency which were truly exemplary.68.	It is also a pleasure for me to convey the congratulations of my delegation to the Secretary General  who has placed his great talents  authority and prestige in the service of peace in the world  as we can see once again in reading his report to the Assembly on the work of the Organization. The tireless efforts of Mr. Waldheim to curb the major international crises of our time and assist in bringing about a settlement of them have won for him the admiration and respect of all.69.	I should also like to welcome the proclamation of the independence of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and bid the representatives of this new Member welcome among us  while expressing the conviction that they will play a constructive role in the United Nations.70.	The development of the international situation over the 12 months which have elapsed since the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly has  unfortunately  not been very encouraging. The major problems facing the world  with one or two exceptions  have become increasingly mired in stagnation  thus depriving whole peoples of any hope of a better future. Furthermore  new problems have emerged on the international scene creating an atmosphere of crisis that endangers the process of detente  which alone can enable mankind to apply itself to the major economic and social challenges confronting it  on the handling of which depends its very survival.71.	Among the major problems of our time  that of the Middle East has the grim privilege of being the oldest and perhaps the most complicated. After three wars and numerous local conflicts  this region  with the countries of which Greece has long maintained very close links  continues to be a powder keg ready to explode at any time.72.	The Greek Government considers that the solution to this problem should lie in the scrupulous application of the following principles: first  evacuation of all Arab territories occupied by Israel since the 1967 war  including East Jerusalem; secondly  recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination  one of the options of which would be the creation of an independent State; and thirdly  recognition also of the right of all countries in the area  whether they be Arab States or Israel itself  to live in security within secure  recognized and guaranteed frontiers.73.	Faithful to these principles  the Greek Government has always expressed disapproval  as indeed have the vast majority of Member States  of the Israeli policy of modifying the demographic nature of the occupied territories  either by the establishment of new settlements or by other means.74.	Similarly  my Government wishes to associate itself fully with Security Council resolution 476 (1980)  which opposes any change in the status of Jerusalem. I should like to take this opportunity to reaffirm our conviction that the right of free access to the city of Jerusalem must remain inviolable for the benefit of the faithful of the three monotheistic religions  for whom the Holy Places have a sacred character.75.	Furthermore  we deplore armed incursions into Lebanese territory  and we appeal for an end to be put to all these acts of violence in Lebanon. The international community is in duty bound to ensure absolute respect for the territorial integrity of Lebanon and the restoration of the authority of the Lebanese Government over the entire territory of the country. It must also ensure that UNIFIL enjoys conditions which will enable it to continue unhindered the admirable work which it has been doing in southern Lebanon.76.	The importance of the Middle East problem is such that all those who can contribute to its solution should spare no effort to do so. For this reason we take pleasure at the declaration of the heads of State and Government and Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the countries of the European Community issued at Venice on 13 June  the outlines of which converge with the policy of my own Government.77.	We have also noted with satisfaction the mission entrusted to the current President of the Council of the European Community to contact the parties involved  with the aim of exploring the possibilities of a negotiated solution of the conflict. We believe that such negotiations should be open to all interested parties  including the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO].78.	We have seen in southern Africa a development that is both important and instructive: the long struggle of the people of Zimbabwe for its independence has finally been successful and has led to the election of a Parliament and a Government representing all the ethnic elements of the country. That outcome of the long drawn out Rhodesian crisis  an outcome made possible thanks to the political will of all the signatories of the Lancaster House Agreement  demonstrates the moral superiority of reason over force  of conciliation over hatred  and of good will over intransigence. The wisdom and political maturity displayed by the Government of Zimbabwe since it took power has won it the admiration of all. It is therefore with particular satisfaction that the Greek delegation again wishes the noble people of Zimbabwe success  happiness and prosperity.79.	At the same time  we should like to congratulate the Government of the United Kingdom on its contribution to the settlement that was brought about.80.	What happened in Zimbabwe should set an example for Namibia. The plan of the five Western countries endorsed by the Security Council in its resolution 435 (1978) is an excellent basis for the free expression of the will of the inhabitants of the Territory and its accession to independence. The South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO] and the frontline States have demonstrated their political will to see that plan implemented. Let us hope that South Africa  whose responsibilities towards the Namibian people are particularly heavy  will follow suit. That is something that world public opinion demands.81.	With regard to the problem of apartheid  there has  unfortunately  been no sign that the Pretoria Government has any intention of departing from that odious policy  which is condemned by the universal conscience. This intolerable situation cannot continue much longer without provoking strong reactions both within the country and from the international community.82.	When  at the outset  I said that new sources of tension had emerged over the last few months in addition to the already existing confrontations of the post-war era  which can virtually be called traditional  I was in particular referring to the crises whose impact on world peace and stability is difficult to estimate: the invasion of Afghanistan by Soviet troops and  for a week now  the conflict between Iraq and Iran.83.	The taking of hostages and the detention to this very day of diplomats and other American officials in Teheran should be considered a very serious violation of international law that may well jeopardize the very bases of international relations. The attitude of the Iranian authorities with regard to that incident was unanimously condemned by the Members of the Organization and by its supreme legal authority  the International Court of Justice. On the strength of the ties of friendship that have always existed between the Greek and the Iranian peoples  my Government once again urgently appeal to the Iranian Government to comply with the requirements of the law of nations  which it may in turn invoke in order to settle its differences with the United States.84.	The Soviet invasion in Afghanistan  like that of the Vietnamese troops in Cambodia one year earlier  is an event fraught with serious consequences. Respect for the independence and territorial integrity of States  which constitutes one of the foundations of the Charter of the United Nations  is a rule not only of law but also  and above all  of morality  which should provide the foundation for all international order. If the great and the powerful do not pay all the necessary respect to those principles  there is the risk of intimidation and violence becoming the supreme laws of international life.85.	As for the conflict between Iraq and Iran  which is liable at any moment to assume alarming proportions  I should like to associate myself with all my colleagues Who have from this rostrum appealed to the two countries  to have recourse to peaceful means to settle their disputes.Through the Security Council and the Islamic Conference  the international community has declared itself ready to sponsor such an effort. Let us hope that the two adversaries will benefit from that offer before it is too late. At the same time  we duly appreciate the assurances given in various quarters that efforts will be made to avoid internationalization of the conflict.86.	Lastly we should like to state our complete agreement with the statement of the Foreign Ministers of the European Community with regard to the need to ensure freedom of navigation in the Gulf. That need  which is obvious  is increased by the fact that a large number of countries  including Greece  depend  with regard to their energy needs  to a considerable extent on deliveries of oil from that region.87.	The crises I have just mentioned  with all the dangers they entail for peace in the world   make it absolutely clear that it is necessary and urgent for there to be effective disarmament. Furthermore  one of the indispensable conditions for any true effort at disarmament is the gradual elimination of sources of friction as well as suspicion among States. That can be brought about only if all the countries of the world  whatever their power or their resources  refrain from recourse to force or the threat of it and make use of the means available to them under the Charter and other documents of international law to eliminate causes of friction among themselves. Only thus can the current disarmament negotiations  or those contemplated for the future  have any chance of proving fruitful.88.	Another aspect of disarmament  and by no means the least important  is the release of funds to be used in the fulfilment of the major economic and social aspirations of our time. But that requires the sincere cooperation of all countries  beginning with the nuclear Powers and that  in turn  presupposes effective international control over any arms limitations provided for in agreements already signed or to be signed.89.	My country's willingness to contribute to understanding among all European peoples has been manifested in the constructive attitude it adopted in the very opening phases of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe  held at Helsinki in 1975. It is in the same positive spirit that we approach the second review session of the Conference  to be held at Madrid  the major objective of which should be to maintain the momentum provided by the Helsinki Conference for the development of harmonious relations among countries belonging to different socioeconomic systems.90.	But in the view of my Government it will be easier to attain that objective if at Madrid we undertake a frank and objective examination of what has been done so far and if we ensure the application of the provisions of the Final Act of the Conference as a whole.91.	With regard to a field in which the prospects seem to be rather betterâthat is  the field of international economic cooperation  one of the most constant and encouraging characteristics of recent years has been the Organization's growing awareness of the major social and economic problems confronting our world. The elimination of poverty and hunger; the narrowing of the very wide gulf now separating the rich countries from the poor countries; the struggle against illiteracy; the limitation of unbridled demographic growth; the protection of the environment; the preservation of non-renewable energy resources  and their gradual replacement by other sources of energyâall are urgent and universal tasks that we cannot shirk without the risk of earning the reprobation of future generations. In the words of the poet  ask not for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for us all.92.	That is why we greeted with great hope the initiation  a few years ago  of the long process that led to the eleventh special session of the General Assembly  one of the major goals of which  as we know  was the undertaking of preparations for negotiations covering the major problems of an economic nature to which I have just referred.93.	That session did not  of course  yield all the results we had hoped for. If on one of its aspectsâthe International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decadeâwe have brought about a consensus which gives us the broad outlines for economic cooperation for the current decade  on the other hand in another aspectâglobal negotiationsâwe find ourselves at present in a deadlock. I hope that this deadlock is only temporary. We know that the developing countries consider global negotiations as the means of ensuring acceptance of their legitimate demands. To disappoint them would be a serious mistake  with incalculable consequences.94.	We should not like to minimize the obstacles that remain to be overcome if these negotiations are to be started on time  but it would be wrong to dramatize them. It is our conviction that in the course of the present session it will be possible to eliminate differences in viewpoints  because we do not think that there are leaders in the world who fail to realize the magnitude of the problems and the imperative need to tackle them as soon as possible.95.	If there were any need for proof that it is possible to resolve even the thorniest problems provided there is the necessary political will  one has only to consider the progress achieved by the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. Greece  a pre-eminently maritime country  took an active part in that Conference and  we hope  made a positive contribution to it. The work  as was so well pointed out by the secretary General in his report on the work of the Organization  confounded the pessimists and proved that agreement is possible if negotiators act in a spirit of genuine compromise. We hope that the few points that still remain will be settled at the next session of the Conference and that we will succeed in signing and applying a convention that will make it possible for countries not only to settle their differences and to avoid disputes in the future  but also to devote themselves to the common exploitation of the resources of the oceans and seabed to the benefit of all the inhabitants of our planet.96.	I should like now to deal with a subject that is a matter of particular importance to Greece: that of human rights.97.	If the Organization had only one raison d'etre  it could well be that of ensuring for all the inhabitants of our planet the free exercise and enjoyment of their fundamental rights: that of the freedom of opinion but also the free development of the personality; the right to proper education  but also the right to a satisfactory standard of living; the free election of representatives of the people  but also the choice of the economic and social system best suited to each country. However  in quite a few cases these rights have been systematically disregarded  if not actually trampled underfoot  either by the State itself or by individuals with the complicity or tolerance of the established authority.98.	What makes the role of the United Nations particularly delicate in this case is the need to prevent this sacred cause from serving as a pretext for purposes that are alien to it. This is  indeed  a difficult task  which warrants as much attention as possible from the competent organs and the countries therein represented.99.	While on the subject of human rights  I should like to mention a specific case. About 2 000 people disappeared in the aftermath of the hostilities in Cyprus in 1974. We still know nothing about what became of these people  some of whom were of Greek nationality and this in spite of resolutions of the General Assembly and its organs which provided for an international inquiry on the spot. Such an inquiry has not yet been carried out because of the refusal of the Turkish Cypriot leaders  who had  however  agreed to this when Mr. Waldheim went to Nicosia in May 1979.100.	The purely humanitarian aspect of this question should prompt the Turkish Cypriot side  as well as any other authority that is in a position to do so  to help the Organization to obtain information as to the fate of the people 1 have mentioned and thus do something to reduce the distress of their kith and kin.101.	To conclude  I shall refer to the problem of Cyprus. The fact that I can do this briefly is in itself encouraging. It proves that the prospects for an agreed solution have become a reality once again  thanks to the resumption of the intercommunal talks. May all those who have contributed to this positive development find in this an expression of our gratitude to them.102.	I should like to express the hope of my Government that this time the talks  even if they should prove to be difficult  may finally succeed in bringing about an agreement that will make it possible for the unfortunate island to find its peace  independence and prosperity once again and for the two communities to staunch the wounds of the past and resume their common life. As for my own Government  it will do everything in its power to contribute to a satisfactory outcome of the intercommunal talks. I say everything in our power aware as I am of the fact that the brunt of the responsibility lies with the island's inhabitants free of outside interference.103.	Let me  however  express a conviction that We have always repeated to all interested parties  namely  that only a solution that provides for the State and economic unity of the Republic of Cyprus would be viable. Cyprus is too small a country to be divided in any way. If this fundamental truth is accepted by the two communities  there will be a good chance of seeing them joining forces in the pursuit of a goal that has hitherto eluded themâthat of building together a common future.104.	The review that I have just made of the situation in the world is  perhaps  not calculated to fill us with optimism. International problems  whether they be political  economic or other kinds  often seem to defy the powers of the United Nations to solve them and instead to vindicate those who claim that our world is doomed to catastrophe. It is up to us all to prove that this is not the case. We owe it to ourselves  but we owe it  above all  to future generations."
"58",2846,"GRD",35,1980,"ï»¿Mr. President  let me first fulfil a pleasant duty on behalf of myself and the delegation of Grenada. We congratulate you  Sir  on your election to your high office. Your distinguished record of achievement highly qualifies you to guide the deliberations of this body and we are confident that in that office you will make a great contribution to the success of this thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly.2.	We express our gratitude to your predecessor  Ambassador Salim Ahmed Salim. We are grateful to him and his country for his services. They are well noted  and cannot be forgotten.3.	We offer our special thanks to the Secretary-General  Mr. Waldheim  for his untiring efforts in the furtherance of the objectives of the United Nations.4.	Subscribing to the principle of universality of member-ship of the United Nations  Grenada welcomes the admission of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Zimbabwe to this Organization. We are happy to welcome Saint Vincent not only because  like Grenada  it is a member of the Caribbean community but particularly because it is our closest neighbour and shares with us ties of history  geography  culture and blood.5.	We particularly welcome Zimbabwe because of its heroic and historic struggle for freedom and independence. Zimbabwe has enjoyed our deep respect  admiration and firm support throughout the most difficult and trying period of its valiant and successful confrontation with racism and imperialism. Zimbabwe is the most recent testimony to the scientific fact that a united people fighting for freedom and social justice will always be victorious. We join the nations of the world in making a strong appeal for financial aid to help in the national reconstruction of Zimbabwe. Each new nation will inevitably seek its own route to development  and certainly each of us has a fundamental responsibility to respect  deal with and maintain normal State-to-State relations with each other regardless of the ideological predisposition of the various State systems.6.	We in Grenada are revolutionaries; we are not dogmatists. We understand that change is a process requiring the scientific development of the objective and subjective factors. We favour the movement towards anti-imperialism  but we know  purely on the basis of scientific objectivity  that change cannot be achieved at one stroke. So  while we reserve the right to maintain the most cordial relations with political parties and States which share our ideological pre-dispositions  we regard it as a serious and historic obligation to maintain and build normal State-to-State relations. Even so  we will always unhesitatingly denounce the development of Fascist tendencies and the murder of revolutionaries wherever they occur. We have resolutely denounced the Chilean Fascist regime and we have publicly supported  and will continue to support  those who seek to restore democracy to Chile. We will take the same position wherever else fascism rears its ugly head.7.	The pursuit of democratic progressive and anti- imperialist goals in Grenada requires of us a commitment to support the right of all peoples to be free and independent and to choose their direction on the basis of that reality. It is for this reason that we support the right to independence of all colonial territories in the Caribbean and elsewhere. Belize is of special concern. There are no barriers to the independence of that nation except the absurd claim by reactionary circles in Guatemala that Guatemala has a legal right to more than 75 per cent of the territory of that nation. That claim is repudiated by the vast majority of the people of Guatemala. There is no doubt that the reactionary elements in Guatemala could sustain that claim only with the support of imperialist interests. And now that the revolution is taking hold in Central America  they and their imperialist allies are increasingly reluctant to agree to the unconditional sovereignty of the people of Belize.8.	We States Members of the United Nations must take an international initiative to ensure the immediate and guaranteed independence of Belize. The ritual mentioning of our support for Belize in international forums is not enough. In collaboration with the people of Belize  we must set a date for independence and ensure the early decolonization of that Territory. Put it to the conscience of the world as it has never been put before: Belize must be free because the reality is that none of us is free until all of us are free. This is most evident in the Caribbean community  where the colonial Powers constantly claim the right to intervene on behalf of their colonies and in the process undermine the sovereignty of each of us.â9.	It is our very firm view that lack of self-determination is the primary contradiction  the first item on the agenda for any colonial country. Until that question is resolved  no other matter affecting the external relations of such States should be settled.10.	It is the right of the people of Puerto Rico to achieve their independence. Let them have that right  and afterwards  if they so wish  they can look to the question of working out special relationships with other countries.11.	As far as the British colonies are concerned  there appears to be a fair prospect of their achieving independence within a reasonable time. However  there are colonies in our region  and the position of our Government remains firm  that independence is the right of all the peoples demanding it. That position cannot be compromised  particularly in relation to the Latin American-Caribbean region  which remainsâand we say this with great indignationâthe most colonized region in the world today.12.	The independence that we seek for our brother nations must be equal in all measures to the independence that we seek for ourselves. Like the vast majority of Members of the United Nations  we are convinced that the people of all territories which are not independent have the inalienable right to self-determination  independence and territorial integrity. We are convinced  too  that all nations have the inalienable right to exercise national sovereignty and to the absolute control of their wealth and natural resources  so as to be able to contribute to the development of their territories and the well-being of their inhabitants. And all of us must be prepared to assist in defending that right and to struggle against any attempts at destabilization and intervention. In our short experience of revolutionary transformation we have experienced varying forms of both.13.	From the very beginning we have faced the threat of military intervention from mercenaries who serve the cause of imperialism. Very early in our revolution we faced what might be called a diplomatic-economic intervention  when imperialist interests again threatened to ruin our tourist industry unless we abided by their dictates. Soon after  we had the experience of violent intervention  when local counter-revolutionary elements in alliance with Mafia and imperialist agents vainly sought to turn back our revolution by overt and covert intervention.14.	The imperialist rumour machine has been working overtime to discredit our efforts at economic  political and social reconstruction. We know  of course  that we are not the only object of imperialist attention. We have seen them try to belittle the Iranian revolution  to discredit the Cuban and Nicaraguan revolutions  to undermine the Kampuchean revolution  the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic  Palestine  Namibia  Ethiopia and Angola  to name just a few. Sadly  this is only an early stage in the plans of imperialism to turn back the tide of revolution. For the pattern has been that when all those plans have failed  those same interventionist forces seek to assassinate the revolutionary leadership. We have experienced their wrath in the savage attack of 19 June  in which three young women were killed and 94 people wounded by a bomb manufactured under licence from imperialism. Those murderous plans of imperialism and its local counter-revolutionary agents and terrorists to wipe out at one blow the revolutionary leadership in our country failed.15.	We in Grenada know that this will not stop now. We know that those elements will continue in their blind ambitions to reverse the will of the people. And we live by the dictum ""hat those who make a revolution must be prepared to defend it.16.	The fact is that the vast majority of us who seek to introduce fundamental change have already faced such experiences and all of us are capable of facing them. None of us  however  can dare to condone any of these interventionist techniques. Indeed  we feel sure that we shall all condemn them as flagrant violations of the sovereign right of each nation to self-determination and independent development.17.	We regret the outbreak of hostilities between Iran and Iraq. Both societies are fuelled by a revolutionary dynamic that is fundamentally anti-imperialist  although each takes a different course. That reality was strikingly illustrated by the fact that  after the hated Shah was deposed  Iraq sponsored Iran for membership in the non-aligned movement. The achievement of a just and lasting peace  which ensures respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity  is therefore our most fervent desire.18.	The past year has witnessed a great increase in Zionist arrogance  insults  insolence and racist oppression. Not only have the Zionists refused to abide by Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  not only have they refused to return the Palestinian lands illegally acquired in 1967  not only have they refused to bow to the demands of world public opinion but  even more  they have illegally acquired the whole of Jerusalem and they have sanctioned the murder  maiming  torture and general violation of the human rights of the people of Palestine.19.	We shall continue to support the right of the people of Palestine to their homeland. Grenada will always support the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO] as the sole and authentic representative of the heroic Palestinian people and we are prepared to make whatever contribution we can to the just settlement of the problem of Israeli encroachment.20.	That pattern of encroachment is being followed by other racist States. In particular  South Africa  which daily brutalizes our black brothers and sisters using the cruel whip of apartheid  has taken to invading Angola and Mozambique in what it arrogantly describes as punitive raids. It is fanning the flames of a war that threatens to be genocidal in its dimensions. It would be most sensible of South Africa immediately to halt its external aggression and its internal repression  to take to heart the experiences of Zimbabwe  Zambia  Malawi  Kenya and others and to initiate a system of majority rule before the passions of racism drive the oppressed blacks of South Africa to a more painful and harrowing solution that will set the world on edge for generations to come.21.	South Africa's illegal occupation of Namibia and its stubborn refusal to heed the advice of even its staunchest allies demonstrate the irrationality of fascism at work. The South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO] has been internationally recognized as the only legitimate representative of the people of Namibia and no amount of imperialist or Fascist manoeuvring can change that fact. A people united in armed struggle cannot be defeated.22.	That dictum applies equally to the valiant and heroic people of El Salvador  where a military junta supported by the local oligarchy and imperialism has been engaged in a genocidal war  in the mistaken belief that they can defeat the people.23.	With imperialist military and financial support  the final day of victory will be delayed but the people can never be defeated. In this forum we wish to declare our support for all our Latin American and Caribbean neighbours struggling for freedom and independence  including the people of Chile  Uruguay  Paraguay and Haiti.24.	The Fascist military coup in Bolivia is totally intolerable. Whatever the extent of the present repression  whatever the price of freedom  the people of Boliviaâthe inheritors of the name of the great liberator  Simon Bolivarâwill  through their own efforts and with the public moral support of the people of Grenada and all other peace-loving people  gain their freedom.25.	From our own experiences and from the lessons of history we know that revolution cannot be forced  created or exported. We know that the objective and subjective factors must merge. Equally  we see each day the balance of forces moving in the direction of revolutionary transformation and we have the fullest confidence that history is on the side of the people because the days of oligarchy  feudalism and fascism are numbered. We continue resolutely to condemn the criminal Pol Pot gang  which murdered millions of Kampucheans. We wish to restate our view that the Pol Pot gang has no right to a place in this Assembly.26.	Turning to Korea  Grenada wishes to restate its position that peace and stability will continue to be unattainable if reunification is not achieved.27.	On the question of Cyprus  Grenada will follow closely the intercommunal talks held under the aegis of the Secretary-General. It is our hope that progress will be made during these talks with a view to finding a just and durable solution that will guarantee the territorial integrity  sovereignty and independence of the Republic of Cyprus and respect its policy of non-alignment.28.	Grenada is a non-aligned country  free of any commitment to any military bloc and anxious to live in a world free of the threat of war. That threat of war looms larger and larger as those who control nuclear weapons for oppressive and exploitative purposes and the means to deliver them throughout the world put petty issues of local political import above and beyond the primary issue of world peace. This  in part  in our understanding  is why reactionary forces in the United States of America are refusing to support ratification of SALT II  thus threatening world peace and security. We in the Caribbean do not have these terrible weapons of war in our hands and we do not need them. But if we are to ensure that the Caribbean remains nuclear-free  we must maintain the call for a collective initiative to ensure that the Caribbean region is recognized as a zone of peace.29.	We call for the support of the United Nations in our attempt to get urgent Latin American and Caribbean action to achieve the following: first  prohibiting the introduction of nuclear weapons into the region; secondly  stopping all aggressive military manoeuvres in the region; thirdly  dis-mantling all foreign military bases that exist in our area; fourthly  ending the colonization of all territories  once and for all; and  fifthly  establishing machinery to deal with all forms of aggression  including assassinations  mercenary invasions  propaganda intervention and diplomatic and economic aggression.30.	This is a far-reaching initiative that will involve all of us in many problems of definition. But  of course  that is no reason for attempting to avoid the tasks involved. The success of such an initiative would make its mark on generations yet unborn and make a deserving contribution to the attainment of the elusive goal of world peace.31.	The peace of the world is also seriously threatened by the pauperization of more than half of mankind and the acquisitive enrichment of a segment of the citizens of the industrialized world.32.	We are on the verge of concluding a reasonable treaty on the law of the sea that will  we hope  make at least a modest contribution to rectifying the dangerous mal-distribution of the world's resources. We support the view that the resources of the seas and oceans should be utilized for the benefit of all the world's peoples. We reject any suggestion that profit-seeking multinational corporations should be allowed free access to the exploitation of these resources. Some mechanisms and institutional arrangements must be implemented to ensure that the interests and basic needs of developing countries are protected. But the piecemeal tack-ling of these urgent problems will not solve the great divisions between North and South. We need a comprehensive new international economic order.33.	In recent years every single report of the developed economies has stated that the world economic situation is grim. Usually these same reports predict a gloomy future for the developing world. These reports say that development prospects for the world's poorer nations are practically zero.34.	When we look at any of the widely used economic indices  what do we find? We find  for example  that poor developing States suffer from much higher rates of inflation. Recent reports indicate that inflation rates in non-oil- producing developing countries averaged 29.4 per cent in 1979 with even higher rates predicted for 1980. The comparable statistics for the advanced industrial States is reported at just under 10 per cent for both years.35.	Certainly a plan of action for structuring the world economy is an absolute necessity. But plans must not remain mere documents. Plans must be implemented. They must be concretized and serious attempts must be made to ensure speedy and successful implementation. And  further  implementation of plans requires genuine commitment on the part of those countries committed to world economic development. But what do we find? We find that in spite of statements of commitment and plans for implementation there has been very little progress towards achieving the goal of a new international economic order. According to the Secretary-General's report  ""in some crucial fields  including money and finance  protection of the purchasing power of developing countries' exports  access to markets  the process of change  if any  is at an early stage"".36.	For us poor countries  accumulation is a serious issue. As colonies  our ability to accumulate resources in order to create conditions for our development was seriously con-strained. Foreign ownership and control of our key resources and massive transfers of resources to finance development in the advanced countries ensured that possibilities for economic transformation were limited.37.	A paragraph on page 5 of the World Economic Out-look: A Survey by the Staff of the International Monetary Fund of May 1980  offers us cold comfort:""In any case  the availability of resources to support developmental expenditures in the non-oil developing countries will tend to be squeezed in the period ahead. Maintenance of domestic savings will be difficult or impossible in the face of very high rates of increase in consumer prices  and the real value of funds borrowed or received through grants from abroad will be impaired by the rise in import prices. Even if substantially larger nominal amounts can be borrowed  the recent and prospective deterioration in the terms of trade of the non-oil developing countries means that a larger volume of domestic output must be used to obtain a given real inflow of imported goods and services.""38.	Finance plays a critical role in the development process. For developing countries  external financial assistance is extremely important  but we must remember that economic backwardness cannot be eradicated simply by attracting foreign capital. Historically  foreign monopolies operating in developing countries have extracted and exported large profits. Rather than promote development  transnational corporations have generated conditions for increasing the impoverishment of poor countries.39.	Official development assistance or aid to poor countries has been recorded as a dismal failure. The developed countries have failed miserably to achieve a limited aid target of 0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product.40.	We know that developing countries cannot generate economic and social progress for their peoples without funds from outside. It is imperative; however  that there be a radical change in the terms and conditions under which external financing is obtained. Whether funds are from Government-to-Government programmes  international financial institutions or private investment sources  the terms and conditions under which they are granted are extremely important; and we strongly support the view that such funds must be allocated in such a way as to guarantee the economic advancement of the developing world.41.	We echo the numerous calls being made in various international forums for democratization of ""international"" financial agencies like IMF. Lending conditions and related economic prescriptions emanating from these institutions must be more sensitive to the needs of the world's poor and materially dispossessed.42.	Primary commodity production continues to be the main source of foreign exchange earnings  employment creation and income generation in the developing world. So far the implementation of policies to strengthen and stabilize primary commodity prices and markets has been limited. Although in operation  the IMF compensatory financing facility requires significant modifications to satisfy the needs of developing countries; for example  use of the IMF facility is based on a country's IMF quota rather than its financial needs or revenue shortfall. The repayment period under the IMF compensatory financing facility is three to five years  whereas the gestation period for primary products in most developing countries is five to seven years  therefore it is our view that the repayment schedule of institutions like the IMF should be extended to a period of not less than 10 years. With this and other international finance issues in mind  we support the Arusha initiative and join the call for a United Nations conference on international money and finance.43.	Economic co-operation among developing States is an area of great concern to us. As colonies and former colonics they had a particular form of integration in the international division of labour. Historically  this has had negative consequences. While some countries provided the sugar  others provided nutmegs and others still provided cocoa or coffee  in the final analysis all developing States imported the finished products from the head office or colonizing country. We had everything to lose  nothing to gain.44.	It is precisely because of that historical experience that we support the deepening of ""South-South"" discussions  not as a replacement for North-South dialogue but to strengthen our negotiating position. More specifically  we urge the implementation of the Arusha programme of collective self-reliance.  In this context  we must ensure that genuine .economic co-operation takes place not only in international trade but also  to a greater extent  in production ventures  marketing and transportation arrangements and financial mobilization. All this must be seen as part of a strategy for eliminating dependence on imperialism and participating in a world economy in conditions which would develop rather than under develop our national economies.45.	In this respect  we welcome the establishment of the joint Venezuela-Mexico oil facility for Latin American and Caribbean countries. This demonstrates a concrete manifestation of South-South co-operation.46.	As we say this  we reiterate our fundamental concern for the needs of particularly disadvantaged countries. We recognize that such countries cannot create the conditions for economic transformation without significant assistance. We agree with the Brandt report's recommendation that ""there must be immediate intervention to attack the root causes of povertyâ and again we call for speedy and meaningful implementation of those policies.47.	When our Prime Minister spoke here last year he stressed our desire for ""a new system of international interdependence  based on mutual respect for sovereignty and a collective will to put an end to imperialist machinations designed to disrupt our unity and purpose"". Our peoples want to establish truly equal and mutually beneficial international co-operation. In this sense  therefore  we sup-port proposals for increased economic co-operation among countries with different economic and social systems.48.	In conclusion  I should like to stress that  although the causes for concern hold sway over considerations of a com-forting and encouraging nature  we are neither discouraged nor pessimistic. Our concerns simply reflect the reality of the millions of the deprived and under-privileged in the third world; our concerns also reflect our firm determination to contribute fully to the solution of the problems we face  matched by our commitment to non-alignment. We are confident that  as the struggle continues  it will find assured victory."
"59",2891,"GTM",35,1980,"ï»¿On behalf of the delegation of Guatemala  I extend to Mr. Rudiger von Wechmar my warm congratulations on his election to the presidency of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. The unanimous confidence which the Assembly has shown in him by electing him to such a high office is fully justified by his participation in the activities of the United Nations and his qualities as a diplomat and international negotiator.263.	I also wish to congratulate his predecessor  Mr. Salim A. Salim  of the United Republic of Tanzania  for having successfully presided over the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly.264.	My delegation joins in the tributes paid in this forum to the United Nations Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  who has done his utmost to tackle the many serious problems confronting the world community.265.	We have read with great interest the Secretary- General's annual report on the work of the Organization and we express our appreciation of that important document  which reflects judgements based on his years of experience in his post during which he has always worked with patience  diplomacy and discretion  thus fully deserving our admiration.266.	I also wish to take this opportunity to convey a cordial welcome to the countries which have just joined the Organization. We support their admission in conformity with the principle of universality  an aspiration which  strengthened by the observance of the provisions of the Charter  is aimed at .the maintenance of world peace.267.	My delegation would like to convey its condolences to the Byelorussian SSR on the tragic death of Pyotr Masherov  alternate member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of that country  which occurred on 4 October.268.	The Government of the Republic of Guatemala  â¢under General Fernando Romeo Lucas Garcia  considers that it is important to describe to this world Assembly what the people of Guatemala are doing at all levels to accelerate269.	Large-scale projects of direct benefit to the people are being carried out in Guatemala. For example  a comprehensive road-building plan has been launched to ensure that Guatemala is endowed with a perfect road network. Work is proceeding to equip the country with hydroelectric plants. Building operations have started to provide Guatemala with a modern and functional port on the Pacific Ocean. The construction of hospitals  health centres  schools and recreational establishments is being accelerated  and we have continued to build housing projects mainly for the low-income sectors.270.	We are also carrying out a land reform policy with the aim of providing farmers not only with land they can own but also with farm credit  training and technical assistance to ensure the best use of the land  effective support for agricultural activities  assistance with the industrialization of agricultural products and construction of the infrastructural works necessary to ensure that farmers have all types of facilities for the marketing of their products.271.	We must note the progress of work in the northern fringe of the country  which comprises an area of 9 140 square kilometres. This area is being incorporated into the activity of the country and is designated for social transformation  since the land is being handed over to be worked mainly on a communal basis. This will allow the settlement of numerous families in that large area assigned for agricultural development.272.	Moreover  the work of reforestation has been intensified through a series of programmes to protect the ecology of the nation.273.	We are continuing to give strong support to the national co-operative movement  mainly with the aim of improving the living conditions of the small producers  most of whom are in the rural areas. We have promulgated the appropriate legislation necessary to strengthen the cooperative movement and have set up the bodies required for the implementation of a comprehensive policy of aid to the workers.274.	Recently  a substantial increase was decreed in the minimum wage of agricultural workers to allow them to cope with the increase in the cost of living  a phenomenon which affects all nations.275.	For the first time in the history of our nation  sports  which are carried on in a fully autonomous manner  enjoy the financial resources required if sports are to be engaged in for the benefit of the country. The State has promulgated legislation granting all kinds of support and encouragement to sports at all levels. The sporting spirit is being fostered among children and young people as a means of creating unity and strengthening feelings of friendship  achievement and solidarity  in accordance with the principle that sports are a patriotic activity.276.	We have begun to harvest the fruits of this policy: young people have discovered that the practice of sports is not only a recreation but a stimulus to their participation in the enhancement of Guatemala's greatness.277.	With reference to hydrocarbons  we are strongly encouraging oil exploration and development. We have already exported modest amountsâa total of 520 000 barrelsâof Guatemalan crude oil.278.	The execution of our educational plan is given high priority  since it is aimed at equating education with the needs and aspiration* of Guatemalan society  with the improvement of the quality of education and of the system  so as to serve the whole population.279.	Every encouragement to cultural development is given and the participation of all social sectors in cultural activities is promoted. Guatemalan folklore  one of our people's sources of pride  is thus protected.280.	Guatemala  as a country in the process of development  is like all other developing countries  faced with a number of problems. Our situation has become worse as a result of the constant and unreasonable increase in the price of oil and its derivatives  and of world inflation whose effects are more strongly felt in the underdeveloped countries  which are more vulnerable to external phenomena.281.	To this we must add the unfair conditions of international trade.282.	In order to continue with development programmes in Guatemala  as in all developing countries  it is urgent to improve the conditions of trade and credit  to obtain easier access to markets and to secure a higher price for the raw materials and industrial goods of the underdeveloped nations  in order to achieve greater equity in the distribution of profits.283.	The strength of the developing countries must be based on the justice of their cause and on their unity. This strength should reside not only in their number but also in the awareness that they constitute the majority of nations and the majority of the world's population. It should be emphasized that their aspirations therefore acquire special significance for the future of mankind.284.	Guatemala considers that the implementation of the decisions agreed to for the establishment of a new international order is a collective responsibility which we are required to support with unshakable faith  co-operation and political will. Any delay or postponement will increase tensions  which will run counter to the interests of all peoples.285.	We have the opportunity to establish a new international order in which all nations can maintain harmonious and just relations with one another.286.	With renewed determination and genuine cooperation  all of us  both developed and developing countries  must respond with courage and determination to this difficult and important challenge.287.	Guatemala is a country which respects and guarantees universally recognized human rights. Such rights  as far as Guatemala is concerned  have been elevated to the category of constitutional precepts since the promulgation of our Constitution on 11 December 1879.288.	As regards fundamental human rights such as the right to life  to education  to free and fairly remunerated work  to decent housing  to health  to access to all levels of education and  in general  to a dignified existence  I have already described the progress which the Guatemalan people  by hard work and their own efforts  are making in pursuit of these noble and so human aspirations.289.	As regards individual human rights  in Guatemala all human beings are free and equal in dignity and rights. There is no discrimination on grounds of race  sex  religion  birth  economic or social position or political opinions. Everyone has the right to do what the law does not prohibit. No one can be persecuted or harmed because of his opinion or acts that do not involve an infringement of the law. Any act preventing or impeding a Guatemalan from exercising his rights or fulfilling his duties as a citizen is punishable. No one may be detained or imprisoned except for an offence and by virtue of an order issued in accordance with the law by a competent judicial authority. In criminal proceedings no one may be obliged to give evidence against himself or his relatives. There is no imprisonment for debt. No one may be convicted without being summoned  tried and sentenced in legal proceedings held before competent and pre-established courts  where the essential legal formalities and guarantees are observed. The domicile and correspondence of all individuals are inviolable. There is complete freedom of movement  of individual or collective petition to the authorities  of peaceful meetings and of association for the different purposes of life. There is freedom of thought without censorship and it is not an offence of slander or insult to denounce  criticize or censure public officials for purely official acts performed during their public duties. There is complete freedom of religion. There is freedom of industry  trade and work. There is freedom of access to the courts to bring proceedings in accordance with the law. The documents of the Administration are public. Suffrage is universal  direct and secret. There are institutions for controlling the conduct of public officials such as parliamentary questioning  the use of amparo (right to legal counsel) and habeas corpus  the law of responsibilities and the law of probity. Congressmen enjoy parliamentary immunity. There is complete freedom of the press  which enjoys special protection.290.	With regard to social human rights  there is freedom to form trade unions for purposes of economic protection and social betterment. There is a system of social security. The right to strike is recognized. Labour legislation is based on principles of social justice with safeguards for the workers. The enjoyment of all kinds of labour benefits is guaranteed  and there is a special labour jurisdiction.291.	With regard to civil legislation  which in a number of aspects falls within the purview of human rights  Guatemala has very advanced provisions  such as those ensuring non-discrimination against children on grounds of birth  the investigation of paternity  the freedom to dispose of property  equal status  with certain requirements  of de facto and civil marriage  so as to guarantee the unity of the family and the rights of the children. There is divorce by mutual consent and divorce on specific grounds. The rights of minors are specially protected and there are special family courts.292.	Penal legislation is designed basically to rehabilitate the delinquent. There are provisions for the remission of penalties through work and the training of prisoners is encouraged so that  on regaining their freedom  they can be useful to society. When penal law favours the accused  it may be applied retroactively. The penalties of life imprisonment  solitary confinement  exile or loss of nationality do not exist in Guatemala.293.	With regard to public liberties  since Guatemala is a free  sovereign and independent nation  it has chosen a republican system of government and it is a parliamentary democracy. The exercise of sovereignty is delegated to the legislative  executive and judicial branches  which are all equal.294.	In Guatemala the President may not be elected; nor may. congressmen  mayors and other numbers of municipal corporations be re-elected before a certain time has elapsed.295.	In Guatemala there is complete political freedom. At the moment there are eight legally registered political parties with different ideologies and tendencies. A number of them are opposed to the present Government.296.	We Guatemalans have experienced all kinds of political systems: a colonial regime  a federation  liberal  conservative  revolutionary  leftist  dictatorial and de facto governments  presidents for life Juntas and triumvirates; but we have found our right institutional path through suffrage. Thus  so far  we have elected four successive governments by popular vote  the first time we have achieved this in our history.297.	Democracy is a living reality in Guatemala where the universities  the central bank  the social security system and the municipalities are autonomous. There are other bodies which enjoy decentralized or semi-autonomous status for the better fulfilment of their objectives.298.	There are now four ex-Presidents living in Guatemala  together with all the persons who have held high office in former administrations.299.	In Guatemala there is not a single political prisoner and no citizen has been exiled. The right of asylum is respected and the few persons who have sought asylum in the diplomatic missions accredited to Guatemala have been granted safe conduct out of the country  in accordance with our domestic legislation and the international conventions to which Guatemala is a party.300.	We Guatemalans seek through our political system to be genuine and authentic persons  we try to find our own path and to live in peace  with dignity  in a free society  engaging in fruitful and productive work and enjoying to the full the aptitudes and qualities of citizenship and all the advantages of material  moral  civic  intellectual and spiritual development.301.	In this way Guatemalans enjoy  exercise and observe all human rights in the broadest possible sense and the State guarantees the exercise of such rights.302.	Our Government feels it is important to refer to the campaign which certain groups and individuals abroad have been waging against Guatemala in an attempt to undermine its international prestige. They have not succeeded in this aim because they have encountered the rock-like unity of the Guatemalan people  which rejects any kind of interference in its domestic affairs.303.	Precisely for that reason  in the face of the campaign directed against the people of Guatemala by foreign sectarian organizations  we have extended an invitationâalready acceptedâto the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights of the Organization of American States to visit Guatemala in order to observe our full enjoyment of human rights.304.	In the same spirit  on behalf of the people and Government of Guatemala  I invite citizens of all countries of the world to visit Guatemala and see how things really are in our country.305.	Despite the fact that Guatemala enjoys all possible freedoms  some groups  inspired by political and economic doctrines alien to the people of Guatemala  instead of channelling their aspirations through civic participation in the political parties  have chosen the path of violence as a means of usurping power and enslaving our people.306.	This tortuous campaign  which is instigated  supported and financed from abroad  has given rise to the formation of clandestine groups which compete with each other in acts of terrorism and murder  spilling the blood of Guatemalans and bringing mourning and sorrow to Guatemalan homes.307.	These subversive factions  by public statements and announcements sent to the news media  have arrogated to themselves the right to commit acts of violence.308.	The Guatemalan people rejects the activities of these factions. There is a fervent desire for peace among the population who is profoundly concerned at the climate of violence now existing in Central America.309.	Thus  farmers  workers  organizations  associations  groups  political parties  universities  professional schools  trade unions  and in general all the sectors which make up our population have made public appeals to the warring factions and have called upon them to cease their activities and to understand that dialogue is the best way of settling differencesâa view which the Government of the Republic fully supports.310.	This year saw the beatification of that venerable servant of God  Pedro de San Jose de Betancur  the first Guatemalan saint. That apotheosis met with the spontaneous approval of the Guatemalan people and the date of the beatification  22 June  was declared Peace Day in Guatemala.311.	Also  upon popular request  it was decided to construct a peace plaza as a symbol of the overwhelming aspiration of the people for peace.312.	In addition  we were visited this year by Mother Teresa  winner of the Nobel peace prize and a missionary who has dedicated her life to the cause of the poor.313.	The people of Guatemala have made public their profound desire for peace in the country and there have been many spontaneous demonstrations in favour of peace throughout the country.314.	On 7 September last  in the capital  there was a huge demonstration in favour of peace in Guatemala. More than 500 000 persons participated  prompted by their own convictions and desires. They came from all parts of the nation and belonged to ail social sectors: peasants  workers  students  professionals  private and State employees  businessmen  industrialists  farmers and so on. They condemned the extremist factions which spread subversion  terrorism and death. That massive demonstration showed the fervent desire for peace that lies in all Guatemalan hearts.315.	We Guatemalans hope that peace will once again reign in our country and we are doing our utmost to secure that noble objective.316.	We are convinced that  with God's help  we shall achieve in Guatemala the peace so fervently desired by the whole people.317.	The groups abroad who are fostering a climate of violence in Guatemala are completely out of touch with our social situation  traditions  special qualities  the spirit of unity of our people  the political history of the country and the values inherent in our Guatemalan nationhood. It is precisely because of that ignorance that they are making false allegations against the Guatemalan people.318.	In the international field Guatemala is following a policy which is fully in accord with its national policy. Thus we support the decisions adopted by the world community which are designed to uphold certain fundamental values: peace  freedom  justice and social progress  democracy  the promotion and observance of human rights and respect for the dignity of nations.319.	The foreign policy of Guatemala is based on principles enshrined in international law  such as non-intervention in the internal or external affairs of other States  the territorial integrity of nations  ideological pluralism  the sovereignty of countries  the peaceful settlement of disputes between States  good faith in the fulfilment of international undertakings and the development of international cooperation and solidarity.320.	With regard to the Central American countries  Guatemala is following a policy of fraternal association with their peoples and respect for their Governments. It is a sincere believer in Central American integration at all levels  aimed at the early reconstruction of the Central American fatherland.321.	In pursuit of that noble aim of our peoples  the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Central American nations met at San Jose  Costa Rica  in March this year to work out effective machinery to give it practical effect. At that meeting we adopted  on 15 March  a very important document entitled the Declaration of San Jose. It sets forth the basic points for implementing a series of measures designed to increase the fraternal links between the countries of the region on the basis of mutual respect  and to advance the process of integration of the Central American countries. Regular meetings of the Central American Ministers will continue in order to evaluate the progress made and to take the action necessary to secure the goal we have described.322.	At the Latin American level  Guatemala maintains cordial relations of diplomacy  friendship and co-operation with all nations. We extend our support to all just causes and we are doing our utmost to strengthen our region to enable it to participate in decision-making on the grave problems confronting the world and so that the importance of the Latin American continent may be recognized within the international community.323.	At the world level  our policy is to understand the problems besetting the human race and to search for solutions to them.324.	As a founding Member of the United Nations  Guatemala has continued to make its political and juridical contribution to the United Nations  with the aim of promoting the achievement of the purposes and principles set forth in the Charter.325.	We are convinced that the United Nations has been and still is the most important instrument yet devised by the family of nations for the maintenance of peace and security in the world and for the promotion of the principles of freedom  justice and human dignity.326.	We support the appeal which has been made for strengthening the United Nations so that it can play a more effective role in tackling the serious political  economic and social problems we are facing.327.	To sum up  the international policy of Guatemala is sovereign  democratic  realistic  responsible  honest and dignified. We seek friendship and co-operation with all nations  we have faith in international organizations and we respect all countries. Our foreign policy is carried out with the aim of helping to establish an international community in which the rights of peoples to determine freely their own destiny are recognized and international peace and security are not mere aspirations but effective realities.328.	My delegation wishes now to refer to the longstanding dispute between Guatemala and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland over the territory of Belize.329.	Guatemala reaffirms in this world forum that Belize is an integral part of our national territory.330.	It also reiterates that the rights of Guatemala over the territory of Belize are unquestionable. They are founded on solid historical  geographical  legal  political and moral arguments  of which the international community is well aware.331.	It solemnly declares  once again  that Guatemala cannot accept  recognize or permit the unilateral granting of independence to Belize by the colonial Power which usurped the territory. That would involve the dismemberment of our native land  a matter on which we cannot compromise because it affects the integrity of our territory  which we are pledged to defend at all costs.332.	In that respect  it is pertinent to quote paragraph 6 of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV)  which states:""Any attempt aimed at the partial or total disruption of the national unity and the territorial integrity of a country is incompatible with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.""333.	The dispute over Belize is subject to a process of direct negotiation among the parties involved: Guatemala  the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the representatives of Belize.334.	In other words  the dispute is governed by one of the procedures set forth in the Charter of the United Nations for the peaceful settlement of such disputes. Hence  the United Nations must not intervene or take a stand on this question. If it does so  instead of helping to solve the problem  its intervention will constitute interference in bilateral negotiations. It would be seeking a political solution to what is a territorial dispute in which very special elements are involved.335.	Guatemala rejects in this case the intervention of the United Nations and restates its position that it will not consider itself bound by the resolutions which have been adopted or which may be adopted on this question.336.	Similarly  it repudiates the interference of Governments which have absolutely nothing to do with this dispute but which arrogate to themselves the right to dispose of the territory of another nation. This is contrary to the principles of non-interference in the internal or external affairs of other nations and to the respect which States must show to each other  as laid down in the Charter of our Organization.337.	More than two years ago Guatemala and the United Kingdom began a new series of direct negotiations  in which they have made some progress. They are sure they can reach a solution that will be honourable and just to all the parties concerned.338.	Guatemala has come to the negotiating table with the sincere desire to accept conciliatory formulas for the equitable settlement of the dispute  taking into account the legitimate rights of Guatemala over the territory of Belize and the vital interests of the inhabitants of that territory.339.	Within this round of negotiations  there was a meeting on 19 and 20 May 1980 in Bermuda between the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Guatemala and the United Kingdom. Officials from Belize also attended.340.	I visited London at the end of June and the United Kingdom Minister of State for Commonwealth Foreign Affairs was in Guatemala in the early part of August.341.	Also  on 7 and 8 July 1980  a meeting of technical officials from Guatemala and the United Kingdom was held here in New York.342.	At all these meetings we viewed the dispute from different angles  determined to find a solution to it. We shall continue our future discussions along these lines. The next meeting is to be held in New York.343.	Obviously  the problem is complicated  but we feel that if the parties concerned show goodwill a just settlement to this territorial dispute will be found.344.	I wish to extend my best wishes to the President for the success of this session of the Assembly under his experienced guidance  and I reaffirm the faith of my country in the United Nations.345.	This world body has played an important role in the maintenance of international peace  security and understanding.346.	The establishment of a new world order is the responsibility of all countries  great and small  developed and developing. This objective can be attained if all nations are ready to sacrifice a small part of their interests for the benefit of mankind.347.	Guatemala will always associate itself with all efforts to achieve peace  social justice  freedom  democracy  support for and observance of human rights  friendship among peoples and the prosperity and development of nations."
"60",2936,"GUY",35,1980,"ï»¿The unanimous election of Ambassador von Wechmar to the presidency of this thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly is a source of great pleasure to me and to my delegation. I congratulate him most warmly. Guyana pledges its full support and cooperation to him in the exercise of his stewardship  confident that he will conduct the affairs of this Assembly with the efficiency which is one of his manifest characteristics.157.	Let me also seize this opportunity to pay a special tribute to his distinguished predecessor  Ambassador Salim Ahmed Salim of the United Republic of Tanzania. Upon Ambassador Salim's broad and eminently capable shoulders fell the work not only of the thirty-fourth session but also of the sixth and seventh emergency special sessions as well as the eleventh special session. It is to his lasting credit that he bore these unprecedented responsibilities with cheerful fortitude and consummate skill. In the discharge of his duties  Ambassador Salim not only reflected the values which his country and his continent espouse but also upheld the principles of equity and justice advocated by the movement of nonaligned countries in pursuit of the fulfilment of the highest and finest sensibilities of man. We are greatly indebted to him.158.	At this session it is with satisfaction that we record a further advance in the historic march against colonialism. We do so as we welcome into our midst the new State of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  with which Guyana has a shared historical experience. Bound as we are by close cultural  political and geographic ties  we look forward to continuing within this Organization the fraternal cooperation which characterizes the relations between our two leaders  our two Governments and our two peoples.159.	As we contemplate the international agenda for action in the 1980s  it is not inapposite for us to reflect on the nature and the evolution of the international system which was constructed in 1945 and to assess its achievements no less than its failures. In that analysis it is relevant  I suggest  to recall the assumptions which underpinned that system.160.	Is it not an effective commentary on the capacity of that system to be consistently in step with the reality of change that in today's circumstances there is retained in the Charter of the United Nations a reference to ""enemy State""? The present enemies of the vast majority of mankind are those forces which have made a permanent investment in the maintenance of relationships which derive from domination  hegemony and control.161.	It is a truism to assert that our world is more complex than that of the mid1940s. Nothing more strikingly demonstrates this change than the rise of the postcolonial States and their clamant and sustained endeavour to exercise their right to participate as equals in the management of their present and the determination of their future. The dramatic increase in the number of State actors in the international system is not only a statistical reality; it is also a factor of qualitative significance. In this Assembly  Africa is represented by as many Member States as our Organization had at its creationâ51; and Asia and Latin America  since those early days in San Francisco  have also advanced the principle of universality by contributing  respectively  32 and 10 Member States to our Organization.162.	Also of significance has been the increased role of transnational corporations  which today are responsible for 35 per cent of all world production and account for more than 30 per cent of world trade  and which in essential areas lie beyond the reach of both national and international direction and supervision.163.	Nothing  no single act  so starkly illustrates the contradictions in the workings of the international system as the failure of the recently concluded eleventh special session to reach agreement on the procedures for a new global round of negotiations on international economic cooperation for developmentâand this  despite the fact that the necessity for such negotiations had earlier attracted consensus.164.	In this regard  no analysis of the present international system can fail to take account of the role of the movement of nonaligned countries. The policy of nonalignment places that movement in the vanguard of the struggle for democratic international relations  including new equitable forms of international economic cooperation. Such is the strength  the efficacy and the influence of the movement of nonaligned countries that some States which are not within its ranks seek to win its support or to deflect it from the resolute pursuit of internally agreed policies.165.	Clearly there have been since 1945 changes in the international system and adaptation of the rules that govern relations between States. But generally these changes have not occurred as a result of the recognition by those who created the system of the need for them and the adoption of consciously determined action. In the main  such changes have been generated in response to pressures from actors like the developing countries and other forces.166.	The critical question therefore is the extent to which the changes fall short of the objective requirements of the global policy. The simple truth is that those who created the system still seek to maintain dominion over it.167.	As we survey the situation which confronts mankind at this particular juncture of history and undertake our analysis of the evolution of the international system  it becomes difficult to express unequivocal satisfaction with what has been achieved with regard to the establishment of conditions for a secure and lasting peace. This is palpably evident in the field of disarmament  which has always been a primary goal of this Organization. The present environment of tension and crisis provides a chilling dramatization of failure to control the escalation in arms and to move towards genuine disarmament.168.	Central to the question of arms control and disarmament and the attendant impact on peace and security is the relationship between the dominant military Powers and the blocs with which they are associated. The net result is that  in so far as there have been global efforts to deal with the issue of disarmament  an asymmetrical relationship has been established between the two militarily dominant blocs and the much larger category of developing countries. Thus  because of the manner in which disarmament diplomacy has until now been conducted and the rules of exclusivity which it encompasses  this latter group  as representative of the majority of the world's people  has not been enabled to play a role corresponding to the stake which it has in international peace and security. In the result  the diplomacy of arms control and disarmament has largely been the function of major Power relationships and the less than global strategic perceptions that inform those relationships. Even where the major Powers have ascribed responsibility to themselves in limited response to a global need  they have not always carried out their obligations. They have  for example  failed to adopt effective measures for ending the nuclear arms race and for nuclear disarmament  as required by the provisions of the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Who can therefore take issue with a cynic who asserts that continuing inaction in this respect supports the objective of maintaining a nuclear status quo?169.	In the general area of relaxation of international tension we need to assess the prospects of the much vaunted detente. In its essence  detente was embraced as an instrument for regulating the relations between the major Powers. It derived from recognition that uncontrolled military competition between the major Powers could be mutually self-destructive and that there can be meaningful bases for productive cooperation between them. Detente therefore assumed the character of an agreed policy for antagonistic collaboration between the major Powers.170.	The general understanding and expectations of detente when it acquired political legitimacy were positive and favourable. That is why the movement of nonaligned countries has always encouraged and supported it and called for its extension to embrace the relations of all States in all their dimensions.171.	We have however been witness to several attempts at imposing unilateral interpretations of the nature and scope of detente. Any interpretation which  in the context of contemporary realities  encourages hierarchical relationships and spheres of influence is therefore unacceptable.172.	Integrally linked to any genuine new effort to globalize detente must be a renewed commitment to respect the sovereignty and independence of States and to refrain from interference in their internal affairs. In this regard  Guyana and other nonaligned countries have since 1976 sought to persuade the international community to adopt a declaration on non-interference in the internal affairs of States. We shall continue with our efforts at this session.173.	In proceeding with our assessment of the international system  let us applaud the outstanding contribution which this Organization has made to the struggle against colonialism. It was in 1960 that General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) was adopted  a resolution which represented a concrete elaboration of a right enshrined in the Charterâ the right of peoples to self-determination. More than that  resolution 1514 (XV) defined operational perspectives for the implementation of that right. I suggest that that resolution be regarded as the ""freedom charter for colonial peoples"". This year  therefore  as the twentieth anniversary of that charter is celebrated  let us be reminded that there were some at the time of its adoption who stood aside from endorsing the provisions of that resolution  thereby signalling a reluctance to be in the mainstream of efforts to assert the right of colonial peoples to self-determination and independence.174.	Guyana takes this opportunity to salute the sterling work of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. It is a matter of public record that that Committee  allied with progressive forces  has lent valuable support to the colonial peoples and their liberation movements in the struggle for the recovery of their freedom. The victories have been great and they have been many; but the work is incomplete and there are still some vestigial remains. On this important anniversary of resolution 1514 (XV)  let this Assembly  in the name of human dignity and in the interest of freedom everywhere  resolve to bring a speedy end to colonialism and thus promote the cause of decolonization.175.	It is undoubtedly in southern Africa that the colonial impulse has been most enduring. The recent victory of the people of Zimbabwe  who are now properly represented in this Organization  helps to sharpen the focus of our attention on the problem of apartheid in South Africa and the situation in Namibia  rendering more propitious the moment for generalized efforts to terminate colonialism and apartheid once and for all in the southern Africa subsystem.176.	We can no longer put up with the unparalleled effrontery of South Africa. We musk resolutely implement the plan so carefully and elaborately devised for the early independence of Namibiaâfor Namibia is decidedly next on the calendar of political freedom. Let us reserve its place in this Organization now.177.	In North Africa  Western Sahara represents a new dimension in colonial relationships. We again call on Morocco to respect the legitimate aspirations of the people of that territory. For our part  Guyana recognizes and has established diplomatic relations with the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic. Let us also reserve its place in this Organization now.178.	In my own hemisphere  Belize is still held at the threshold of nationhood  despite the overwhelming support given by the United Nations to its people's legitimate aspirations. Guyana reiterates unequivocally its support for the inalienable and imprescriptible rights of the people of Belize to an early and secure independence with their territorial integrity intact. Let us  with Belize  fix a date for its freedom. Let us reserve its place in this Organization now.179.	There are two issues which have been with us from the beginning of this Organization's work and which have remained flashpoints for global conflict. The first relates to what has historically been an arena of competing strategic interests. It is the Middle East. I do not need to recount the history of our consideration of that question in all its aspects. Suffice it to say that any mature reflection on the evolution of the Middle East situation and the Palestinian question in the United Nations and elsewhere would reveal a distinctive and decisive shift within recent times in favour of the Palestine liberation forces and the cause of the Arab nation. The shift has involved widening support for the Palestinian people. It has also involved increasing recognition of their liberation organization  the PLO  and of its vanguard role in the legitimate struggle for the restoration of the national rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to a homeland in an independent State in Palestine. The Palestinians have thus returned to centre stage  and no contrary assertion can invalidate that reality.180.	The continuing manifestation of intransigence and lack of sensitivity by Israel increases instability and tension and serves to impose further constraints on the search for a comprehensive solution. The purported annexation of East Jerusalem and Israel's flagrant interventions in Lebanon only frustrate that search.181.	The centrality of the rights of the Palestinians is beyond question  and so too are the other requirements for peace in the Middle Eastâthe no acquisition of territory by force  implying and involving the withdrawal of Israel from all territories occupied since June 1967  and the right of all States in the area to live within mutually recognized boundaries.182.	Peace is also urgently required on the Korean peninsula. The people of Korea  in a South North Joint Communique of 4 July 1972 expressed their desire for the peaceful reunification of their fatherland without outside interference and involving the withdrawal of foreign troops. In this connexion Guyana takes note with satisfaction of the more recent proposals advanced by the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and its expressed readiness to resume meaningful talks. Let us determine to make that resolve an early reality.183.	Similarly  we must make a concerted effort to bring a lasting peace to Cyprus on the basis of a framework of action long established by this Organization. In this regard we take note of the resumption of the intercommunal negotiations. We should give every encouragement to those talks in order to ensure their successful conclusion.184.	Beyond those specific issues  the potential for regional conflict remains a danger to global peace and security. In this respect the movement of nonaligned countries has consistently supported the creation of zones of peace  in the Indian Ocean and in the Mediterranean  for example. In my own region  the Caribbean  the peoples of the area are increasingly demanding that it should be a zone of tranquillity  an area in which the various nation States can pursue freely their own independent paths of political  social and economic development. We believe in non-interference and ideological pluralism. The Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Commonwealth Caribbean  meeting in Saint Lucia in February of this year  acknowledged that ideological pluralism is an irreversible fact of international relations. It is now time for the adoption of appropriate measures to make the Caribbean truly a zone of peace.185.	Like the zone of peace  regional organization not only can serve to develop economic and other forms of functional cooperation between States but can foster political understandings  thereby contributing to peaceful and harmonious relations. The peoples of the Caribbean and of Latin America have been prominent in the search for such new forms of organization.186.	Inspired by those objectives  Guyana and other States in the Caribbean have since 1965 been pursuing the elaboration of practical steps to promote regional cooperation and integration. Those efforts are aimed at maximizing cooperation and integration within the region and at laying a more secure basis for its survival and development.187.	In the wider context of Latin America  we have  through the creation in 1975 of SELA  sought to promote arrangements for beneficially utilizing our complementaries and for the elaboration of common policies in the global search for just and equitable economic relations.188.	More recently  in 1978 eight States of South America which embrace the Amazon shield have concluded a treaty to promote the harmonious  rational and mutually beneficial use of the vast resources of the Amazon region. In many senses the Amazon is one of the last frontiers of mankind. Similar frontiers have in the past been rapaciously and unscrupulously despoilt in the pursuit of policies informed by considerations which were other than global in their scope and humanistic in their effect. A tremendous responsibility therefore devolves on the States involved. They should make recompense both in terms of the restoration of renewable resources such as forests  which have been recklessly utilized  and the sensible and rational exploitation of new frontiers in the sea and the seabed.189.	For its part  Guyana will not allow any derogation of its sovereignty with regard to the development of its part of the Amazon shield. We urge those who at present seek through seemingly humanistic and altruistic motives to pontificate on the development of the Amazon shield to channel their not inconsiderable energies and influence in the direction of the reconstruction made necessary by past excesses elsewhere.190.	Next month the countries of the Amazon basin will meet in their first substantive consultations in Brazil. It is Guyana's expectation that those consultations will represent a watershed in the efforts of States collectively to pursue cooperative arrangements for their development.191.	Thus it is important that  as we welcome the positive developments on the recently concluded ninth session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  we remain cognizant of what is yet to be accomplished. A good basis for an international law of the sea treaty does exist. If in the concluding session full account is taken of the legitimate interests of all States  the agreement reached will mark a turning point in our collective efforts to make a reality of our acknowledged interdependence. That is why Guyana views with apprehension the unilateral promulgation of deep-sea mining legislation while negotiations are in progress and an agreement for mutual benefit appears to be within our grasp.192.	Interdependence is frequently invoked in this forum and elsewhere. Less frequently  however  is a conception of interdependence espoused which takes account of the critical requirements for a democratic international order. Indeed it would be apt to observe that interdependence as proposed by some States amounts to nothing but a facade for the status quo. In our view that kind of interdependence perpetuates inequitable relations  and fosters contradictions. Such a situation is decidedly not conducive to global peace and security.193.	Properly defined and applied  interdependence can be one of several important and positive bases for the 1980s. It is in this context of interdependence and mutual benefit that we must view the need for a new international economic order and a new information order.194.	The twin prerequisites of genuine peace and security are decolonization and international economic democracy.195.	Colonialism has left a most pervasive legacy. Its effects are felt no less by the former oppressed than by the oppressors. Decolonization is a process  and the colonizers themselves need to be decolonized if they are to fully comprehend and meaningfully respond to the objective conditions of today's world.196.	The new international economic order is an essential foundation of international concern for the promotion of human rights. To the extent that one of us stands aside from full participation in the implementation of such an order or seeks to frustrate its achievement  to that extent is our commitment to human rights diminished. Let us therefore use the opportunity which this thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly provides to continue the search for agreement on the procedures and agenda for a new global round of negotiations on international economic cooperation. Let us also demonstrate our commitment to the rights of the hungry  to the rights of the destitute and to the rights of the poor by giving careful consideration to the serious proposals put forward by our Secretary General for an early action programme on the critical economic situation of many developing countries.197.	A desideratum for the 1980s is the quickening of the pace of economic cooperation among developing countries. It is both a requirement for the development of the developing countries and an impetus for effecting structural change in the international system. In these efforts the United Nations must play an enhanced supporting role.198.	Allied with the effort for a new international economic order is the necessity to alter the present information system which reinforces attitudes and perceptions that have their origins in hierarchy and domination. Equally  a new information order must eschew the use of the media as a tool of subversion and destabilization.199.	Though there are attempts to reinforce relations based on power  the international system is in a process of transition. At the beginning of the 1980s we have entered a period of heightened and generalized tension and involving increased interventions and interferences. Therefore all the more reason exists for the adoption of democratically determined arrangements for managing the transition to new and more egalitarian norms of international behaviour.200.	In the programme of action we devise for the 1980s  let us collectively agree to halt the development of underdevelopment and show our appreciation of the narrowing margins of safety into which mankind is being drawn.201.	The Director General of FAO observed recently: ""We are on the verge of simultaneous human disaster in many countries of an unprecedented character  with all the terrible implications of the consequences of inaction"". It is an observation  I suggest  which has a relevance and validity wider than the immediate cause which inspired it.202.	Finally  if we are to respond adequately to the challenges of this decade  there must be etched in the political consciousness of all of us the imperatives of true peace and the need for such mechanisms as would make it a lasting reality. The prospects of success will be accelerated if those who in the past have been reluctant to be part of the vanguard will  in their own interest  take a leap into what will be tomorrow's history"
"61",2980,"HND",35,1980,"ï»¿Mr. President  first of all I wish to extend to you the sincere congratulations of the delegation of Honduras on the well-deserved honour of being unanimously elected President of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. Your well-known qualifications and diplomatic experience constitute a firm guarantee that our debates will be directed with wisdom and impartiality  in an atmosphere of understanding and tolerance.173.	We also wish to express our appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Salim  who firmly  skilfully and with statesmanlike vision guided the proceedings of the General Assembly during a particularly difficult year.174.	We also congratulate the Secretary General on his tireless and patient labours to achieve the objectives of the Charter  and  in particular  world peace and security and the promotion of genuine international cooperation.175.	We cordially welcome Saint Vincent and the Grenadines as a new Member of this Organization from our American continent and therefore a young country enjoying our affection and friendship.176.	Unfortunately  it is not news that at the beginning of our session the world is immersed in an ideological  moral  economic and social crisis. It is not news  because mankind  since it came into being  has always lived in a state of crisis. What is really alarming is that the situation is becoming increasingly aggravated  and ethical and legal principles regarded by our forefathers as immutable are now being questioned and attacked.177.	It has been said more than once that the sign of our times is development and that the new name of peace is development. Not only material wellbeing but also freedom and justice can be achieved by means of development.178.	Yet I would venture to maintain that another characteristic of our times is paradox. Indeed  never before has man been able to unravel so many of the secrets of nature or to master such advanced technology. Never before  moreover  has he been so close to bringing about his own total destruction. Distances have disappeared  but men are ever more remote from their fellows. Purely natural factors have added immeasurably to the wealth of a few and have deeply impoverished many others. On the one hand  culture has reached spectacular levels  while  on the other hand  it has sunk to abysmal depths  as occurs in warlike confrontations based on differences of religion and race long thought to have been done away with forever.179.	That is why we firmly believe that the Committee on Disarmament must work even harder so as to ensure an end to the arms race  the adoption of effective disarmament measures and the initiation of sufficient transfers of economic resources to meet development needs.180.	Honduras took part in the second Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  held recently at Geneva  and regrets that obstacles remain which make it impossible to strike the necessary balance between the obligations of the nuclear Powers and nonnuclear weapon States. Similarly  we are worried that a number of countries which  because of their financial resources and technical ability could within a short time manufacture nuclear weapons  have not yet acceded to the Treaty. Hence my country believes that we must improve the inspection machinery of IAEA  the better to be able to supervise the transfer of nuclear materials  thus lessening the legitimate anxiety caused by a possible proliferation of nuclear weapons in the present international situation.181.	In 1980 we are witnessing an aggravation of international tension and a proliferation of wars and internal conflicts  thus increasing the probability of serious conflagrations throughout the world. These dangerous events bring into question the machinery for the Pacific settlement of disputes established under the United Nations Charter and create doubts as to the will for peace of the great Powers  which can involve the medium and small countries in their ideological and strategic confrontations.182.	The war in Lebanon continues unabated  without the presence of the United Nations forces  which Honduras supports  being a sufficient element of deterrence to prevent both armed incursions into Israel and military actions and bombing by Israeli forces within Lebanon. Our country  which in past years has urged caution on the parties to a conflict imposed on the people of Lebanon  once again condemns the circumstances of senseless bloodshed and urges respect for the territorial integrity  self-determination and wellbeing of the Lebanese.183.	Although the overall situation in the Middle East has been stabilized between Israel and Egypt  owing to the commendable initiative of President Sadat and the Camp David accords  it nevertheless remains tense and likely to lead to explosive consequences.184.	The problem of security for all the countries of the region  and Israel in particular  is closely linked to the prompt consideration of and justice for the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people  which do not relate merely to their status as refugees.185.	Honduras continues therefore to favour a negotiated political settlement which  on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  will guarantee peace to all parties  including the Palestinian people  and put an end to the continuing Israeli occupation of various Arab territories.186.	Our country is carefully studying the resolutions adopted at the seventh emergency special session of the General Assembly and is closely following the initiatives of the European Economic Community. At the same time  we cannot accept unilateral measures altering the status of Jerusalem  and we consider that the continued policy of Israeli settlements in occupied Arab territories is a serious obstacle to the peace process.187.	The tension in the Middle East has recently been extended to the coastal countries of the Indian Ocean  which have in various forums shown their legitimate concern at the escalation of confrontation in the area.188.	Our Government continues to be seriously concerned at the occupation of the United States Embassy in Iran and the holding of members of its staff as hostages. We take this opportunity to reiterate our appeal to the authorities of the Islamic Republic of Iran to ensure their prompt release in a dignified manner  in conformity with international law.189.	As we said at the sixth emergency special session  the presence of Soviet troops in Afghanistan is a flagrant violation of international law and creates a situation of growing danger  which several neighbouring countries of Afghanistan have denounced. General Assembly resolution ES6/2 therefore continues to be relevant  and we expect that measures will be taken to comply with it.190.	Meanwhile  in Southeast Asia  Thailand continues to be threatened by the unforeseeable consequences of the war in Kampuchea. Once again we are encountering an area of tension in which foreign intervention in the internal affairs of a country threatens to engender a conflict of more serious proportions which  unfortunately  might successively involve the great Powers. For its part  Honduras is in favour of United Nations action aimed at normalization of the situation and supports the countries of ASEAN in their efforts to bring that about.191.	Those problems have also brought to light the great human tragedy of the refugees. Our country  which in the past two years has had to bear the grave consequences of the displacement of refugees in Central America  once again wishes to draw the attention of the international community to the need to give greater support to the programmes of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.192.	For some years the Central American region has been one of conflicting interests for some and of concern for others  and it is regrettable that what attracts world attention should be the violence that has racked some of the countries of the isthmus.193.	Because of its geographical location  Honduras is at the very heart of Central America and shares boundaries with Guatemala  El Salvador and Nicaragua. This proximity goes hand in hand with a special affinity among our peoples  since we have the same origins and are aware that we share a common destiny. It is therefore logical that what happens in neighbouring countries is of extraordinary significance for us. We therefore view with profound sorrow the continued bloodshed among our brothers  and with growing concern the results to which violence could lead us.194.	It is a source of great satisfaction to me to represent the Provisional Government of Honduras at this session of the Assembly. That Government came into being after the general elections held on 20 April last  which led to the convening  on 20 July  of the freely elected and democratically representative National Constituent Assembly. The latter  after preparing a new Constitution for the Republic  will call for direct presidential elections in 1981.195.	Fortunately  our country enjoys political and social stability and channels its economic development efforts towards the greater wellbeing of all. The peace which my country enjoys is scarcely the product of mere chance or coincidence: it is the result of persevering efforts begun three decades ago by all sectors of the people and Government of Honduras to create an atmosphere of freedom  political stability and social justice. In this respect  I deem it appropriate to quote the following words of General Policarpio Paz Garcia  the President of Honduras  on 20 August last  when he established the new Government Cabinetâwords which summarize the philosophy behind governmental action in a new stage of our institutional process:""We have not been vaccinated against violence. Accepting this premise does not mean that we contemplate the future pessimistically  but rather that we acknowledge that all Hondurans  regardless of their place in society  have a serious responsibility for the maintenance of peace. It means that the armed forces and the political  economic and social forces of the nation must form a national front capable of ensuring for the Republic inviolable  sovereign and secure boundaries and an internal atmosphere in which  united  we can face the challenges of this decadeâpoverty  backwardness  sickness  ignorance  unemployment and lack of physical communicationsâand establish on sound bases a pluralistic and reforming political regime.""This imposes on us the urgent need for a thorough review of our economic system in order to bring about a just and equitable development of our society  by the adoption of the necessary machinery and the bold institution of the reforms considered appropriate to our particular characteristics  our real capabilities and the experience we have acquired thus far.196.	In the Central American context  I am pleased to be able to say that the mediation procedure adopted by Honduras and El Salvador to settle the differences that have existed since 1969 is proceeding normally  under the wise guidance of the eminent Peruvian jurist  Mr. Jose Luis Bustamante y Rivero. The political will to find a settlement evinced by both sides gives us legitimate grounds for hope that in the near future a just  dignified and final solution to all the pending problems between the two countries will be reached.197.	In conformity with its domestic policy  Honduras  furthermore  seeks to reaffirm  at the Central American and Caribbean level  the principles of territorial integrity  self-determination and democratic pluralism. We therefore participated in the meeting of Foreign Ministers of Guatemala  EI Salvador  Honduras  Nicaragua  Costa Rica and Panama  who  on 15 March 1980  adopted the San Jose Declaration  an instrument which we consider very important for the development of integration and cooperation among the countries of the Central American isthmus.198.	In our view  the countries of Central America and the coastal States of the Caribbean should join forces to foster a normalization of relations among the countries of the area. That could be followed by positive increases in commercial and cultural relations and economic cooperation among them.199.	In this respect  it is also fitting to recall the agreement on financial and energy cooperation reached by Honduras and other countries with the Governments of Mexico and Venezuela on 3 August 1980  which represents  in our opinion  a specific effort at the economic solidarity so badly needed in the economic crisis we are experiencing.200.	Indeed  the international economic situation continues to be characterized by monetary disorder  inflation and increasing protectionism  as well as by stagnationâ with a few honourable exceptionsâin the levels of financial and technical assistance for development. The North South dialogue must go on.201.	The recently concluded eleventh special session of the General Assembly sought to make effective the postulates of the new international economic order by sponsoring a round of global economic negotiations within the United Nations. Nevertheless  some industrialized countries still lack the necessary political will. Accordingly  at this session of the Assembly we have to work out the agenda and timetable for those negotiations.202.	The Government of Honduras  for its part  is making serious development efforts through a five-year national plan and a short-term programme of action. Similarly  in 1980  with the support of all social sectors  it initiated a broad national literacy campaign to mobilize throughout the country thousands of educators  and the completion of this will significantly reduce the illiteracy rate  which is so detrimental to the overall improvement of the population particularly in the rural areas. Our national plan seeks also  among other priority goals  to increase agricultural and food production and to promote the diversification of industry and of communications and tourism services  as well as to construct the El Cajon hydroelectric complex.203.	These efforts require international technical and financial assistance  and Honduras is expanding its programmes with United Nations institutions  regional and sub-regional agencies  friendly Governments and the international private financial sector so as to coordinate and carry out those projects more effectively.204.	In the social field  we shall implement to the fullest extent the recommendations of the World Conference of the United Nations Decade for Women  held at Copenhagen  and the programmes for children  which are of particular interest to us  as can be attested by our interest in and traditional support for UNICEF.205.	The Government of Honduras is  by deep-rooted conviction  a zealous defender of human rightsâan apparently simple matter  but controversial in practice. Violence  in all its manifestations  leads to violation of the rights of individuals and of peoples  and Honduras  which has never claimed to set itself up as a judge of Governments or of countries which have painful experience of such violence  nevertheless considers that national and regional efforts should be combined to face its fatal consequences.206.	On the one hand  sooner or later every Government will have to answer for its acts before the most implacable and severe of judges: its own people. On the other hand  the international community can effectively assist in the universal implementation of human rights  as prescribed in international instruments adopted by the United Nations.207.	And here we should emphasize that Honduras considers that one of the major violations of the present is the odious policy of apartheid practised by the South African authorities. We once again consider that the greatest political and economic pressure must be exercised to achieve its elimination.208.	Our country  which at the beginning of this month welcomed the entry of Zimbabwe into our Organization  believes it necessary to refer also to the disappointment caused by the delay in holding free elections in Namibia under United Nations supervision. We believe that  not only because of its humanitarian consequences but also because of its political consequences that situation has to be corrected and the valiant people of Namibia must be allowed to accede to independent existence  while maintaining the integrity of its territory and the essential freedom to determine its own destiny.209.	I should like to point out that our Government actively participated in the ninth session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea and that  with certain reservations  we were satisfied with the results. These were the outcome of delicate negotiations and  to be sure  of a great effort of will to compromise among the negotiating parties.210.	In 1981 we shall hold the final session of the Conference and  although some important issues remain to be settled  the draft convention which has been prepared"" brings the participants closer to a consensus. In consequence  within the framework of the rules  this will greatly facilitate a final decision on the set of articles and annexes which constitute it.211.	The Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea is obvious proof of the real possibilities for agreement which exist within the United Nations and constitutes a remarkable effort at international cooperation which will provide the international community with a more just and rational order for the use of the resources of the sea and its subsoil for the benefit of mankind.212.	To conclude  I wish to reiterate the faith and confidence which my country places in this Organization as the means most suitable for the achievement of the highest destiny of man and nations. We consider that it is the unquestionable duty of all its Members to strengthen and improve its systems so that it may fully comply with the noble objectives set forth in its Charter."
"62",3049,"HTI",35,1980,"ï»¿I should like to associate myself with those who have spoken before me on this rostrum in congratulating Mr. von Wechmar  on behalf of the Haitian delegation  upon his election to the presidency of the General Assembly. The success of this session has thus been ensured  by virtue of his great personal qualities  his experience and his dynamic nature. I should not like to let pass this opportunity of expressing to him the satisfaction of my Government at the development of relations between Haiti and the Federal Republic of Germany. I would assure him of the full co-operation of my delegation.183.	I also wish to acquit myself of the pleasant duty of presenting once again my warm congratulations to our brother from the United Republic of Tanzania  Mr. Salim  who presided with such rare skill and remarkable talent at the thirty-fourth session and three special sessions of the General Assembly.184.	My delegation wishes to reiterate its gratitude to the Secretary-General for his untiring efforts to make this Organization an active international force  a home of conciliation  justice and peace.185.	The admission of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to membership of the Organization fills us with joy. My delegation is happy to convey to its people and Government the wishes of the Haitian Government for a future of peace and prosperity.186.	I should like to take this opportunity to welcome again the delegation of Zimbabwe and to wish it much success in its participation in the thirty-fifth session.187.	A period has elapsed between the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly and the current session of which the best that can be said is that it was not particularly good for international relations: a period in which hopes of peace appear to have grown weaker and new hotbeds of tension have arisen in various parts of the world. The situation in Afghanistan  the Middle East  Indo-China  the Horn of Africa  and the war between Iran and Iraq are causes of deep concern for the international community. The continuing arms race  the widening gap between rich and poor countries  the world economic crisis and its effects on socioeconomic systems: all stress the broad outlines of the work that lies ahead for the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. More than any other session  it will have to give the international community new reasons for hope. It should on an urgent basis arrive at a solution of the problems of international peace and security and co-operation among nations. The world expects the Assembly and the United Nations to avert the threat of a third world war and  to that end  to reduce injustice and inequality on this earth  to reduce the numbers of the tortured and the slain and of those suffering from hunger  poverty and ignorance.188.	The objectives of the Assembly at the present session will be achieved only to the extent that delegations realize the urgent need to halt the arms race  to denounce as inadmissible the policy of the use of force against the territorial integrity and political independence of States  to eliminate centres of poverty in the world by establishing a new international economic order and thus consolidating peace and co-operation among nations.189.	If at the thirty-fifth session those objectives should fail to be achieved  the world will remain confronted with today's problems as well as with the problems of tomorrow  which may be even more serious. In Kampuchea there will still be an army of occupation and a people which suffers and which aspires to independence. On the outskirts of Middle Eastern cities there will still be a Palestinian Diaspora in quest of a homeland and an Israel on the alert and on a footing of war. The war between Iran and Iraq will become a threat to peace; the racist leaders in southern Africa will continue to practise with impunity and with the help of their allies their policy of apartheid and racial discrimination and the poor countries will become even poorer because they will be affected to a greater degree by the pressures of galloping world-wide inflation  while remaining deprived of the means of escaping from underdevelopment.190.	During the eleventh special session of the General Assembly  on development and international co-operation  I had the honour of putting forward the views of the Government of Haiti"" on the prospects for success of the North-South dialogue  in keeping with the urgent and immediate needs of the developing countries. At the same time the Head of State of Haiti  Mr. Jean-Claude Duvalier  made a statement for the periodical Leaders  which he published under the title ""A challenge to the world leaders"". The President listed the following development objectives of the third world nations: to create more employment; to become self-sufficient in the production of food; to intensify educational programmes; to improve housing  health and social services; and  for the attainment of those objectives  to give priority to agriculture  industry  tourism  infrastructure and housing.191.	That approach to the problem  to the extent that it presupposes efforts for development on the part of the countries concerned  would be bolstered by the implementation of a production programme. That approach would make it possible to remove the obstacles to the search for a solution likely to bring to bear on the core of the problem the rational use of international aid. That approach would lend itself to the compromise that it is desirable to envisage during the debates which the Assembly is called upon to resume at the thirty-fifth session on the refinement of the text of the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade.192.	My delegation is confident that  despite the difficult circumstances prevalent in the world  the reopening of the North-South dialogue is still a sound prospect for a third world ravaged by disease  hunger and ignorance.193.	In that regard  the President of the World Bank  Mr. Robert McNamara  did not conceal his concern in a speech made last week at the thirty-fifth annual meeting of the Bank and IMF. He stated that 600 million human beings were called on to live in the most absolute poverty until the year 2000. He then made a dramatic appeal to the large share-holders of the Bank  particularly the United States  Japan and the United Kingdom  to increase their assistance. Given those bleak prospects  it would be desirable to prevent the possible consequences for the North and for the South of any delay in moving towards action.194.	Of course there is the World Bank  but its operational criteria are ill-adapted to the present situation in the developing countries. There are the multilateral economic institutions  but they do not sufficiently meet the special needs of our countries. There are the developed countries  but they in their relations with the South maintain obsolete practices that slow down trade  the financing of projects and the positive applications of science and technology in the service of development.195.	Apart from that  it is urgent to find a solution to the problems of energy  balance of payments and foreign debt. It is urgent to establish a new international division of labour to facilitate access by the third world to financial markets and to take a step towards reforming the monetary system.196.	And  since all the problems confronting the world are related  it is difficult not to link the success of the dialogue with a reduction of the arms race. No rich country can devote 1 per cent of its gross national product to international assistance if military expenditures exceed $500 billion.197.	In the context of those concerns my delegation urges that agreements be concluded that would lead the rich countries not only to freeze and to reduce their military expenditures but also to disarm. The Haitian Government considers it extremely urgent that the General Assembly intensify its negotiations on disarmament  in particular nuclear disarmament. The countries of Latin America have already expressed their interest in the creation of a zone in the subcontinent that would be effectively denuclearized. My Government makes an appeal in the strongest terms to the great Powers that  within the time limits provided for the Second Disarmament Decade  they conclude the current negotiations in a manner satisfactory to all those peoples which hope to see peace and co-operation among nations established on lasting foundations.198.	The United Nations is the only universal forum charged with ensuring international peace and security and where States  large and small  can unite their efforts with a view to collective action.199.	Haiti  as a founding Member of the Organization  has always followed the line of conduct of encouraging the establishment of an international order based on peace and co-operation among nations. It is  incidentally  in that spirit that at all times it expresses its desire to live at peace with all the countries of the world  in particular those in its region  while respecting international commitments and the principles of self-determination  non-interference and sovereignty.200.	With the Dominican Republic  a sister and neighbouring country  our relations have been established under the sign of these principles. The already historic meetings between President Duvalier and President Guzman have led to the conclusion of agreements on co-operation and development  which show the common interests and aspirations of the two peoples and their desire to exist in peace and mutual respect.201.	My delegation has listened with great pleasure and satisfaction to the lengthy friendly passage that Mr. Emilio Ludovino Fernandez  Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Dominican Republic  devoted to Haiti in his brilliant address. In truth  we could not express better than he what our relations were in the past and what they are today  nor better forecast what they will be tomorrow. We are both certain that between two peoples which wish to live in peace there is room only for co-operation  mutual assistance and understanding.202.	Haiti contributes to the extent of its means to the strengthening of Latin American participation in international gatherings. Our country brings its solidarity and co-operation to problems affecting our region and considers that its action will only be positive in the global perspective within which those problems may be solved.203.	We have affirmed our will to establish stable relations with all countries in the world. However  some are con-fronted with situations which threaten world peace and security. My delegation wishes  in this connection  to put forward the views of the Haitian Government.204.	Concerning the Middle East  the Haitian position was clearly stated last July at the seventh emergency special session on the question of Palestine. A just and durable peace can be found only if the following objectives are achieved: recognition of the right of Israel to exist within secure boundaries accepted by its neighbours; recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination; acceptance by all the parties to the conflict to renounce the use of force  in particular in Lebanon. The Camp David accords and the peace treaty between Israel and Egypt are important steps towards the peaceful settlement of the conflict.205.	The situation in Kampuchea and that in Afghanistan are still a source of concern for the world community. Despite General Assembly resolutions 34/22 and ES-6/2 calling for the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops from those countries  those peoples are still suffering from the rigours of war.206.	Those military interventions endanger the essential principles of balance and peace in the world. They affect the territorial integrity  sovereignty and independence of the nations concerned. For the Haitian Government  they are unacceptable. If there is a situation that prevails in Kampuchea and Afghanistan  only the peoples of those countries are called upon to solve itâand that without foreign interference.207.	In southern Africa  the independence of Zimbabwe has highlighted the little progress recorded by the international community as regards Namibia and the policy of apartheid in South Africa. The Haitian Government  which bases its foreign policy on respect for historic traditions  the struggle for the total elimination of all forms of colonialism and racial discrimination and the principles of self- determination  freedom and independence  considers it intolerable that South Africa continues to practise apartheid and its acts of aggression against the neighbouring countries and Namibia.208.	With respect to Namibia  the Haitian Government deplores the delayâattributable to South Africaâin the organization of free elections enabling Namibia's people fully to enjoy its right to self-determination. The problem that remains to be solved is that of South Africa. The international community should increase its pressure against the Government of that country  whose policy obstinately runs counter to history  and in order to make that pressure effective  certain countries must disengage themselves. The support they give that Government in contravention of United Nations resolutions encourages South Africa to perpetuate with impunity a policy that the whole world has condemned.209.	As regards the taking of hostages in Iran  we express the hope that a solution will be found. In this connection  we already support the initiative taken by the Nordic countries to include on the agenda of the thirty-fifth session the question of the protection of diplomatic and consular missions and representatives.210.	The ninth session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea concluded its work on 29 August last. We noted with much satisfaction that it concluded with general agreement on the adoption of a convention on the peaceful uses of the resources of the seas and oceans. The Haitian Government is gratified at the happy results of that Conference.211.	The World Conference on the United Nations Decade for Women unfortunately did not meet our hopes. The Haitian Government considers it  however  of great importance that the General Assembly at its present session should adopt the results of the Copenhagen Conference on the legitimate rights of women. There is much profit to be drawn from that Conference as regards the status of women and the work of UNITAR.212.	At the eleventh special session of the General Assembly  on development and international co-operation  we stressed the situation of Caribbean migrant workers coming from countries along the cyclone route. In a broad approach to the problem we should understand ""migrant workers"" as cheap labour imported from the poor countries of the third world to meet the needs of the Christian West. These workers for decades have been making a remarkable contribution to the industrial development of the rich countries. Living as minorities  they are subject to police and security laws where they work  but they have no recourse to justice to defend the rights which barely exist. They have difficulty in securing decent living standards for their families  or educational  health and recreational benefits. In addition  the employer has no obligations. Moreover  since the recession has reduced employment  they are confronted with a deplorable situation where  together with bad treatment and harassment by the police  they are the victims of racism and racial discrimination. These are flagrant violations of the principles contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.213.	That is why my delegation is gratified to see that the problems of these workers have been included on the agenda of the Third Committee of this Assembly under item 12. In addition to the international convention on the protection of all migrant workers and their families which is to be drafted during this session  the relevant drafting committee is certain to suggest the establishment of a high commissioner's office for migrant workers.214.	Here we have another problem to be included under the heading of protection of human rights. The Haitian Government reiterates its irreversible attachment to this principle in keeping with the ideals of equality  fraternity  justice and freedom  which form the ideological bases of the struggles of Haiti for independence. It is in the legitimate desire to make respect for human rights a militant national enterprise that my Government has felt it necessary to create the Haitian Bureau of Human Rights. It is charged with ensuring liaison between the public services concerned and various national and international specialized institutions which champion human rights. All of this eloquently demonstrates the determination of President Jean-Claude Duvalier to spare no effort in advancing the process of the liberalization and democratization of my country.215.	Lastly  my delegation deplores the regrettable events taking place at present between Iran and Iraq. It hopes to see those countries respond as quickly as possible to the appeal for a cease-fire launched by the Security Council and the Islamic Conference. It enjoins the Powers concerned to do everything they can to keep the conflict circumscribed to the geographical limits within which it has broken out. This is the only way of avoiding its generalization and of reaching a settlement.216.	We cannot remain silent on the question of Belize  a happy solution of which could only be beneficial for Latin America. In this connection  the Haitian delegation  in voting on 21 November 1979  in favour of General Assembly resolution 34/38  only reaffirmed one of the principles which have always characterized the foreign policy of the Haitian Government.217.	Today still  it is determined to give its unconditional support to the inalienable rights of the people of Belize to self-determination  independence and territorial integrity. It hopes to see the Governments of the United Kingdom and of Guatemala respond to the wishes expressed in that resolution by reporting to the General Assembly on the measures that have been taken to enable the people of Belize to exercise its rights as a free people.218.	We must recall other questions of which the United Nations has been seized of late. I am referring to Cyprus and Western Sahara  two points in the world where ravages of war continue  sowing disarray and grief among families. The United Nations would have put an end to these crises if the parties concerned had complied with General Assembly resolutions 34/30 and 34/37. We appeal for a settlement of such situations in order that the people of Cyprus may again find peace and that those of the Western Sahara may be in a position to exercise their right to self-determination  by the rigorous implementation of resolution 34/37.219.	At its thirty-fourth session the General Assembly adopted three resolutionsâ34/61 on African refugees  34/161 on women refugees and 34/174 on student refugees from Namibia  Zimbabwe and South Africaâwhich stress the acuity of the problem and the imperative need to do everything to improve the condition of the millions of men  women and children who desperately hang on to life and hope for a less tragic future.220.	My delegation is gratified by the programme of assistance to refugees implemented by the United Nations. We hope that those resolutions will be followed by concrete action on the part of States  governmental organizations and non-governmental organizations called upon to contribute to them.221.	We have stated before this Assembly the position of Haiti on certain questions included in the agenda of the current session. It is not surprising that we should attach special importance to problems of development; they are and will remain for a long time responsible for all the imbalances which disrupt the world. The recommendations which we shall be called upon to make on that issue encompass new living conditions for man  his anxieties  his hopes and the great changes that all of this implies.222.	The quest for the happiness of all  the quest for justice  the right to live in freedom  to think  to speak  not to be afraid  are the commandments of man's new destiny. It is up to each and every one of us to follow them  so that peace and justice will triumph on earth  so that there will no longer be people suffering and dying in Kampuchea  Afghanistan  the Middle East  southern Africa or elsewhere.223.	We express to the members of the General Assembly the hope that at this session it may give to mankind  if not immediate results  at least new reasons for hope."
"63",3095,"HUN",35,1980,"ï»¿President  I should like first of all to congratulate you on your election to the presidency of this thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. I trust that  under your guidance  our work at this session will be successful.38.	At this as at every session we have to analyse the main tendencies and phenomena of the international situation  to explore the underlying causes of both the favourable and unfavourable processes and to work together to adopt resolutions which will promote stronger peace and security and facilitate social progress  in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. As most of the speakers before me have pointed out  the present situation dictates a special need for sober deliberations and for the encouragement of constructive endeavours.39.	The people of my country welcomed with satisfaction the impressive achievements of the 1970s in the consolidation of international peace and security  the settlement of certain complex international problems and the cooperation among countries with different social systems.40.	Today we maintain our firm belief that preserving peace and warding off the danger of a new world war are vital for mankind in our age. My Government still regards this as its primary task and is doing its utmost to contribute to preserving and increasing the results of detente.41.	In the current situation it is of particular importance to maintain and strengthen the ties which have been established in recent years among countries with different social systems  on the basis of peaceful coexistence. So far as possible  bilateral relations should be developed still further and any effort to block that road should be opposed. Paramount importance attaches to ensuring that dialogue between leaders of countries will not cease even for a moment in this period of tension  which we trust will be but transitory. We are convinced that there is no single international issue in dispute which  given the necessary good will  could not be settled by political means.42.	The present situation is characterized by elements of detente and tension  which exist concurrently in world politics. Recent years have witnessed sober endeavours followed by various steps which have worsened the international climate. In our view  the principal causes lie in the fact that the leading countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] launched a new wave of the arms race at their summit conference in Washington as far back as 1978  and made no secret of their intention to obtain military superiority over the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty. To that end they increased the military expenditures of the NATO countries  the long-term programmes for building up arms  the deployment in Western Europe of new American nuclear missiles of medium range but strategic in nature  the postponement of the ratification by the American Senate of the SALT II agreement and the creation of rapid deployment forces for purposes of interventionâto mention only the most striking instances of that effort. If one adds the undeclared wars  the acts of political and ideological subversion carried on by imperialist circles to weaken progressive regimes in numerous countries of the world  then there looms ahead a by no means negligible danger to peace and security.43.	The anti-peace manoeuvres of the extremist circles of imperialism are supported and even encouraged by the leaders of China. This is today another important element in the increase in international tension.44.	There are some who believe that what the extremist circles of imperialism are aiming to do by increasing the arms build-up and taking political steps reminiscent of the cold war is no more than to influence certain events in domestic policy or to achieve similar ends. However  nothing could be further from the truth. If that were so  then before long the world would be able to breathe a sigh of relief. We believe that the new phase of the arms drive has deeper roots  namely the aims of extremist circles to exert political pressure on the peoples of other countries  to contain progress and to regain their lost position by applying the well-known formula of the policy of strength. Although we know that that is a futile attempt  it should nevertheless be condemned for jeopardizing peace and security.45.	Mankind today has  however  an ardent wish for and a vital interest in quite the opposite  namely  to uphold peace  strengthen security and expand co-operation. The Government of the Hungarian People's Republic  like the other countries in the socialist community  is ready to work together with the peoples of progressive and other peace- loving countries and with all Governments of the world that are committed to act together with a sense of responsibility for the destiny of their peoples  in order to achieve those grand aims.46.	My Government agrees with the appraisal of disarmament tasks as contained in the memorandum which the Soviet Union has submitted to the Assembly and it lends full support to the adoption and realization of the Soviet proposals  which envisage urgent measures for reducing the danger of war.47.	The Government of the Hungarian People's Republic believes that the continuation and speeding up of the dis-armament talks  the adoption of effective measures to curb the arms race and the attainment of equal security at ever lower levels of armaments are absolutely necessary.48.	I wish to reaffirm my Government's readiness  which is shared by the other States parties to the Warsaw Treaty  to negotiate and to assume treaty obligations on the limitation  reduction and complete destruction of any type of weapons on the basis of equal security and reciprocity. It is on that basis that the socialist countries have put forward initiatives in different fields of disarmament.49.	It is a matter of concern to us that the Committee on Disarmament  at Geneva  has once again failed to make any notable headway in the current year. The Committee has spent too much time dealing with organizational and procedural questions. At the opposite pole from the socialist countries with their initiatives for the solution of disarmament problems  certain Western Powers are seeking to avoid undertaking any commitments. There is little hope for progress if some members of the Committee on Disarmament fail to summon up the political will necessary in the quest for solutions to the issues under discussion.50.	My Government has repeatedly stated that it attaches great importance to the conclusion and implementation of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We cannot but deplore the failure of the second Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty to produce the results hoped for. We believe it necessary for all Members of the United Nations  even without formal adoption of a final document  to promote the observance of the provisions of that Treaty  the strengthening of its universality and the prevention of the spread of nuclear weapons.51.	We can brook no further delay in finding solutions to tasks of common concern  such as the prohibition of the manufacture of chemical weapons and the development of new types of weapons of mass destruction  as well as the prevention of the spread of radiological weapons.52.	It is our conviction that the entry into force of the SALT II agreement would be of key importance to the success of the ongoing bilateral and multilateral disarmament talks at Geneva and in other forums. This is the pre-condition also for starting a third round of talks  SALT III  on considerable reductions in strategic arms. Furthermore  efforts to press for the implementation of the NATO decision on the deployment in Europe of new nuclear missiles of medium range but of a strategic nature should also be abandoned.53.	The stationing of new American medium-range missiles in some countries of Western Europe would pose a direct threat to the security of the Hungarian People's Republic. My Government fully supports the relevant Soviet proposal submitted in this regard which provides a good basis for the settlement of this issue. We hope that the forthcoming Soviet-American talks will be useful and successful.54.	Progress must also be made in the Vienna Talks on Mutual Reduction of Forces  Armaments and Associated Measures in Central Europe. NATO tactics have doomed those talks to a stalemate. While the socialist countries present new and positive proposals  the NATO countries evade a constructive response to any of those proposals. However  we do not give up hope. The conclusion of a mutually acceptable agreement is a task of increasing urgency.55.	The Political Consultative Committee of the States Parties to the Warsaw Treaty in its declaration of 15 May complemented the earlier proposals made by socialist countries  each and every one of which serves the cause of reducing international tension and promoting peace and security. We deplore the fact that those to whom they are addressed show much less interest in them than they merit in view of the importance of the cause they promote.56.	The Hungarian People's Republic continues to pay particular attention to the cause of security and cooperation in Europe. It is consistently striving to develop its relations with all countries of the region on the basis of the Helsinki Final Act and is guided by the spirit thereof in preparing for the Madrid meeting of representatives of the signatory States. In the course of preparatory work for that meeting  Hungarian diplomacy has  through bilateral channels  made several new proposals designed to strengthen confidence and co-operation among the peoples of Europe. We believe that the Madrid meeting should focus attention on questions of common interest. It is inadmissible that certain Western circles should again try to use that forum for a propaganda campaign against the socialist countries and to aggravate the situation  even though some evidence of this is already available. The interests of the peoples of the countries signatories to the Final Act of Helsinki would not be served if scope was left in Madrid for unbridled mud- slinging and accusations in connection with matters that are not within the competence of that Conference. What is needed is a constructive spirit and forward-oriented proposals.57.	The people and Government of the Hungarian People's Republic  acting in keeping with their national interests  are doing their utmost to ensure the implementation of the proposals made by the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty for the continuation of the process of security and co-operation in Europe. We believe that the chances of a successful outcome of the Madrid meeting would be greatly enhanced if at the meeting it was decided to convene a conference on military detente and disarmament in Europe and its date determined as well as its procedure and the agenda for the first phase. Such a decision would have a favourable impact on the atmosphere in all disarmament forums.58.	The position of my Government concerning the conflicts and hotbeds of crisis that poison the international climate is unchanged. In urging action to remove the causes of the crisis situations  we reaffirm our solidarity with and support of the peoples in their struggle for progress  national independence and self-determination  as well as against colonial and neo-colonialist oppression and neo-colonialist designs. It is in this spirit that we have taken our stand on the situation in southern Africa  on the policy of apartheid  on the questions of Western Sahara and Cyprus and on the revolutionary processes in Latin America. While I do not intend to repeat our position on all questions  I nevertheless deem it necessary to state our views on a few issues that have a particular bearing on the world political scene.59.	I think it is now sufficiently clear to all that the Camp David accordsâthe separate deal between Egypt and Israelâhave solved nothing and have proved a blind alley. The complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from the occupied Arab territories is  in our opinion  indispensable for a comprehensive and just settlement of the Middle East crisis. The Palestinian people must be allowed to exercise their legitimate rights  including the right to establish a State of their own  and the security of all countries in the region should be guaranteed. We condemn Israel's decision on the annexation of Jerusalem. We support the resolutions of the seventh emergency special session of the Assembly  on the question of Palestine  and urge full implementation of their provisions.60.	The victory of the popular forces in Afghanistan in 1978 and later the turn of events in Iran have changed the situation in the Middle East. The extremist circles of imperialism will stop at nothing to regain their lost positions  resorting to means ranging from overt intervention in the domestic affairs of other countries  through economic boycotts and sanctions  to the supply of arms to counterrevolutionaries scheming abroad against the legitimate Government.61.	The Government of the Hungarian People's Republic is of the view that the key to the solution of the situation in that country is the halting of intervention by outside reactionary forces. Acceptance of the proposals made by the Afghan Government for a settlement on 14 May of this year would remove the tension whipped up around Afghanistan and would allow that Government to carry out its progressive policy measures that broadly respect the country's historical and religious traditions. My Government finds it unacceptable that on the pretext of Soviet military assistance to Afghanistan the extremist circles of imperialism should be mounting an over-all attack against international detente and co-operation. The slanders cast at the Soviet Union are simply a screen for efforts to carry out longstanding and well-known schemes.62.	The greatest problem in South-East Asia results from the expansionist and great-Power policy of the Chinese Government. China's aggression against Viet Nam and its threats to ""teach it another lesson""  as well as its subversive acts against the neighbouring progressive regimes and its open intervention have given rise to tension in that region.63.	The plight of the Kampuchean people is gradually improving  despite intrigues from outside  and the results of the effort to build a new society are already in evidence. The people of Kampuchea  upon whom a terrible tragedy was visited  is rallying more and more firmly behind the People's Revolutionary Council. This has met with favourable response from the progressive forces. Recognition and acceptance of the realities  international recognition of the sole legitimate representative of the Kampuchean people and its participation in the work of the United Nations would contribute greatly to the alleviation of the tense situation. The prestige of our world Organization is impaired while the seat of people's Kampuchea is still occupied by the genocidal Pol Pot clique  which represents nobody.64.	It was with a view to restoring tranquillity in Southeast Asia that 13 Member States  including Hungary  proposed that the item entitled ""Question of peace  stability and co-operation in South-East Asia"" be placed on the agenda of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly.65.	The latest events in South Korea have again focused attention on the long-outstanding question of Korea. My Government still holds that all foreign troops should be withdrawn from the Korean peninsula and that the peaceful reunification of the two parts of that country should be encouraged. We support the relevant proposals made by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.66.	Twenty years ago  the historic Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples was adopted by the General Assembly. Since then a number of countries have become free from colonial oppression as a result of the persevering struggle of socialist countries  national liberation movements and other progressive forces  and they have taken their place in the community of nations. Among them now are Zimbabwe and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  the newly admitted Member States of our world Organization. On behalf of my Government I wish to welcome our new Member States and I take this opportunity to express satisfaction at this fresh result in the liquidation of the colonial system  and this new achievement of the struggle for national liberation. We wish those countries every success.67.	In our opinion  the anniversary of the Declaration imposes an obligation on Member States to take joint and still more efficient measures with a view to the final liquidation of the remnants of colonialism and the guaranteeing to all peoples of their right to self-determination.68.	While indisputable results have been achieved  there is more to be done. Now that the independence of Zimbabwe has been proclaimed  the situation of Namibia becomes even more striking and untenable. We condemn the machinations of South Africa to delay Namibia's accession to independence and to set up a puppet regime subservient to neo-colonialist interests. My Government demands the granting of independence to Namibia in accordance with the resolutions of the United Nations and OAU. It recognizes the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO] as the sole legitimate representative of the Namibian people and lends its support in its struggle to attain independence.69.	The Hungarian People's Republic has a paramount interest in ensuring that international economic cooperation develops smoothly  facilitates the full use of advantages offered by the international division of labour for the improvement of the welfare of peoples  and enhances the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems.70.	We deplore the fact that owing to the negative attitude of a few countries the eleventh special session of the General Assembly devoted to questions of the world economy failed to produce results. The restructuring of international economic relations on a democratic and just basis and the removal of obstacles to the development of economic cooperation remain an urgent task that must be discharged  as required by the interests of mankind as a whole and by the extremely grave economic situation in some of the developing countries 71.	During the present session my country is commemorating the twenty-fifth anniversary of its admission to membership in the United Nations. In the course of the past quarter of a century it has been the constant endeavour of the Hungarian People's Republic to conduct its activities according to the letter and spirit of the Charter and to help the world Organization fulfil as fully as possible its main function of maintaining and strengthening peace and security.72.	We maintain that on the whole the United Nations has so far lived up to its mission  but we are convinced that its role in the solution of international issues can be still further increased. We highly appreciate the activity of the Secretary- General in enhancing the effectiveness of the Organization.73.	My Government is of the view that the Charter of the United Nations has laid down norms of conduct for States  a set of rules for coexistence among nations and a procedure against its violators that are still valid today. We are convinced that this carefully balanced Constitution of the community of nations is not in need of amendment. The role of the United Nations can be enlarged  as is desired by the majority of Member States  through fuller use of the possibilities inherent in the Charter and through strict observance of its provisions. At the same time  however  the successful solution of the complex international issues confronting us presupposes stronger co-operation among Member States  mutual respect for the interests of others  understanding of one another's problems and an active search for solutions and arrangements.74.	I have endeavoured to state concisely my Government's position on the current international situation  outlining the pressing tasks facing us and presenting our ideas concerning ways in which these problems might be resolved. The Hungarian delegation will work in that spirit throughout the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly."
"64",3142,"IDN",35,1980,"ï»¿Mr. President  it is a privilege for me to congratulate you on your unanimous election as President of the current session of the General Assembly. Your election is a tribute to your personal qualities as well as to the contributions made to the cause of the United Nations by your country  with which Indonesia enjoys friendly and cordial relations. I pledge my delegation's full cooperation in making this Assembly a success.114.	To your distinguished predecessor  Ambassador Salim Ahmed Salim  I should like to convey our deep appreciation for the effective and efficient manner in which he conducted our deliberations  not only during the regular session but also in the three special sessions of the General Assembly  which were held this year.115.	I also wish to express my Government's gratitude to the Secretary-general for his continued service to our Organization and for his untiring and relentless efforts in promoting the realization of its purposes and objectives.116.	It is a pleasant duty for me to welcome the addition of new Member States and I am particularly privileged in welcoming Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to membership in our Organization. Indonesia would also like  once again  to congratulate the people of Zimbabwe on the attainment of their independence and warmly welcome them. The addition of those new Members will certainly strengthen the Organization and will contribute to intensified efforts in the promotion of international peace and justice.117.	In reviewing the world situation  we are profoundly dismayed by the deteriorating trend of events. While we began the decade of the 1970s in an aura of hope for world peace and stability  as indicated by the relaxation of tension in the context of detente between the great Powers  we regretfully closed the decade confronted by a deterioration in the relationship of those Powers and threatened by the possibility of a breakdown in the already fragile structure of international peace and security. The last year of that decade  in particular  was marked by grave turbulence and proved to be most difficult in the international arena  as we were faced by threats to world peace and mired in a stalemate on various political and economic issues.118.	We note with deep concern that open armed intervention and interference in the internal affairs of small States by more powerful countries has been introduced as a new  disturbing phenomenon in the relations between States. What is particularly troublesome is that the area of conflict between the great Powers has now been indisputably extended to the territories of the developing countries in West and Southeast Asia and in Africa. In the meantime  the situation in the Middle East has become more explosive and dangerous  owing to the arrogant challenge of Israel persisting in its defiance of the resolutions of the United Nations  while a situation of tension and conflict continues to prevail in the southern part of Africa as a result of the unremitting intransigence of the apartheid regime in Pretoria.119.	This bleak situation is aggravated by pervasive economic uncertainties and structural imbalances on the world economic scene. International efforts to redress those problems have become bogged down  yielding little but disenchantment for the developing countries.120.	Facing armed conflicts and grave tensions exacerbated by a worsening economic situation  the international community as a whole has a solemn duty and responsibility to seek peaceful solutions of those problems and tensions. That is imperative for the realization of the ideals of the United Nations. Indonesia stands ready to cooperate with likeminded nations to find such solutions  especially in its own region of Southeast Asia.121.	The grave problems which marked the closing of the last decade should be dealt with resolutely and with a renewed sense of responsibility in order that the decade of the 1980s may herald a period of harmony in State relations. The process of detente  so much disturbed of late  should be revitalized in our common effort to create a global system of peace and cooperation embracing all regions of the world.122.	What we need is a new resolve and determination on the part of Members to institute real change and achieve progress. Indeed  in the areas where the international community has exhibited such determination  notable success has been achieved. While we can take pride in past accomplishments  limited though they are  let us with renewed vigour and sustained efforts try to resolve the many issues which challenge the world today. It is with that in mind that I join previous speakers in the hope that this thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly will lead us to the re-emergence of international harmony followed by genuine peace  cooperation and justice for all the nations of the world.123.	While we look towards the future  we should continue to be guided by the experience of the past. The principles established at the Asian African Conference  held at Bandung in 1955   and elaborated and reaffirmed by the Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries held at Belgrade in 1961  have proved themselves an effective basis for relations among States. In this period of international flux  we must adhere to them more closely if we are to survive the turbulence that surrounds us. The adoption by all States of those principles can lay the foundation for a more broadly based and equitable international system of peace free from bloc politics and regional conflicts.124.	The emergence of regional groupings  like ASEAN  expressing common interests and viewpoints on important issues  has been a welcome development on the international scene. To preserve the viability of those groupings  it is essential that States refrain from actions which can undermine regional cohesion and stability. Of no less importance is the imperative need to contain regional conflicts and prevent them from becoming a source of external interference and great Power confrontation. In that connexion  it is important to maintain the principles of respect for the independence of all States and their sovereign right to follow their national policies.125.	My delegation notes with deep concern the continuing conflict in Kampuchea resulting from the armed intervention by Viet Nam in violation of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. At the thirty-fourth session the General Assembly focused attention on this military intervention and its attendant threat to international peace and adopted resolution 34/22 by an overwhelming majority calling for the prompt withdrawal of all foreign forces from Kampuchea.126.	Now  one year after the adoption of that resolution  foreign forces still remain entrenched in Kampuchea. Hunger and starvation persist in the country  while hundreds of thousands of Kampucheans continue to live as refugees in neighbouring Thailand. We are further disturbed by the recent armed incursions into Thailand from inside Kampuchea. This has heightened tensions along the Thai Kampuchean border and increased the danger of a widening of the conflict. There is no doubt that peace and stability in the region can be achieved only through the strict implementation of resolution 34/22. It is therefore essential for the General Assembly to address itself to the various ramifications of this dangerous problem once again and find ways and means to secure the withdrawal of foreign forces from Kampuchea. Together with other sponsors  my delegation has submitted draft resolution on the situation in Kampuchea for adoption by this Assembly.127.	No less alarming is the plight of hundreds of thousands of Kampucheans who are now staying temporarily along the Thai-Kampuchean border and in Thailand itself after having fled their country  and of those who remain in the country and need international assistance for their survival. It is important that a system of voluntary repatriation of refugees be instituted and that the dire predicament of the Kampuchean people in Kampuchea be alleviated. The Meeting on Humanitarian Assistance and Relief to the Kampuchean People  held at Geneva on 26 and 27 May  adopted a set of recommendations which  if implemented  would go a long way in ameliorating the sufferings of the refugees.128.	We cannot be oblivious to the equally desperate situation of the refugees in other regions of the world  such as Africa and West and South Asia. It is our task to continue to seek all possible means of rendering humanitarian aid to these unfortunate people as well as to find a lasting and satisfactory solution to their problems.129.	In the case of my country  tens of thousands of refugees have fled to Indonesia in the last two years and more still are entering the country every month. A great many of them have already been resettled in third countries  but several thousands are still in the processing centres especially built for them  waiting for permanent resettlement.130.	With regard to the situation in Afghanistan  we are concerned about the continuing intervention in the internal affairs of a Member State belonging to the nonaligned movement. Resolution ES6/2  adopted at the sixth emergency special session of the General Assembly and calling for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan  has not been implemented. It rests with this Assembly to take the necessary measures to ensure its full implementation in order to facilitate the re-emergence of Afghanistan as a nonaligned country able to play an independent role in the conduct of world affairs.131.	The Eleventh Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers  held at Islamabad from 17 to 22 May of this year  established the Committee of Three  to seek ways and means for appropriate consultations and explore the possibility of convening an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations or other forums to achieve a comprehensive solution to the grave crisis in Afghanistan. We believe that this initiative merits the support of the international community.132.	We are once again confronted in the Middle East with the intransigence of Israel in connexion with the search for a just and comprehensive solution  in spite of the growing world trend  as witnessed by a change in the position of the European Community in favour of the Palestinian cause. Indeed  not only does Israel continue to ignore the will of the vast majority of the international community but it also undertakes actions aimed at entrenching its colonial control over the occupied Arab territories  as indicated by its decision to annex Jerusalem as its capital. Such actions are a direct affront to this body  which has on many occasions declared Israel's measures to change the legal status and character of Jerusalem to be illegal and invalid. The use of the issue as a pawn in great Power politics has further aggravated the present impasse and complicated the search for a viable solution.133.	As a member of the United Nations Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People and of the Jerusalem Committee of the Islamic Conference  Indonesia has observed the growing anger and frustration in the Arab and Moslem world. It is clear that failure to resolve this conflict soon may well lead to catastrophic consequences which we shall all regret.134.	It is therefore incumbent upon this body to take the necessary steps to ensure a comprehensive solution of the problem by initiating effective measures to put an end to illegal Israeli policies and practices. The withdrawal of Israeli forces from all occupied territories  including Jerusalem  is a prerequisite for the realization of such a solution. Finally  the PLO  as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  should participate in all endeavours leading to the establishment of an independent Palestinian State.135.	My delegation is saddened by the outbreak of hostilities between Iraq and Iran  both nonaligned countries with which my country has close and friendly relations. In a statement issued yesterday  my Government expressed the hope for a cessation of hostilities and a peaceful settlement of their dispute. My delegation supports the appeal made yesterday by the Security Council to the Governments of Iran and Iraq. We hope that both parties will accept the offer of good offices made by the secretary General.136.	In the field of decolonization  it is heartening to note that determined international efforts to bring colonialism to a speedy end have brought new results this year with the independence of Zimbabwe  Vanuatu and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. While the international community is encouraged by this positive development  still no progress has been made towards independence in Namibia  where the racist regime of South Africa maintains its illegal occupation and has stymied the realization of a just settlement. The purpose of Pretoria is abundantly clear  namely  first  to stifle the struggle for immediate independence of the people of Namibia  under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO] and  secondly  to exploit the natural resources which are indispensable to sustain the future independence  integrity and prosperity of this Territory. The Pretoria regime must be made to understand that Security Council resolution 435 (1978) offers the only means for a just and peaceful solution.137.	If all efforts for a peaceful and speedy transition of Namibia to independence fail  my delegation is prepared to support any measures which would more strictly enforce the embargo already imposed by the United Nations as well as comprehensive sanctions against South Africa.138.	The responsibility of the United Nations vis-Ã -vis South Africa is in fact twofold: first  to compel the Pretoria regime to abide by United Nations resolutions on Namibia and  secondly  to bring the apartheid policy to an end. We must tighten the net of isolation so that the pressures upon Pretoria will immobilize its ability to function in the international arena.139.	The deteriorating international situation has been fully reflected by the lack of progress in the field of disarmament. The strategy adopted by the General Assembly at the first special session on disarmament"" has yet to be implemented; instead  it has been followed by a further escalation of the arms race during the Second Disarmament Decade. The Committee on Disarmament has so far been unable to negotiate a comprehensive test ban. That is a crucial issue. Despite the persistent and repeated appeals of the General Assembly  nuclear weapon testing has continued unabated  and this casts doubts on the existence of the political will to bring about its cessation.140.	Indonesia regrets that the second Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons failed to reach agreement on a final declaration containing an assessment of the operation of the Treaty and recommendations for future action. Despite the absence of such a consensus  my delegation hopes that nuclear weapon States will seriously take into account the concerns expressed by nonnuclear weapon States and take concrete steps to ensure that the provisions of the Treaty are fully and effectively implemented.141.	With regard to the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace  my delegation wishes to reaffirm its support for the principles contained therein. In view of the current worsening military and political situation in the region  the planned Conference on the Indian Ocean has become urgent. We therefore believe in the wisdom of convening the Conference next year with a view to giving effect to the Declaration.142.	International cooperation in the wider transfer of space science and technology  as well as its application  has become imperative for the development of the developing countries. Indonesia already enjoys such cooperation  especially in the fields of remote sensing and communications  and we favour further and intensified efforts in this sphere. In this regard  Indonesia hopes that the Second United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space  to be held in Vienna in 1982  will serve as a major forum for an exchange of information and for the enhancement of cooperation for the benefit of mankind and  in particular  of the developing countries.143.	The Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea has successfully resolved most of the hard-core issues during its ninth session and has largely completed the stage of informal negotiations. This is indeed one of the most significant achievements of the Conference  which for many years had to discharge an almost impossible task of reconciling and harmonizing various conflicting positions. The breakthrough achieved has paved the way for the successful conclusion of a comprehensive convention on the law of the sea  which will be the most important milestone in international relations since the signing of the Charter of the United Nations.144.	Besides attaching great importance to the legal regime of archipelagic States and of straits used for international navigation  Indonesia also considers many other issues in the Conference highly important  particularly those concerning production policies  which might affect existing or potential operations on land.145.	Indonesia supports the position of the Group of 77 against the unilateral legislation governing the exploration and exploitation of the sea bed beyond the limits of national jurisdiction. Such action is contrary to international law and constitutes a breach of the principle of good faith in the conduct of negotiations and thereby undermines the legitimate interests of the international community as a whole.146.	In the international economic arena the issues and the negotiations on them remain contentious. Therein lies an added danger  for in the last two decades the ascendancy  it not the primacy  of economic issues in international relations has demonstrated the pervasive linkage between peace and security and economic equity and justice. Persistent international economic imbalances and asymmetries critically inhibit the pursuit of international peace and prosperity. It is also becoming conventional wisdom that the world is increasingly interdependent and that the search for a solution to the problem of the deteriorating global economic situation is not just an act of benevolence but a condition of mutual survival.147.	In 1980  a year of mounting international tension  increasing armaments and ominous warnings to peace and security  the international community has sustained yet another disappointment with the poor results of the eleventh special session  devoted to the development and international economic cooperation. In this difficult and uncertain yearâboth politically and economicallyâit is imperative that the international community seize the moment constructively if the deteriorating situation is to be arrested.148.	The two major tasks confronting the international community during the eleventh special sessionânamely  the adoption of the International Development Strategy for the 1980s and the inauguration of the round of global negotiationsâhave ended  one in qualified progress and the other in unfortunate impasse. After six months of deliberations in the preparatory process of the Committee of the Whole Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174 and a further three weeks of intensive and even agonizing negotiations at the special session itself  the work on the global round  and in particular that concerning the procedural framework  almost resulted in a viable compromise. We therefore deeply regret that the unwillingness of a very few prevented the success of the negotiations  and that thus the high expectations invested in the special session by the developing countries have been reduced to disappointment. The convening of that session  which it had been hoped would generate the necessary spirit and impetus  failed to lead to the required breakthrough.149.	Short-sighted interests and narrow political expediency have once again been instrumental in subverting the unique opportunity presented by the special session to tackle constructively and comprehensively the substantive North South issues. Such negative attitudes call the efficacy of the whole North South dialogue seriously into question. This dangerous development runs the risk of setting mankind on a collision course  wrecking any advances it may have accomplished. The international community should  therefore  be on its guard and resist any worsening of the situation. The developed countries in particular  owing to their special responsibility by virtue of their favoured position in the international economic system  should make every effort to reassess their attitudes with a view to making them more positive in meeting the imperatives of the changing international economic realities. It is not the negotiating process but the commitment to negotiate that is wanting.150.	We cannot afford to despair but must continue the search for means of resuming these endeavours. The alternatives are simply unthinkable.151.	The consensus achieved on the text of the new International Development Strategy is an object lesson in what can be usefully achieved with the exercise of mutual determination. It is encouraging to note that the Strategy  though not fully satisfactory  constitutes a progressive departure from its two predecessors. The International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade has proved a demonstrable failure. Few  if any  of its objectives have been fulfilled. Its fundamental weakness resided in the fact that it was predicated upon the trickle down concept of development  which failed to address itself to fundamental structural changes in the international economic system and thus perpetuated the pattern of dependency in international economic relations. Instead of achieving the desirable outcome of self-sustaining growth in the developing countries  it contributed to widening the gap between them and the developed ones. It is indeed ironic that  as we enter the 1980s and after two decades of development cooperation  two thirds of mankind still live in backwardness and abject poverty while one third continue to live in relative opulence.152.	In direct contrast  the new Strategy has been formulated within the parameters of achieving the objectives of the new international economic order. We are convinced  given this thrust and framework  that the Strategy for the 1980s has great potential for stimulating and accelerating the development of the developing countries  thus helping to alleviate the pervasive poverty and suffering of mankind.153.	However  I must hasten to add that without a strong and persistent commitment and determination to implement this Strategy  it too will become just another empty shell  a compendium of lettres mortes  and thus an enduring indictment to our collective resolve.154.	The difficulties and problems besetting mankind are indeed overwhelming but dually  man's ingenuity and capacity to meet his challenge almost limitless. Resources and technologies which furnish the essential means abound. The only vacuum remaining is that of unanimous political will. This is our immediate challenge. We must  all of us  without exception  muster this essential quality in order to resolve our differences and address the fundamental questions of the human predicament. We cannot forfeit this trust of mankind.155.	At the same time  we must remain fully aware of the special role the United Nations can play in meeting these challenges. While the Organization no doubt needs strengthening  the major role it has played and continues to play in solving the myriad problems we encounter must be recognized. Therefore  our efforts to build a world of peace and justice must centre on the United Nations. As we begin our deliberations in this first General Assembly session of the 1980s  let us reaffirm our commitment to the noble effort of mankind epitomized in the United Nations and enter this decade with a firm determination to continue the further advancement of the principles of our Organization."
"65",3189,"IND",35,1980,"ï»¿I extend to Mr. von Wechmar the warm felicitations of my delegation on his unanimous election to the presidency of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. His nomination to that high office is a tribute to his personal qualities as an experienced and skilful diplomat. It is also fitting testimony to the dedication of his great country to the ideals of the United Nations  and his opening address amply demonstrated his personal devotion to the fundamental principles and purposes of the Charter. I wish him every success in his challenging assignment and pledge my delegation's full support in his endeavours.138.	It is a matter of particular satisfaction for me to place on record the sincere appreciation of my delegation for the outstanding work performed by his predecessor  Mr. Salim of the United Republic of Tanzania. His presidency of the General Assembly at its thirty-fourth session  as well as of the three special sessions during the past 12 months  was indeed an eventful one. The patience  skill  sincerity and unfailing courtesy displayed by him will long be remembered in the annals of the General Assembly.139.	It is a pleasure for me to greet once again our distinguished Secretary-General. We admire the way in which he has been discharging the onerous and delicate responsibilities which the complexities of the international situation impose upon him. His travels and efforts straddling the globe  covering points of crisis and explosive situations  have helped defuse tension in our troubled world.140.	I already had the opportunity at the eleventh special session to extend my congratulations to the freedom-loving people of Zimbabwe on the achievement of their hard-won independence and their membership in the United Nations. I should like once again to welcome Zimbabwe to our midst and to wish it all success in its exciting and difficult task of nation-building.141.	It also gives me great pleasure to extend our warm and sincere felicitations to Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  which has now become the one hundred and fifty- fourth Member of the Organization. We rejoice with them in their hour of triumph and joy and trust that their aspirations to a better and brighter future will be amply fulfilled in the years to come. India looks forward to establishing mutually beneficial relations with the new nation.142.	The Indian delegation participates in this General Assembly in the context of a transformed domestic political perspective. India has had another general election since the General Assembly met last year. The people of India appraised the challenges that they had faced  reassessed the nature and quality of leadership required to meet them and massively reaffirmed their conviction in the leadership of Prime Minister Mrs. Indira Gandhi.143.	The new Government in India is engaged in the difficult and enormous task of national reconstruction and regeneration of a pluralistic multilingual  multi-religious and diverse society  and this by democratic means. Intractable though our problems may seem  our national efforts to resolve them since our independence have borne results to a great extent. This has imbued our people with a sense of confidence and inspired them to the objective that India shall emerge as a strong  self-reliant and modern nation.144.	It is also an abiding conviction of my Government and my people that India's future stability and development depends on the success of the international community in creating a world order characterized by durable peace. There is a national consensus  therefore  on the content and objectives of India's foreign policy. There is unanimity of opinion in India about the relevance of the principles of non-alignment and the imperative need for friendship towards all nations based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence.145.	Developments during the past year have not been such as to bring credit to the international community as a whole. The collective behaviour of nation-States in recent months has only deepened the sense of insecurity and distrust in the world. New and ever more ominous strategic doctrines are being propounded  bringing the world closer to the cataclysmic outbreak of an all-out nuclear conflagration. The scientific genius of mankind is being exploited for the perverted purpose of manufacturing means of destruction  perhaps in the search for the ""ultimate weapon"" which  it is believed  I think quite erroneously  would enable one or the other group of States to impose its will on the others. Increasing recourse is being made to might in a manner which has threatened the national independence and integrity of small and medium States. The principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of States has been observed more in breach in a variety of ways  covert and overt. All means are considered legitimate in the pursuit of the objective of expanding spheres of influence. International economic relations continue to be marked by inequity  selfishness and short-sightedness  particularly by those who possess the means to bring about a change and to start the process to usher in a New International Economic Order. The wisdom which was evident last year when certain significant decisions were taken in the sphere of the North- South dialogue seems to have lost some of its momentum this year.146.	Living as we do in this small and increasingly interdependent world  no one can completely escape responsibility for the current atmosphere of gloom  fear  frustration and diffidence. But the primary responsibility must rest with those who literally possess the power of life and death over all of us and who do not hesitate to wield that power  without caring too much for the consequences of their action. A few powerful nations are claiming and blatantly exercising what they consider their right to cause destabilization in any place and at any time and with any means of their choosing. It is obvious that the weak and poor nations cannot look upon this unenviable lot of theirs with equanimity. They have  therefore  to be eternally vigilant if they are to survive  if they are to preserve and promote the well- being of their peoples and if they are not to become pawns in the game of great-Power manipulation. They have to speak up on behalf of their mute millions  assert that they have no intention of acquiescing in the dangerous activity of big- Power brinkmanship and that they do not wish to face annihilation either by the deliberate design of callous Powers or by accidental errors of mindless machines.147.	It is in this context that the policy of non-alignment assumes greater validity. Non-alignment is the embodiment of the aspirations of the vast majority of nations and peoples to protect their existence  their freedom  honour and dignity. The non-aligned movement is not directed against one or the other bloc. Over the decades it has come to represent a positive forceâa force of life and not of deathâin international relations which is now recognized even by those who had at one time ridiculed it. At the same time  the non- aligned movement has had to pass through certain vicissitudes. The general atmosphere of doubt and recrimination seems to have contaminated the movement to some extent. Internal problems within the movement have tended to affect its unity. We have to examine these problems closely and devise ways and means of ensuring the unity and continued effectiveness of the movement. While reserving these tasks for discussion at the forums of the non-aligned movement itself  I shall only express my confidence that  both by positive determination and by sheer necessity  non- alignment shall be restored to its original concept and sweep when it was devised to deal with global issues of detente  disarmament  decolonization and development.148.	There is an organic relationship between these four issues. Progress in any one of them would help create the proper atmosphere for forward movement in the others. By the same token  setback in one leads to increasing difficulty in the others. The present international situation vividly illustrates their interrelationship. The collapse of detente has led to stalemate in disarmament negotiations and absurd increases in defence expenditures which  in turn  have prevented the developed nations from achieving what was expected of them in international economic co-operation and development or  at any rate  tended to provide them with an alibi for falling far short of expectations.149.	It is a matter of considerable anguish to my delegation that the continent of Asia  which has given the world all its major religions and served as the main cultural pathfinder over several millennia  is at present the scene of most of the conflicts and much of the suffering caused by these conflictsâWest Asia  South-West Asia and South-East Asia. The Indian subcontinent  I am happy to say  has been free from conflict for some years now  and it is my earnest hope and the constant endeavour of my Government to see genuinely peaceful and co-operative relations continue to develop in this area.150.	In West Asia  the threat of a conflagration will continue to persist so long as the Palestinian problem is treated as a refugee problem and as long as the commitment of the United Nations to establish an independent State for the Palestinians in their homeland remains unfulfilled. Far from heeding the call of the United Nations to withdraw from the occupied Arab territories  Israel has unabashedly colonized Arab lands and illegally annexed the Holy City of Jerusalem in total disregard of its sacred heritage. I firmly believe  as I said a few weeks ago during the seventh emergency special session   that a comprehensive solution to the problem of West Asia entails the following elements: the exercise by the Palestinian people of their inalienable national and human rights  including the right to establish an independent State; the total and unconditional withdrawal by Israel from all Palestinian and Arab territories occupied since 1967  including the Holy City of Jerusalem; and the guarantee of the right of all States in the region  including Arab Palestine  to live within secure and recognized borders. A peaceful solution cannot be attained without the full and equal participation of the PLO  the sole and authentic representative of the Palestinian people  in any negotiations. Experience has shown that attempts at partial solutions without the participation of the PLO have neither succeeded nor contributed to peace in the region.151.	The people and Government of India are saddened by the recent and continuing conflict between Iran and Iraq  two close neighbours of ours. Our cultural and economic ties with the peoples of the two countries are as old as history itself. Since our independence in 1947 those ties have become even closer and acquired new dimensions.152.	Iran and Iraq are both developing countries  as in India. We cannot but express regret that the conflict will inevitably lead to retarding the process of economic and social development which is so vital to the needs of the peoples of the two countries. At the same time the conflict weakens the solidarity of the non-aligned and developing countries. We therefore urge Iran and Iraq to settle their differences peacefully  in accordance with the principles and provisions of the Charter of the United Nations.153.	The developments in Afghanistan have been engaging the serious attention of the Government of India. India has historical and traditional ties with the people of Afghanistan. We are deeply concerned and vitally interested in the security  independence  stability and tranquillity of our friendly neighbour. Over the past months the Government of India has been in touch with the countries of the subcontinent  as well as other countries  in order to prevent the aggravation of these dangers and heightening of tension.154.	We have consistently emphasized the inadmissibility of the use of force in international relations or intervention or interference in the internal affairs of sovereign States. It is also our firm belief that only by upholding the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States can peace and stability be preserved in the area. Observance of those principles would not prejudice the legitimate security interests of any State and  in fact  would go a long way towards safeguarding them. What is required is a dialogue among the parties concerned  without pre-conditions  so that the contours of a political settlement  acceptable to all  can emerge. I am satisfied that such a dialogue is possible  since most of the difficulties are essentially notional and at best technical and non-substantive. If the countries of the region are left in peace to work out their own destiny  without the competitive attention of great Powers  that will permit them to embark on relationships based on mutuality and a developing trust in bilateral negotiations as the best means of settling outstanding problems.155.	India's relations with Kampuchea go back several centuries. Indeed  the temples of Angkor Wat bear testimony to the close interconnections between the cultures of our two countries. The gentle and peace-loving people of Kampuchea have suffered very greatly through no fault of their own. The world will not forget nor condone the calculated and heinous crimes perpetrated in the recent past by a cruel regime against the innocent and defenceless people of Kampuchea. It is a great irony that  while emphatic references are being made time and again to human rights  the first and foremost right of the Kampuchean people  namely  the right to live  has been glossed over conveniently. Politically motivated callousness seems to have crossed all limits when it is realized that remnants of the very same despotic regime are representing  as it were  their own victims of Kampuchea in this Assembly.156.	The countries of Indo-China have been subjected to conflict  destabilization and war for far too long and should be allowed now to concentrate on the development of their economies and societies. The Government of India has decided to establish diplomatic relations with the Government headed by President Heng Samrin. This is an expression as much of the overwhelming majority of public- opinion within India as of our general policy of recognizing the reality of the political situation inside Kampuchea.157.	We value highly our relations with countries of ASEAN and believe that the development of our relations with all our neighbours in South-East Asia will enable us to assist in the solution of the problems that confront them at the present time.158.	Every objective analyst of the situations in South-West and South-East Asia must be convinced by now that extreme positions have not helped ease tensions in either region; on the other hand  they have only hardened attitudes and prolonged the sufferings of the concerned peoples. India's approach is based on the conviction that the search for a solution in both cases lies in political means and not through military force.159.	There should be no illusion that India is seeking merely momentary peace. As we have repeatedly stated  we are against the presence of foreign troops or foreign bases in any country. But if we desire to move towards finding a positive solution  what is required is an assiduous and continued effort to devise suitable package solutions which take care of the concerns of all and succeed in eliminating outside intervention and interference. Willingness in this regard on the part of the concerned  howsoever partial  should be taken advantage of for furthering a solution and not being spurned out of hand. If only the efforts of influential countries had been bent in this direction  these problems would  I am sure  have already been well on the way to satisfactory solution. That has been India's approach  and I am glad to say that it has over the months begun to receive at least grudging approval by many. In this connection  I should like to make special mention of the beginning of a dialogue between Viet Nam and Thailand  with the good offices of the Secretary-General. This is the right direction  and I hope it will proceed to ultimate success in that region as well as elsewhere.160.	The Indian Ocean has become over the past decade and a half the arena of increasing great-Power confrontation. The stresses and strains of their relationships have often been reflected in the corresponding arithmetic of their military presence there. That the littoral and hinterland States have expressed their unified and determined opposition to such military presence and called for its elimination in the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace in resolution 2832 (XXVI) is a fact of history which is often sought to be conveniently ignored.161.	The current uncertainties in the political and security climate in the Indian Ocean as well as its environs  as evidenced by the frantic efforts to develop the Diego Garcia base  further underline the urgency of addressing ourselves to this central preoccupation. Both in the recently enlarged Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean  where we have welcomed the participation of the great Powers and major maritime users  and at the Conference on the Indian Ocean  to be convened during 1981 in Sri Lanka  India will clearly identify the key concern of the littoral and hinterland States in securing the effective implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace. We are firmly committed to the convening of the Conference in 1981 in Sri Lanka and expect that the decision of the present session of the Assembly will contribute to that goal.162.	On 1 October 1980 the President of Pakistan in his statement before the General Assembly [18th meeting] referred to the State of Jammu and Kashmir  which is an integral part of India. That reference  attacking as it does the territorial integrity of India  was unfortunate. Three times in 24 years Pakistan attempted to detach the State of Jammu and Kashmir from India by the use of force. It received a befitting response on each of the three occasions. In 1972  India and Pakistan signed the Simla Agreement  which provides for the settlement of all issues between the two countries through bilateral negotiations. But since 1977 Pakistan has repeatedly raised the issue of Jammu and Kashmir at the United Nations and other international forums. References are made to relevant United Nations resolutions on the subject  quite forgetting the fact that those resolutions have become irrelevant because of the action of Pakistan itself. In the face of such references  I am constrained to wonder whether Pakistan's adherence to the Simla Agreement has undergone a change. There is a clear contradiction between the expressed desire of Pakistan to normalize relations with India in accordance with the Simla Agreement and its pronouncements in various forums which attempt to set the clock back. India's stand  on the other hand  has remained constant  and we continue to be prepared to settle all matters with Pakistan through bilateral channels.163.	There is an old Indian metaphor likening the world to a frog resting in the shadow of a cobra's hood. Such is the plight of peace in our age. The question of the relationship between ethics and power in international politics has long engaged the attention of both the philosopher and the practitioner of foreign policy in the nation State. Our principal concern in this nuclear age is  however  that the leadership of the most powerful nations of the world should consider not only the political appositeness of their foreign policy prescriptions but their consequences for the very survival of the world. We run the risk today of being carried on the wings of a collective paranoia. The situation calls for restraint and responsible behaviour so as to bring the world away from the edge of a nuclear catastrophe.164.	Yet  judging by the current climate of international relations  the shadows of such a catastrophe have become darker. Not only have the expectations of the first Disarmament Decade  and especially those of the tenth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament  been belied  but there has been a staggering  almost quantum leap in world military expenditure  which today totals nearly $US 500 billion. Familiar arguments of ""deterrence"" and doctrines of ""balance of terror"" are adduced to justify the continued escalation in the build-up of nuclear weaponry. New doctrines of limited nuclear war are being postulated which  by making nuclear war credible  increase the risk of such a war and even give it a semblance of respectability.165.	All too often we are reminded of the dangers of an accidental nuclear holocaust being triggered off by human or technological error or by computer malfunction. The very existence of such weapons makes the possibility of system failures resulting in outright catastrophe frighteningly real. Over the years India has consistently argued that the only effective guarantee against the use  threat of use or accidental use of nuclear weapons is the total elimination of such weapons. Their use has been declared a crime against humanity and contrary to the Charter of the United Nations. Pending  however  the total elimination of nuclear weapons  all States possessing nuclear weapons should give a binding commitment not to use them under any circumstances.166.	India is firmly of the view that  like the Geneva Protocol of 1925  which completely forbids the use of biological and chemical weapons  a convention on the total prohibition of the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons would be a most desirable objective which should be pursued energetically by the international community.167.	We understand that the United States and the USSR are scheduled to resume shortly their dialogue on some aspects of the question of curbing the arms race. This is a welcome development.168.	We have noted the proposals put forward by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union on urgent measures for reducing the danger of war. My delegation will give those proposals its most serious consideration.169.	It is pertinent to recall that it was India which first brought the problem of the proliferation of nuclear weapons to the attention of the United Nations in 1964 by inscribing in the agenda an item entitled ""Non-proliferation of nuclear weapons"". Our approach was based on the premise that both horizontal and vertical proliferation were integral parts of a problem which had to be dealt with as a whole. This concept was endorsed by the General Assembly in resolution 2028 (XX)  which declared  inter alia  that any treaty ""should embody an acceptable balance of mutual responsibilities and obligations of the nuclear and non-nuclear Powers"".170.	Unfortunately  this concept was deliberately altered in the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  concluded in 1968. If the Treaty has become an unworkable document  it is only because it has adopted the narrow and illogical approach of addressing itself only to the question of horizontal proliferation. The conclusion of cartel-type arrangements  the attempts to impose full-scope safeguards and discriminatory constraints on the peaceful nuclear activities of non-nuclear-weapon States are all aimed at perpetuating a kind of nuclear feudalism which is unrealistic  illogical and unacceptable.171.	India is opposed to nuclear weapons. On the other hand  the Government of India is firmly committed to the peaceful utilization of nuclear energy. We would oppose any moves or measures which are discriminatory in nature and which come in the way of our programmes to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. The question of non- proliferation of nuclear weapons should not be confused with the right of all States to develop  acquire and use nuclear energy and to determine their peaceful nuclear programmes in accordance with their national priorities  needs and interests.172.	As we prepare to celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the historic Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  the United Nations can legitimately be proud of its record of achievements in the field of decolonization. Except for a few pockets where colonialism and racism are desperately fighting the forces of nationalism  the world today is free from colonial domination and exploitation. While the independence of Zimbabwe and Vanuatu was first and foremost the result of the freedom struggle of their peoples  the contribution made by the United Nations has been significant.173.	We were hopeful that the independence of neighbouring Zimbabwe would set an example for a peaceful settlement of the question of Namibia. The United Nations plan for Namibia contained in Security Council resolution 435 (1978) had established a framework for the early independence of Namibia. Its acceptance by the parties concerned had marked a step in the right direction. But the racist South African regime has continued its dilatory tactics by raising extraneous issues and by questioning the very impartiality of the Secretary-General of the United Nations. We should certainly support every effort for a peaceful settlement of the question of Namibia which would be to the satisfaction of the people of Namibia. However  we regret to note that even the most recent communication  dated 22 September 1980  received by the Secretary-General from the South African Government does not indicate that South Africa has any intention to implement the United Nations plan. The only means left to the United Nations in the present situation is for the Security Council to impose mandatory sanctions against South Africa under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter  so as to compel South Africa to abide by the wish of the international community. Meanwhile the Member States should continue to provide moral and material support to SWAPO  the sole and authentic representative of the people of Namibia  in its struggle for national liberation.174.	Permit me to refer briefly to the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  which concluded its ninth session at Geneva recently. The Conference has been in session since 1973 and before that the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction had reviewed the law of the sea and done preparatory work for about six years. During that long period  understanding was reached on a number of significant issues  including a 12-mile territorial sea  a 200-mile exclusive economic zone  limits of the continental shelf  a regime for marine environment and marine scientific research  and a regime and international machinery for the exploration and exploitation of the international sea-bed area and its resources  which have been recognized and acknowledged by all States as the common heritage of mankind.175.	We note with satisfaction that the Conference was able at its last session to make progress on some more critical questions and we hope it will successfully conclude its work of finalizing a comprehensive convention on the law of the sea in the near future.176.	The year 1980 marked the mid-point of the United Nations Decade for Women. Considerable progress has been made during the first half of the Decade in focusing the attention of Governments and peoples on the need for improving the status of women. Women in India have traditionally enjoyed pride of place in our society. Long before the International Women's Year and the Decade for Women  the Indian people had enacted into law equality of women in all respects. That was no accident  for it flows from the best traditions of our history and culture  and in particular of our struggle for independence  when men and women together accepted sacrifices and rejoiced in the dawn of freedom  I hope that the Programme of Action adopted at Copenhagen"" will provide the guidance and framework for action-oriented programmes to work towards the implementation of the objectives of the Decade through the United Nations and other international forums.177.	The year 1981 will be the International Year of Disabled Persons. There is a vast segment of mankind  estimated to be around 400 million  which  being handicapped in one way or another  is unable to live with the dignity which is the right of all human beings. The bulk of those unfortunate beings is in the developing countries. We in India intend to reinforce our efforts in the rehabilitation of the disabled and  more important  in the prevention of disability. We have already taken several steps  including the establishment of a National Committee  in preparation for the International Year of Disabled Persons.178.	We have just emerged from the frustrating processes of the eleventh special session and the agonizing memory of its disappointing ending is still fresh in our minds. However constructively one may try to look at the outcome of the special session  one is unable to escape the conclusion that the failure was not so much because of the complexity of the task but because of the absence of political will and the incomprehensible stubbornness of a fewâto be precise  just three States Members of this Organization. In their incessant quest for an orderly and co-operative approach towards a new international economic order  the developing countries were persuaded to accept a compromise text on procedures for the global negotiations. That was the irreducible minimum for securing a process that would have provided hope of finding solutions to the critical problems facing the world economy as a whole and the economies of the developing countries in particular. A vast majority of the affluent nations  whose fortunes are interlinked with the destiny of the developing world  also accepted the procedures worked out through extremely difficult negotiations during the special session. Not all of them could have found those procedures entirely satisfactory  but they responded to the imperative of interdependence and to the obligations implicit in it. And yet  in the final analysis  all those endeavours ended in total collapse and the international community was at the end left chasing the wisp of international co-operation and interdependence. It would be less than candid on my part not to affirm that those who prevented a consensus being reached must bear the entire responsibility for the failure of the special session.179.	It would be appropriate to ask why the concept of interdependence does not seem to have received acceptance in practice  particularly in all developed countries. There is a view that the fact of interdependence either is not quite apparent or is not urgent enough to be taken into account in formulating current economic policies and decisions of developed countries. The dialogue as well as the argument based on interdependence  therefore  takes on a rather academic and unreal character and does not seem to carry conviction with the people of developed countries. That is the distinct impression one gets from their media  whatever the pronouncements of their political leadership. It is time that this hiatus in understanding was seriously taken note of.180.	Of course the position is not the same in all developed countries or on all occasions in the same country. It would therefore not be correct to lump all developed countries together in that respect. There are distinct variations in the perceptions of the Governments and peoples of those countries and it would be both relevant and prudent to analyse them closely. The extent of the genuine realization of interdependence on the part of the Governments and peoples of the developed countries is the real measure of success which the North-South dialogue will achieve.181.	Until three days back India was the Chairman of the Group of 77 in New York and  as such  articulated the aspirations of the developing countries. India will continue to endorse the stand taken by the Group of 77 as before and contribute its mite for the success of the global negotiations. The Group of 77 has taken a reasonable and balanced stand. We hope that in due course it will find a favourable response from developed countries  mainly through a process of appraisal of their own long-term interests  which can be achieved only through co-operation with developing countries. That process obviously needs a persuasive and positive effort on the part of all right-thinking and sober elements in both the developed and developing camps. The attitude of charity would be just as unreal and fallacious as the approach of obligatory expiation would be impracticable and counterproductive.182.	The nature of the phenomenon that we witnessed at the eleventh special session is disturbing and its consequences ominous for the future of economic co-operation among nations. My delegation is concerned to hear arguments of domestic pressure inherent in a democratic set-up preventing adherence to or fulfilment of international covenants and agreements. Whether it is the law of the sea  where difficult negotiations over long years are promising to come to fruition soon  or multilateral trade negotiations on which agreement was reached last year at Tokyo  or other internationally binding agreements  their sanctity is being breached in the name of national compulsions and with increasing impunity. Is it very difficult  I ask the members of this Assembly  to infer from all this that a wilful departure is being made by those countries from the concept of inter-dependence and from the process of international co-operation?183.	Thirty-three years ago  when we achieved our political independence  we deliberately chose the democratic path of government. Democracy to us became a way of life  permeating the intricate political process as well as the methodology of development. Like most other nations  we too faced the conflict between national sovereignty and international obligations implicit in our existence as a member of the world community. To the best of our ability and belief  we have never turned away from our international obligations  nor can we be accused of violating the sanctity of international agreements freely entered into by my country. Such a course often involved domestic sacrifices  but our democratic structure gave us sustenance and strength in remaining true to our international or multilateral obligations. It would be particularly unfortunate if the leadership of a democratic country were to plead helplessness in fulfilling valid international obligations on the ground of opposition in its legislature. This helplessness would  in fact  detract from the credibility of the democratic system itself in international relations. So those who are having recourse to this argument  for whatever reason or short-term exigency  are in reality undermining the validity of their own cherished system. My earnest appeal would be that this tendency be eschewed.184.	So far as India is concerned  we are determined to continue our efforts to bring about an early resumption of the North-South dialogue. For our part  we would expect the few developed countries which have still not fully accepted the logic of global negotiations to join in the process that would make the resumption of the North-South dialogue possible. It is also my expectation that we should be able to see this movement in the course of the current session of the General Assembly so that the preparatory work for the launching of the global negotiations could be completed before the end of this year.185.	The eleventh special session of the General Assembly did manage to reach a consensus on the text of the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade  embodying the goals and objectives of an integrated process of economic and social development during the 1980s and the policy measures required to achieve those goals and objectives. It remains to be seen to what extent the commitments undertaken in the Strategy when it is adopted during this session  will represent unambiguous and unanimous agreements. This is true particularly in regard to official development assistance  industrial redeployment  international trade and monetary issues. Having said this  I would like to underline our satisfaction at the consensus that exists in regard to measures to meet the critical situation in the least developed countries.186.	At this session the General Assembly is expected to consider and take appropriate action in regard to the suggestions made by the Secretary-General last July for overcoming the critical economic situation of many developing countries. We await the elaboration by the Secretary- General of his suggestions and trust that it will be possible for him to go into all relevant details  such as the feasibility of raising the amount required for additional assistance and operational arrangements for its disbursement among low- income countries most seriously affected by the current economic crisis.187.	I should also like to refer to the policy measures for the most seriously affected countries that have been agreed to in the context of the International Development Strategy. The General Assembly resolution on the subject last year called upon the Secretary-General to submit an analytical report at the special session in 1980 and called upon all donor countries to consider in the meantime extending relief and assistance to the most seriously affected countries. While the special session was unable to consider the report of the Secretary-General in detail  the International Development Strategy does refer to agreed measures that will need to be urgently considered by the international community and this Assembly.188.	Many years ago Jawaharlal Nehru  reflecting on the dilemma of his time over the futile attempts at disarmament  wrote:""The real difficulty ... has been that there are two classes of countriesâthe satisfied Powers and the unsatisfied Powers  the dominant Powers and those that are suppressed  the Powers that want the present state of affairs to continue and those that want a change. Between the two there can be no stable equilibrium  just as there can be no real stability between a dominant class and a suppressed class .... Nothing proves the unreality and mockery of international politics today so much as the failure of all attempts at disarmament. Everybody talks of peace  and yet prepares for war.""189.	These words  written more than 40 years ago  have a ring of tragic prophecy. They are symptomatic not only of disarmament negotiations but of the entire gamut of international relations today. Sometimes  looking at great stretches of history  it is difficult to believe that the ideal of co-operation and working together for the common good has made much progress. And yet  if we are to avert a catastrophe  we should resolutely continue on the path of dialogue and co-operation and turn away from sterile polemics and confrontation. All of us perhaps perceive the danger and recognize the challenge  but the will to act has so far been sadly lacking. Let us  therefore  so readjust our sights and conduct our affairs that future generations may not condemn our times as yet another barren stretch in the history of man."
"66",3235,"IRL",35,1980,"ï»¿I should like to congratulate Ambassador von Wechmar on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly. It is a source of particular satisfaction to Ireland because of his character and abilities and because of our regard for his country. Through his long years of experience at the United Nations  he has learned the advantage of patient negotiations in the solution of conflict  and I am sure that he will apply that experience in guiding our work.216.	I should also like to thank his predecessor in this onerous office  Mr. Salim of the United Republic of Tanzania  for the patience  competence and understanding with which he presided over several sessions of this General Assembly.217.	To the Government and people of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  I offer our warmest congratulations and our wishes for every success for their future well-being and prosperity as our one hundred and fifty-fourth Member.218.	I should like to express  too  my Government's continued confidence in the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Wald- heim  whose deep concern for this Organization and for the preservation of international peace and security is so absolutely manifest in his latest report on the work of the Organization.219.	Thirty-five years ago the founders of the United Nations  speaking in the name of the peoples of the world  set themselves to build a new framework of international order from the ruins of war. They drafted a Charter which speaks for rights and human dignity  of peace and security for peoples  of tolerance and social progress for all.220.	That is a language which expresses universal human aspirations and ideals. But it did not then  and it does not yet  describes very well the reality of human life for all of the world's peoples.221.	It is now more than a generation since these aims were proclaimed in the name of mankind. Over that period the sweep and flow of human history has quickened. A world political system of independent nations has emerged  with an interdependent world economy. There are no more unknown or uncharted areas on the globe.222.	It is evident today that humanity is oneâand aware of itself as such. Global travel is faster and sure as never before  and communication is easy. An event of importance in one part of the world is quickly reported in all and generates immediate and varying reactions which are in turn reported throughout the world. Human technology and mastery by man of his environment have increased dramatically; andâsymbol of this masteryâman for the first time has left this planet.223.	But there is also a darker side. Human nature has not changed. Tension and conflict are still a part of human life in society  and a global society must meet global problems and face global dangers.224.	It is this most important point which we must now grasp and act on  here and elsewhere  not simply in what we say but in our actions. What might once have been separate or local problems are now linked and interconnected  so that they arouse a common concern and pose a common danger.225.	We may have mastered the human environment. But we have also touched the limits of our planet and of its resources. We see now that life on earthâall lifeâis fragile and that it will be for humanity to decide through its actions whether to conserve or to destroy it.226.	We may have developed global communications. But our easy communication highlights inequity within the emerging world system and makes injustice more evident to the deprived  who  in their new-found solidarity  will no longer accept it or tolerate it.227.	We may have advanced our technology in the developed world. But it is evident that this more prosperous part of the world simply cannot maintain indefinitely that disproportionate claim on the world's resources which has sustained its present way of life.228.	We have seen the growth of a single international system which is global in character and almost universal in membership. But in a global system conflict  too  however limited in origin  can have a global dimension. What in another time might have been local rivalries within a region now send tremors throughout the international system  which is already tensed and polarized with major Powers and alliances in confrontation. It is true that we have avoided major warâthough many have suffered in lesser conflicts over a generation. But we live always with a fearful paradox. Peace  to the extent that we have known it  seems to depend on a constant refinement of the means and a constant emphasis on the readiness  within minutes  to fight a major and disastrous war.229.	There is indeed a daunting list of problems before us: injustice and inequity within the world economy; unfair division of the world's resources and lack of care for their conservation; polarization and confrontation between major Powers; the steady growth of armaments  dangerous in themselves and wasteful in their diversion of resources from human welfare; violation of human rights and lack of concern for large-scale human suffering and the problems of refugees; and conflict and confrontation within regions  which could have wide and dangerous consequences for all.230.	Those who founded the United Nations must have had some feeling for these global problems as they drew up the Charter  but they cannot have envisaged in any detail the kind of dangers which we now face. How can we respond to these dangers? That represents the challenge of today.231.	The United Nations as we inherit it is an Organization which comprises States and groups of States which differ greatly in outlook  culture  ideology and political orientation; and fundamental to its structure are the principles of national sovereignty and respect for non-intervention. These facts set limits to our capacity this Organization to meet the global challenges we face. Bur die United Nations itself and the family of economic  social and other organizations linked with it do provide an essential framework of world order  and the Charter  if taken as a living instrument  does set guiding principles and provides the procedures to achieve that justice which is necessary if any order is to endure.232.	The United Nations  it has been said  can be seen either as a mirror which faithfully reflects the world's problems  confrontations and paralyses of will; or it can be seen as a living instrument  an Organization  a set of procedures which is more than the sum of its parts  where problems can be faced and tensions eased. It is for each of us represented here to decide whether we shall use the Organization as such an instrument and develop fully its potential for resolving conflict or simply allow it to remain a mirror which faithfully reflects our quarrels but does nothing to resolve them.233.	The truth is that peace and justice are not static achievements. They require constant effort and a constant commitment by every nation to the effort to attain and maintain them. Above all  they require willingness by each of us to apply in our own case the same principles we so freely ask others to apply in issues where we are not involved.234.	The United Nations has had many successful achievements as it has evolved in 35 years from an Organization representing a limited group of States that fought a war together to one that is now almost universal in membership. In this twentieth anniversary year of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  it is fitting that we recall the indispensable role that the United Nations played in helping to bring so many States to independence in a relatively short space of time. As a country which itself regained its independence in this century  Ireland has welcomed this development. We particularly welcome the presence in our midst of Zimbabwe  which has at last emerged to independence following troubled years in which it was a special concern of the United Nations. We believe that the people of the few remaining colonial Territories must be enabled to exercise their right to self- determination without delay.235.	Another achievement for the Organization has been the considerable progress made towards agreement at the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. It seems that  subject to the resolution of a small but very important number of issues  it should be possible to complete negotiations and adopt a convention on the law of the sea next year. The Conference has shown that  given a willingness to compromise  it is possible to negotiate successfully on a complex range of issues in a forum in which all Member States are represented. If  as we confidently expect  it can now be concluded successfully  it will mark a really historic achievement in agreed control of a large part of man's environment.236.	Another heartening development in recent years has been the growth of co-operation in many fields among groups of States on a regional basis. Such co-operation makes it possible to give substance to United Nations ideals and is in full harmony with broader co-operation on the world front. Indeed  it can increase the pace and scope of such co-operation on a world level to have functioning co-operation on a regional basis. I might mention that  in Europe  the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe process  if sustained and developed  can be of particular significance in reaching towards world peace and is a practical example of regional co-operation within Europe  from the Atlantic to the Urals.237.	However  despite these achievements  the past year has not been a hopeful one for all of us who believe in the development of an international society in which peace and security should be maintained by international agreement and disputes settled by peaceful means and through negotiation. The 1980s  which promised to be a decade of political and economic negotiation and co-operation  unfortunately threaten to be one of conflict and confrontation. Detente is threatened by new and growing tensions  and there is a danger that the fragile achievements in the area of arms control and disarmament may be swept aside in a new round of the arms race.238.	Economic growth has been replaced  unfortunately  by economic stagnation. The efforts to establish a just and equitable international economic order fall far short of what is needed. Inflation and threats to the continuity of supply of crucial raw materials have added to the burdens of rich and poor nations alike.239.	A major crisis has erupted in the region of southern Asia as a result of the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan. Within the last few days  a new armed conflict has broken out between Iran and Iraq  adding to the instabilities and tensions which that region has known for more than 30 years. We here are all fully aware of how serious that conflict could be in its human and economic consequences for those directly involved and in the wider dangers it poses for all of us. We must feel some concern  I believe  at how little we in this Organization have been able to do directly so far to achieve an end to the fighting and a settlement of the conflict in accordance with the principles of the Charter.240.	Yet it does no good to despair. There is no alternative to the attempt to find solutions through negotiations to the manifold problems which we face  however intractable these problems may seem to be.241.	Agreement to negotiate is  of course  not enough. There must first be the will on all sides to negotiate seriously and with the intention of reaching agreements which deal with the real problems and issues at stake and which will be more than mere expedients.242.	Secondly  all must be prepared to exercise restraint in their actions. It is difficult to expect that negotiations can be conducted with any chance of success if any of those involved attempt unilaterally to change the situation to their advantage.243.	Thirdly  the search for agreed solutions through negotiations requires that we do not ignore injustices for so long that those who suffer those injustices are forced to bring their grievances to our attention by other means. It is sobering to reflect how many of the problems with which this Assembly has to deal could have been resolved at an early stage if sufficient awareness and generosity had been shown at the right time and the appropriate steps had been taken.244.	This is not to say that the United Nations must be involved in every dispute  or  indeed  that the form of its involvement should not vary  as it has  depending on the circumstances. What it is true to say is that we will not come close to resolving many of the issues with which we are faced unless we use to the full the flexible and varied means which the United Nations provides.245.	Since Ireland joined the United Nations 25 years ago we have acted consistently in this belief. I hope and believe that our contributions over the years in this direction have been constructive. It is with this belief in the resolution of disputes through negotiations and with a commitment to accept in our own case the principles we commend to others that I now go on to speak in more detail about some of the major issues confronting this Assembly.246.	On the issue of disarmament  I referred a few moments ago to the danger of a new round in the arms race. There are now more nuclear weapons than ever in the world. Their destructive power is multiplied and they have become a permanent feature of the security policies of major Powers and their allies. It is difficult  perhaps impossible  to envisage any rational political calculus in which the use of nuclear weapons could play a part. Indeed  deterrence has been based on the assumption that a nuclear war would result in the certain and mutual destruction of the adversaries. None the less  we now face the danger that technological imperatives  combined with political mistrust and the inherent pessimism of military planners  may bring this period of relative nuclear stability to a close. The development and possible deployment of new weapons and the strategic doctrines that go with them will not only greatly complicate arms control negotiations but may even inhibit the exercise of restraint in future crises.247.	It would be ironic; indeed  if  in the interests of the increased security of the nuclear States  the world were subjected to a new generation of weaponry  which would in reality diminish the security of all.248.	But the nuclear arms race is not confined to the nuclear Powers or to the development of more deadly and more accurate weaponry. During the past year  the danger of the further spread of these weapons to countries which do not as yet possess them has been increased. My Government must register its very profound regret and disappointment at the outcome of the second Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The system of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  to which Ireland has had the honour to adhere since its inception  has helped to hold the ring and prevent the further spread of nuclear weapons. We fear that the unsuccessful outcome of the Geneva Conference will make the task even more difficult.249.	It would  of course  be unjust to lay the blame for the arms race solely on nuclear weapons and the nuclear Powers. So-called conventional weapons have killed 25 million people since the Second World War. The destructive power of such weapons is today vastly greater than in the Second World War  and the greater part of military expenditure is devoted to conventional arms. One generation of sophisticated conventional weapons follows another in rapid succession  consuming enormous sums of money  a fraction of which world contribute so much to relieving hunger and disease throughout the developing world.250.	It is easy  I know  to talk about disarmament in the abstract. It is easy to deplore the arms race  to urge its immediate end and to call for general and complete disarmament. What we really need and need urgently are concrete measures that are practicable in the short term and bring immediate results that all can see  and I will make some suggestions in this regard.251.	First  the SALT Treaty should be ratified. In our view  this would be of great significance in restraining com-petition among the major Powers in the further development of nuclear weapons and in helping to promote the reduction of existing nuclear arsenals.252.	Secondly  we need a comprehensive test-ban treaty or  failing that  a moratorium on nuclear testing  which would help efforts to halt the spread of nuclear weapons. The existing Non-Proliferation Treaty regime  in particular  would be strengthened by such a development.253.	Thirdly  there should be an agreement on ending the production of fissionable material for nuclear weapons. This would also help the cause of non-proliferation.254.	Fourthly  we need an agreement or international convention to insure non-nuclear States against the use or threat of nuclear weapons.255.	There are  of course  other issues on which agreement would be of great practical and political benefit: for example  a chemical weapons convention  an agreement on the reduction of military budgets and steps to prohibit the development and deployment of new weapons of mass destruction.256.	Turning to the question of peace-keeping  if on the one hand the hopes of the framers of the Charter in regard to the maintenance of peace and security 'lave not all been realized  on the other the United Nations has developed over the years the useful concept of peace-keeping operations. The introduction of peace-keeping forces into an area where there is a dispute does not of itself resolve the dispute but it does provide a respite during which parties to a dispute can seek a more permanent resolution of their differences. The concept and practice of peace-keeping is still evolving  and each new generation provides fresh insights for the conduct of future operations.257.	United Nations peace-keeping has become the political counterpart of United Nations programmes in the economic and social fields  in which assistance is offered on a disinterested basis to those who need it. Ireland has consistently supported the development of peace-keeping and has participated without interruption since 1958 in United Nations peace-keeping operations. We believe that tl.is is one of the practical ways in which small nations can help in the task of maintaining international peace and security.258.	The Middle East continues to be an area of great concern which presents serious dangers for international peace and security. Foreign Minister Thorn of Luxembourg  as President of the Council of Ministers of the European Economic Community  has already set out in detail the policies of the nine Community countries on this issue. He has outlined the progress of the contact mission which he undertook on behalf of the nine countries to the Middle East in recent months to see how Europe could best contribute to the achievement of a just and comprehensive peace in that area.259.	None the less  I should like to call attention to two principles which were stressed by the Heads of State and Government of the nine member States of the European Community in their declaration at Venice on 13 June 1980 and which  in the opinion of my Government  are essential elements in a peace settlement. These are the right to existence and to security of all the States in the region  including Israel  and the requirement of justice for all the peoples involved  which includes the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people within the framework of a peace settlement.260.	It is only by reconciling these two principles through negotiation that a comprehensive  just and durable settlement can be found. Such negotiation must involve all the parties concerned  including the PLO. No one is so sanguine as to imagine that this is an easy task but  equally  no one can doubt that the task must be faced or that the Middle East is a vital area where conflicts are likely to have repercussions on a world-wide scale. It is therefore essential for international peace and security that a settlement in the Middle East be achieved  no matter how discouraging the obstacles may appear to be.261.	Some of these obstacles indeed are inherent in the conflicting rights and aspirations of the different parties. Some arise from intransigent positions taken by one or another party and from unacceptable actions such as the establishment of settlements by Israel in occupied territories and the claim to alter the character and status of Jerusalem.262.	I cannot leave the question of the Middle East without reference to the tragic situation in Lebanon. My country remains firmly committed to the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon and looks forward to the day when a Lebanese government will be in a position to exercise its authority fully over all its territory.263.	Ireland currently contributes some 650 troops to UNIFIL. I do not need to remind the Assembly of the difficult circumstances faced by UNIFIL which have resulted in loss of life for some contingents  including that of my own country  in brutal circumstances. UNIFIL remains unable to extend its control over the entire area entrusted to it in southern Lebanon. As the Secretary-General notes in his report on the work of the Organization:""A main factor in this situation is the policy of the Government of Israel and its support of the de facto forces . .He also refers to:""The disturbed conditions in other parts of southern Lebanon  including the presence of Palestinian and other armed elements  and the general political and security situation in Lebanon . . 264.	Despite these difficulties  my country is convinced that over the two and a half years of its existence  UNIFIL has made a significant contribution towards the prevention of an outbreak of general hostilities in the Middle East by reason of its presence in southern Lebanon. At the same time  if a peacekeeping force is to operate  it must be given the necessary conditions to do so effectively: in particular  it must function with the consent of all parties and be allowed freedom of movement throughout the area assigned to it  and in conditions of adequate security for its personnel. I hope that all concerned will reflect carefully on the consequences of any further actions that may make UNIFIL's task more difficult.265.	I must also join with the Secretary-General in expressing my concern about UNIFIL's financial problems  caused by the policy of some Member States in withholding their assessed share of the costs of the operation. This places an unreasonable burden on troop-contributing countries such as mine  over and above the basic risks involved which they willingly accept. I earnestly hope that ways can be found to alleviate that situation at this session of the Assembly.266.	Operations such as UNIFIL serve as an example of the positive and practical contribution which the United Nations can make in keeping the peace in difficult circumstances.267.	We in Ireland have long admired the determination of African countries to work together in the OAU to achieve their common objectives. We know they welcome outside co-operation in their development and in dealing with problems created by national disasters  and Ireland is pledged to play its small part in this effort. We know  too  that the African States oppose intervention by outside Powers in their affairs. Such intervention can only compound the conflicts that exist.268.	In contrast  the constructive results of the promotion by the United Nations of the decolonization process are now evident  thankfully  in southern Africa.269.	Zimbabwe has at last achieved its rightful position among the free nations. Out of the years of bitter war has come a new source of inspiration and hope  not only for the future of southern Africa but for the resolution of conflicts in the world at large. At the regional level in southern Africa  possibilities for fruitful co-operation are now unfolding. The initiative undertaken by the countries concerned following the Conferences at Arusha in 19798 and Lusaka this year9 is worthy of the widest support. The international community  for its part  has a special responsibility for ensuring that the achievement in Zimbabwe is not in any way jeopardized. Zimbabwe and the other front-line States should be supported  and pressure for change in Namibia and South Africa maintained.270.	In spite of the best efforts of the Secretary-General and of the contact group of the five Western countries  the United Nations plan  as contained in resolutions 385 (1976) and 435 (1978) of the Security Council  has not yet been implemented. At the technical level  the differences have been reduced to the point where they are no longer sufficient to justify continued delay. Concessions made by SWAPO and the constructive attitude of the front-line States have demonstrated their commitment to the achievement of a negotiated settlement  despite the provocation of the recent South African attacks on Angola and Zambia. The South African Government must realize that further delay cannot be justified. It will bear the full responsibility for the very serious consequences that will ensue if the legitimate aspirations of the people of Namibia continue to be denied to them. There is no alternative to the adoption of the United Nations plan if a peaceful and internationally recognized solution is to be achieved. Any attempt to establish a so- called independent State without international agreement would be doomed to failure. Ireland will continue to give its full support to the efforts of the Secretary-General  together with those of the Western contact group and the front-line States in co-operation with SWAPO  towards the achievement of a just and internationally recognized settlement without delay and without further bloodshed.271.	It is evident that there can be no durable peace in southern Africa so long as South Africa maintains its present racist policies. The system of apartheid condemns the majority in South Africa to a life as second-class citizens  renders millions stateless in their own country and involves the forced migration of many thousands to rural slums in the so-called homelands. It can be sustained only through repression. This is a policy that must lead to disaster. Ultimately it will fail  and at great human cost.272.	There are some signs of a growing awareness among the white community in South Africa of their isolation in the world. However  attempts to reshape or restructure apartheid will not create a free and just society. There can be no compromise on the principle of the equality of every human being and the need to translate this into practice. The need for concerted international pressure on South Africa to change its policy is in no way lessened by recent developments: rather  the need is to maintain such pressure  now that some movement is apparent. The Security Council should  therefore  continue its consideration of selective measures to increase the pressure for change in South Africa.273.	The breach of Charter principles is evident in Kampuchea. The people of that country have undergone a period of barbaric despotism in their own land  followed by foreign invasion and occupation.274.	As the Irish Foreign Minister declared on behalf of the nine Community members at the last session of the Assembly  a solution to the problem must be based on an independent Kampuchea  free from any foreign military presence  maintaining friendly relations with all the countries of the region and having the benefit of international assistance for reconstruction. In a joint  declaration issued at the end of the Second Ministerial Meeting of ASEAN and the European Economic Community  held at Kuala Lumpur on 7 and 8 March 1980  we urged the early implementation of General Assembly resolution 34/22 and we also called on all parties to exert the utmost efforts in order to avert a possible spill over of hostilities into neighbouring ASEAN countries and a widening of the area of conflict.275.	My Government is particularly concerned at the heightening of tension over the past few months in the area of the Thai-Kampuchean border and at the consequent grave danger to the large numbers of Kampuchean refugees who are concentrated there. The incursion into Thailand at the end of June resulted in a dangerous increase in tension  further threatened the stability of South-East Asia as a whole and caused still further human suffering. There is a need for restraint by all concerned in this potentially explosive situation.276.	Despite the failure so far to find a political solution  our Organization has  however  had some success in the humanitarian field. The immediate danger of widespread famine and its consequences which faced the Kampuchea people last year seems to have passed  to some extent. Credit for this is due in no small measure to the heroic efforts of the international relief agencies. I reaffirm Ireland's support for the activities of these agencies in their efforts to help all those in need  without discrimination  and I hope they will be given the greatest possible co-operation by the authorities involved.277.	In Afghanistan  too  any settlement must provide for the withdrawal of foreign troops. Afghanistan must be enabled to resume its traditional neutrality and non- alignment  to remain outside competition between the Powers and to maintain friendly relations with its neighbours  Conditions must be created in which the people of Afghanistan can determine their own form of government and decide their destiny free from outside intervention  in accordance with General Assembly resolution ES-6/2 adopted on 14 January 1980.278.	Both among the peoples of the world and here at the United Nations  there has been a growing awareness of the importance of basic human rights and the need to protect them. Unfortunately  that growing awareness has been largely prompted by the knowledge that human rights are being violated on a systematic and widespread basis in many parts of the world. In the area of human rights  the plight of refugees or displaced persons in many parts of the world illustrates this in a most dramatic fashion. Governments continue  unfortunately  to act in conflict with the international commitments that they have accepted in this area.279.	The Commission on Human Rights has intensified its work as a result  and it is important that the Commission continue to develop its investigative powers and that it be given every co-operation to that end. It is especially important that investigations begun by the United Nations  whether under public or private procedures  should not be concluded before satisfactory results are achieved. We must also continue at this Assembly the effort to reach agreement on improved United Nations human rights machinery and to give to the Secretariat the resources that will permit it to function with much greater effectiveness.280.	Some progress has been made in establishing legal norms. The last session of the Commission on Human Rights made substantial progress in adopting parts of the draft convention on torture and other cruel  inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment."" The establishment of a working group to examine the fate of missing persons and persons who have disappeared was a significant achievement of the session and a recognition of a growing problem. For when authorities can deny any knowledge of the whereabouts of such individuals  they are effectively deprived of all their rights.281.	While on the subject of human rights  it is incumbent upon me to refer to the continued holding of members of the staff of the United States Embassy in Teheran as hostages  in flagrant breach of international law and of humanitarian principles. Ireland fully respects the independence of Iran and the right of the Iranian people to determine their own future. But in their own interest  and that of the world community as a whole  I would again call on the Government and the people of Iran to respect the rights of others with whom they may differ on a political or religious basis and to uphold fundamental and humanitarian principles and established tenets of international law by releasing the hostages.282.	Underlying many of our current problems are the gross disparities that continue to exist between rich and poor nations  such disparities are not only unacceptable in themselves but can constitute a real threat to peace and stability. The millions of our fellow human beings who  through no fault of their own  exist in an apparently unending cycle of poverty and hunger  cannot be expected to acquiesce in that condition indefinitely. Justice demands that their situation be changed urgently and effectively.283.	The international community  through the United Nations  has taken the lead in helping to promote such change and over recent decades some progress has been made to improve the lives of the less well off in developing countries. But the situation continues to be critical and much remains to be done. We must not only provide aid to help those who suffer from the effects of under-development but we must attack the very root causes of underdevelopment itself.284.	The recently concluded eleventh special session of the General Assembly was concerned essentially with seeking to concentrate our energies towards achieving that end. The agreed text of the new International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade sets out the general framework for our actions over the next 10 years establishes our priorities and provides that the outcome of future United Nations and other relevant conferences  including the global negotiations  can be incorporated into it as the decade proceeds.285.	However  my Government regrets that the eleventh special session was unable to finish its tasks and that work on the procedures and agenda for the global negotiations was not completed. That must now be done at the present session of the General Assembly  so that the new round of global negotiations can be launched early in 1981. We believe that global negotiations can be vital and. by promoting growth and development  can benefit not just the developing world but the entire international community.286.	Ireland is determined to play  both nationally and internationally  its full part in promoting a revitalized North-South dialogue. I can reaffirm that Ireland  although not a rich or powerful nation is committed to progressing towards the 0.7 per cent target for official development assistance as rapidly as our resources will allow. Given our own stage of development and the many social and economic demands of a young and growing population  our progress may not be as rapid as we would wish. None the less we intend to maintain a steady increase in the flow of our transfers during the course of the present decade.287.	Drawing on our own recent developmental experience  we in Ireland aim in our co-operation with the people of developing countries to help them free themselves from the trap of under-development.288.	In looking at those parts of the world where there is unrest and turmoil  I may be forgiven for being particularly concerned about an area close to home. The tragic violence that has come to be part of everyday life in Northern Ireland has endured now for more than 10 years.289.	In approaching that fact  as with any other problem  we must distinguish between symptoms and causes. The symptoms in Northern Ireland are evident but the causes are deep seated  and they will not be solved by security measures alone.290.	The division of Ireland 60 years ago and the establishment of Northern Ireland as a region within the United Kingdom was a misconceived attempt by the British Government to resolve a major problem of the day  On the one hand  it faced the need to come to terms with the demand of the majority of the people of the country as a whole that Ireland should be independent. On the other hand  British interests and sentiment called for arrangements to meet the wish of a unionist minority to remain united with Britain.291.	Instead of resolving the difficulty  however  that settlement simply concentrated it within what then became Northern Ireland. The area was artificially devised not on a geographical or historical basis but to create a unit in which people of unionist leanings would have a permanent inbuilt majority. As a consequence  it also included a newly-created and substantial minority of nationalists who shared the aspiration to unity and independence of the majority of the population of Ireland  an aspiration that was frustrated by the new arrangement.292.	Sixty years have now passed since Ireland was thus divided. In that time  even though the vast majority of the population of IrelandâNorth and Southâwants peace and abhors violence  and even though both British and Irish Governments act vigorously against violence  almost every decade in that period has seen violence erupt within Northern Ireland. It is clear that Northern Ireland as an entity and the settlement that brought it into being have failed. It is apparent that there is a fundamental instability in the very structure of the region which has inhibited the development of normal political and social life there and which all too frequently has found expression in violence.293.	The area is fundamentally unstable because there has never been within it the kind of political consensus which in more normal societies underlies party differences. Instead  the very existence of Northern Ireland itself has always been the issue  so that normal politics do not exist; and that has been the only basic issue for over 60 years. The majority were always insecure and fearful that the settlement which made them a majority would be upset; the minority  on their side  were frustrated in their basic aspirations to Irish unity  discriminated against because of this and excluded in practice from effective political participation in an area whose very existence they called into question.294.	The result is that normal political life has been distorted and community divisions based on historical or religious differences have been accentuated rather than diminished.295.	Even now  60 years later  new efforts are still being made to establish suitable structures of regional government to accommodate the interests of all sections of the community within Northern Ireland. Many past injustices have indeed been corrected in recent years. But fears and insecurities continue and the forces of violence and extremism on each side of a divided community have taken advantage of the situation for their own narrow ends.296.	The toll of violence in such a very small area is indeed appalling. Over the past decade more than 2 000 people have been killed and 25 000 injured. There have been 27 000 shooting incidents and almost 7 000 explosions. Translated into human terms  the figures represent a society that is virtually under siege  with whole areas and neighbourhoods which can scarcely remember peaceful conditions. Perhaps even more disturbing are the social malaise and economic stagnation which have come about in Northern Ireland. Because of the continuing instability  valuable opportunities for economic development have been lost. Industrial and agricultural outputs are now lower than in the early 1970s. The population  which had been increasing up to the 1970s  is now static or declining. Overall unemployment stands at 15 per cent. In some areas it is as high as 28 per cent.297.	For the young  especially  the picture is sombre and distressing. Many have come into a society where violence and deprivation are the norm. Their chances of finding a job and securing a decent  standard of living are small. These social conditions provide a rich breeding ground for further disorder and extremist politics.298.	My Government cannot look upon these conditions as something affecting Northern Ireland alone or remote from our daily life in the rest of Ireland. They are happening in our country. They affect the people of all traditions in Ireland. Indeed  as a result of what is happening in Northern Ireland  my Government now spends on security alone proportionately more than the United Kingdom on similar measures. It is said that prosperity is indivisible. So also  unfortunately  is instability. The conditions I am referring to may affect not only Ireland  but places outside it. Trouble in any country today can mean trouble for many countries.299.	This is the background that has led my Government to fix the peaceful resolution of the problem of Northern Ireland as our primary political priority. We are determined to seek a lasting and comprehensive settlement to this question.300.	As we look back at the past 10 years  it is hard to avoid the conclusion that much of the political effort in Northern Ireland has been directed at the symptoms only. Successive efforts to work out equitable Government structures within the existing framework of Northern Ireland have come to nothing because they failed to get to grips with the fundamental problem. I would not wish in any way to be dismissive of the most recent attempt  which is still in progress  but it is difficult  from what we know of the positions and the expectations of those involved  to be optimistic as to the result.301.	It is necessary  in my view  to go beyond the efforts now under way to devise structures of government solely confined to Northern Ireland. The framework for a solution must take full account of three other vital dimensions: that of relations between North and South in the island of Ireland; the relationshipânow so close in so many areasâ between Britain and Ireland; and the common membership of both countries within the European Community.302.	The relation between North and South in Ireland is fundamental; it is a matter of geographical  historical  political  economic  social and cultural reality. Time has shown that division in Ireland simply has not worked. Accordingly  my Government wishes to see an arrangement evolve where-by Irish men and women would manage the affairs of the whole of Ireland in a truly constructive partnership  without a British presence but with active British goodwill for any arrangement in Ireland which may be worked out by agreement.303.	My Government is willing to discuss with all the representatives of Northern Ireland what arrangements would be needed to safeguard their interests and traditions. My Government has no doubt that they can be accommodated. We would be willing to go farâvery farâperhaps further than they realize  in order to reach agreement on new arrangements  looking not to the past but to the future to bring peace and stability to an area which has known trouble for far too long.304.	Having said that  I must add that attitudes struck up to now have been influenced by the unqualified guarantees given by successive British Governments to the unionist section of the people in Northern Ireland. This has encouraged them to veto any proposals  however constructive  in advance. Accordingly  it is our belief that a declaration by the British Government of their interest in encouraging the unity of Ireland by agreement and in peace could open the way towards an entirely new situation and help us  in Ireland  to devise new structures  by agreement and with consent  which would bring lasting peace to the whole island of Ireland.305.	It is clear that discussion of this question must be raised to a new plane between the sovereign Governments of Ireland and Britain and be set within the second and wider dimension of which I spokeâthe unique relationship between the peoples of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the peoples of the Republic. That this relationship is indeed unique was explicitly recognised by the Irish Prime Minister  Mr. Haughey  and the British Prime Minister  Mrs. Thatcher  in the communique which they issued following their talks in London in May this year. They agreed on that occasion to develop new and closer political cooperation between their two sovereign Governments and to hold regular meetings on a continuing basis  and they agreed to further that unique relationship between their peoples in the interests of peace and reconciliation.306.	Finally  there is the wider dimension set by the common membership of Great Britain and Ireland within the European Community. Linked together within the wider grouping  the two countries  together with their other partners  have developed new forms of co-operation which complement and extend the already close bilateral relations between them. Clearly  this common membership of both countries in a wider community committed to closer integration of its peoples provides a good background against which the two Governments can hope to resolve the apparently intractable problem which a common history has left to their two peoples.307.	I need hardly add that this new arrangement in Ireland which my Government wants to see emerge must be based entirely on agreement and consent. We have no wish to coerce or dominate  and we totally reject violence and will continue to act vigorously against it.308.	In summary  our approach to this problem  which is close to us  is essentially that which I commended to our Organization here at the outset of my speech. We commit ourselves to efforts to bring true and lasting peace to our island  and we reject those who have recourse to violence. We commit ourselves to apply in our own case the principles we commend to others and which underlie the Charter of this Organization.309.	Many of those who have come before me to this rostrum in the general debate have spoken of the world situation at present in sombre terms. I do not know if this view of the international situation today is wholly justified; but it is certainly true that the international climate is more difficult now than a year ago. At this time  it is  I believe  more important than ever that we uphold and abide by the principles of this Organization as set out in the Charter. My delegation has tried to do this since it became a Member 25 years ago.310.	Here at this rostrum today  I pledge on behalf of my Government and country that we will continue to do so to the best of our ability."
"67",3282,"IRN",35,1980,"ï»¿In the name of Allah  the Most Gracious  The Most Merciful  The Annihilator of Oppressors. On behalf of the delegation of the Islamic Republic of Iran I should like to extend to you  Mr. President  my warm congratulations on your election to the presidency of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. I am confident that  thanks to your personal qualities as an experienced and skilful diplomat and your devotion to the fundamental principles of the Charter  this session will achieve positive results.298.	I should also like to express my delegation's appreciation of the outstanding performance of your predecessor  Ambassador Salim Ahmed Salim  during his presidency of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly and the three special sessions that followed.299.	It is a pleasure for my delegation to welcome amongst us here the representatives of the freedom-loving people of Zimbabwe. The victory of the people of Zimbabwe is a clear sign that freedom for the people of South Africa and Namibia cannot be far.300.	A momentous historical transformation took place in Iran in February of last year. The brutal despotism of Mohammed Reza Pahlavi that had been imposed on my people by a coup dâEtat organized and financed by United States imperialism was pulled down and pulverized by the united Moslem masses of Iran. Using their bare hands and following the spiritual leadership of Imam Khomeini  the people of Iran in their millions staked their limbs and lives to liquidate a dictatorship that was armed to the teeth and dripping blood from its every pore.301.	The Islamic revolution shook the whole of the Moslem world. It towers above all else in a thousand years of our history. A mass revolution of the people rooted in Islam was triumphant before the world. Our people had resolved to return to the socio-political dynamism of Islam as a total way of life compatible with freedom and progress. The example of our revolution has given hope and courage to the masses of oppressed people.302.	The fundamental principles on which our revolution is based are  first the equality of all human beings regardless of race  social status  sex  language or ethnic background; secondly  the abolition of all forms of oppression and exploitation  individual as well as collective; and thirdly  the spiritual and moral development of our people and the mobilization of our material resources to that end.303.	We have sought to realize these principles both through struggle within our own country and in our relations with other countries. Within Iran we have instituted people's power; the people have obtained participation in government at all levels through a series of historic actions.304.	They have participated freely in two referendums to approve the Islamic Republic and the new Constitution  as well as in a variety of elections to choose the President of the Republic and the members of the parliament. Unlike any other revolution in history  the Islamic Revolution of Iran was able  despite attacks from within and without  to hold six free elections in the space of one year  the most notable of these being a vote to determine the nature of the post- revolutionary regime and votes on the Constitutional Assembly and on the Constitution.305.	It is therefore not surprising that the eyes of all freedom-loving peoples around the world who also aspire to be free and independent are focused on Iran. Freedom  independence and an Islamic Republic are sought by the peoples of all Moslem nations. That is why the Moslem masses everywhere have  in various ways  expressed their popular support for the revolution in Iran.306.	As long as there is oppression and terror and as long as there is inequality and exploitation  the forces of tyranny will wage war upon the forces of liberation  and right will battle wrong. Indeed  the history of mankind is the history of such struggles.307.	The holy books are also full of examples of the struggle between right and wrong. One such example  cited in the Old Testament as well as in Islamic literature  is the life- history of Nebuchadnezzer  the king of Babylon. He lived in that same region which is today a burning inferno resulting from aggression. Nebuchadnezzer sought to govern with the twisted logic of coercion and aggression. He ended his life leaving behind him a trail of destruction and death for his own people  no less than for the neighbouring peoples.308.	A new Nebuchadnezzer appeared in Iran in the form of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi. Our people removed him from power and extended the olive branch of peace to all our brothers in neighbouring countries. But now another Nebuchadnezzer  a new Shah  has sprung up in his place: Saddam Hussein and his thugs from Tikrit. The Iraqi and Iranian peoples will smash him and remove him and join hands to build a permanent peace 309.	Our revolution had learnt the lessons of history. The Islamic Republic of Iran stands for justice  freedom and independence for all peoples and nations. Accordingly  we support the Palestinian people struggling against the Zionist entity  and we stand against colonialism  imperialism and international Zionism everywhere. The peoples of Africa  Latin America and the Arab world all know this  and thus they in turn support our revolution.310.	It is no accident that in every trouble-spot in the world where oppression and exploitation of man exists  at least one of the major Powers is involved  lending its support to oppression and exploitation. This is true in the case of the occupation of Arab territories by Israel and Israeli aggression against southern Lebanon. It is true of the exploitation of the black majority in southern Africa and in Namibia. It is true of the occupation of Western Sahara  and it is true of the aggression against Iran by Saddam Hussein and his gang.311.	Our position in international relations is clear. We do not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries  but morally and spiritually we are with the oppressed people everywhere  for ideas and beliefs transcend national boundaries. That is why we have condemned the invasion of Afghanistan. The people of Afghanistan  the people of the Arab countries and the people of the whole Moslem world are our brothers and sisters in faith  and we cannot condone or accept aggression against them.312.	In the same way we are in full solidarity with all the oppressed peoples of the world. Our stand against occupation and aggression has been stated forcefully by Imam Khomeini himself. He made it very clear in his statement of 12 September 1980 that the servants of imperialism are trying to divide the oppressed people of the Moslem world on the basis of prejudices inherited from the era of colonial and imperialist domination. The purpose of Islam  he said  is to put an end to such prejudices. Contrary to that  the Government of Saddam Hussein has used these prejudices to stage an aggressive war against my people. It even seeks to stir up racial and sectarian hatred and resorts to the Zionist technique of digging into ancient history to make claims upon our territory.313.	The Islamic Republic of Iran stands for the genuine independence of the people. Imperialism has sought by every means at its disposal  overt and covert  to undermine this independence.314.	When Mohammed Reza Pahlavi was overthrown  his defeated supporters  including agents of SAVAK and some generals of the so-called Imperial Army  crossed the border and joined Saddam Hussein. The last puppet Prime Minister of the Shah also escaped via Iraq and has not hidden his close ties with the regime of Saddam Hussein. Ever since the overthrow of the Shah  Iraq has been a staging-point for counter-revolutionary actions inside Iran. A steady stream of Saddam Hussein's agents has been entering Iran along with the counter-revolutionaries  they have committed acts of sabotage and murder along the borders and especially in the provinces of Khuzestan and Kurdistan.315.	The Baghdad authorities have openly praised those attacks in their official radio broadcasts and their State- controlled press. There are many documented instances in which Iraqi agents have been arrested inside Iran with weapons and explosive materials. The Baghdad authorities have also indulged in acts of terrorism against Iranian embassies in various parts of the world. In August 1980  for instance  the Austrian Government expelled an Iraqi diplomat who was involved in supplying explosives to terrorists trying to bomb the Iranian Embassy in Vienna. Still fresh in public memory is the Iraqi terrorists' takeover of the Iranian Embassy in London. That incident  in which innocent people were murdered  involved the provision of documents and safe passage to the terrorists by the Iraqi Embassy there 316.	We have repeatedly warned the international community that  following the triumph of the Islamic Revolution in Iran  domineering Powers are seeking to return to the Persian Gulf region. Our worries have been confirmed by events. There has been a drastic expansion of American naval presence in the Indian Ocean. The United States has attempted to secure military bases in the region and to establish rapid deployment forces for direct American intervention in the region 317.	Parallel with those actions Saddam Hussein started his hostile policies towards the Islamic Revolution of Iran. Iranian border positions were shelled and professional saboteurs were sent across the border into Iran to damage our oil installations and public utilities in the hope of weakening our national unity. They did not even hesitate to bomb a mosque while prayer was in session. As that did not work  40 000 Iraqi citizens accused of having Iranian ancestry were barbarically expelled. They were collected from everywhere  without prior warning  and taken by trucks to the border. There they were left in the desert in the most inhumane manner  without food  shelter or any of their personal belongings.318.	Imperialism and international Zionism have never stopped their attempts to destabilize Iran. Bomb explosions  assassinations  attempted coups dâEtat and commando missions all failed to shake the Islamic Republic. From the very first day attempts were made to organize counter-revolution in Iran as well.319.	The Iraqi authorities have actively supported those imperialist games  and their actions can be understood only against this background. They began their expansionist drive by sending in insurgents. The arms they smuggled into Iran were confiscated in the thousands by the people and authorities of my country. Their support for the imperialists escalated and culminated in the sending of regular armed forces into Iran. Infiltration by infantry which began in April 1980 was gradually replaced by artillery and tank attacks. These attacks became a daily feature as Iraq built up its forces at the border.320.	Parallel with those armed interferences in Iran  the Iraqi Government was involved in a political plan as well which included hosting the so-called political opponents of the Islamic Republic and giving them radio transmission facilities. They even invented their own names for cities and places in my country  clearly showing they are out to grab as much as they can.321.	On 11 August 1980  for instance  Iraqi forces attacked Makuman  only to be beaten back. On 15 August  Iraqi artillery fired for four hours at Kamarun  in south-western Iran. On 17 August  there was an Iraqi artillery attack on Palerashi. On 19 August  Iraqi agents were caught smuggling machine-guns into the Abadan area. On 20 August  Iraqi attacks on Qasr-e-Shirin and Golkhaneh were repelled. I could go on giving instances. On 17 August  for instance  Iran repelled a big Iraqi attack which was supported by artillery. On 1 September  46 Iraqi troops lost their lives when their attack on Qasr-e-Shirin was repelled. There were heavy artillery and tank attacks on 3 and 4 September at Qasr-e-Shirin  Nasrabad and Kalantari. On 7 September  Iraq attacked in the Qasr-e-Shirin area with MIGS and helicopters. Thereafter air attacks became a regular feature of Iraqi intrusion into Iran. Iraq thus grad- rally escalated its attacks on Iran. This escalation had nothing to do with any perceived Iraqi grievances regarding the 1975 Treaty signed following the Algiers Agreement of March 1975  and came much before any complaints that Iraq claims to have made to Iran.322.	After having concentrated an armed force on the Iranian border  Iraq unilaterally abrogated the Iran-Iraq Treaty of 1975 on 17 September of this year. Saddam Hussein declared on that day in person that Iraq would use all means to reach its so-called ""just frontiers"". This statement is reminiscent of the aspirations of one other than Adolf Hitler concerning Czechoslovakia and Austria  and also resembles the statements of Israeli leaders when they talk about their boundaries. The Iraqi Government also used the Nazi method in its justification of the unilateral abrogation of the 1975 Treaty. Hitler used to enjoy sending diplomatic notes to nations that were to be his victims. When they replied he would reject the reply and launch an armed attack. Then Goebbels would come in and use the big lie technique. The policy of escalation has culminated in the Iraqi blitzkrieg against Iran in the same way. But the enemy has so far only captured the city of Khurramshahr  and that only in fictitious claims  seven in number. Its attempt to destroy the Iranian air force on the groundâa pitiful copy of Israeli tacticsâhas ended in failure.323.	Both the Iraqi blitzkrieg and the Iraqi air attacks have failed. As a result  on the one hand Saddam Hussein hypocritically called for a cease-fire so that he could bring up reinforcements and on the other hand he carried out indiscriminate bombing of civilians in Iran.324.	Saddam Hussein claims that his aggression has something to do with what he calls the non-implementation of the 1975 Treaty. His claim is utterly baseless. The Treaty of 1975  which he himself negotiated  contains an article that clearly specifies the methods by which all differences concerning the enforcement of the Treaty should be resolved. In any case  let us see what the Treaty calls for in case of non-implementation and let us see if Saddam Hussein even considered the relevant text of the Treaty. Here is the text of article 6 of the Treaty relating to provisions for resolving differences over the Treaty.""1. In the event of a dispute regarding the interpretation or implementation of this Treaty  the three Protocols or the annexes thereto  any solution to such a dispute shall strictly respect the course of the Iraqi-Iranian frontier referred to in articles 1 and 2 above  and shall take into account the need to maintain security on the Iraqi- Iranian frontier in accordance with article 3 above.""Members can see how well they maintained their respect for borders.""2. Such disputes shall be resolved in the first instance by the High Contracting Parties  by means of direct bilateral negotiations to be held within two months after the date on which one of the Parties so requested.""3. If no agreement is reached  the High Contracting Parties shall have recourse  within a three-month period  to the good offices of a friendly third State.""4. Should one of the two Parties refuse to have recourse to good offices or should the good offices procedure fail  the dispute shall be settled by arbitration within a period of not more than one month after the date of such refusal or failure.""Members can see how all these steps have been forgotten.""5. Should the High Contracting Parties disagree as to the arbitration procedure  one of the High Contracting Parties may have recourse  within 15 days after such disagreement was recorded  to a court of arbitration.""With a view to establishing such court of arbitration each of the High Contracting Parties shall  in respect of each dispute to be resolved  appoint one of its nationals as arbitrators and the two arbitrators shall choose an umpire. Should the High Contracting Parties fail to appoint their arbitrators within one month after the date on which one of the Parties received a request for arbitration from the other Party  or should the arbitrators fail to reach agreement on the choice of the umpire before that time-limit expires  the High Contracting Party which requested arbitration shall be entitled to request the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint the arbitrators or the umpire  in accordance with the procedures of the Permanent Court of Arbitration.""6. The decision of the court of arbitration shall be binding on and enforceable by the High Contracting Parties.""7. The High Contracting Parties shall each defray half the costs of arbitration.325.	It is clear that Saddam Hussein resorted to war not in response to a breach of the Treaty by Iran but in quest of glory and empire. His adventure in launching this war will prove vain. Saddam Hussein named it the ""Qadesiya of Saddam'. It will be known by future generations as Saddam's battle of elephants. I refer here to a chapter in the Koran known to all who are familiar with Islamic history. His attack on the Iranian people with modern armour will collapse  just as surely as did the attack of Abraha Ashram with his elephants on Mecca.326.	It is an undeniable fact that both parties concluded the 1975 Treaty negotiations without registering any complaints. On the contrary  they had nothing but praise for each other and for their achievement.327.	The present President and Foreign Minister of Iraq were in full control of their faculties when they negotiated and signed the Treaty and had it ratified by their Governments. When we review their statements at the time of the signing it is evident that they expressed joy and thanks with no words that would point to the Treaty's having been imposed on them.328.	The Iraqi claims are not only contrary to the rules governing international treaties and accepted declarations but are based on an agreement which was colonial in nature. This is a heritage that both the Iranian and Iraqi peoples have rejectedâa heritage of British colonial dominance over our region  after the defeat and collapse of Ottoman rule  whereby Iraqi sovereignty was overridden by the British.329.	The Treaty not only gave Iraq the security that it was seeking on its north-eastern frontiers but also a considerable amount of territory. The Treaty also settled the dispute over the common navigable river between the two countries which is known as the Shatt-al-Arab by dividing sovereignty over the river according to the line. This in fact ended a colonial heritage which was flagrantly in violation of common international practice concerning shared sovereignty of boundary rivers and which was deliberately created by the dominant colonial Power in the area in 1913 with the purpose of leaving a potential cause of conflict to be used when appropriate to further its age-old colonial policy of ""divide and rule"".330.	Saddam Hussein's recourse to aggressive war in order to settle a border dispute is thus not only in contradiction of the Charter of the United Nations  the charter of the Islamic Conference and the principles of non-alignment but also of the provisions of the Treaty itself.331.	The Islamic revolution in Iran and the downfall of the Shah shattered the classic vision of power in the Middle East and upset the division of the world by the super-Powers into zones of influence. That development was a great threat to the super-Powers  in particular the United States. The Iranian revolution led the United States to lose a loyal gendarme in one of the most sensitive regions of the world bordering on the territory of the other super-Power  namely the Soviet Union. The Shah's regime  which was imposed on the Iranian people  had the duty of safeguarding the interests of imperialism.332.	After the downfall of the ex-Shah  the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran opposed having anyone  whether local or foreign  act as a policeman for the region and declared that the security of the area had to be safe-guarded by the countries of the region 333.	From the outset the United States has tried to sabotage the policy in order to preserve its control of the area. The United States has opted for the emergence of another policeman in the region to replace the Shah. Imperialism did not need to look far. The regime of Saddam Hussein was well suited to the job  for  like that of the Shah  it is based on oppression. But there was one catch: geography prevents Iraq from controlling the Persian Gulf effectively unless it expands its borders. It was to overcome that obstacle that Saddam Hussein launched his military aggression against the territorial integrity of my country  The aims of that aggression are to take total control of the strategic waterway that links Iraq to the Persian Gulf and to establish a buffer zone between the two countries in the province of Khuzestan.334.	But Saddam Hussein overlooked another obstacle: the Iranian people in defence of Islam. Iran and Ingilabâthe revolutionâwill block and reverse all attacks upon Iranian sovereignty and territorial integrity. In doing so they have the support of all the peoples of the region.335.	The Government of Iraq  in order to weaken the obstacle of Islamic revolutionary consciousness  seeks to distort the character of this war. This war is not one between Arabs and Persians  nor between Iraq and Iran. It is a struggle between imperialism and its agent and gendarme- Saddam Husseinâon the one side  and the people  both Iranian and Iraqi  Persian and Arab  on the other. Saddam Hussein and his clique from Tikrit are the enemy of Islam  of the Arab nation  of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries [OPEC] and of the non-aligned. They are destined not for fame and glory but for infamy and shame.336.	After the fall of the ex-Shah a new phenomenon was born in the region  Not only did it not fit into the network of super-Power agreements or shoulder the burden of guarding their interests  but it also became a serious and attractive alternative for the oppressed masses of the world. It was to be expected that international imperialism would not accept the existence of the Islamic Republic of Iran and would use all efforts to destroy it.337.	At the outset the counter-attack of imperialism against the Islamic Republic took the form of attempts at coup dâEtat. That failed. The plan of economic boycott and the freezing of Iran's assets was then used in the hope of creating the proper environment for later coups. Then the United States launched a military attack in Tabas. It failed. Alongside those attempts  imperialism tried to exploit the just aspirations of Iranian minorities. That failed too. Residues of the Shah's regime tried to create chaos and insecurity in Iranian towns  hoping that the central Government would become so weak as to make changing the regime possible. Imperialism failed again.338.	Now imperialism is using a new weaponâSaddam Hussein. Having learned nothing from their previous failures  they calculated that within 48 hours the Iranian army would be destroyed  Saddam Hussein would triumph and the Iranian masses would scatter in confusion.339.	Once again imperialism faces defeat. The Iranian people have stood firm. They have rallied together and behind their Government and their leader. National unity has not been shattered but consolidated. The will to resist has not been bent but turned into a solid rock  The army has not been demoralized but revitalized. The common people have entered into furious battle with the enemy  fighting once again with little more than their bare hands. The Iranian people have demonstrated that a united people will never be defeated. An oppressed nation has shown that imperialism can be checked. Islam has shown itself to be a real and vital force against which arms and armour are powerless. The Iranian people have shown that Iran is eternal. Once more they have shaken the despots of the world. The heroic resistance of the Iranian people and their capacity to risk martyrdom in the face of tyranny and coercion has transformed the dream of imperialism and Saddam Hussein into their nightmare. As never before  the enemies of God and humanity are haunted by a spectreâ The spectre of Islamic revolution. King and President have joined hands in an unholy alliance to crush us. Now they must reckon that they will themselves come crashing down if the aggression is not checked.340.	In calling upon the world community to condemn the aggressor  I ask the Assembly to view the actions of the Iraqi Government in the context of the accepted definition of aggression contained in the annex to General Assembly resolution 3314 (XXIX) 341.	It is not only the armed aggression against my country that is most worthy of condemnation but the barbaric method of destruction which is being used against our cities and my people.342.	Iraqi artillery and ground-to-ground missiles are being indiscriminately and deliberately fired at residential areas  hospitals and schools. Saddam Hussein is using the infamous pacification method used against civilians by the Nazis in the Second World War  by the Americans in Viet Nam and by the Israelis in Palestine in order to force our people to desert their towns and villages. Two nights ago ground-to-ground missiles destroyed a great section of the city of Dizful around midnight while people were asleep. The aggressor  in its desperation  is fighting a dirty war of unprecedented cruelty and devastation. Our policy has been set by our leader. Imam Khomeini  who has declared:""According to our Islamic beliefs we are always against war and destruction. We desire peace among all nations. However  if a war is imposed on us or we are attacked by an enemy  we shall be obliged to confront the attacker with all our ability and with all our able-bodied men. This will remain the case even if our enemy is enjoying the full support of the super-Powers. A basic reason for such a reaction from the followers of Islam is that we consider martyrdom a great blessing from God and this is exactly the case with our Moslem nation. The murderous puppet regime of Baghdad is attacking our civilians. In Dizful last night they fired rockets at innocent people in their sleep and killed many of them  but we shall never commit such an act. Our forces will only attack military positions and we are certain that we shall be the final winner as the masses arc backing us.""343.	We hold the aggressor fully responsible for the billions of dollars of material losses that have been inflicted upon the industrial installations  residential towns  harbours  roads and other possessions of our people; for the rendering homeless of thousands of civilians because of indiscriminate shelling; and for all the children who have lost their parents because of this barbarism.344.	We expect the human community to accept its responsibility in defending our people which has been subjected to a blatant act of aggression. We expect the international community to condemn the destruction of humanitarian and international values by the aggressor and to listen to the aspirations of our people after years of oppression.345.	The world knows that we did not start this war. We are victims of aggression and the aggressor is right now on our territory. It has been recommended to us to stop defending ourselves. The honour and credibility of our people and revolution dictate that as long as the aggressor is on our land the struggle must go on 346.	The Iraqi Government has stabbed us in the back at a time when we are confronting the forces of imperialism and Zionism. The Iraqi regime has taken a decision to annex some Iranian sections of the common Shatt-al-Arab waterway in the same way as Israel has declared its decision to annex the Holy City of Al-Quds al-Sharif. Saddam Hussein boasts of his commitments to Arab interests  so why does he not act against Israel which has been violating the interests of the Arab nation for 32 years? Instead he has directed all Iraq's armed forces against a country which has given most support to the Palestinian struggle. As a result it is the Zionist entity which stands to gain most. Saddam Hussein stands exposed; he is neither an Arab nor a Moslem  but a true ally of Israel and the super-Powers.347.	Iran stands for Islamic brotherhood and the unity of the oppressed. It has no quarrel with the Iraqi people. It makes no claim over Iraqi territory. But Iran cannot accept any cease-fire nor enter into any negotiations with the aggressor until it has pulled back from all the territories which it has occupied."
"68",3329,"IRQ",35,1980,"ï»¿On behalf of the Iraqi delegation  I should like to express to you  Mr. President  our congratulations on your election to the presidency of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. I am convinced that thanks to your wisdom and great competence  at this session the Assembly will achieve fruitful and constructive results.74.	I should also like to express our thanks and appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim  who carried out his duties with excellent ability and competence during the thirty-fourth session  as well as during the sixth and seventh emergency special sessions and the eleventh special session.75.	Iraq has been one of the staunchest adherents of the policy of non-alignment  which is based on the principles of non-interference in internal affairs  respect for the national sovereignty of all States and the preservation of peace and security in the world. In addition  our foreign policy does not tolerate any interference in the independence of Iraq and the Arab countries  or in our sovereignty  territorial integrity and internal affairs in any form  of any origin or on any pretext whatsoever. In adhering to these principles in its non-aligned foreign policy  Iraq proceeds from a profound need and a long national and pan-Arab experience in this regard.76.	Any disequilibrium in the bases of balance in State relations would certainly impair the rights and sovereignty of one side in favour of another. In order to avoid this phenomenon  which has often led to tension and crisis  it is imperative to found international co-operation on rules that aim at the achievement of common interests within the framework of respect for sovereignty and non-interference in internal affairs. That is particularly true in the case of neighbouring States because the geographical reality imposes upon them a policy of good-neighbourliness.77.	In its relations with Iran  Iraq has adhered firmly to that policy  which is based on a number of realities that arise from the historical and religious ties between the peoples of Iraq and Iran. Our policy has always been and still is favourable to any factor that strengthens the relations between the two countries  avoids the outbreak of crisis and takes account of common interests. In this connection  while Iraq has fully understood its international responsibility  at the same time it has not lost sight of its national sovereignty and pan-Arab duties as a part of the Arab nation.78.	The relations of Iraq with Iran have reached a grave crisis point because of the policies of successive regimes in Iran which have considered Iraq and the Arab homeland  particularly the Arab Gulf area  as a sphere for domination.79.	Those policies have been expressed in different forms appropriate to the particular exigencies of the time. During the rule of the Shah  arrogance  aggression  territorial expansion at the expense of others and attempts to harm Iraq's national sovereignty and the inalienable rights of the Arab nation were a constant pattern. Iraq and the Arab nation were regarded as a sphere of influence for the expansionist plans of Iranian interests. That policy has been followed throughout history by the ""Persian State"" against its neighbours.80.	When the revolution of 17 July 1968 took place in Iraq  Iraqi-Iranian relations experienced two rival phenomena. On the one hand  the Shah of Iran was being prepared  with great assistance from the West and in particular from the United States of America  to play the role of policeman in the region. On the other hand  the new regime in Iraq was struggling to build up a new society and for the consolidation of national independence.81.	Thus the Iranian regime found its policy of exerting pressure on others met with resistance from Iraq and it was consequently necessary to destabilize Iraq. This began with a propaganda campaign in various forms  which was escalated to a political crisis coupled with a consistent and continuous policy of interference in the internal affairs of Iraq  whether through the exportation of plots or the backing of rebellion.82.	The Shah at first began to consolidate Iran's territorial encroachments upon Iraq's land frontiers. Iranian border posts were pushed forward inside Iraqi territory and roads were opened between them in such a way as to include large areas of Iraqi lands inside Iran. All that was done with the support of military forces in order to impose those encroachments by force. Then the Shah began to demand changes in the frontier of the Shatt-al-Arab  contrary to the legal situation then prevailing. When that demand was met by Iraq's refusal  the Shah unilaterally terminated the Boundary Treaty of 1937. Then  in order to achieve his political aims and territorial demands  the Shah began to exert military pressure  directly and indirectly  thus abandoning the traditional means he had followed in the past to achieve his ambitions. He thought that by military means he could ensure the achievement of his expansionist aims and ambitions. So Iran committed its armed aggression against Iraqi border areas in central and southern Iraq in 1974  regarding which Iraq brought a complaint against Iran before the Security Council. A more dangerous step was exemplified by the broad co-operation which the Shah initiated with the reactionary secessionist rebellion in northern Iraq. He began to exercise a direct role in the field in order to dismember Iraq.83.	The Shah's support for the secessionist rebellion was limitless. He provided the reactionary leadership of the rebellion with huge quantities of modern and sophisticated armaments and put at its disposal all kinds of facilitiesâ material  military and political  including the services of his advanced information system. In that respect  the Shah was like Israel  whose Prime Minister declared on 29 September 1980  as reported in The New York Times of the same day  that it had provided Barzani with weapons  equipment and instructors and provided the rebels with training from 1965 to 1975. Iraq  with its devoted sons from all sects  religions and national minorities  fought a vicious conflict against that agent clique and those who stood behind it. We were inspired by the honour of Iraq and the duty to defend the unity of our homeland. Our people made all the sacrifices required by the battle.84.	The military situation reached a dangerous point when the Shah advanced his military forces on numerous occasions to fight directly against our forces on various fronts with a view to supporting the military position of the agent rebellion. The situation reached a more dangerous level in relation to Iraq's capability when we were surprised by the October war of 1973  in which Iraq had inevitably to participate in consonance with its pan-Arab position and responsibilities.85.	In 1975  however  when the late President of Algeria  Houari Boumediene  took the initiative of communicating with Iraq and Iran and suggesting direct negotiations between them in Algiers regarding all their differences  Iraq agreed to that initiative in the interests of preserving Iraq's security and national unity. Those negotiations met with success and resulted in the conclusion on 6 March 1975 of the Algiers Agreement  which represented a settlement. The political and juridical aspects were balanced in the agreement in a manner that made the impairment of any element thereof a violation of that balance and a reason for the total failure of the agreement. That was explicitly provided in paragraph 4 of the Agreement.86.	What follows logically from that Agreement is that in implementing it the two parties should have achieved the balanced gains that they had agreed upon. But what happened in fact was that Iran achieved a direct and instant gain as soon as the Algiers Agreement entered into force. Iran's position on the Shatt-al-Arab became that of a partner in sovereignty over a large part of the river on the basis of the new delimitation of the frontier line therein on the basis of the thalweg. As against that  Iran agreed to give up the Iraqi lands which it had previously encroached upon and to stop its support for the secessionist Barzani.87.	Then  the new regime in Iran came to power. Iraq saw that event as a welcome sign  because it ended a regime whose policies were based on aggression and interference in the internal affairs of others and in particular of Iraq and the Arab homeland.88.	Iraq presented through its President its felicitations to the Iranian peoples  expressing the hope that the new republican regime would work actively for the maintenance of Iran's role in the service of peace and justice in the world and the forging of the strongest relations of friendship and good-neighbourliness with the Arab countries in general and with Iraq in particular. When the new regime in Iran announced its willingness to have Iran join the non-aligned movement  Iraq was the first country to bless that move and declared its welcome to and support for Iran's application to the membership of the movement.89.	Iraq pursued all possible avenues with genuine good will to establish relations with the new regime in Iran with a view to achieving fruitful co-operation in all fields. Iraq expressed this sincere intention through Iraqi official statements and through diplomatic channels.90.	But the actual state of affairs indicated that the sincere effort that Iraq was making was being met by contrary intentions which did not preserve the basis that permitted the two countries to establish good and fruitful relations. Moreover  the relations between the two countries were marred by an intentional act on the part of the new authorities in Iran  which aimed at the disruption of the existing relations between the two countries and which dangerously aggravated the situation. It was later established that the new regime in Iran had been harbouring those contrary intentions since the first days of its assumption of power. The Iranian regime recalled to Iran from the United States the leaders of the rebel faction of Barzani  his sons and followers. After the death of Barzani his sons and followers returned to Iran  where they were granted refuge  assistance and permission to use Iranian territory as a base of operations for threatening Iraq and interfering with its internal security and national integrity.91.	Moreover  the Iranian Government has never ceased harming the good-neighbourly relations between the two countries. It facilitated acts of infiltration of a subversive nature. In many Iraqi towns  acts of murder  sabotage and poisoning of water and fishery resources were committed with the support of the Iranian Government. The situation was not limited to such activity. The Iranian acts went further to instigate trouble  sectarian and religious dissension and the commission of acts of plunder in the border areas by groups called ""revolutionary guards"".92.	It is worth emphasizing that the Government of Iraq addressed numerous diplomatic notes to the Iranian Government through its embassy at Baghdad. In those notes  all the Iranian violations regarding the matters I have mentioned were clearly stated. In order to give an idea of the number of those violations  we have distributed to the delegations of Member States a brief account of a sample of the violations and a map indicating Iranian encroachments on our land frontiersâfrontiers that were delimited clearly and drawn jointly on the new maps by the two parties  and re-demarcated on the land by building anew the old frontier pillars of 1913  which number 126  and the new additional pillars  which number 593  established in 1975. We shall also distribute a detailed study with maps on the evolution of the legal regime of the Iraqi-Iranian frontier since 1520.93.	What I should like to mention now as an example is that during the period from June to September 1980  Iran committed 187 violations and military actions across the Iraqi frontiers against populated cities and villages  roads and border posts.94.	On 4 September 1980 a dangerous turning point in the chain of those violations occurred. The Iranian military forces used American-made heavy artillery of 175 mm. calibre to bombard the towns of Khanaqin and Mendili  causing thereby severe loss of life and damage to property. It is worth mentioning that that concentrated savage bombardment was carried out from the area of Zain Al Qaws which is situated between frontier pillars 46 and 51 deep inside Iraq's territory.95.	At noon on 7 September 1980  there was again the same savage bombardment. We called the charge d'affaires of the Iranian Embassy at Baghdad to the Foreign Ministry on that date and delivered a note to him. In it we stated that Iranian military units had encroached upon numerous areas of Iraqi territory as was the case  among others  in Zain Al Qaws  and that those encroachments had continued  contrary to the Frontier Treaty of 1975 between the two countries. We requested him to convey to his Government that it should immediately end those encroachments. But the Iranian forces continued their bombardments until nightfall of that day. On the following day  8 September 1980  the Iranian charge d'affaires was again called in to the Foreign Ministry and we handed him another note. In that note we stated that the Iraqi military forces  in the exercise of our legitimate right to self-defence  were forced to end the Iranian occupation of Zain Al Qaws and regain the occupied Iraqi territories.96.	In the note  the Government of the Republic of Iraq also expressed its hope that the Iranians would learn from that event and give back the Iraqi lands which Iran had encroached upon in previous times  as was agreed upon in the 1975 Treaty hence avoiding the possibility of wider confrontation between the two countries. But the following days witnessed concentrated military activities by the Iranian military forces inside the Iraqi territories that had been encroached upon. My Government found it necessary once again to call in the Iranian charge d'affaires to the Foreign Ministry on 11 September 1980. He was handed a detailed note this time stating three points.97.	First  from our observation of Iranian conduct and reactions  we had reached various conclusions the first of which was that  because of the confusion in Iran and the disordered structure and information sources of the Iranian State  the Iranian leadership might not have been aware of the fact that Iran had encroached upon Iraqi territories in contravention of international law and past agreements between the two countries  including the Algiers Agreement of 1975. If this was so  we advised the Iranian leadership to ask the Iranian authorities responsible for matters of frontiers and agreements in order to ascertain our point of view and thus base its action on knowledge rather than myth.98.	Secondly  the Iranian leadership had to realize that striking at cities populated by civilians  as it did in bombarding Khanaqin and Mendili  was neither a simple matter nor a game of violence of the sort with which the Iranian officials entertain themselves at times inside Iran. Striking at Iraqi cities is considered a grave matter which should be avoided by Iran  if it does not wish relations between the two countries to deteriorate dangerously. The rulers of Iran alone will bear the responsibility of those aggressive actions before God  the Iranian people and world public opinion.99.	Thirdly  Iraq has no ambition with regard to Iranian territories.100.	But all those diplomatic notes went unheeded  as we received no response to them.101.	In view of the continual Iranian violations of the Algiers Agreement of 1975 and the insistence upon the justification for those violations  which was made clear by the announcements of official Iranian circles to the effect that the Agreement was suspect  that did not meet Iran's interests and that Iran did not consider itself bound by it  it was established by the Government that the Iranian Government had violated the elements of the comprehensive settlement contained in the Algiers Agreement and that it had terminated it. Consequently  the Government of the Republic of Iraq decided to consider the Agreement and those following and based upon it as terminated on the part of Iraq after Iran had terminated them by word and deed. This was done in accordance with paragraph 4 of the Algiers Agreement and article 4 of the Treaty on International Borders and Good-Neighbourly Relations of 1975  which was based on the Algiers Agreement. On that occasion Iraq called upon the Iranian authorities to accept the new situation and act rationally and wisely in view of the exercise by Iraq of its legitimate rights and full sovereignty in all its land territories and fluvial territory in Shatt-al-Arab  as was the case before the Algiers Agreement.102.	The Government of the Republic of Iraq was forced to take the measures I have just indicated since the ruling authorities in Iran persisted in gravely violating their inter-national obligations. Having exhausted all the peaceful means of persuading Iran to heed its obligations  my Government was left with only one choice  namely  the exercise of self-defence for the purpose of restoring Iraq's sovereignty over the totality of its territory.103.	Despite the fact that my Government had declared through its highest officials that it did not wish to have any war with Iran  that it did not want to extend the conflict beyond the limits of the restoration of Iraq's legitimate rights of territorial sovereignty  and that Iraq did not have any territorial ambitions in Iran  the Iranian Government nevertheless escalated the conflict. On 19 September it began to bombard with heavy artillery and bomber planes densely populated areas in Iraq  vital economic establishments  Iraqi and foreign incoming and outgoing vessels in the Shatt-al-Arab and the navigational channels in the river  as well as its approaches in the Arab Gulf.104.	In the face of these savage acts  my Government issued a statement warning the ruling authorities in Iran of the consequences of that escalation and the indiscriminate strikes which they had committed  putting the full responsibility upon those authorities. My Government also explained in that statement that the acts committed by Iran made it necessary to direct preventive strikes against Iranian military targets inside Iran with a view to protecting the safety  security and vital interests of Iraq. Thus  once again  Iraq was forced to exercise its right to preventive self-defence in accordance with international law  in order to repel aggression.105.	The existing Iraqi-Iranian armed conflict on which the eyes of the whole world are focused represents  as I have shown  an in dissociable component of an established Iranian policy. That policy has been practised by different Iranian Governments throughout history  irrespective of their declared intentions  against Iraq and the Arab nation. What I have shown the General Assembly of the developments that led to this conflict is fully corroborated by the statements of the various Iranian officials. We have already had occasion to reply to those statements in our letters  which have been distributed as documents of the General Assembly and the Security Council. If the ruling authorities in Iran do not really intend to expand at the expense of Arab national interests and if they honestly stand for the defence of those interests against the Zionist enemy  then we are entitled to wonder about the reasons for their retention of the three Arab islands  Abu Moussa  the Greater Tunb and the Lesser Tunb  which Iran occupied in the time of the Shah.106.	In addition  if the Iranian Government really intends to co-operate fruitfully with its neighbours through the establishment of friendly and good-neighbourly relations  then why has it not fulfilled its obligations towards Iraq and the Arab nation  when all in the Arab world gave their blessing to the Iranian revolution when it occurred?107.	Iraq would like to emphasize from this rostrum a number of points previously declared by us on numerous occasions. First  Iraq is not responsible for the armed conflict with Iran to which past events have led; rather  it is the ruling authorities in Iran who bear the full responsibility. Secondly  Iraq is defending its legitimate right to sovereignty  honour and dignity  and is ready to make all the necessary sacrifices to defend those rights. Thirdly  Iran must realize that we shall not sacrifice the rights and interests of Iraq and the Arab nation as a whole. We shall oppose any attempt to interfere in our internal affairs  sovereignty and pan-Arab interests. Fourthly  Iraq realizes fully the importance of preserving international peace and security and world economic interests  in particular those relating to the flow of oil. We shall do all we can to prevent the ruling authorities in Iran from adversely affecting those interests. Fifthly  Iraq has expressed recently in the Security Council and through President Saddam Hussein in his letter addressed to the Secretary-General on 29 September 1980 its readiness to halt the hostilities immediately if the other side will undertake to do the same and to resort to negotiations  directly or through a third party or an international body or organization  in order to find an equitable and honourable solution.108.	Moreover  Iraq expressed  as stated again by President Saddam Hussein through President Mohammad Ziaul-Haq of Pakistan during the meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Islamic Conference  held in New York on 1 October 1980  its readiness to declare a cease-fire unilaterally from 5 to 8 October 1980 in order to create the best conditions for the noble efforts aimed at stopping bloodshed  achieving peace and stressing the humanitarian and legitimate content of Iraqi and Arab rights.109.	Finally  I should like to end my statement by quoting what the President of our Republic said in his comprehensive speech on 27 September 1980.""We are not of those who are tempted by power and who lose their senses in victory and impose illegitimate conditions on others  even if they are aggressors with evil intentions. We do not impose illegitimate conditions  nor do we have any ambitions. We establish clear and noble principles: the principles of right  goodness and peace before the Iranian peoples  the countries of the region  the Arab nation and the world as a whole. What we demand is the clear  legal and actual recognition by the Iranian Government of Iraq's historic and legitimate rights over its lands and waters  the adherence by it to the policy of good-neighbourliness  the renunciation of its racist  aggressive and expansionist attitudes and its evil attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of the countries of the region and the return of every inch of the homeland which it has usurped. The Iranian Government should look upon its rights  as well as those of the Arabs and Iraqis  on these bases and it should respect international law and custom  as well as international covenants."""
"69",3376,"ISL",35,1980,"ï»¿It gives me great pleasure  Sir  to join my colleagues who have congratulated you on your election as President of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. I am confident that your wisdom and experience will stand you in good stead in your search for solutions of the many problems which this General Assembly will discuss.2.	Allow me also to join in the welcome to the new Members of our Organization  Zimbabwe and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.3.	It is a special pleasure for me to have this opportunity to address the General Assembly. In 1946 I was a member of the Icelandic delegation to the second part of the first session of the General Assembly here in New York  when Iceland was admitted as a Member of the Organization. There was optimism in the air then. No doubt the most optimistic idealists have been disappointed. They have not seen all their hopes realized. But the words and deeds of visionaries often bring results  although they themselves do not live long enough to see those results. Ideals can have wings to fly into the future and across borders.4.	When we look at the progress of the United Nations  which in the beginning raised such high hopes  we see both a bright and a dark side and many changing shapes. For more than a third of a century the United Nations has successfully accomplished a great deal for the good of all mankind. However  we are obliged to note that a number of the items of the agenda of the first session of the General Assembly  held in 1946  are still under discussion 34 years later. That shows us that  even with the greatest of effort  there are often many difficulties to be overcome before attaining a goal.5.	However  we also have in this Assembly hall evidence of the great changes in international society which have taken place in this short period in the history of the world. Since I first attended the Assembly session in 1946  the membership has tripled  and by far the greatest number of new Members are former colonies which have now become full participants in the community of nations.6.	Unfortunately  it is not overstating the case to say that the atmosphere in East West relations has deteriorated since the conclusion of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly. This turn of events  along with other occurrences on the world scene  now throws new shadows on the development of international relations.7.	The situation in Afghanistan stands out and casts the darkest shadow. A vast majority of the nations represented in this distinguished body strongly deplored the armed intervention in Afghanistan in a resolution adopted in January of this year by the sixth emergency special session. That resolution clearly states that respect for the sovereignty  territorial integrity and political independence of all States is a fundamental principle of the Charter of our Organization. A violation of this principle on any pretext is contrary to the aims and purposes of the Charter. Therefore  all foreign troops should be withdrawn from Afghanistan immediately and unconditionally.8.	Now  more than eight months after that resolution was adopted by the General Assembly  nothing has so far been done to comply with it. Consequently  I consider it my duty as a representative of a small nation State  which puts its trust in full respect for the principles of the Charter of the United Nations  to remind the Assembly here and now of the provisions of the resolution passed at the sixth emergency special session. It is necessary to start implementing them without delay.9.	This situation in Afghanistan which I have referred to has  in my opinion  been the major cause of cooler relations and increased tension between East and West  although other events have no doubt also had their influence.10.	The policy of detente in Europe  which had its origin in the latter part of the 1960s and was formalized by the Final Act of Helsinki  has certainly taken a step backward. Nevertheless  I am of the opinion that there is .no acceptable alternative to detente. If international peace and security are to be maintained  we have to continue to work towards reducing tension. Technical development in communications and armaments increases the danger of a cold war turning into a nuclear holocaust  and then nobody would be safe  anywhere in the world. Therefore  although I have discussed relations between only a small part of the nations represented here  this matter concerns each and every human being.11.	Relations between the superpowers and their actions on the world scene have truly tremendous influence on the development of all international matters. However  we should not forget that the small nations also carry a heavy responsibility in the world. By their firm policy they can have decisive influence on both the fortunes and the future of mankind. In our Charter and other fundamental documents  such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  we find the most important basic principles  which every State has to carry out both internally and externally  if we aim sincerely at the prosperity and progress of all mankind. Unfortunately  we have in many instances made regrettably little headway towards actual implementation of the policies we decided upon. However  this does not mean that we should give up. On the contrary  this performance should incite us to work harder at promoting our policies and advancing towards our goals.12.	As I just mentioned  the situation in international affairs is now more serious than it has been for a number of years. This fact is reflected in particular in the field of disarmament. Experience has showed us that mutual trust is the basis for successful agreements in these important and delicate matters. It is therefore today our urgent and pressing task to try to re-establish this mutual trust. In order to do so  all parties concerned have to show by word and deed their will to respect the basic principles which we agreed upon in the Charter of the United Nations.13.	A few days ago there was convened at Madrid the preparatory meeting of the second review session of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. It is of the greatest importance that that session of the Conference succeed in reawakening as much as possible the cooperative will and trust which was originally the basis for the Helsinki Final Act. Here  I should like to express my hope that all participants in the Conference at Madrid try earnestly to regain what has been lost recently and prove their good intentions by making an extra effort.14.	One of the most serious problems our Organization has to deal with is the situation in the Middle East. I do not intend to discuss these grave issues in detail or analyse their causes. I should only like to stress that the Middle East conflict has to be resolved as soon as possible. A comprehensive peace settlement has to be found on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). Peace in the Middle East requires that both the right of Israel to exist within secure and recognized boundaries and the national rights of the Palestinians be accepted and respected by all parties concerned. In accordance with the rights of the Palestinians to self-determination  they must participate in the negotiations on a lasting and just solution.15.	The North South disparity  or rather the broad and widening gap between rich and poor nations of the world  constitutes another set of problems with which our Organization has been dealing  most recently at the eleventh special session  just concluded. Unfortunately  in spite of the intensive search for agreements at the special sessions on international economic relations  progress has been slow. It remains  therefore  a primary task of the United Nations to achieve realistic agreements on international economic: issues which would improve greatly the standard of living of the low-income nations. A major effort in this matter is necessary  not only to eradicate the shameful situation where a large number of the people of the world live in dire poverty and hunger but also to prevent the danger of war which would otherwise result from this intolerable situation.16.	Respect for human rights is one of the fundamental principles of the nation I have the honour to represent. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted by the General Assembly almost a third of a century ago. It is. Therefore  regrettable to have to say that the civil liberties and fundamental freedoms of the individual are being trampled on in the world today. This dismal situation has to be corrected. Each and every State represented here in the General Assembly is morally bound to do its utmost to make the Universal Declaration of Human Rights the guiding principle in its relations with individuals 17.	When I mention here the increasing use of violence and lack of respect for life and liberty  I come inevitably to a related matter. I refer to the shocking increase in acts of violence directed against embassies and consulates and their staff. Only last year  no fewer than 20 such violent acts were committed  and obviously the attack on the United States Embassy at Teheran and the seizure of the hostages constitute the most serious case in question. On account of these developments  the Nordic countries requested that a new item be inscribed in the agenda of this session of the General Assembly entitled ""Consideration of effective measures to enhance the protection  security and safety of diplomatic and consular missions and representatives."" I should like to express the hope that the deliberations of the General Assembly under this new item will result in increased confidence that diplomatic and consular relations  a fundamental requirement for the normal functioning of the international community  will not break down when most needed.18.	Before concluding  I should like to refer to one matter which Iceland considers among the most important tasks undertaken by the United Nations: the preparation of a treaty on the law of the sea. After seven years of conference work and extensive preparations prior to the Conference  it now appears that agreement is possible on a comprehensive treaty on the law of the sea. If this convention becomes a reality it will be one of the greatest achievements of the United Nations since its beginning. It will be a shining example of what our Organization can accomplish if the will is there."
"70",3423,"ISR",35,1980,"ï»¿Mr. President  at the outset I should like to express to you our congratulations on your election to the high office of President of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. Your vast experience and the outstanding qualities that you have exhibited in the realm of multilateral diplomacy ensure your ability to keep a firm grasp on the helm of the Assembly during this stormy period.53.	Al the opening of this session a new State joined the ranks of the United Nations: Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. On behalf of the Government and people of Israel  I should like to welcome it to the Organization and wish it all prosperity and success as an independent and sovereign Stale.54 	To my very grout regret  it is not possible to express satisfaction at the condition of the United Nations today  cither in general or from the specific perspective of my country. Indeed  it is questionable whether there remains much similarity or correlation between the noble ideals  principles and purposes which guided the founding fathers of the United Nations and the reality prevailing in the Organization today. The founders of this Organization saw in their vision a forum and a framework for the achievement and maintenance of peace between nations after the horrific experience of the Second World War  a horror which they had experienced at first hand.55.	Perhaps the most cynical expression of the gap between the original vision and the reality prevailing in the United Nations today has been the refusal of this Organization  ostensibly dedicated to the peaceful settlement of disputes  to adopt and encourage the Camp David accords' and the subsequent Peace Treaty  which brought to an end decades of hostilities between Israel and Egypt and raised the possibility of expanding the peace process to embrace all of Israel's neighbours. This Organization  whose principal purpose is the promotion of peace among nations  has thus betrayed its own raison d'etre by rejecting an historic step towards peace and by playing into the hands of the enemies of peace  the rejectionists and the warmongers.56. This unhappy phenomenon is not confined to the General Assembly. Out of the 18 debates which have been conducted thus far during 1980 in the Security Council  nine were devoted to subjects involving my country. Is there anyone who seriously believes that half of the world's international problems today are connected with Israel? We need only glance at a map of our region  the Middle Eastâwhich is just one region of the worldâto sec that it is riddled from length to breadth with countless conflicts between States  between ethnic minorities and between different religious groups. Virtually all those conflicts have a history and a dynamic of their own  totally divorced from the Arab-Israeli conflict.57. By way of illustration. I need only mention the situation in Afghanistan and. of course  the full-scale war between Iran and Iraqâa worrying outbreak of hostilities which has wide-ranging implications. That war between two States ruled by extremist  irresponsible and trigger-happy regimes threatens both regional and international security by putting at risk much of the world's regular supply of oil  That war  a struggle between two Moslem States  demolishes  in our opinion  the naive and groundless belief that the world's oil supply is dependent on a pro-Arab solution to the dispute between Israel and its neighbours. It has become all too clear that the solution of the Arab-Israeli conflict will not provide any miracle cure for the region as a whole or eliminate the many other grave conflicts raging in it. The ability of the United Nations to work for an end to the bloodshed in Iraq and Iran will be a yardstick of the Organization's ability to continue to fulfil its role for the encouragement and maintenance of peace.58.	Important tasks have been allotted to the United Nations. Besides its role in the preservation of international peace and security  it also has a vital role to play in other spheres which require our earnest attention  in particular through the specialized agencies established for various purposes. But even the specialized agencies have been gravely compromised by the plague of politicization. Business-like debates and deliberations in them have become increasingly difficultâif not all but impossible to conductâto the grave detriment not only of the agencies themselves but also of those whom they were set up to serve.59.	While I am bound to express deep regret at the condition of the United Nations today. I must also express the hope that all Members of the Organization which share our concern and feelings of responsibility for its future will intensify their efforts both to bring the United Nations back to the ideals of its founders and to channel the specialized agencies back to their specific areas of concern.60.	Among the subjects which have rightly been given a prominent place in the agenda of the United Nations are the state of the world's economy and the relations between the industrialized and the developing nations. The convening of the recent eleventh special session of the General Assembly attests to this fact. Israel took part in that special session with the intention of making a constructive contribution to its work. We therefore share the disappointment over the results of that event  which were not adequate. We sincerely hope that in the near future the efforts to have a constructive dialogue rather than confrontation will be resumed  so that those whose needs are greatest will not suffer the most.61.	Despite our small size and limited resources  we have for decades devoted far greater efforts than might have been expected to assisting nations of the third world in the development of their economies and societies. Israel has shared freely the know-how which it has developed  as well as its experience as a small State in an arid and subtropical region  which has enabled us to make great strides over a period of a few short years.62.	The problems encountered by Israel in the course of its social and economic development are similar to the problems facing much of the developing world today. Many of the solutions worked out in Israel can be applied directly by others. Despite the disappointments which my country has experienced  Israel continues to have deep sympathy for the struggle of the developing countries to ameliorate and advance the condition of their peoples and economies. Israel stands ready to continue to give of its know-how and to take a vigorous and constructive part in the efforts of the international community in the spheres of health  social services  agriculture  development of new and renewable sources of energy  and in every other sphere to which we can contribute.63.	From this rostrum I should like to give expression to the anguish of our Jewish brothers in various parts of the globe. There is. it would seem  no end to the pain of the Jew in history. The suffering and persecution continue even today. And we  the people of Israel  feel responsible for the lot of every Jew who suffers anywhere.64.	In the last year additional harsh limitations have been imposed on Jews who seek to leave the Soviet Union and emigrate to the State of Israel. Those restrictions conflict with the most basic human and national rights of peoples  and we are in duty bound to echo the cries of the Jews in the Soviet Union and appeal to the Government of that country to remove the restrictions and facilitate the immigration of Jews to Israel.65.	We must also express anxiety over the condition of the tortured Jewish community in Syria  whose human rights are severely curtailed  and many of whom have been imprisoned and have had their property impounded. I would thus also appeal to the Government of Syria to respect the basic-human rights of its Jewish community  which it holds as hostages and which it prevents from leaving.66.	The Jews of Iran have suffered painfully in recent months  and their situation is deteriorating from day to day. Many Jews have been thrown in gaol; others have been given the death sentence  in most cases on ""charges"" of contact with Israel. We know of the difficulties in dealing with the present regime in Iran  to which fundamental concepts of human rights and the norms of international relations seem foreign. But we hope that sight will not be lost of the situation of the Jews there who are perhaps among the most vulnerable of the minorities in that troubled land.67.	Two years ago a development took place in the Middle Eastâa breakthrough which can appropriately be called historic. After serious negotiations between the parties  with the active and important participation of the United States  the Camp David framework and the subsequent Israeli-Egyptian Peace Treaty were signed by the leaders of the two countries and witnessed by the President of the United States. Israel made major concessions and took considerable risks by signing those agreements  l.et me cite only our withdrawal from the oilfields in Sinai  for there is no need for me to waste words on the significance and implications of that step in this day and age. Similarly I need only point to the strategic depth in Sinai which Israel has relinquished  as well as to the advanced air bases located in Sinai  the evacuation of which will be implemented in due course in accordance with the terms of the Peace Treaty.68.	Israel believed that its concessions and sacrifices would be met with appreciation and understanding by the world community and that a long-awaited breakthrough would be achieved on the international scene. Not only has that not 06itte about  but many countries in the world have spared no effort to destroy that hard-won peace  and Israel continues to be the object of unending accusations and attacks.69.	Nevertheless  the decision and determination of Israel remain firm to continue on the road to peace. Thus  in accordance with the Camp David framework  negotiations have taken place for the attainment of full autonomy for the Palestinian Arab inhabitants of Judaea. Samaria and the Gaza District.70.	Substantial progress has been achieved in these talks in certain fields  but the talks have  it is true  had their tips and downs and have even been suspended a number of times by Egypt. There is nothing exceptional or extraordinary about the difficulties encountered thus far in the progress of the talks. They reflect the complexities inherent in the subjects under discussion. The difficulties are familiar to any country which  at one time or another  has been engaged in complex negotiations involving multifaceted and long-standing problems.71.	One area in which progress has been achieved in the negotiations is the modalities of the free elections to be held in the territories concerned. These procedures would make the proposed autonomy into one of the fewâall too fewâ examples of free democratic process in the Middle East. Progress has also been achieved in the area of powers and responsibilities of the autonomy covering many aspects of the everyday life of the inhabitants of the territories in question.72.	We certainly believe that autonomy can and must be established. All the parties to the Camp David framework are convinced that the process set out in that framework is the only one which is within the realm of the possible. All alternative suggestions for the solution of the problem at handâideas such as the holding of an international conference or the likeâare devoid of real prospect or purpose. No one can really believe that the various elements in the Middle East which arc so much at odds with each other would attend a peace conference and achieve a positive outcome that would lead to a solution acceptable to all. Thus too the ideas entertained by the European Community  which do not take Israel's position into account  are only likely to encourage those who are opposed to peace.73.	Those who genuinely seek peace should encourage the progress which has been achieved through the Camp David process. Let them also bear in mind and give due regard to the fact that  by proposing the idea of autonomy in Judaea  Samaria and the Gaza District  Israel has taken on itself great risks for the sake of peace.74.	We hope that the autonomy talks will be resumed in the near future. We also hope that the process of normalization of relations between Israel and Egypt will be intensified and will serve as the best possible proof and a living symbol of the fact that peace can and must take the place of war. The full significance of these peaceful relations should be grasped for what they areâand for what they may lead toâas the very corner-stone for peace in the region.75. The leaders of Israel and Egypt have reiterated time and again their mutual commitment to the proposition that there will be no more war. Let us hope that the change which has come about in the Middle East with the signing of peace will be the opening for a positive and long-lasting transformation in the history of our conflict-ridden area. The strict adherence to the agreements by Israel  in accordance with their letter and spirit alike  is a guarantee of the continuation of the peace process. However  by itself it is not enough. We hope that all the others involved will act in the same way.76. Much has been alleged against Israel in the name of the principle of self-determination for nations. We favour that concept  and we have proved that in the support that we extended to many States which have achieved their independence in our generation  in Africa  Asia and elsewhere. The Governments of those States and their peoples know that full well. But there is no connection between that principle and the perverted attempt to turn self-determination into the basis for the destruction of the Stale of Israel  as certain States are endeavouring to do. Anyone who is familiar with the ideology and the terminology of the murder organization that calls itself the PLO  as well as with the declarations of the various Arab rejectionist States  can see beyond all doubt that the term ""self-determination""  as they use it  is nothing more than a euphemism for the destruction of Israel.77.	It should not be forgotten that the Palestinian Arabs have achieved their self-determination in Jordan  a State which is the Arab State in Palestine  by virtue of its history  territory  population  culture and all aspects of its national life. The establishment of a second Palestinian Arab Slate by distorting the principle of self-determination means the creation of an extremist and hostile base opposed to the very-existence of Israel. Hence we will not agree to a distorted form of self-determination  which in reality implies self-destruction for our ancient nation deeply rooted in its own land.78.	The programme of autonomy which we have proposed for the Palestinian Arab inhabitants of Judaea  Samaria and the Gaza District  as accepted in principle in the Camp David frameworks  is the first practical proposal to be advanced to provide a dignified solution for the needs of the Arab population of those areas. It comes in place of all the empty declarations with which the Palestinian Arabs concerned have deluded themselves and have been deluded by other States and organizations over the years.79.	One of the most vivid expressions of the rejection of all peace proposals by the Arab rejectionist States is to be seen in their unprecedented military build-up and in the armaments which they have received in recent years from the Soviet bloc or purchased from the United States and Western Europe. In the course of the last three years  orders for arms purchases by the larger Arab States have reached astronomic sums. The quantities of arms that were actually supplied have been equally staggering. There is no precedent for the amassing of arms on this scale in our region. Those arms are designated first and foremost for use against Israel. But the implications of that vast array of armaments ait not confined to my country alone. It also serves to inject war into the area at large.80.	We call upon the United Nations to take due note of the military build-up by the Arab rejectionist States and to urge them to decrease their armament. For our part  we are prepared to lend a hand in any joint effort to bring about the limitation of arms in our region which is poised on top of a volcano.81. I should like to address myself to another crucial aspect of disarmament. Israel has consistently supported resolutions of the General Assembly aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons. This global problem  we believe  can best be solved by means of negotiated regional arrangements. Hence  since 1975  Israel has consistently advocated the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East on the Tlatelolco model. Israel believes that an international conference of all the Slates in the region and adjacent to our region should be held  leading to the conclusion of a formal  contractual  multilateral convention among all States of the region.82.	We hope that in the course of this General Assembly  we shall find a suitable opportunity to give concrete expression to our views on this matter. In the meantime  I should like to reiterate my Government's position  which is that Israel will not be the first to introduce nuclear weapons into the Arab-Israeli dispute.83.	In the last months  Jerusalem has been the object of attacks on Israel in various international forums. There has been much hypocrisy and cynicism in those attacks  For  truth to tell  never has the situation of the various religions represented in Jerusalem been better than that prevailing since the unification of the city by Israel in 1967. For 19 years  between 1948 and 1967  the eastern part of the city was under Jordanian occupation and barbed wire divided it in two. Places holy to the Jews were maliciously desecrated. Ancient synagogues and cemeteries were destroyed in a barbaric manner  and Jews were denied access to the Holy Places which are the spiritual life-blood of the Jewish people. It is not out of place to remark that the Moslem Arab citizens of Israel were also denied access to their Holy Places during that ignoble period. And where  I am bound to ask  was the voice of this Organization during that period"".' Not once was it raised in condemnation of those illegal acts.84.	On the other hand  since 1967. allâirrespective of religion and nationalityâhave been accorded free access to the city of Jerusalem and the possibility of worshipping at the Holy Places and shrines revered by them. Israel has assured the free and unfettered observance of the religious rites of all members of all faiths  who also administer their religious lives and their Holy Places without any outside interference. That is the truth well known to everyone who lives in Jerusalem and to everyone who has visited the city. There is no substance or basis to any claim to the contrary.85.	There is no need for me to dwell at length on the bond between the Jewish people and Jerusalem. The Jewish people is the only people which has made Jerusalem its capital since it appeared as a nation on the stage of human history. Throughout the many years of exile inflicted on it. The Jewish people prayed three times a day  every day  for its restoration to Jerusalem.86. For the last 150 years there has been a Jewish majority in Jerusalem. Whoever seeks to sever Jerusalem from Israel seeks to decapitate the Jewish people. We hope that nations that seek peace and know the reality which prevails in Jerusalem today will respect the city as the sovereign capital of Israel; a city which will not be divided again  in the same way as Israel respects the Holy Places of all religions and their freedoms in the city.87.	I wish to conclude with a call in the spirit of the Prophets of Israel  who were a light and an inspiration for much of mankind. My call is for peaceâpeace which is at the very basis of the existence of the United Nations.88.	We in Israel yearn for peace. We have done so since the first day of the restoration of our national sovereigntyâin our Declaration of Independence  which was issued on the very day that the State of Israel was founded in 1948. In that Declaration  we extend the hand of peace and good neighbourliness to all the States around us and all their peoples. We have taken far-reaching steps and have made huge sacrifices for the sake of peace. But peace with Israel does not mean peace without Israel  or peace at its expense. Nor does it mean peace with a weak Israel deprived of its capital and with its wings clipped from the security and geostrategic viewpoints. With such an Israel peace will not be attained  because a weak Israel will be an object of unceasing attacks and destructive designs.89.	I wish to call upon the Arab States which are our neighbours  and also upon the Palestinian Arabs living in Judaea  Samaria and the Gaza District  to follow the dictates of reason and to join the peace process. I wish to call upon the other nations of the world to support this course and to prevail upon the Arab States to adopt it. The world at large  and not merely our region alone  will benefit from this."
"71",3470,"ITA",35,1980,"ï»¿Allow me first of all to address to Mr. von Wechmar  on behalf of the Italian Government and on my own behalf  warmest congratulations on his election to the presidency of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly and to convey to him the expression of our deep satisfaction at seeing the conduct of the work of this august body entrusted to the eminent representative of a country which is our friend and ally and our partner in the European Community. I would also like to reiterate here our great appreciation for the skilful and effective way in which his predecessor  Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim of the United Republic of Tanzania  performed his particularly difficult task during four sessions of the General Assembly.169.	Allow me also to stress once more the importance that my Government attaches to the tireless activity of the Secretary General of the United Nations  Mr. Kurt Wald heim  in seeking solutions to problems that are among the most serious and most intractable of our era.170.	May I also extend a sincere welcome to the delegation of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  which has just been admitted as the one hundred and fifty-fourth Member of our Organization  thus bringing us closer to the ultimate goal of the universality of the United Nations.171.	The achievement of this priority objective of making the United Nations effectively universal  which the Charter itself set for us more than 30 years ago  no longer appears unduly distant. However  although the 1970s have brought us close to this important success  the 1980s that are now opening before us are still full of challenges to be faced and goals to be pursued.172.	Even more than in past decades  the United Nations must therefore strive to increase its importance and effectiveness as a forum at the service of individuals  of peoples  of States  and of the whole international community  in order to contribute to the achievement of a world of greater solidarity and security.173.	Above all  our Organization has a paramount responsibility to work to serve individuals whose dignity it must safeguard and whose rights it must protect. In this set  the membership of nearly all the States of the world confers a special legitimacy on United Nations action  precisely because the Organization is the expression of the universal conscience and  at the same time  of the diversity of cultures.174.	We must listen to the voice of all who are suffering unjustly and who are being persecuted  tortured or forced to abandon their own country because the authorities in power are unable or lack the will to provide adequately for their needs. In this area  Italy is ready to cooperate fully with the world Organization  for  whenever the value and dignity of the individual are threatened  no obstacle can stand in our way. No country can henceforth take refuge behind the principle of non-interference in internal affairs when human dignity is at stake.175.	The numerous international legal instrumentsâboth global and regionalâalready in existence for the protection of human rights remind us of the vast amount of work that has been accomplished in identifying the fundamental principles involved. A large part of the credit for these achievements must go to our Organization. In the years to come  however  we must close the gap which in too many cases separates affirmations of principle from the practical recognition of these rights.176.	As a country of emigrationâand now also as a country of immigrationâItaly also plans to work actively and to table specific proposals within the working group which will be entrusted by this General Assembly with the elaboration of a convention for the protection of the rights of migrant workers and their families.177.	Millions of men and women are still turning towards the United Nations in the silent hope that it can tackle and improve the situations which unfortunately still exist in many parts of the world and in which they remain prisoners of misery. No one will believe us if we do not take into account that the sphere of freedom is very broad and that it is right to seek not only freedom of thought and movement  but also freedom to own a home  to educate one's children  to receive medical care and  first and foremost  for millions of human beings  not to die of hunger. Italy is profoundly convinced that no State  no responsible authority and no individual can find peace or can slacken their efforts so long as such tremendous problems as imbalance between population consumption and resources or the deterioration of the environment continue to face the peoples of the globe. These problems require from the United Nations  from all countries and from the whole international community the adoption of joint strategies  the union of forces and a genuine solidarity of the whole world. Future generations will judge us by the results of our efforts today and by the successes or failures that we register. On this depends our future and the quality of life that we can transmit to our children.178.	The conclusions of the recent special session of the General Assembly devoted to the problems of development have emphasized  inter alia  the objectives to be pursued and the expectations which exist in regard to them.179.	Admittedly  it has not yet been possible to reach complete agreement on all the questions on which we were called upon to take wide-ranging decisions  but nevertheless the special session was able to achieve substantial progress  which we should not underestimate.180.	I am referring not only to the agreement reached on the definition of the new International Development Strategy  which we hope will be duly adopted at the end of our work. I should like  above all  to stress the efforts made to re-establishâas Italy had fervently wishedâthe climate of trust and cooperation that is essential to revitalize relations between the North and the South in the present extremely delicate political and economic situation.181.	A highly significant political result  which we must include among the positive features of the special session that has just ended  was therefore the unanimous reaffirmation of the need to continue vigorously the close dialogue between industrialized countries and developing countries that began at the special session. We should not allow ourselves to be discouraged by difficulties. On the contrary  we must take advantage of the moral awareness generated by the special session in order to deepen and intensify that dialogue during the present session  in the conviction that it is essential to ensure the stability of international relations and to enable us to tackle without delay the urgent problems of development.182.	Italy maintains that in this field too the universality of the United Nations is an essential instrument for tackling positively the innumerable problems that must be overcome if we are to attain the objectives pursued and meet the expectations aroused.183.	The joint participation of all members of the international community is essential to the success of the efforts being made by the United Nations to reduce and eliminate the conflicts  crises and sources of tension that exist throughout the world.184.	Here I should like  first of all  to refer to the crisis that began nine months ago with the intervention of Soviet military forces in Afghanistan  and in this regard I should like to recall the pertinent and timely resolution adopted by this Assembly last January at the end of its sixth emergency special session. I fully agree with the analyses and assessments which  in respect to the serious problems arising from this new source of tension  have already been made here by the current President of the Council of Ministers of the European Community  the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Luxembourg  Mr. Thorn  on behalf of the nine member countries of that Community . Already  last February  the members of the Community stated that the crisis could only be ended by a political solution based on the withdrawal of Soviet military forces and the exercise by the population of its right to self-determination  thus leading to the establishment of a neutral and nonaligned Afghanistan  removed from the rivalry among the major Powers.18i'. This perspective  from the very moment in which it was formulated by the Community was neither exclusive in character nor intended to interfere in the internal affairs of Afghanistan or in the necessary balance of power in the region. Precisely tor this reason  the initiatives taken by the Islamic Conference appear to us to be particularly appropriate  because what Italy wants for the Afghan people  in full agreement with the overwhelming majority of this Assembly  is that Afghanistan should not indefinitely remain a victim of a fait accompli.186.	During the whole of this year we have followed with close attention and deep concern the difficulties that still prevent the implementation of United Nations proposals for the peaceful attainment of internationally accepted independence for Namibia  the consequences of the continued denial of the rights of the majority of the South African people  within the framework of a political  legal and economic system unacceptable and abhorrent as the system of apartheid  and the continuing risks of destabilization in the whole of Southeast Asia and the sufferings of its martyred peoples.187.	The international community has been able to join in an effort of solidarity to save the people of Cambodia from annihilation. But the refugee problem today has a global dimension and afflicts other regions in Asia and Africa with extremely serious consequences. It is our fervent hope that the operations which  both through the United Nations and at the bilateral level  aim at putting an end to the tragedy to which we bear witness  the tragedy of millions of innocent people condemned to die of starvation  may be further developed.188.	In the face of the consequences of the armed clashes which recently caused destruction and mourning once again in the Horn of Africa  in countries to which we are linked by ties of traditional friendship and fruitful relations of cooperation  we urge the parties to search for negotiated solutions based on the principles of the Organization of African Unity [OA U] and the United Nations.189.	On another continent  Latin America  to which Italy is linked by ties of friendship whose roots run deep in history and culture  we have witnessed this year positive developments in that a number of countries  recently including Peru  have restored democratic forms of government. But we have also noted with concern that in other countries hotbeds of grave tension persist or have been freshly ignited. These have taken the form  on the one hand  of the degeneration of the political system into an authoritarian regime  and  on the other hand  of the massive exodus of tens of thousands of people abandoning their native lands and their homes. These events  which involve risks of destabilization and which endanger the basic principles of civil coexistence  have been firmly deplored and condemned by the Italian Government.190.	For an assessment of those problems and of all the current international crises  I have already referred to the statement made on behalf of the European Community by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Luxembourg. Indeed  the nine countries of the European Community are constantly increasing their joint actions in the international field to further at the global level  in a spirit of solidarity and peace  their priority objective  which is to contribute to the achievement of an ever better political  economic and social balance among the peoples of the world.191.	Italy  therefore  has set for itself the major political goal of building a Europe of community  open in the broadest way to all fruitful forms of cooperation. The European Community has already given concrete proof that this is not a selfish and autarchical endeavour designed to defend privileged positions.192.	Our Community  which  through the European Parliament which is elected by direct universal suffrage  henceforth guarantees in particular the participation of the peoples in its institutional machinery  will be further strengthened by the entry of Greece on 1 January 1981 and by progress in the procedures under way for the admission of Spain and Portugal.193.	Italy  which is situated in the sensitive Mediterranean area  looks with special interest at these developments of the European Community because it realizes that it is responsible for reaffirming and interpreting authoritatively the political will of the Community in that region.194.	Thus  no one is more thoroughly convinced than my country of the importance of the stability of the Mediterranean region for peace  security and economic and social development. This is why Italy's foreign policy is particularly aware of and devotes very careful attention to developments in the situation in this area  whether it is a question of the problems and conflicts which unfortunately still remain or one of cooperative efforts for consolidating peace.195.	Among these problems  the most important is to find a comprehensive and lasting settlement in the Middle East which would be just for all. The nine countries of the European Community  in conformity with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  have set out fully and comprehensively in the Venice Declaration of 13 June 1980 all the principles which  in their judgement  must form the basis for a solution. At the same time  they decided upon a concrete follow-up in the form of a ""European mission"" to the countries of the region. Mr. Thorn has already given the General Assembly the basic information on the first phase of his mission; this phase will be completed in the next few days. It has already been decided to continue the European mission. On the basis of these results  the Community will draw up concrete positions on each of the most important items with a view to the decisions which the Council of Europe will take regarding the form which a European initiative might take when such an initiative would seem appropriate.196.	Italy is deeply aware of the basic questions that have to be resolved: that of the implementation of the legitimate rights of the Palestinians; that of the security of Israel; that of Jerusalem  for which no unilateral decision is acceptable; and that of Lebanon. Italy  therefore  actively contributed to the drafting of the Venice Declaration and took part in defining the position of the Community on the Camp David accords  which were considered a first step towards breaking the deadlock which had arisen in the search for a solution of the problems of the Middle East.197.	But Italy is not losing sight of the realities of the situation. It is well aware that the desired comprehensive peace settlement can be achieved only if all the fundamental principles defined by the international community are accepted and implemented by all the parties to the negotiations on the attainment of a comprehensive solution: that is  by Israel  by the Arab countries and by the PLO. Italy is aware of the need to ensure the effective exercise by the Palestinian people of its right to self-determination as a means of solving its tragic problems. Italy is also aware that  in conformity with the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force  all the States of the region  Israel and the Arab countries alike  have the right to live in peace within secure  recognized and guaranteed borders.198.	It is essential that the people of Israel and the Palestinian people find the way to genuine coexistence. How long will it be before these two peoples  one martyred yesterday  one today  will be able to carry on a dialogue and to understand one another? How long will it be before all nations  big and small  will work actively towards this goal without mental reservations  opportunism or ulterior motives? History teaches us that solutions built on force and violence  which trample underfoot basic rights such as the right of all peoples to preserve their own identities and to be able to express them freely  nearly always remain precarious  if not ephemeral. It is indispensable that all the protagonists be deeply convinced that the present precarious balance is essentially unstable and dangerous and that the only path open to all the parties concerned is that of negotiation.199.	The direct participation of Italy in the operations undertaken by United Nations forces in southern Lebanon is proof of our firm desire to make an active contribution to the preservation of peace and to a gradual solution to the problems of an area with which Italy is linked by centuries of history and culture. It is my duty to express our gratitude and trust to the members of UNIFIL  in the hope that its full deployment and a greater respect extended to it in the field by all parties concerned will prevent the tragic situation in Lebanon from becoming uncontrollable.200.	The hope and trust which Italy places in the United Nations peacekeeping activities naturally extends to another delicate problem in the Mediterranean area. I am referring to Cyprus  where the unremitting activities of the Secretary General  Mr. Waldheim  have recently brought the two communities back to the negotiating table as part of the effort to normalize the situation in the Republic of Cyprus  in which Italy continues to take a legitimate and natural interest.201.	The continuing detention of American diplomatic hostages in Iran is certainly not merely a bilateral problem. It also violates the conditions necessary for the safeguarding of justice and for the respect of clear international obligations. The release of the hostages without further delay is therefore necessary primarily to enable all members of the international community to re-establish normal relations with Iran  whose people have begun a new phase in their history  having made a choice which we fully respect. In their own interest  the hostage problem must be settled as a matter of urgency so that Iran may begin to play the role to which it is entitled in international affairs.202.	In Italy  where the conviction that there are no problems that cannot and should not be settled through negotiations is deeply rooted  we have viewed with grave concern the developments in relations between Iraq and Iran  which have now taken the form of armed conflict. This is a conflict that is linked to a territorial dispute over frontiers  which makes it even more urgent to put an end to the use of force and to hasten the search for a negotiated settlement  in accordance with the United Nations Charter.203.	The history of my country  our recent history  so interwoven with extraordinary changes and sublime moments of unity  but also with cruel episodes which are an affront to the conscience of our citizens  sometimes disconcerts even those most convinced of the primacy of democracy over all other systems. That history  by undermining the confidence of those who are the most dubious  could induce us to take an indifferent view of recent events in Turkey  a country long stricken with political intolerance  and to hide from ourselves the gravity of the military coup dâÃ©tat  the sudden suspension of the parliamentary system and the arrests of prominent advocates of democracy. The events in that great country  to which we are linked by such strong ties  cannot however leave us indifferent. If we were to remain aloof  our guilt would be great. But it is our hope that the people of Turkey may rapidly recover the full enjoyment of their democratic rights and freedoms. We therefore say to the military leaders: restore power as soon as possible to the legitimate representatives of the people of Turkey.204.	As regards the problems of the Mediterranean area  I am pleased to mention a recent development to which Italy has contributed  in the conviction that it would have positive consequences for the stability and consolidation of relations of peaceful coexistence among the countries of the region.205.	On 15 September  the Italian Government reached an agreement with Malta which guarantees a priori Italian recognition of the neutral status of that island  in line with the policy of nonalignment followed by the Government of Malta. The declaration of neutrality which will be made by Malta will list the corresponding commitments by that country  which exclude participation in alliances  the admission on Maltese territory of foreign military forces or bases and the repair in Maltese shipyards of units belonging to the American or Soviet fleets.206.	The declaration to be made by Italy will not only recognize the neutrality of Malta  but will also call upon all other States to respect it and will commit us immediately to proceed to consultations in the case of that neutrality being threatened or violated. Those commitments will be accompanied by measures to promote the economic development of Malta during the first years of its neutrality as well as  in the case of Maltese neutrality being threatened or violated  measures to guarantee that neutrality and aid to the island  measures that Italy could adopt if it deemed it necessary. We naturally hope that other Mediterranean countries  both European and Arab  which are neighbours of Malta  will make declarations similar to ours.207.	The commitments that will be entered into by Italy and Malta in this context were conceived with explicit reference to the provisions of the United Nations Charter and with full respect for them. The text of the agreements between the two countries  as soon as it is ratified by the respective constitutional organs  will be deposited with the United Nations Secretariat  in accordance with Article 102 of the Charter.208.	In the present international situation  it is crucial to maintain the balance of forces  even in seeking ways to strengthen international detente in other parts of the world besides Europe. From that point of view  participation in the Atlantic allianceâa regional factor for security and the defence of peaceful East West relationsâremains an important aspect of Italian policy.209.	The increased difficulties in the international situation must not hinder the continuation of efforts to promote realistic negotiations on disarmament  on the basis of the decisions taken by the General Assembly at its tenth special session  devoted to disarmament  held in June 1978  decisions which  in our view  remain fully valid.210.	The work done this year at Geneva by the Committee on Disarmament  even in the international climate prevailing in the wake of the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan  has shown that the possibility and the will to continue disarmament negotiations exist. The substantial progress made towards the banning of chemical weapons and on nuclear tests encourages us further to hope that ratification of the SALT II Treaty by the United States will not be further delayed  so that negotiations may be continued  within the framework of a new SALT III agreement. We maintain that that negotiating process  even with the limits inherent in its bilateral character  remains of fundamental importance for the strengthening of peace and security for the whole of the international community.211.	In referring in this context to the expectations related to the control and limitation in Europe of long-range nuclear weapons  I must point out with satisfaction that recently some progress was made. In fact  the offer to begin negotiations on achieving such control through common agreement between East and West  which Italy and its allies made in December 1979 at Brussels  met with a responsive reaction from the Soviet Union and its allies for the first time at the beginning of July. It is a positive fact that it has consequently become possible to put forward to the Soviet Government the proposal  which is in line with Italy's expectations and with the action it has taken at all meetings and in all international forums towards their fulfilment  that the opening talks of those negotiations effectively begin next month.212.	Within the framework of the initiatives aimed at promoting global disarmament  my Government also attaches great importance to the proposals and negotiations that relate specifically to the geographical areas of which Italy is a part: the European continent and the Mediterranean basin. It is obvious in this context that any formula or initiative must be aimed at the limitation of weapons and the maintenance of security in the field through the attainment of increasingly low levels in all weapons sectors. But any formula or initiative can be considered realistic only in so far as it takes into account the whole political and military situation throughout the world.213.	Constructive negotiations on disarmament  the control and limitation of weapons and the reduction of forces can take place only if all nations are encouraged by their interdependence to create conditions of greater understanding and trust. This is the framework which Italy considers to be essential for strengthening detente. It is therefore necessary that the possibilities  the political space and dimensions which individual countries occupy on the world scene should induce each one of them to begin with faith and  I would say also  with courage  a constructive and permanent dialogue. This is the only means which can in the first place set in motion international cooperation and  on a more complex but more complete level  allow detente to develop throughout the world.214.	The serious events in Afghanistan and their negative repercussions on the general situation have shown that detente can only be global and indivisible and that every attempt to reduce it to a regional or sectoral phenomenon may initiate a process which threatens to make it reversible. Even if the prospect of negotiations for the control and limitation of long-range strategic nuclear weapons represents a significant step forward  there is clearly a need for the full reestablishment of detente and for a political solution to the Afghan problem.215.	Certainly  in Europe the process of detente has now been under way for years and the path of detente has been made easier with the help of mechanisms at the regional level  such as the meetings which the Helsinki Final Act provided for as a follow-up to the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.216.	At Madrid  where the preparatory meetings are already in progress  Italy will participate  in a constructive spirit  in the review of the implementation of the Helsinki provisions and in the efforts to make further progress towards security and cooperation among the 35 participating countries. Italy will do so in the knowledge that only a serious and detailed exchange of ideas can lay the foundation for the recovery of detente in a situation adversely influenced by repeated violations of human rights by certain countries and by the serious events in Afghanistan.217.	Italy reaffirms that it is ready to contribute to the building of the foundations of a more balanced and more open world in which there is no longer room for the old temptations of hegemony and where these temptations yield to the appeal for solidarity. This is in fact a peaceful battle that we must all fight together  whatever differences exist between us  because it is a battle for the peace of the world.218.	The United Nations and its principal body  the General Assembly  will always constitute a valuable instrument in this battle. We hope that in the 1980s conflicts will be prevented and that means of mediating and settling existing ones will be found in this forum.219.	My appeal from this rostrum  rightly described as the forum of the world  is that the essential solidarity between us all should not fail  that the United Nations should increasingly assist the international community to win the battle for peace and that all States should do their utmost to promote the free circulation of people  ideas and hopes so that all of us understand more clearly how closely linked are the interests and aspirations of all peoples."
"72",3516,"JAM",35,1980,"ï»¿Let me begin  Sir  by expressing  on behalf of my delegation  our warmest congratulations to Mr. von Wechmar on his election to the presidency of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. This honour is well deserved by both him and his great country. It is a tribute to his own stature as a diplomat and his qualities of leadership  and to the role being played by the Federal Republic of Germany in the international arena.132.	We also wish to pay a warm tribute to his predecessor  Ambassador Salim Ahmed Salim of the United Republic of Tanzania  a close and esteemed friend of Jamaica  who so ably guided the affairs of the General Assembly during the last regular session  as well as during two emergency special sessions and the recently concluded special session. We are proud of and greatly indebted to him  particularly for his contribution to improving the working procedures of the General Assembly. His patience  skill and forbearance were noteworthy and were appreciated by all of us.133.	To the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  my Government expresses its gratitude for yet another year of devoted and able service to the cause of international peace in these difficult times.134.	Jamaica takes great pleasure in welcoming another newly independent sister Caribbean country  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  to membership in this Organization. The continued evolution of the decolonization process in the Caribbean region is a matter of profound pleasure and satisfaction to us.135.	We are forced by events  since we last met in this forum  to reflect even more profoundly on the current world situation. It gives no satisfaction to observe that the first year of the new decade has differed from the last of the old decade only in so far as the international system has slipped even deeper into crisis  as vision and creative action have been even more clearly shown to be absent.136.	But even that assessment  accurate as it is  does not fully convey the gravity of the current situation  for it fails to reveal that not only a quantitative but indeed a qualitative retrogression is occurring in the international system. That is the measure of our condition today.137.	Year after year  during the past decade  a recurring theme in this very hall has been the need to complement political independence with economic independence  and to complement political decolonization with economic liberation.138.	But what do we find? Meeting as we are in the shadow of the eleventh special sessionâand I say ""shadow"" deliberatelyâwe can only say with profound dismay and regret that little has changed. The establishment of new and equitable economic relations among States appears destined to remain for a long time a task deferred by an international community insensitive to its own enlightened self-interest. At the same time  other profoundly disturbing developments are occurring in the international system  developments which indicate that basic and fundamental political gains made by the developing countries in the post-colonial era are now also under assault.139.	Jamaica firmly believes that it is neither an accident nor sheer coincidence that the international political climate is undergoing its most significant deterioration at precisely the time when international economic conditions are at their worst and when the need to restructure the international economic system is most compelling.140.	The effects of this grave situation are now being felt with increasing force and are having deleterious consequences through the entire international system.141.	The countries of the Caribbean greatly prize their political independence. This is so not only because we recognize political independence as a fundamental and basic right  but because of our harsh experience. The yoke of colonialism rested heavily and for a long time on the shoulders of our peoples. The vestiges still remain.142.	Today our region stands at a critical juncture in its political and economic history. Our primary task is the economic reconstruction of post-colonial society. But  as our people seek to channel their energies and their skills in that direction  we find that that difficult task must be attempted in the context of outmoded international economic relations and institutions and increasingly under the heavy shadow of political and military developments which threaten our sovereignty and our freedom of action and choice  and seek to promote political dependency in new forms.143.	It must be recognized by those who would seek to assert definitive influence on and to be the final arbiters of events in our region that this can ultimately only be the responsibility of the Caribbean peoples themselves. The Caribbean must become a zone of peace and tranquillity. That is why Jamaica once again calls upon all countries  particularly the super-Powers  to respect and accept the ideological plurality of the Caribbean region. That is not now the case. Consequently the task of the Governments and peoples of the region to build more just societies and to carry out social and economic reforms in the interest of the majority is made immeasurably more difficult.144.	My Government is profoundly encouraged by the efforts to promote economic co-operation among the countries of Latin America. In June of this year the Government of Trinidad and Tobago established a facility for the countries of the Caribbean Community [CARICOM] on the basis of their purchases from that country of petroleum and petroleum products  fertilizer and asphalt. More recently the major oil exporters of our region  Venezuela and Mexico  have also established a programme to assist some oil- importing countries in Central America and the Caribbean. My Government warmly appreciates those actions by the Governments of Trinidad and Tobago  Venezuela and Mexico  and commends them as steps to be considered by other regions and institutions.145.	The call for the establishment of the New International Economic Order was given full and formal expression at the historic Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at Algiers from 5 to 9 September 1973 and at the sixth special session of the General Assembly  held in May 1974. At that time most of the developed countries adopted an attitude of either indifference or hostility to our proposals for change. They ignored the prognostications from our side about the dangers we would all face if the developed countries failed to take seriously the imperative need for change in the world economic order.146.	A remarkable feature of the present time is the growing convergence of perceptions expressed by both the developed and the developing world when we discuss the global economic situation. We all agree that the prospects for our collective future are bleak indeed. But although we both tend to use the same vocabulary  the actions of the developed countries contradict their language and bear testimony to their continued resistance to changing the structure of the world economic system.147.	Today all of us must accept the simple reality that survival has truly become a collective need. It is the concern of us all. The economic circumstances and problems of the North cannot be isolated from those of the South. However  some developed countries appear to believe that the developing world can be flattered by their willingness to engage us in a dialogue on co-operation for global survival while international economic affairs continue to be fashioned and managed as though they were the preserve of the rich world. If we had any doubts about that  the recently concluded eleventh special session of the Assembly has brought us face to face with the painful reality.148.	At the current session of the General Assembly it is not sufficient merely to review the state of the North-South dialogue. What we need to do is to commit ourselves to action to take us out of the present impasse. Above all we must take steps to manage the process of change which is necessary if we are to achieve peace  equity and stability in the international order. We of the developing world here and now invite the industrialized countries to step forward with us.149.	Jamaica remains convinced that the approach and the principles upon which the Group of 77 insisted at the special session are fundamental to the requirements of the global community and must not be compromised. The interrelationships between money and finance  commodity trade  energy  raw materials and food determine the global economic condition.150.	We ought therefore  as sovereign Governments acting within the framework of a universal body  to ensure that  in the context of global negotiations  we fulfil our responsibility to deal with those problems  problems in respect of which specialized agencies and institutions have neither the universal status nor the global focus to formulate a coherent programme of policies and measures required at this time. Such a process  however much it may respect the functions and competence of various international institutions and forums  must overcome the separation and insulation of issues such as money and finance.151.	Those issues  along with energy  represent the centre-piece of international concern today. They are in fact the life-blood of national and international economic activity and they must be placed at the centre of global negotiations.152.	We are painfully aware of the sensitivities which surround the issues of money and finance. What is most striking is the degree to which the interests and institutions involved in this sphere are subjected to powerful and protective forces and the extent to which these have been insulated from the broad global dialogue and the emerging understanding of development and international economic relations.153.	My Government does not believe that the international community can treat as sacrosanct an international monetary system and its institutions which adhere to diagnoses and prescriptions relevant to the time and circumstances of their establishment over three decades ago. The truth is that we need to demystify these matters.154.	The international monetary system must be urgently brought into line with the complex realities of today's inter-national economic concerns and with the clearly evident needs and conditions of the developing countries. The call for such changes becomes more urgent every day  and developing countries are by no means alone in making it. That was most recently demonstrated at the South-North Conference on the International Monetary System and the New International Order  held at Arusha from 30 June to 3 July 1980.155.	When we speak of questions such as the adjustment process and conditionality attached to drawings from IMF  we are not merely dealing with broad international and national factors. The practices and policies in those areas have an immediate and direct impact on the lives and prospects of individual human beings. We are urged by a number of international institutions and by many others  especially from industrialized countries  that we should attend to the interest of the less privileged in our countries. Yet  the policies and practices related to the adjustment process and to conditionality extract great sacrifices from the very same sectors of our populations.156.	Jamaica believes that reforms would be in the interest of all countries  and would address one of the main problems now affecting the international economic system.157.	Energy is perhaps the most important physical input for the productive and service sectors of the world economy. Two basic facts are evident in this context.158.	First  hydrocarbons provide the main source of usable energy in today's world  and secondly  supplies of this non-renewable source will be exhausted in the foreseeable future. While the relative emphasis attached to either of these may vary from country to country  we are all greatly affected by both in the long run.159.	The world community therefore has an obligation to deploy adequate financial and technological resources to tap potential sources of new and renewable energy. We must ensure that the United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy  scheduled for 1981  takes concrete action in this regard.160.	The other major concern in energy relates to the availability of supplies to the oil-importing developing countries. Inflation in the global economy sustains the pressure on the price of oil and the capacities of those countries to achieve economic growth and development. It has been shown  for example  that a 4.5 per cent growth in the gross domestic product of a country in the industrialized world requires a corresponding proportionate increase in the demand for energy. However  in the case of the developing countries  the increase implied in the demand for energy  given the same percentage growth in gross domestic product  is nearer 6 per cent.161.	It is clear  therefore  that on all counts the oil- importing developing countries require special assistance to enable them to meet the energy requirements consistent with their growth and development objectives.162.	My delegation notes with special pleasure the efforts within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to transform the Special Fund into a bank to assist the developing countries. We note also the initiatives in the World Bank to strengthen its facilities for assisting developing countries with the exploration and development of their indigenous energy resources.163.	But we must face squarely the question whether these efforts by themselves  commendable as they are  really address the fundamental issues of energy and development. The answer is clear and the prospects are not reassuring. Surely it must be the classic contradiction of our time that over $500 billion of the world's resources are annually devoted to the manufacture of arms  while the central banks in the oil-importing developing countries struggle to survive the economic dislocations caused by their accumulated balance-of-payments^ deficit  now running at $50 billion. And  while this situation persists  our countries are forced to reduce imports of food  fertilizer  drugs and vital raw materials to well below minimum required levels.164.	The eleventh special session was intended to launch the global round of negotiations next year and to approve the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade. We reached consensus on the Strategy  but the text that emerged bears the harsh marks of resistance on the part of many industrialized countries to a really effective global effort. We failed to persuade the industrialized countries to join in what could have been a consensus on a text on the mechanisms for the global round of negotiationsâa text which some developing countries  including Jamaica  found inadequate in expression of the vital role of the central conference. At the current session  the General Assembly must find a way to overcome these obstacles and begin to tackle with real purpose the social and economic problems which confront us all.165.	Earlier this year  the international community took a step towards addressing the problem of price fluctuations and development issues in world commodity trade. My Government welcomes the Agreement establishing the Common Fund for Commodities  inadequate though it is. But  as we have stated before  this achievement merely provides a foundation upon which we should seek to build enduring structures to deal with the outstanding issues in world commodity trade.166.	The predictions of serious economic difficulties  which some developed countries found convenient to ignore a few years ago  have become the reality of today.167.	This General Assembly must now take full cognizance of the fact that the economic and financial crises facing the world and affecting in particular the developing countries can only be corrected by immediate and drastic action. Some are confronted with the problems now. The forecasts tell us that others will face them in turn tomorrow.168.	The Independent Commission on International Development Issuesâthe Brandt Commissionâpresented the world with an analysis and a set of recommendations and proposals for the alleviation of poverty and the promotion of international peace and equity and stability. These do not represent the full measure of the call for the New International Economic Order. Nevertheless  they confirm the basic thesis of the developing countries that change is imperative: time is not on our side.169.	The general lack of progress on international economic issues is paralleled by a serious worsening of the political climate.170.	We note with profound concern that a particularly unwelcome development in the past year or so has been that  as tension in the international system has increased  the focus of concern among the major Powers has shifted decisively towards preoccupation with issues of ideological competition and great-Power rivalry. This has occurred at the expense of issues vital to the economic survival and development of the majority of nations.171.	The super-Powers and major blocs must end now their dangerous journey into the past before they become mired so deeply that history will repeat itself as tragedy.172.	The arms race continues unabated. The stalemate which marked last month the review of the non- proliferation Treaty   the renewed calls for more sophisticated weapons and weapon systems  reflect the collapse of sanity and moderation and the bellicose spirit of our day.173.	Jamaica believes that detente  which appears to be increasingly in jeopardy  must now be placed firmly and securely back on track if the best interests of the international community are to be served. In this respect  we welcome the imminent resumption of discussions between the Soviet Union and the United States on the deployment of tactical nuclear weapons in Europe and the reconvening of the Vienna Talks on Mutual Reduction of Forces  Armaments and Associated Measures in Central Europe. Above all  the early ratification of SALT II is essential.174.	The defusing of the current international hostility is a matter of immediate concern to all the countries of the third world. Our respective regions continue to be the theatres in which great-Power rivalry and ideological competition take on their most concrete and destructive form as incendiary elements in regional conflicts and disputes.175.	In this context  Jamaica notes with great concern the resurgence of the view that entire regions and areas of the globeâin Africa  in Asia and in Latin Americaâare considered fair game for the application of outmoded spheres of influence policies by great Powers as part of their arbitrary attempts to fit such areas into the confines of their perceived interests.176.	It will be recalled that in an earlier era precisely such assumptions and policies so seriously threatened the independence  sovereignty and freedom of action of small and less powerful States that the non-aligned movement was founded as a countervailing force in the international system. Now  two decades later  despite the growth and dynamism of that great movement and despite its historic role as a vanguard in the democratization of international relations  policies and practices hostile to the principles and spirit of non-alignment appear to be on the ascendancy once again.177.	We remain convinced that the policy of non- alignment offers the best hope for the preservation of the independence of developing countries and for peace in the international community. Jamaica stands firm in its commitment to the non-aligned movement and its policies.178.	We have expressed in this and other forums our views on recent events in South-West Asia. It remains our concern that there should be an early return to normality  in the interest of stability in the region and the wider interest of international peace.179.	In South-East Asia  the collective effort of States in that region is required in order to reduce tension and conflict and to establish a zone of peace.180.	Differences between Iran and Iraq  two non-aligned States  have regrettably erupted into open conflict. The outbreak of fighting between those two neighbouring Islamic countries is a cause of great human suffering and has world-wide repercussions. Jamaica takes this opportunity to appeal to these two States to bring an end to hostilities and to resolve their dispute peacefully  in keeping with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of the non-aligned movement.181.	In the Middle East the crisis has deepened. The past year has seen developments which place further obstacles in the path of peace. We have seen Israel's continued promotion of illegal settlements; its measures intended to annex the eastern part of Jerusalem  and the continuation of its attacks on Lebanon  all in contravention of relevant resolutions of the Security Council.182.	At the same time  the denial of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people remains a painful reality. It is well established that at the core of the conflict is the tragedy of the Palestinian people. No peace can be effective or permanent which does not enable the Palestinian people to exercise its right to self-determination  independence and sovereignty  and which does not ensure the security of all States in the region.183.	At this session we celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the historic Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. The positive achievements of the United Nations in decolonization in those 20 years need no elaboration.184.	The right of the people of Belize to self-determination and independence with territorial integrity has been re-affirmed by the United Nations on many occasions. The administering Power acknowledges that right. The people of Belize are ready and anxious to exercise it. Jamaica supports the proposal to be put forward at this session of the General Assembly so that we can act to ensure that the exercise of the right to independence by the people of Belize is no longer delayed  and that they may with confidence and the support of the world community enjoy that right. Guatemala should no longer be allowed to exercise a de facto veto and thus prolong the colonial status of a neighbouring State.185.	It is a source of great joy to us that Zimbabwe has at long last been liberated and has already joined this Organization. The long years of suffering and sacrifice for justice and freedom were not in vain. The triumph of their cause appears to augur well for the struggle of the people of Namibia against the illegal and oppressive occupation of their country by racist South Africa. However  the chances of success by negotiated settlement are receding. Continued prevarication and refusal to co-operate on the part of South Africa must be firmly dealt with by the application of sanctions  as provided for in Chapter VII of the Charter.186.	The continued refusal of influential members of the international community to support the application of sanctions against the racist minority regime in Pretoria reveals even more clearly the hypocrisy which informs their position on this question. Gross violations of international norms and conduct are punishable by sanctions. Some members of the international community appear to recognize this only when their immediate interests are directly threatened.187.	No country has more consistently defied the decisions of the United Nations and the International Court of Justice than South Africa. We note with bitterness the behaviour of those States which are only too willing to avoid the application of sanctions here  despite the most flagrant and continued abuse.188.	The widespread resistance of the oppressed people of South Africa to the abhorrent system of apartheid has assumed new dimensions. The brutality and savagery of police repression of protesters earlier this year are signs of the increasing desperation of the authorities. It is an affront to people of conscience that the apartheid regime continues to be sustained and strengthened by contacts with the outside world. Even worse is the fear aroused by the events of late last year that South Africa had become a nuclear Power. Those who have constantly disregarded the many warnings issued and the calls for terminating nuclear collaboration must face severe indictment for placing the nuclear weapon in the hands of a criminal regime.189.	Despite the prevailing gloom there have been a few encouraging developments. Jamaica welcomes the reopening of dialogue between the two communities in Cyprus. We encourage the parties to approach the negotiations in a constructive spirit  to lay aside the grievances and antagonisms of the past  and to work together towards building a united and harmonious existence for all Cypriots.190.	At the World Conference of the United Nations Decade for Women  held at Copenhagen from 4 to 30 July 1980  we reviewed and evaluated at the midpoint of the United Nations Decade for Women the progress made in implementing the recommendations of the World Conference of the International Women's Year  which was held at Mexico City from 19 June to 2 July 1975. In that sphere  much has been achieved during the first half of the decade. On the international front  there is the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women  of which Jamaica is a signatory. The Voluntary Fund for the United Nations Decade for Women has been functioning since 1977 to the benefit of women and children in a number of countries.191.	At the national level  we in Jamaica have implemented or are in the process of implementing most of the mandates which were adopted at the Conference through the World Plan of Action.  This we have done through legislative provisions and educational and social programmes  as well as the establishment of national machinery to deal with matters of specific concern to women and children.192.	The Programme of Action adopted at Copenhagen  with its emphasis on equality  development and peace and on such issues as employment  health and education  is important in the continuing quest for the full recognition of the rights of women.193.	A development of major significance is the progress achieved by the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea at its resumed ninth session at Geneva. From that meeting there has emerged a package on all the outstanding matters relating to the exploration and exploitation of the common heritage area. That package represents a compromise by all sides. It holds out the possibility that the adoption of a universal convention on the law of the sea is close at hand and that the tenth session of the Conference will be its last. We hope that nothing will occur to disturb that momentum.194.	Jamaica reiterates its readiness to host the international sea-bed authority.195.	In all our endeavours we should not fail to give attention to the interpersonal aspect of human affairs  which in the final analysis is the most fundamental. The way in which communities and nations regard each other is often quite different from the way in which individuals react to each other when they meet.196.	Few areas of human activity are more charged with possibilities than travel and tourism  which is a rapidly growing international industry. No development is more spectacular than the growth of the technology  and its applications  in the field of communications.197.	As we seek here and elsewhere to find ways of establishing peace and equity in relations between States and regions  we must equally search for ways of encouraging greater contact among peoples. That must be achieved on the basis of appreciation for different cultures and in a manner that facilitates the eradication of those notions of superiority  suspicion and hatred which still unduly influence so much of the relations among countries.198.	My delegation calls on the United Nations system to give greater attention to tourism as a means of providing an impetus to global economic activity and to recognize it as a means for promoting better human understanding.199.	It is a long-standing truism among historians that chronological devices such as decades are in many ways but artificial contrivances to which history and events often pay little heed. That has been amply demonstrated during the past year. The problems of the past have remained stubbornly with us  in many cases compounded and seeming even jess to admit of early solutions.200.	As we have met in forum after forum to address the major political and economic problems of our time  the cascade of words has brought forth but a trickle of deeds. A verbal avalanche has yielded a veritable mound of inaction. Success continues to elude our grasp.201.	But we must persevere. We must remain undaunted. We must stand firm for peace. We must stand firm against the exploitation of nation by nation  of man by man. From our achievements  though few  we must recognize the measure of the possible.202.	Our obligation to history and to succeeding generations must be to redouble our efforts now to effect meaningful political and economic change new  even as the obstacles increase.203.	The United Nations is the corner-stone of all our hope. It is here we must lay foundations for the future."
"73",3562,"JOR",35,1980,"ï»¿210.	At the outset I wish to extend to Mr von Wechmar  of the Federal Republic of Germany  congratulations on his unanimous election to the presidency of the thirty-fifth session. The confidence that the Assembly has shown by electing him to that high office is an expression of the international community's acknowledgement of his outstanding political and diplomatic qualities and the recognition of the important role played by the Federal Republic of Germany in the maintenance of international peace and security. Its efforts are evidenced by the ever-expanding bilateral relations with other countries as well as by its active role as a member of the European Community in the family of nations.211.	My country attaches great importance to its friendship with the Federal Republic of Germany  which is based on co-operation and mutual respect. I am confident that Mr. von Wechmar's extensive experience and diplomatic acumen will contribute to ensure a judicious and constructive dialogue aimed at the solution of the various questions on this session's agenda.212.	I also wish to express our deep gratitude to his predecessor  Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim  who shouldered the arduous task of presiding over the thirty-fourth session and several special sessions. His exemplary qualities and dedicated leadership in grappling with the most complex issues earned him the respect and admiration of the United Nations. These sentiments we feel in equal measure for his friendly and esteemed country  the United Republic of Tanzania  and for the great continent of Africa as a whole.213.	I wish to take this opportunity to acknowledge with profound appreciation and gratitude the tireless efforts of the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  to augment the effectiveness of the United Nations system in preserving peace  stability and justice throughout the world. Those achievements have entailed incessant efforts with a view to restructuring relationships in the economic  social and cultural fields on the basis of greater equality among nations.214.	We have learned with deep regret of the tragic death of Mr. Masherov  one of the eminent leaders of the USSR and First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Byelorussia. On behalf of the Government and people of Jordan  I extend to the peoples of the USSR our sincere condolences on the loss they have suffered with the passing of that great man. I would request our colleagues in the delegation of the Byelorussian SSR to convey our heartfelt sympathy to Mr. Masherov's family.215.	My country supports unswervingly the struggle of all peoples to attain freedom. It is with deep joy that I convey the congratulations of His Majesty King Hussein and the Government and people of Jordan to the Republic of Zimbabwe and its people  and extend a hearty welcome to that Republic on its accession to membership in the community of nations. We are confident that it will play its rightful part in supporting the causes of freedom  progress and peace.216.	I also wish to welcome to membership in the United Nations the State of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and to address our sincere congratulations to its delegation.217.	The report of the Secretary-General on the work of the United Nations deserves our highest commendation. It is an objective appraisal of the current world situation and of the achievements in and the obstacles that impede progress in the political and economic fields.218.	The substantial progress and agreement achieved at the ninth session of the Third Conference on the Law of the Sea  held last August  concerning the law of the sea and the exploitation of the resources of the seas and the oceans are truly a landmark in the annals of the United Nations.219.	My Government shares the Secretary-General's concern  reflected in his report  pertaining to the important issues of which the United Nations is seized. In the words of the Secretary-General:""It is rightly a matter of general concern that the decisions of the Security Council and the resolutions of the General Assembly often go unheeded  so that problems which should have been brought under control persist  proliferate and pose continual threats to international peace.''220.	We also agree with his comment that ""the will of the majority in the United Nations has too often been flouted and that the reasonable demands of its resolutions have been ignored"".221.	This serious difference in the visualizing of international issues indicates two diametrically contradictory positions. The first is based on the free expression of the views of the majority of Member States on questions relating to peace and the right of all peoples to self-determination; the second is based on power politics and the imposition of faits accomplis  which some States continue to practise in the mistaken belief that such a course is the best way to solve conflicts.222.	In spite of the gravity of the situation  our faith in the collective judgement of that majority and the moral weight it brings to bear upon the work of the United Nations will have an increasing impact on the role of the Organization in preserving world peace and the political  economic and social advancement of mankind.223.	The accelerating arms race and the ever-increasing threat of destructive wars have been and continue to be the nightmare which overshadows the fate and future of all peoples. That is the stark reality  in spite of the bitter experiences we have passed through and notwithstanding all the decisions and resolutions which the United Nations has adopted and which reject the use of force and advocate peaceful means for the settlement of international conflicts.224.	The policy of dividing the world into spheres of influence has created international tensions which have compelled the countries of the third world to seek the protection of their national interests by arming themselves inordinately  quantitatively and qualitatively  beyond their means and at the cost of undermining their own progress and economic and social betterment.225.	The enormity of this tragic situation is illustrated by the fact that the arms race has imposed upon the world the expenditure of more than $500 billion in 1980. A sizeable proportion of that wasteful expenditure has been borne by the countries of the third world. The denial to the poor countries of the third world of a propitious atmosphere for concentrating on internal development and their propulsion into the arena of international conflict which threatens their very existence have forced them to focus their primary energies on the paramount issue of survival.226.	Disarmament is imperative to the peace and security of the world. The negotiations on the limitation of strategic weapons and the Helsinki Final Act"" are steps which  we hope  will transform relations among nations from ""power politics"" to wider levels of detente which will find concrete expression in scientific  cultural  economic and human cooperation.227.	It is our earnest hope that the second review session of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  to be held at Madrid  will provide a new opportunity to achieve a modus vivendi for consolidating co-operation and peaceful co-existence in other parts of the world. This is particularly the case as Europe is presently called upon to play its rightful role in building international peace and security and also to promote balanced relations between the two superpowers.228.	Jordan is deeply concerned about the dangers of nuclear proliferation and fully supports the United Nations efforts in the field of non-proliferation. In that context it is our earnest hope that the world Organization will succeed in guaranteeing that the Middle East remains a nuclear-free zone. This has assumed greater urgency since the development of a nuclear arsenal at its centre  in Israel  which still believes that hegemony  expansion and aggression are the overriding principles of its policy. That is amply demonstrated in the occupied Arab territories; it is also exemplified in the aggression against Lebanon's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The tragedy which has befallen its people and the effectiveness of the role of the United Nations there have become an acid test of the extent of our adherence to the principles of the Charter.229.	One of the most important and urgent issues confronting the international community is the establishment of a new economic order  on a more just and equitable basis  to supplant an inherited and outdated economic system which was created under conditions different from those which exist today. The international economic order has reached a stage of crisis where our aspirations to find appropriate solutions can only be described as a struggle for the survival of the human race  particularly in the least developed parts of the world. Abject poverty  ignorance and disease are becoming an increasing threat to whole societies. Drought and desertification are menacing other societies in Africa and Asia.230.	In spite of the alarming magnitude of the situation  it has failed to galvanize adequately the political wills of the developed countries to an extent commensurate with the magnitude of the challenges. It has failed to lay down new moral imperatives based on justice  equity and solidarity among nations.231.	My delegation believes that the United Nations has a central role to play in a basic restructuring of the existing international economic order and the establishment of a new one. We also believe that there should be a moral order to guide relations between the developed and the developing countries. It is also our conviction that international trade is impaired because of the unjust principles on which GATT is based.232.	We believe that the new international economic order must be directed to ensure coherent and well balanced food security for the whole international community. To that end  modern technology should be directed towards arresting the problems of desertification  reclamation of unused lands and development of water resources.233.	Jordan attaches considerable importance to regional co-operation among developing countries and is contributing to its application in accordance with the recommendations of the special session of the Arab Economic and Social Council which met at Amman on 6 July this year. Jordan stresses the imperative need to apply such regional cooperation in various other geographical regions as complementary to and not as a substitute for international co-operation.234.	We have followed with keen attention the proceedings of the eleventh special session  devoted to development and international economic co-operation  which concluded its work on 15 September last. We have also considered with the utmost attention the recommendations issued by that special session. We wish to express Jordan's deep satisfaction that the emergency aid to the least developed countries  previously proposed by the Secretary-General  was unanimously approved. We also noted with satisfaction the consensus among Member States regarding the imperative need to proceed forthwith with the adoption of the new International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade.235.	Notwithstanding our disappointment over the failure to achieve consensus in the interrelated field of global negotiations  we hope that negotiations concerning the differences between the developed and the developing countries will be resumed in the course of the current session.236.	Inspired by its Arab and Islamic legacy  Jordan ardently believes in human rights as a lofty and all- encompassing goal which must be attained without any discrimination. It should be kept apart from varying ideological struggles. It is therefore deeply dismaying to see the cause of human rights practised selectively.237.	The deprivation of a whole people  the Palestinian people  of their most fundamental right to self- determination in their homeland is therefore a matter which evokes perplexity and deep concern.238.	The denial of fundamental Palestinian rights is all the more obnoxious as that denial comes from a State which had misguided the world into thinking that it was an oasis of democracy. It had also for a while deceived public opinion in the West into thinking that it was a centre of freedom and justice in the Middle East.239.	The Western world  weighed down by a guilty conscience  has for some time been led to believe that Israel must be created  sustained and consolidated to atone for the misdeeds of the Nazis against the Jews. It is incredible that Israel itself  which has incessantly reminded the world that the Jews were among the victims of Nazism  should today be practising the ugliest forms of fascism and racism against the Palestinian people. The numerous reports issued by fact-finding commissions of the Security Council  the General Assembly and many other bodies have revealed the ideological and behavioural practices which dominate the Israeli mentality and which match in magnitude the ugly practices of the racist South African regime in its policy of apartheid.240.	It is incumbent on us to warn of the grave consequences which will ensue from the existing collaboration between the two racist regimes of Israel and South Africa in the political  cultural  economic and military fields. The collaboration has extended to the nuclear field in the exchange of uranium and technical know-how. Its most telling manifestation has been the combined atomic explosion in the Indian Ocean  which poses a threat to international peace and security.241.	We subscribe to the Secretary-General's assessment that the situation in the Middle East continues to be the central issue in the international situation and is of paramount importance to the political and economic stability of the world.242.	Arab efforts have therefore been directed towards the achievement of a just and comprehensive peace in the region  within a framework acceptable to the international community. On the other hand  we find Israeli practices which are prompted by a mentality based on aggression  hegemony and expansion. This was clearly asserted in the statement by Israel's former Minister for Foreign Affairs  General Moshe Dayan  in which he said that his connotation of security for Israel was that its limit was coterminous with the farthest spot on which an Israeli soldier stood. It has also been reflected in the latest Knesset resolution declaring the Holy City of Jerusalem as the unified capital of Israel. It is likewise manifested in the expenditure of the equivalent of $3 billion  or roughly 15 per cent of Israel's annual budget  for the construction of new settlements  in addition to supporting expenditures to sustain those colonies.243.	Israel's massive military build-up in consequence of the material  military and moral support of some Powers  and specifically of the United States of America  has created a security imbalance in the region and has enabled Israel to achieve predominance. In consequence  Israel has unabashedly persisted in its defiance of the international will and in refusing to implement the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council. It has simultaneously implemented its ideology of expansion and of exclusivism  in which the legitimate Palestinian presence in Palestine and the Arab region around it is regarded as a human and material barrier which must be destroyed and overcome to enable Israel to achieve its long-standing plans to consolidate its hold on the lands which it occupied by means of colonization and expulsion of the inhabitants  achieved through all military and political forms of terrorism.244.	In describing the situation which prevails to this Assembly  Jordan warns that its continuance will have a great bearing on international peace and security.245.	Israel's declaration of Holy Jerusalem as its unified capital  in defiance of Security Council resolution 478(1980) of 20 August last  is the climax of these heedless and dangerous illegal policies. The Knesset enactment has made the search for comprehensive and just peace virtually impossible. Moreover  it is Israel's declared intention to annex the occupied Golan Heights.246.	Jordan  by virtue of its geographical location and its historical and national commitment to the Palestinian cause and the rights of its people  has faced the tragedy of Palestine with the optimum degree of responsibility. While the Palestinian people are to this day living victims of deprivation and dispersal from their homeland  Jordan has experienced the consequences of this human tragedy in its manifold political  military and economic dimensions.247.	The Act of Unity between the Palestinian West Bank and Jordan of 24 April 1950 was but an expression of this national commitment. The Act of Unity unequivocally attests to Jordan's support for the historic rights of the Palestinian people and the preservation of all Palestinian rights  in any final settlement  in accordance with national aspirations  international justice and the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination.248.	Inspired by its Arab national commitment  the Jordanian citizen has shared with his brethren whom aggression has dispersed an honourable life  his home  his school and also the trenches. Jordan has also shouldered and continues to shoulder the consequences of a human and a political issue which was created by unjust and misguided international action. Jordan's commitment to the Palestine cause has been expressed in its rejection of unjust resolutions which accorded legitimacy to the Zionist entity at the expense of the Palestinian people  in conditions which are all too familiar to this Assembly.249.	Jordan's organic association with the Palestinian cause and its ramifications has always been clear-cut in its vision and its basic principles. Jordan has given clear support to all international efforts pertaining to the question of Palestine and the situation in the Middle East. Jordan has taken a positive attitude  subject to its declared principles  towards the various efforts aimed at achieving a just and comprehensive peace within an acceptable formula under which the international community could shoulder its responsibility for achieving a solution.250.	Just as we have reacted positively and clearly to every genuine effort which might contribute to a just and comprehensive settlement of the question of Palestine and the situation in the Middle East  so we have reacted clearly and vehemently against the Camp David accords because this transaction runs counter to the vital rights and interests of all the parties concerned  with the exception of Israel.251.	The framework of the Camp David agreements totally ignores the core of the issue  save for short-sighted and partial solutions; it repudiates the most elementary of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people.252.	Jordan furthermore regards the Camp David agreements as infringing the basic elements accepted by the international community for any comprehensive and just settlement  elements to which the Arab leaders committed themselves at their Summit Conference  held at Baghdad in November 1978   where they laid down the minimum requirements for such a settlement: first  total Israeli withdrawal from the Arab territories occupied in 1967; secondly  the return of Arab Jerusalem to Arab sovereignty; and thirdly  recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination in their land and their national territory  under the leadership of the PLO.253.	The best evidence of the failure of the Camp David agreements in tackling the question of peaceâquite apart from its perpetuation of Israel's policy of the fait accompli and of separate agreementsâis that the signatories to the framework agreements are suffering today a loss of direction. Some of those signatories have conceded that they have reached an impasse. That Camp David framework has encouraged Israel to ignore the General Assembly resolutions and the Security Council decisions  which are presumed to be binding upon all States. The Camp David framework has brought the region nearer to the perils of war  contrary to its declared purpose of leading the region in the direction of peace  for it has given Israel the opportunity to direct all its military forces against the other Arab fronts with a view to imposing its military dominance over them. Needless to say  it has also enabled Israel to consolidate its occupation and to impose the policy of the fait accompli.254.	The positive and categorical resolutions adopted by the non-aligned movement  the Islamic Conference and the OAU and all other peace-loving States Members of the United Nationsâwhether through their own regional conferences or through their positions at the General Assemblyâconstitute the basic pillar in support of our legitimate and just rights.255.	Jordan considers the Venice Declaration issued on 13 June this year by the European Community as reflecting a positive and responsible change which we hope will be further developed and articulated until it meets the aspirations of the Arab peoples and all peace-loving States. Europe's move on the correct path and its readiness to participate more actively towards a solution of the question of Palestine and the Middle East are a tangible demonstration of the European Community's heightened awareness of its international responsibilities in the cause of peace and in sparing the region the scourge of war  which will not be confined to the area but might threaten the world in its entirety.256.	The Government of Jordan  as part of its efforts towards rectifying the wrongs that are still being perpetrated against Palestine and its people and as a manifestation of its commitment to international legitimacy  has  following consultations with its brethren  decided to request the General Assembly to seek an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice concerning the Israeli practices and the legal status of the occupied Arab territories  whose character Israel is striving to obliterate  whose history is being assiduously distorted and whose occupation Israel is bent on consolidating by murder  annexation  Judaization and colonization.257.	Jordan  as an Arab and Islamic country  is deeply pained by the fratricidal events that are currently occurring in our region between two neighbourly Islamic States. Jordan  whose adherence to resuscitating the Islamic identity is a cardinal principle of its policy  views Islamic solidarity as a vehicle for consolidating Islamic principles and values. This policy makes a salutary and effective contribution to the preservation of international peace and security.258.	Jordan  inspired by its fidelity to the Charter of the United Nations and to the norms of international law and in its unequivocal national commitment  stands by the sister State of Iraq in the latter's defence of its national soil and legitimate Arab rights. It is our hope that the Islamic Republic of Iran will respond positively to the Iraqi initiative for a cease-fire  which would provide a propitious atmosphere for achieving a just settlement based on good-neighbourly relationships and non-interference in the internal affairs of States.259.	We wish to take this opportunity to express to President Zia-ul-Haq of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan our gratitude and appreciation for his goodwill efforts on behalf of the Islamic Conference  and our hope that these efforts will be brought to fruition in the achievement of a just and honourable solution.260.	I should also like to pay a tribute to the efforts of Mr. Agha Shahi  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Pakistan  and to Mr. Habib Al-Shatti  Secretary-General of the Islamic Conference  for their efforts to achieve a solution of this conflict.261.	Our immediate and overriding concern is to stop the bloodshed and destruction and to accord to each side its rightful due  on the basis of international legitimacy  upon which the Charter of the United Nations rests."
"74",3609,"JPN",35,1980,"ï»¿30. Mr. President  on behalf of the Government and people of Japan I should like to extend our congratulations to you on your being elected President of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. I earnestly hope that under your able leadership this session of the General Assembly will prove to be a most fruitful one.31.	I should like also to express my deepest respect to the former President  Mr. Salim  for his leadership of the thirty fourth session of the General Assembly  the sixth and the seventh emergency special sessions  devoted respectively to Afghanistan and Palestine  and the eleventh special session on economic matters that was recently concluded. The success of all those sessions was greatly enhanced by Mr. Salim's guidance  which was truly admirable in its strict impartiality and efficiency.32.	At the same time  I should like to pay a sincere tribute to the Secretary General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  who has been undertaking extremely difficult tasks at a time of great international turmoil. I earnestly hope that he will continue with renewed vigour to fulfil the profoundly important duties that the Charter of the United Nations has entrusted to him.33.	Now I should like to take this opportunity to extend a most hearty welcome to Saint Vincent and the Grenadines as it becomes the one hundred and fifty-fourth Member of the United Nations. My country looks forward to promoting relations of friendship and cooperation with that new Member State  both within the framework of the United Nations and outside it.34.	Exactly 35 years have passed since the establishment of the United Nations. It is no exaggeration to say that the international community  having taken a first dynamic step into the new decade  is approaching a crucial juncture. Just as the decade of the 1980s was dawning  the Soviet Union launched a military intervention in Afghanistan. Furthermore  the conflict in IndoChina is far from a political solution. Those regional confrontations and hostilities continue and in some areas are being intensified. Indeed  this situation contains grave elements that could reverse the entire trend of history towards the relaxation of tensions and closer relations among nations.35.	Moreover  since last year the second oil crisis has spurred an incipient inflation and has resulted in a worsening of the problems of recession and unemployment  which today pose a serious threat to the economy of every nation. Thus  in spite of the self-help efforts of developing countries and the increased assistance efforts of developed countries  the economic development to which all developing countries aspire is being subjected to numerous ordeals.36.	Although prospects for the international community in the 1980s do not warrant optimism  there is no need for us to react with undue pessimism  because by no means does the international environment harbour only such discouraging elements. Having recovered from the devastation of the Second World War  mankind has over the past 35 years been painstakingly building foundations of world peace and prosperity which  in my view  are not so fragile.37.	In the contemporary world  the trend towards multi polarization continues to grow  and interdependence and complementary relations among nations are deepening. In such a community of nations  the basis for the solution of all kinds of problems lies in international cooperation. Indeed  no nation can expect to enjoy peace and prosperity within its own borders unless there is world peace and prosperity.38.	Japan's fundamental diplomatic posture remains unchanged. It consists of the pursuit of peace  refusal to become a military power  and positive efforts to contribute to world peace and prosperity. Today  35 years after the end of the Second World War  Japan's national determination not to become a military Power is deeply rooted among the Japanese people.39.	I hereby declare that in the 1980s Japan is determined to assume international responsibilities commensurate with its capabilities and its status in the international community by contributing more actively to the maintenance of international peace and to the development of the international economy.40.	On the basis of these fundamental perceptions of diplomacy  Japan will continue to make every effort to strengthen its relations with countries throughout the world and thus to work for the advancement of understanding and trust among nations.41.	For example  it is one of the fundamental tasks of Japan's diplomacy to establish a stable relationship  based on true mutual understanding  with the Soviet Union  one of its important neighbours with a different social system. Unfortunately  however  because the question regarding the Northern Territories still remains unresolved  we have not yet concluded a peace treaty with the Soviet Union. Furthermore  we have been confronted with an extremely regrettable situation in which the Soviet Union has recently deployed and strengthened its military forces in our Northern Territories. The Government of Japan does not believe that those actions are conducive to building confidence among nations. From that point of view  the Government of Japan continues to demand of the Soviet Union that this situation be promptly rectified and to endeavour to conclude a peace treaty so that genuinely friendly relations with the Soviet Union can be maintained and promoted. At the same time  Japan strongly hopes that the Soviet Union itself will demonstrate  with concrete deeds as well as with words  good neighbourliness and friendship.42.	Next  among the problems confronting the international community  I should like to bring up those which I feel are particularly important with regard to world peace and stability  as well as international justice  and briefly to present the Government of Japan's views on them.43.	The problem which demands our most immediate attention is the situation in Kampuchea. There are two aspects to the problem. The first has to do with restoring peace in Kampuchea and helping to build a country according to the true self-determination of the people. The second has to do with providing relief to the refugees and the people of Thailand who have been afflicted by the flow of those refugees into their country. Itself an Asian nation  Japan is deeply concerned at the fact that the fighting in Kampuchea still continues  that hundreds of thousands of its people are still struggling for their survival and  above all  that the fighting has recently spilled over into Thailand.44.	One year has already passed since the General Assembly  in an effort to restore peace and fundamentally to resolve the problem  adopted by an overwhelming majority a resolution calling for  inter alia  the withdrawal from Kampuchea of all foreign forces and the exercise of the right of self-determination by the Kampuchean people 45.	Although the Secretary General  Mr. Waldheim  visited Viet Nam and Thailand last August in the hope of finding a solution to the Kampuchean problem  it is highly regrettable that not even a hint of a peaceful solution has yet been found. Japan takes this opportunity to make a strong appeal once again to the international community and particularly to all the parties to the conflict for the complete implementation of the resolution. Only in this way can peace be restored to the Kampuchean people who  trapped in devastating conditions  are suffering in the midst of the fighting or are being forced to flee to neighbouring countries.46.	I believe that the United Nations should take a new initiative to create an atmosphere in which a settlement as called for in the resolution can be realized. In order not to aggravate the instability of the region  our most urgent task is to prevent by all means the conflict in Kampuchea from spreading once again into neighbouring Thailand. Moreover  I earnestly hope that in the course of this session of the General Assembly there will be further concrete and useful discussions about such matters as the time  venue and agenda of an international conference on Kampuchea  as contained in General Assembly resolution 34/22 and which Japan has been advocating since last year. I also hope that guidelines regarding these issues will be set forth in any new resolution to be adopted during the current session. In this connexion  my country fully supports and  in fact  has become a cosponsor of  the new draft resolution regarding the situation in Kampuchea which was submitted by ASEAN and other countries and which incorporates  inter alia  these fundamental views of my Government. We are confident that all countries which strictly abide by international justice will support it as well.47.	Last month  I myself visited the area along the Thai Kampuchean border and witnessed with my own eyes the miserable conditions of the refugees and Thai people affected in the nearby areas. Thus  in addition to resolving the political problem  another urgent task of the international community is to bring humanitarian relief to the masses of people who have been victimized by the Kampuchean conflict. Particular mention should be made of the fact that life for the Thai people along the Kampuchean border is being threatened by the tremendous influx of Kampuchean refugees. The Government of Japan pays a high tribute to the considerable success of the cooperative efforts of the international organizations and Governments concerned in providing humanitarian relief to the refugees and people affected  and is determined to cooperate further in such relief activities.48.	However  in order to make the humanitarian assistance to the Kampuchean people more effective  it is urgently necessary to improve the distribution of relief supplies. Thus  I should like to renew our appeal to the international community regarding the need to establish demilitarized peace zones as proposed by the ASEAN countries and Japan. According to this proposal  in order to ensure the safe and effective distribution of relief goods  certain areas within Kampuchea should be designated demilitarized zones of peace  with consultations between international relief organizations and the parties concerned. I should like to urge that the relevant United Nations agencies promptly begin consultations with the parties concerned on the establishment of such zones  and that all countries concerned transcend political differences  and  from a purely humanitarian viewpoint  support the establishment of the demilitarized peace zones. It is essential that they cooperate to the fullest extent with the relief activities of international organizations for the Kampuchean people. I also hope that  in order to implement this plan effectively  the relevant organizations of the United Nations will play an active role in monitoring the demilitarized peace zones. The establishment of such zones  as well as the dispatch to Thailand of United Nations observer teams  which has been urged by the ASEAN countries and supported by Japan  are temporary emergency arrangements  but I hardly need stress once again that  in order for lasting stability to be achieved in Southeast Asia  it is necessary to find a solution that goes to the very root of the Kampuchean question.49.	The military intervention in Afghanistan by the Soviet Union at the end of last year not only violates the main principles of non-intervention and non-use of force as contained in the United Nations Charter  it also seriously jeopardizes international peace and security. The international community absolutely cannot tolerate such a flagrant challenge to international law and justice. This was clearly demonstrated by the fact that at the sixth emergency special session of the General Assembly held last 10 to 14 January  a resolution calling for the immediate  unconditional and total withdrawal of the foreign troops was adopted by an overwhelming majority. It was also clearly shown by the fact that two similar resolutions were subsequently adopted at the Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers  held at Islamabad from 27 to 29 January 1980 and from 17 to 22 May 1980 respectively.50.	The Government of Japan cannot but express its profound concern over the fact that  despite repeated appeals by the international community  the Soviet Union continues to station its troops in Afghanistan and to prevent the establishment of a Government according to the free will of the Afghan people  thereby posing a threat not only to neighbouring countries  but to the entire world. We therefore strongly urge the Soviet Union to withdraw its troops immediately and to respect the Afghan people's right to self-determination. Moreover  I sincerely hope that  based on General Assembly resolution ES-6/2  the United Nations will adopt a new resolution containing concrete measures for a solution to this problem.51.	The problem of the Afghan refugees  which has been exacerbated by the Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan  is no less painful to me than the IndoChinese refugee problem. I visited the refugee camps in Pakistan last month after my visit to the camps in Thailand in order to acquire a better understanding of the problems and to discover what measures Japan  as well as the international community  should take. The human conscience cannot ignore the plight of people  whatever their nationality  who  in order to avoid the disasters of war  are forced to flee from their homelands with only the clothes on their backs and to wander in desperation  suffering from starvation and disease. I firmly believe that the international community  while hastening to find a political solution to the underlying cause of the problem  should also for purely humanitarian reasons extend a helping hand to these unfortunate people.52.	For its part  Japan has of its own volition provided relief for refugees around the world through major contributions to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and to UNRWA  and is resolved to continue this assistance in the future. As an Asian nation  Japan is particularly concerned about the refugees in IndoChina and Afghanistan. We feel great sympathy as well for the difficulties which the Governments of Thailand and Pakistan are experiencing as a result of receiving the refugees. Japan sincerely hopes that  with the support of the international community  the Governments of both countries will be able to overcome these difficulties.53.	I am profoundly disturbed about the fact that  even after such a long period of time  no solution has been found to the problem of the occupation of the American Embassy in Iran and the taking hostage of its diplomatic personnel. Not only is this incident a violation of established international law  but its illegality has been pointed out by resolutions of the Security Council and the judgement of the International Court of Justice.  Thus  it is a matter of concern which the international community can by no means ignore. It is my sincere hope that the hostages will be released as soon as possible and that the question may be resolved peacefully. I have been following with intense interest the developments in Iran that have been reported over the past few days.54.	In addition  present indications that the conflict between Iran and Iraq is intensifying are a source of grave concern to me. I strongly hope that the fighting will cease immediately and that both countries will seek a solution of any conflict in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.55.	The situation on the Korean peninsula  which lies in close proximity to Japan  is also a matter of great concern to us.56.	New developments have been witnessed in the Republic of Korea since last autumn. We sincerely hope that the stability of that country will be maintained and that its steady development will be achieved. It is our earnest wish that the parties concerned will continue to make strenuous efforts towards peace and the relaxation of tensions in the region. There still exist marked differences between South and North  but we strongly hope that  in order to achieve genuine peace and stability in the Korean peninsula  both sides will promote a dialogue and will gradually undertake exchanges in various fields with the aim of deepening mutual understanding.57.	I now wish to turn to the question of the Middle East. The solution of the question of the Middle East is essential not only to regional stability and development but to international peace and ability as well.58.	Japan's basic position on the Middle East question was clearly stated by its representative at the seventh emergency special session of the General Assembly on the question of Palestine  held last July.59.	In order to achieve a just and lasting peace in the Middle East  we believe that Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) must be completely implemented  that Israel must withdraw from all the territories occupied since the war in 1967 and that the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people  including the right of self-determination  must be recognized and respected in accordance with the United Nations Charter.60.	Accordingly  Japan supports the principles contained in  and the spirit of  General Assembly resolution 3236 (XXIX) of 22 November 1974 and resolution ES7/2 of 29 July 1980  which recognized the right of self-determination of the Palestinian people.61.	In order to ensure that these resolutions will constitute a firm basis for achieving a just peace in the Middle East Japan believes that it is necessary to incorporate into them one of the essential elements of a just solution  that is  respect for and acknowledgement of the right of every State in the region to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries.62.	We recognize the significance of the Palestine question  which is the core of the Middle East problem  and are convinced that in order to bring about a just solution of the question it is essential that Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]  which represents the Palestinian people  recognize each other's positions and that the PLO participate in the peace process. We should also like to stress the necessity for the parties concerned to make concerted and sincere efforts to create an atmosphere conducive to a just solution of the question. In this regard  Japan is profoundly concerned about an impasse in the Palestinian autonomy talks and the deterioration of the situation in the West Bank and finds it most regrettable that the primary cause stems from Israel's occupation policies  such as the establishment of settlements in the occupied territories and its steps to annex East Jerusalem. We sincerely hope that Israel will  with good grace  pay heed to the voice of the international community and demonstrate a courageous and flexible attitude towards the peace talks.63.	Japan supports all international endeavours for a just solution of the question and will vigorously cooperate so that the results obtained so far will not be jeopardized but will continue to be supplemented and promoted. In accordance with its independent viewpoint  it is Japan's policy to explore actively possible solutions of the problem.64.	In southern Africa  the fact that the question of Southern Rhodesia  which had been a major concern of the international community  was peacefully resolved through negotiations deserves our heartfelt congratulations.65.	The continued practice of racial discrimination in South Africa  however  goes against the trend of history towards establishing majority rule and must be strongly condemned. Japan  a country that has resolutely opposed racial discrimination in any form since the time of the League of Nations  strongly urges the Government of South Africa to make efforts to eradicate racial discrimination.66.	Furthermore  it is utterly deplorable that the Republic of South Africa maintains an intransigent attitude which has prevented the establishment of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group for Namibian independence. Japan has declared its readiness to participate actively in the United Nations Transition Assistance Group and earnestly hopes that it will be established in the very near future.67.	Disarmament is indispensable to the achievement of international peace. In this  the first year of the Second Disarmament Decade  we should renew our firm commitment to the promotion of disarmament. As a first step towards making the Second Disarmament Decade a ""fruitful decade""  I should like to make a strong appeal for the early conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty and a treaty prohibiting chemical weapons  for which the international community has long been waiting.68.	The second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament is scheduled for 1982. My country intends to play an active role from the early stages of the preparatory work.69.	World peace is essential for the prosperity of the people of any nation; conversely  the prosperity of the people  which depends upon the stability and development of the world economy  is essential as a foundation for the true and firm establishment of world peace. In this connexion  as  on the threshold of the 1980s  we observe the world economy  we find that the economies of countries throughout the world are beset with numerous difficulties such as inflation  recession  unemployment an J balance of payments imbalances.70.	One thing that is certain in the present world economy  however  is the fact that at this time of deepening interdependent relations  the economic prosperity of any country will not be attainable without the harmonious development and expansion of the world economy. Accordingly  it is essential that each country in the world assume its proper role and carry out its responsibilities in a spirit of international cooperation.71.	During the eleventh special session of the General Assembly  which has just concluded  Japan stressed the notion of the shared responsibility of the North and the South in tackling various problems and in seeking and exploring mutually beneficial solutions  because it is our fundamental belief that such a responsible attitude on the part of the North and the South will be to the advantage of both sides.72.	Thus  I should like to welcome the fact that the special session was able in effect to conclude discussions on a new International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade. It is vitally important that the North South dialogue be patiently continued  and that truly harmonious relations between the North and the South be generated within a long-term perspective. Accordingly  I sincerely hope that  based on the results of the special session just concluded  preparations for launching the global negotiations will be finalized during this session.73.	In this connexion  and in light of the fact that  more than anything else  the rapid increase in the price of oil is seriously affecting the entire world economy  including the economies of non-oil producing developing countries  I should like to point out that the energy problem  including oil  is an area which deserves our urgent and priority attention and with which both producers and consumers must deal seriously in a spirit of cooperation.74.	The cooperation extended by developed countries for nation building  as well as for human resources development  in developing countries is essential for strengthening the foundation of world peace and stability.75.	In the firm belief that it is the responsibility of developed countries to respond to the legitimate expectations of developing countries  Japan has been cooperating to the best of its ability with the self-reliant efforts of developing countries in promoting their economic and social development.76.	First of all  I should like to outline Japan's policy with respect to development assistance. I am pleased to confirm that the medium-term target set by Japan to double its official development assistance within three years from 1978 will be achieved this year as scheduled. Furthermore  Japan intends to maintain this positive attitude hereafter by making further efforts to increase the amount of its official development assistance  as well as to improve the ratio of official development assistance to its gross national product. As for areas to be covered by its official development assistance  Japan's policy is to stress the importance of humanitarian assistance and cooperation for the development of human resources as well as assistance in such fields as agriculture and energy.77.	Secondly  with regard to the expansion of trade in developing countries  I should like to call attention to the noteworthy progress that has recently been achieved in the field of primary commodity exports for the benefit of many developing countries. I am referring specifically to the Agreement establishing the Common Fund for Commodities which  after many years of effort  was finally adopted at Geneva on 27 June 1980  at the United Nations Negotiating Conference on a Common Fund under the Integrated Programme for Commodities."" Recognizing the Common Fund's importance to the economic stability of many developing countries  Japan has worked unceasingly for its early establishment and intends to contribute a total of more than $60 million to the Fund  which includes the largest contribution to be provided to the Fund's second window.78.	I should now like to turn to the question of the maintenance of peace  and to present a few concrete ideas concerning measures which would enable the United Nations better to fulfil its fundamental purposes as contained in the Charter of the United Nations.79.	First of all  it is essential that Member States demonstrate maximal respect for political resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the Security Council in the field of the maintenance of peace. It is extremely regrettable  in this connexion  to note the tendency in recent years for parties directly involved in a conflict to disregard  and in certain cases openly to challenge  important political resolutions which are supported by the overwhelming majority of Member States of the United Nations and  which  as such  reflect the collective will of the international community. I should like to appeal to those parties to show utmost respect for the resolutions of the United Nations.80.	Secondly  I should like to refer to some concrete measures for enhancing the fact-finding functions of the United Nations which my Government proposed during the general debate of this Assembly last year  namely that  whenever a serious dispute arises  a representative of the Secretary General would be stationed at the scene for a certain period of time in order to investigate the facts of the situation and to report to the Secretary General from time to time. We are convinced that recent incidents  such as that which occurred along the border between Thailand and Kampuchea  have underscored even further the real relevance of our proposal. We hope that the Secretary General would make even greater use of the powers conferred upon him by the Charter of the United Nations and would take active steps in this regard. Furthermore  we should like to appeal to all Member States to render their maximal support to the Secretary General as he carries out his responsibilities.81. Thirdly  I should like to take up the question of limiting the veto power in the Security Council. Although we recognize the necessity of maintaining the veto system itself  it would certainly enhance the peacekeeping functions of the Security Council if abuse of that power could be restricted as much as possible. Thus we shall follow with interest future deliberations on that question at such forums as the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization.82 I should like to confine myself to making  just as an example  a specific suggestion concerning the function of the Security Council in connexion with the fact-finding functions of the United Nations as a whole  which I have just mentioned. Since Article 34 of the Charter  which attributes to the Security Council its important fact finding function  has been interpreted as being subject to the veto of the permanent members  the Council has been unable to perform that function in major international conflicts where a permanent member may in some way be involved. We therefore believe that the United Nations should  as soon as possible  take measures which would result in preventing the permanent members from exercising their veto power  at least in decisions relating to the Council's fact finding function under Article 34. We are convinced that the smooth functioning of the Security Council in the fact finding field would enable it to cope more effectively with situations as they develop  and thus help to strengthen dramatically the peacekeeping functions of the United Nations.83.	The international community can never maintain peace by remaining idle in today's world  where there is a tendency openly to challenge the law and order of the international community and where such challenges can result in a fait accompli which eventually simply pushes aside international justice. It is essential that each member of the community of nations share the common responsibility for pursuing world peace  in the conviction that its own peace cannot be maintained unless peace prevails in the rest of the world. It is precisely such efforts actively to fulfil our responsibilities towards peace that will determine whether we shall be successful in handing down to future generations an international environment that is a little more peaceful and a little more congenial than that which we experience today.84.	In concluding my statement  I should like to confirm once again that  for its part  my Government is ready and eager to carry out even more positively Japan's proper responsibilities towards the construction of a peaceful international community."
"75",3681,"KEN",35,1980,"ï»¿Mr. President  I congratulate you on your election as President of the General Assembly. This recognition of your qualities of leadership and your demonstrated skills and experience in diplomacy is a tribute to you personally and to your country  with which my country has long-standing cordial and fruitful relations. My delegation will co-operate with you and give you all possible support in the discharge of your responsibilities as President of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly.2.	I also wish to pay a tribute to your predecessor  Ambassador Salim of the United Republic of Tanzania  who presided over the General Assembly during an unusually busy and difficult year. He did a good job under difficult circumstances. The United Nations and the international community as a whole owe him a debt of gratitude.3.	The ever expanding responsibilities of the United Nations have occasioned the growth of staff and financial burdens that in turn have increased the burdens of managing the Organization. My delegation would like to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General and his staff for taking the Organization through these very difficult years.4.	This year our Organization has grown to include 154 Members. We welcome the sister State of Zimbabwe  whose delegation is attending the regular session of the General Assembly for the first time. For many years my country has joined hands with many others in supporting the people of Zimbabwe to eliminate the racism and colonialism that held them in subjugation. Their success has given us immense joy. We also warmly welcome Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to the United Nations family. We look forward to having fruitful relations with them.5.	The annual general debate of the General Assembly is always a suitable occasion to review the year that is passing. Without any doubt  the past year has been turbulent. Ever fragile  international peace and security have been threatened in many parts of the world  and have actually been broken seriously in some. The problem in Kampuchea has not been resolved; the situation in Afghanistan has become worse; the situation in Iran continues to cause anxiety. Since this session started  the conflict between Iraq and Iran has exploded into open war  thus creating a situation full of grave threats to international peace. The conflict in Lebanon continues. In Africa  the problem of Western Sahara remains unsolved to date  while in the Horn of Africa peace continues to be under constant threat. These breaches of international peace are occurring with increasing frequency  and unless something is done to halt their occurrence by encouraging the peaceful settlement of disputes  the situation will soon get out of hand.6.	These problems are not new  but they form a disturbing pattern. Some States Members of this Organization fail to honour their obligations under the Charter and in some cases completely ignore or deliberately act contrary to international law or to specific treaties or conventions.7.	In Namibia  the United Nations has been frustrated in its efforts to bring to an end the unlawful occupation of the Territory by the illegitimate and odious apartheid regime of South Africa. Although negotiations on Namibia's freedom were completed more than two years ago and agreement was reached  South Africa has continued to engage in transparent delaying tactics calculated to deflate pressure for action by the United Nations  while doing nothing to bring to an end its own illegal occupation of the Territory. Indeed  it has continued its efforts to create institutions and puppets through which it hopes it will continue to direct the affairs of Namibia and to exploit its resources after completing the semblance of withdrawal. The United Nations must reject all those manoeuvres and take enforcement measures under the Charter of the United Nations to heal that ugly sore. Namibia must be free.8.	South Africa is the only country in the world in which human beings are sorted out like animals on the basis of the pigmentation of their skin and then granted or denied their basic human rights according to that classification. To satisfy the official racist policies of separation  even the whites continue to be subjected to punishment for crossing the colour line in certain kinds of behaviour. The so-called Coloureds or Bantus continue to be treated like beasts of burden. The tyranny of the system has no limits. Indeed  the whole system is so full of contradictions and inconsistencies that only the most oppressive and brutal violence of State machinery can hold it unsteadily together. That constitutes a constant source of threat to world peace.â9.	Indeed  in the past few years that danger has already been manifested in the aggressive raids South Africa has repeatedly mounted against Angola  Zambia and Mozambique. Within South Africa itself  the machinery of State has committed numerous murders. Oppression by the State continues. Children of the oppressed have demonstrated by their actions that the situation is a dangerous time bomb. The bomb is bound to explode unless prompt action is taken.10.	It is saddening to note that no acceptable solution of the problem in the Middle East has been found. For a long time now we have witnessed the miserable plight of the Palestinian people  dispossessed  dispersed and uprooted from their land. My delegation has made its views known on many occasions in the deliberations of this Organization on the question of the rights of the Palestinian people. We still believe that no lasting peace can be achieved until the legitimate interests of the Palestinian people are taken into account and adequately safeguarded. We continue to call upon those directly concerned to be realistic and to address themselves to the real issues with a determination to resolve the problems. The basic elements involve the acceptance by all parties of the following: first  the right of all States in the region to live in peace and in recognized and therefore secure boundaries; secondly  the withdrawal of Israel from all Arab territories occupied since 1967  and also from East Jerusalem  as already decided upon by the United Nations; and thirdly  recognition of the right of the Palestinians to a national home  free  independent and sovereign.11.	As long as the parties to the dispute continue to refuse to recognize the essential elements of this problem  the Middle East will continue to pose a threat to international peace and security. Failure to settle this problem today will not make it easier to solve it in the future. If anything  it will make it even more difficult.12.	The problem of Cyprus continues to elude solution  but we urge the communities to make every effort to find a negotiated settlement. Clearly  acquisition of territory by force and the transplantation of populations is not the way to find a lasting peace. We urge the people of Cyprus to recognize their long-term interests and to make use of the opportunity provided by the presence of the United Nations to negotiate a lasting solution that will preserve the integrity of Cyprus.13.	The recent development in Korea is of great concern. This concerns the sudden unilateral suspension of the ongoing South-North working level contacts by North Korea  which causes a great threat to the peace and stability of the Korean peninsula. We urge South Korea and North Korea  the parties directly concerned  to resume the dialogue immediately in accordance with the letter and spirit of the South- North Joint Communique of 4 July 1972 ' thereby easing the tension and improving relations as a means of moving closer towards the attainment of a peaceful solution of the Korean problem.14.	I should like to draw attention to the continuing arms race. Large proportions of national resources continue to be devoted to the production of arms in preparation for war. We consider this to be not only a dangerous but also an unjustifiable use of resources badly needed for development. This unnecessary arms race continues while many deserving projects aimed at improving the quality of human life desperately lack resources. The improvement of the quality of life on this planet is a pre-condition of peace  and we must all work for it. We appreciate that meaningful disarmament negotiations depend heavily on the improvement of relations between the super-Powers. It is for that reason  among others  that we note with regret that in the past year the international climate has deteriorated considerably. This should not serve as an excuse to reverse the momentum that has been built up in the improvement of international relations. The momentum must be maintained if mankind is to survive.15.	We have all agreed that nuclear weapons constitute a major threat to our world today. Kenya is against the proliferation of nuclear weapons and we should like to appeal to all Governments to support efforts towards halting the dangerous process of nuclear proliferation. Successful efforts to create a fool proof non-proliferation regime presupposes a will to co-operate on the part of the nuclear- weapon Powers. They have heavy responsibilities. Many of us who have voluntarily renounced any right to acquire nuclear weapons under the terms of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons are  however  interested in the potential benefits of peaceful applications of nuclear energy. We do not believe that the peaceful application of nuclear energy will automatically lead to proliferation of nuclear weapons as long as all States  nuclear and non-nuclear  agree to observe strictly the safeguards laid down by IAEA. We strongly appeal to the nuclear-weapon States  as well as to the developed countries which possess sophisticated civilian nuclear technology  to implement article IV of the non- proliferation Treaty.16 	Having given up our right to acquire nuclear weapons  we believe that we have every right to insist that the efforts to stop horizontal nuclear proliferation should be matched by equal efforts on the part of the nuclear-weapon States themselves to stop vertical proliferation. We cannot be convinced of the sincerity of the nuclear-weapon States as long as their actions in increasing the sophisticated use of nuclear energy for armaments do not conform with their frequent protestations of willingness to decelerate and subsequently to stop altogether the nuclear arms race.17 	The failure of the Second Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons should not be used as an excuse to abandon or wreck ongoing dialogue in other disarmament forums.18.	We have waited a long time for this body to receive the final results of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea   which is dealing with the important question of concluding a comprehensive treaty on the law of the sea. While we regret that nine sessions of that Conference have failed to produce a treaty  we are encouraged by the report that remarkable progress has been made in resolving the outstanding issues and that we should expect to sign a treaty in the course of the year 1981. We hope  however  that such a treaty will deal adequately with the rights and obligations of States parties in all the designated areas.19.	Similarly  we should like to see questions regarding the transfer of technology adequately dealt with so that developing countries which have hitherto been left behind in this field will receive sufficient consideration. We also consider that the new machinery envisaged for the resolution of issues within the Council and the Assembly  the principal organs of the Authority  will be worked out in a manner that will be fair and equitable in so far as the world community as a whole is concerned. In this connection  we have welcomed the recent progress made with respect to the resolution of issues in both the Council and the Assembly in relation to the deep-sea mining of manganese nodules.20.	I wish to reiterate our position on this matter. We are totally opposed to any procedures that would grant certain States the right to veto decisions. We consider that to be inconsistent with the principle of the sovereign equality of States and also the principle of the right of every State to dispose of its own resources in the manner best suited to it. Thus  in welcoming the results of the negotiations regarding the voting procedures in the Council  we consider that in the event of a failure to reach a consensus the issues which remain unresolved should be referred to the Assembly for resolution. It is our view that the Assembly  being the most representative body and the principle organ of authority  is the organ best suited for that purpose. We intend to press for the adoption of that approach at the next session of the Conference next year.21.	We consider the question of the transfer of technology to the Enterprise to be a major issue requiring very careful treatment. We take the view that in order for the Enterprise to get off the ground it must be provided with the necessary technology. We shall therefore maintain at the next session of the Conference that the transfer of technology should be a continuous process throughout the 25 years of mining activities instead of the 10 years now proposed in the text. Furthermore we shall seek to obtain for the Enterprise the transfer of technology in relation to the processing and marketing of the manganese nodules once they have been recovered from the sea-bed.22.	We have alluded to the question of the identification  with a reasonable measure of certainty  of the rights and obligations of States arising from the new areas designated under the Convention on the law of the sea  Of particular importance in our view is the question of the delimitation of the continental shelf and of the exclusive economic zones of opposite and adjacent States. Negotiations on that issue continue to be difficult and we doubt if agreement could be reached on the basis of an equidistance criterion  which is urged by a number of States. We urge that principles of equity be explored further in order to resolve the remaining problems without delay.23.	The 10 years following the launching of the Second United Nations Development Decade will go down in history as the decade of great but lost opportunities. The decisions emanating from the numerous conferences we have held since then on problems of development have hardly been implemented. These include the recommendations of the sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly  held respectively in 1974 and 1975. The world community must demonstrate a greater degree of seriousness in tackling the problems involved.24.	Energy is one of the most serious problems of this decade and even of this century. The economic situation of the developing nations has been made particularly gloomy because of the energy crisis and will almost certainly remain so for some time to come. Kenya is one of the developing countries seriously affected by the energy crisis and it was one of the first countries to see the urgent and imperative need to shift the dependence of countries from petroleum to a greater reliance on alternative new and renewable sources of energy. It is our hope that the United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy  to be held at Nairobi in August 1981  will offer the world community a rare opportunity to find alternative solutions to our energy problems. My Government looks forward with enthusiasm to acting as host to that Conference and we wish the Preparatory Committee for the Conference every success.25.	On international trade and raw materials we should like to see a substantial increase in the developing countries' trade in manufactures. Furthermore  we seek differentials and more favourable treatment of the developing countries and the elimination of non-tariff barriers and other aspects of protectionism.26.	As for economic and technical co-operation among the developing countries  Kenya calls on them to intensify their activities at sub-regional  regional and inter-regional levels and to undertake regular studies to expand trade and monetary co-operation among themselves. We consider it essential for the developing nations also to increase their share in the trading  transport  marketing and distribution of their primary commodities.27.	We also urge the countries able to do so to provide financial and technical support to enable the countries of the South to realize their objectives. The developing nations have constantly called for reform of the international monetary system and the early achievement of the target of official development assistance. We regret that the developed countries have not yet increased the transfer of resources in real terms to the developing nations to the extent stipulated in the United Nations decision 28.	The International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade  agreed upon at the eleventh special session of the General Assembly was not fully representative of the interests of the developing countries. We hope and believe that the provision in the Strategy for a review and appraisal mechanism  as well as for the implementation of regional development strategies such as the Lagos Plan of Action for the Implementation of the Monrovia Strategy for the Economic Development of Africa  will strengthen the Strategy in the course of the decade and accelerate its implementation.29.	It is essential that the Strategy for the 1980s should  among other things  secure a substantial average annual growth in agricultural production in the developing countries. In order to improve the quality of life in the rural areas it is necessary to have a higher rate of food and agricultural production  food security and storage and a reduction in food losses. Problems of food and agricultural development therefore call for national and international action to achieve collective self-sufficiency in food. They also call for increased capital from external sources 30.	We note with appreciation the agreement and recognition at the Industrial Development Board's recent session of the fact that Africa is the least developed of all the developing regions  and that consequently the General Assembly should proclaim the decade of 1980-1990 as the industrial development decade for Africa. As the least developed region containing the largest number of least developed  land-locked and most seriously affected developing countries  Africa requires massive financial and technical support. We hope that donor countries and the international community as a whole will make substantial contributions towards the achievement of the objectives of the decade in Africa.31.	Similarly  we call on the donor countries and the international community to contribute substantially towards the fulfilment of the needs of the continent in the field of transport and communications. Improvement of this system will enhance intra-African trade and develop the rural areas of the African continent. Adequate and continued support is essential for the implementation of the Transport and Communications Decade in Africa  which terminates in 1988.32.	Science and technology are crucial elements for the achievement of the objectives of the Third United Nations Development Decade. High priority must therefore be given to the improvement of the capacity of the developing countries to make better use of science and technology for development. Indigenous developments in science and technology should be brought into national planning in order to help reduce the problem of the brain drain by creating research centres in these countries and accelerating the process of their transformation and development.33.	We cannot stress strongly enough the need to pay greater attention to the four special categories of States recognized by the United Nations. We urge the international community and countries in a position to do so to take measures to assist them to overcome their problems of economic development.34.	When I addressed the eleventh special session of this Assembly five weeks ago  I stressed my Government's concern at the structural disequilibrium and critical situation in which the world economy finds itself today. We are experiencing the worst economic crisis since the 1930s  and there is every indication from present trends that the situation is likely to get worse. Knowing this  we owe it to posterity to make a greater effort to resolve the remaining issues in the North-South dialogue during this session as far as we can.35.	This year  we witnessed yet another world conference  the World Conference of the United Nations Decade for Women  which was held at Copenhagen from 14 to 30 July. The theme of this Conference was Equality  Development and Peace. Besides taking up many political questions and economic issues  the Conference focused  among other topics  on employment  health and education.36.	On the whole  the Conference came out with a very constructive World Plan of Action covering almost all issues of concern to human development. It further underscored the fact that the issues that concern the world today are also the concern of women and  therefore  women should be involved in all national and international activities and at all levels. My Government supported the Plan of Action produced by the Conference  and we shall endeavour to implement it to the best of our ability.37.	In a resolution of that Conference  it was decided to convene another Conference in 1985 to review the achievements of the Decade for Women and to take stock of all that will have happened during the Decade. The Conference wilt also deliberate on what remains to be done in order to continue to improve the condition of women all over the world  The Kenyan Government offered to host that Conference at Nairobi in 1985. We hope this offer will be accepted by the General Assembly.38.	In conclusion  let me say this: the world community owes it to posterity to remove poverty  disease and hunger from this planetâat least  to make substantial contributions towards that goal. We have the resources  we have the technology. Let us together demonstrate the political will to get on with the job."
"76",3752,"KHM",35,1980,"ï»¿First of all  on behalf of the delegation of Democratic Kampuchea  I should like to extend my warmest congratulations to Mr. Riidiger von Wechmar of the Federal Republic of Germany  on his unanimous election to the presidency of our General Assembly. This is a tribute both to his personal qualities and to his great country  which has consistently played an increasingly important role in the world. I am convinced that under his enlightened leadership the work of our Assembly will be successful.81.	My delegation would also like 10 associate itself with other delegates in extending its warm gratitude to the outgoing President  Mr. Salim of the United Republic of Tanzania  who over the past year has exerted himself to the utmost in the cause of peace  security and stability in the world  particularly in the region to which my country belongs.82.	We should also like to extend our most sincere gratitude to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  for his tireless efforts for world peace and to ensure that the United Nations fulfils its heavy responsibilities.83.	The delegation of Democratic Kampuchea would also like to take this opportunity to welcome warmly to membership in the United Nations the Republic of Zimbabwe which has just become an independent and sovereign State after a stubborn struggle. We should like at the same time to bid a cordial welcome to another new Member of our Organization  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.84.	We also wish to convey our warm gratitude and our most cordial greetings to all countries throughout the world which love peace and justice and have endeavoured to make a valuable contribution to the just national cause of the survival of the people of Kampuchea.85.	The past year has seen the international situation evolve in the direction of greater tension and complexity.The increased aggressiveness and hegemonistic ambitions of international expansionists are the cause of this. After the aggression against Kampuchea by Hanoi and the invasion of Afghanistan by the Kremlin  the threat of the spread of war in South-East Asia  in southern Asia  in the Middle East and throughout the world has been growing  while a new conflict has just broken out in the oil-producing regions of the Middle East  thus piling up factors that are liable to lead to a third world war.86.	The United Nations is quite rightly concerned at the deterioration of the international situation and has put forward relevant proposals to contain it. In particular  with regard to the problem of Kampuchea and that of Afghanistan  it has taken a just and correct position by calling for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Kampuchea and Afghanistan in order to allow the peoples of these countries to exercise the inalienable right to decide for themselves their own destinies without foreign interference. All peoples that love peace and justice have given their firm support to this just position.87.	But the Hanoi authorities and the Soviet international expansionists have not only turned a deaf ear to the repeated demands made by the whole of mankind  but  what is more  they are violating ever further and ever more arrogantly the Charter of the United Nations and the principles governing international relations. Applying the law of the jungle  they are stepping up their aggression in Kampuchea and Afghanistan. They are  in particular  using chemical weapons  although they have been universally prohibited by international conventions  and are taking their cynicism so far as to use the weapon of starvation in order to exterminate the people of Kampuchea the more speedily. At the same time  under the cover of a sham detente  they are intensifying the arms race.88.	For the small and medium-sized countries  like Democratic Kampuchea  the United Nations still remains the last resort for the preservation of their independence and sovereignty. In face of the challenge offered by the Vietnamese- Soviet expansionists who so impudently violate the Charter of the United Nations and international law  it is the duty of our Organization strictly to enforce respect for its fundamental principles and in no way to permit expansionists to trample these principles underfoot. Otherwise  our Organization will not be able to provide any solution for the various problems in the world and will thus have lost prestige and effectiveness. Small and great expansionists will then have a free hand to lord it over the world  bringing our planet dangerously near to the brink of cataclysm through their unbridled ambition and unlimited adventurism.89.	Although having to face a most barbarous war of aggression  the people and Government of Democratic Kampuchea have none the less been paying serious attention to the grave problems of the world. In this regard  concerning Korea  we are gratified at the position of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  which calls for a solution of the Korean question by peaceful means  without foreign interference. This is a positive contribution that is in keeping with the deep-rooted aspirations of the Korean people for an independent and peaceful reunification of their country  as well as with the interests of peace.90.	We are categorically opposed to the annexation of Jerusalem by Israel. The Arab and Palestinian territories occupied since 1967 must be returned. We repeat our firm support for the exercise of the national rights of the Palestinian people  which is continuing its heroic struggle under the leadership of the PLO.91.	With regard to Namibia  the relevant resolutions of the United Nations should be put into effect so that the Namibian people  under the leadership of SWAPO  can recover their independence and dignity. We repeat here our constant support for the just struggle of the people of Azania against the colonialist and racist regime of apartheid of South Africa.92.	Finally  the tension maintained in the Horn of Africa by the Soviet expansionists remains a subject of concern for all.93.	Twenty-two months have elapsed since the occupation of Phnom Penh by the invading troops of Hanoi. For many the conflict between Democratic Kampuchea and the Socialist Republic of Viet Namâwhich came out into the open on 31 December 1977 with the breaking off of diplomatic relations between the two countriesâwas like a peal of thunder in a clear sky. But enlightened observers of Asian matters were not surprised  because they were aware that the ambition of the Hanoi authorities to swallow up Kampuchea and Laos so as to integrate them into the so-called ""Indo-Chinese federation"" went back as far as 1930  the date of the founding of the ""Indo-Chinese Communist Party""  composed solely of Vietnamese  and whose very name even at that time revealed the hegemonistic designs of its founders. Furthermore  the Vietnamese strategy of the ""Indo-Chinese federation""  which is nothing else than the ""Greater Viet Nam""  was writ large in the statute of that Party. The Vietnamese invasion of Democratic Kampuchea in December 1978 is thus only the logical outcome of a whole concatenation of conflicts which have become unceasingly worse over the years  conflicts caused deliberately by the expansionist designs of Hanoi. Still  Hanoi has endeavoured to swallow up Kampuchea quietly  as was the case with Laos  without world public opinion being aware of it. To this end  it has had recourse to attempted coups dâÃ©tat and assassinations of the leaders of Democratic Kampuchea carried out by its agents who long ago had infiltrated the State machinery in order to overthrow the Government of Democratic Kampuchea from within. But this was a futile effort. The fact that Hanoi has been forced to resort to overt aggression and thus to show its hand is by no means the least of its setbacks  because the myth of Viet Nam as the champion of national liberation has collapsed like a house of cards.94.	For a better understanding of the problem  we must take a look at history because  as part of the strategy of the ""Indo-Chinese federation""  everything possible was done to bring this about.95.	The first Indo-Chinese war was an opportunity for the Hanoi authorities to intervene openly in Kampuchea on the pretext of anti-colonialist solidarity. In reality  the leaders and troops of the Vietminh were sent to Kampuchea to wrest control of that country from the French colonial administration under the disguise of a so-called Khmer resistance movement. It was since that time that the Indo- Chinese Communist Party  alias the Vietnamese Communist Party  began to recruit and train agents  who later on succeeded in infiltrating and working their way up to high- level positions in the State apparatus of Democratic Kampuchea.96.	But  following the Agreements reached at the Geneva Conference of July 1954  the Vietnamese troops had to withdraw from Kampuchea. Benefiting from this ebbing of Hanoi's influence over the national liberation movement of Kampuchea  the Kampuchean patriots decided to take over the leadership of the struggle of the Kampuchean people  relying on their own efforts. The Hanoi authorities never forgave the Kampuchean patriotic movement for having taken this independent and sovereign line. They did everything possible to fight it and to distort it. In the 1960s  they took advantage of facilities that had been accorded to themâsanctuaries  freedom of movement in Kampuchean territoryâto re-establish contact with their former network  which had been abandoned in 1954  and to step up even further their subversive activities. After the coup dâÃ©tat of 18 March 1970  they set up parallel organizations in the army and in the Administration  using in particular 2 000 Khmer agents whom they had taken to Hanoi for training in 1954 and sent back to Kampuchea subsequently.97.	The coup dâÃ©tat of 18 March 1970 provided an unlooked-for opportunity for the leaders and troops of Hanoi to return in force  like a tidal wave which was to flood the whole of Kampuchea. But contrary to their expectations  the people and patriotic army of Kampuchea  firmly adhering to their stand of independence and sovereignty  valiantly stemmed that tide. The liberation of Phnom Penh by Kampuchean patriots on 17 April 1975  13 days before the fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975  plunged the Hanoi authorities into chagrin and disarray as they witnessed the collapse of the hegemonistic plans they had so patiently nurtured for so long; for Le Duan and his cohorts were dreaming of sending in their troops against Phnom Penh after the occupation of Saigon in order  allegedly  to ""liberate"" it but  in actual fact  to occupy it.98.	After the liberation of Kampuchea  the Hanoi authorities undertook a world-wide campaign  first by proxy  and then openly  to isolate Democratic Kampuchea by propagating the worst kind of slanders and most sordid lies about it. It will be recalled how fiercely the Hanoi authorities opposed the normalization and improvement of relations between Democratic Kampuchea and Thailand. The visit paid in October 1975  shortly after liberation  by the Deputy Prime Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Government of Democratic Kampuchea to Bangkok was viewed by Hanoi as an act of treason. It is noteworthy that  at the time of the Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries  held at Colombo in August 1976  Hanoi exerted considerable pressure  but in vain  on Democratic Kampuchea to induce it  within the non-aligned movement  to serve the interests of the so-called ""natural ally"" of that movementâin particular  to wage a crusade against the Association of South-East Asian Nations [ASEAN]  accused by Hanoi of being an organization in the pay of a great Power.99.	Along with those diplomatic manoeuvres  Hanoi was striking bloody blows along the Kampuchean-Vietnamese border and had seized the Kampuchean island of Koh Way. In an attempt to normalize the situation  the leaders of the Government of Democratic Kampuchea  despite their heavy responsibilities within the newly freed country  went to Hanoi in June 1975 to negotiate with Hanoi a treaty of friendship and non-aggression. That turned out to be a waste of time  because the Hanoi authorities  intoxicated by their recent victory and the vast stockpiles of arms which had been left behind  did not want to hear any talk of an independent  neutral  non-aligned Kampuchea. They banked on the ability of their military forces to embark  if necessary  on the conquest of Kampuchea. That is what happened at the end of 1977  after the successive failures of their efforts to achieve that by means of wiles  subversion and destabilization  combined with border attacks and attempted coups dâÃ©tat.100.	After the defeat of the first attempted act of armed aggression against Democratic Kampuchea  on 6 January 1978  Hanoi signed a military pact with Moscow on 3 November 1978  and it was with the immense assistance of the Soviet Union that it launched a second act of armed aggression against Democratic Kampuchea on 25 December 1978.101.	Since then  Vietnamese occupation troops have put the whole of Kampuchea to fire and the sword  causing tremendous destruction and committing innumerable crimes  unprecedented in Kampuchea's 2 000-year history. Almost 3 million Kampucheans have already been massacred; hundreds of others are slain every day. The Hanoi authorities  with unheard-of cruelty  have been applying three means of extermination; conventional weapons  chemical warfare and  above all  the inhuman weapon of starvation. So it is not a war of colonial conquest such as has been known in history  but a war of extermination of a whole people and nation.102.	Survivors  in hundreds of thousands  have sought temporary refuge in Thailand  while millions of others have become refugees in their own country. And it is because of the Hanoi authorities' persistence in this systematic extermination endeavour that international humanitarian assistance to the Kampuchean people was cynically diverted for the benefit of Hanoi's occupation troops or ended up in Viet. Nam itself.103.	But in spite of those misfortunes and terrible sufferings  the people of Kampuchea  galvanized by the indomitable will to survive in independence and national dignity  has heroically fought the invader  under the leadership of the Patriotic and Democratic Front of Great National Union of Kampuchea and the Government of Democratic Kampuchea. They have succeeded in bogging down the 250 000 Vietnamese soldiers and 50 000 agents occupying Kampuchea. By way of comparison  this figure is the equivalent of 10 million foreign soldiers of occupation in any country or association of countries having a population of about 200 million.104.	It will be recalled that the so-called ""famous"" dry- season offensive of October 1979-April 1980 mounted by the Vietnamese aggressors was supposed  according to their propaganda  to annihilate completely the forces of Democratic Kampuchea  thus putting an end to Kampuchean resistance. The victory of our national army  of our guerrillas and of our people  who inflicted a crushing defeat on that offensive  constituted a strategic turning point in the struggle of the Kampuchean people  in the sense that henceforth the Hanoi authorities would no longer be able to eliminate Democratic Kampuchea by force of arms and would be driven into a military deadlock.105.	In fact  first of all  the Vietnamese troops are sustaining heavier and heavier losses every day on the battlefield. Their morale has suffered seriously as a result; mutinies and desertions are ever more numerous in the front-line units  particularly in the north-west  the central region  the northeast and the south-west. To offset these losses the Le Duan clique in Hanoi can only resort to new levies of troops or to the ""Khmerization"" of its war of aggression. But it is not in a position to do either of these two things.106.	Soviet assistance  which amounts to $3 million a day  cannot remedy this critical situation  because the feeding of a 250 000-man occupation force is an enormous burden for Viet Nam  a poor country that has been sucked dry by 40 years of war and must also maintain a 50 000-man occupation army in Laos.107.	In the second place  in Viet Nam itself  the Le Duan clique finds itself in a disastrous economic and financial situation because of its policy of aggression and expansion against all its neighbours. Politically  internal dissension among the leaders has been continually worsening  particularly as a result of the accumulated failures in Kampuchea  while discontent has begun to overwhelm the entire Vietnamese people  whose opposition to Hanoi's domination is widespread and manifold. Insecurity has become rampant. On the high plateaux of central Vietnam  the Dega-Fulro resistance movement is gaining strength. In the Saigon and Mekong delta regions  the people belonging to the Hoa Hao and Cao Dai religious sects in particular have stepped up their armed resistance. Their troops have been launching murderous attacks against the Hanoi troops. In the Mekong delta too  guerrilla units of the Khmer Krom population have become more and more active and have inflicted severe losses on the North Vietnamese troops  particularly in the regions adjacent to Kampuchea.108.	Whatever the subterfuges used by the Le Duan clique to attempt to mislead international public opinion  it could not succeed in concealing the fact that at the present time it is experiencing great difficulties in Kampuchea.109.	On the other hand  the situation is steadily improving for Democratic Kampuchea. Our national army and our guerrilla units are consolidating their hold and are developing steadily and methodically in accordance with the plan that had been devised. The fighting zones are becoming ever more extensive and are covering almost the whole country.110.	The Hanoi authorities are finding it necessary to resort to subterfuge in an attempt to make the world believe that the situation in Kampuchea is ""irreversible"" and that they have a total grip on Kampuchea. They are insolently claiming that Kampuchean resistance has been reduced to just a few ""pockets"" along the Kampuchea-Thai frontier. But everyone knows that the national army and the guerrilla units of Democratic Kampuchea are fighting throughout the country up to Phnom Penh itself and are succeeding in inflicting severe and heavy losses on Vietnamese troops every day. Furthermore  the Hanoi authorities have not succeeded either m ""Khmerizing"" the administration. In the temporarily occupied regions it is the 50 000 Vietnamese agents who are running the whole show. The administration installed in Phnom Penh is a purely Vietnamese one.111.	AH the successes of Democratic Kampuchea from a military standpoint could not even be imagined without the support and active participation of large strata of the Kampuchean people in the popular war of national resistance. Indeed  it is absolutely clear to the people that the national stake in that struggle is the very survival of the Kampuchean nation. That explains its active support for the political programme of the Patriotic and Democratic Front of Great National Union of Kampuchea and the new strategic policy of the Government of Democratic Kampuchea  which are mobilizing all Kampucheans  whatever their record  their history  their political ideology or their religious beliefs  with one objective in mindâto drive out all the Vietnamese aggressors from Kampuchea. The preparation of that political programme and of that new strategic policy has been guided by the noble national and patriotic ideals common to all Kampucheans  and the carrying out of that policy has satisfied the people. The Vietnamese occupiers are very well aware that no Kampuchean accepts their occupation. That explains their frantic genocide of the people of Kampuchea.112.	Therefore  the present struggle of the people of Kampuchea is not a struggle for the triumph of any ideology or any given social regime. All classes and social strata in Kampuchea must subordinate  now and in the future  their particular private interests to the higher interest of national survival.113.	It would be national suicide if  after liberation of the country from the Vietnamese yoke  we were to call into question the basis of the political programme of the Front and the new political strategyâbecause the danger from Vietnamese expansionism will not disappear that soon. Even if the Hanoi authorities are forced to withdraw their forces from Kampuchea temporarily  they will not by so doing renounce their age-old expansionist ambitions. Furthermore  after being liberated  Kampuchea  which will emerge from the war totally denuded  will not be able to rehabilitate itself from the ruin and devastation caused by this war without international co-operation and assistance. It is only with that assistance and that co-operation based on equality  mutual respect and reciprocal interest that an independent  sovereign  united  peaceful  neutral and non- aligned Kampuchea will be able to be built and to survive. Responsible to future generations and to history  the Patriotic and Democratic Front of Great National Union and the Government of Democratic Kampuchea will do everything in their power to carry out that sacred duty.114.	Facts and history have shown that the problem of Kampuchea is not a civil war or an ideological conflict. It is a conflict between the determination of the people of Kampuchea to be independent and the determination of the Vietnamese regional expansionists to dominate and to annex  to swallow up Kampuchea into the ""Indo-Chinese Federation"". To start from the premise that it is a problem among neighbours or one of frontiers would be a very serious error of judgement. What it is above all is a problem between aggressors and the victims of aggression  which can be resolved only by the withdrawal of the aggressors.115.	Furthermore  the fact that the Vietnamese regional expansionists are supported by the Soviet international expansionists places the Kampuchean problem within the context of the global strategy of Soviet international expansionism. The Vietnamese invasion of Kampuchea and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan are two aspects of one and the same strategy. The struggles now being waged by the peoples of Kampuchea and Afghanistan constitute a bulwark against the expansionist drive of the Soviet Union  which aims at becoming  with the control of the Straits of Malacca  the Persian Gulf and the oil reserves of the Middle East  the master of the principal supply routes in South-East and South-West Asia.116.	In particular  in Kampuchea  in the war which it is being forced to wage against the Vietnamese aggressors  the people of Kampuchea are fighting  certainly  for their own survival and that of their nation. But at the same time  they are sacrificing their blood to defend peace  security and stability in South-East Asia  in Asia as a whole and throughout the world.117.	Countries that love peace and justice are becoming increasingly aware of what is at stake  in international terms  in the struggle being waged at the present time by the people of Kampuchea  under the leadership of the Patriotic and Democratic Front of Great National Union of Kampuchea and the Government of Democratic Kampuchea. They realize the full importance of that struggle in thwarting the global and regional expansionist strategy of the Soviet Unionâ and the Hanoi authorities.118.	That is why the Hanoi and Moscow expansionists are seeking so assiduously to eliminate at all costs the major obstacle  constituted by Democratic Kampuchea. Indeed  if they succeed in consolidating their position in Kampuchea by eliminating Democratic Kampuchea  there can be no doubt that they will come to dominate South-East Asia and control the Straits of Malacca and the eastern part of the Indian Ocean. They will then have won a strategic superiority that they have never enjoyed before. The position of the Soviet Union in Afghanistan will be strengthened  thus enabling it to push its expansionism further south. In such a situation  no force will be in a position to resist the Vietnamese-Soviet expansionist drive.119.	Thus  solidarity with the present struggle of the people of Kampuchea and with that of the people of Afghanistan is not only an act of justice  but above all a necessity  if we want to put a stop in time  and with the minimum of suffering and loss of human life  to the growing danger of Soviet expansionism and the danger of a third world war.120.	In order to eliminate at all cost Democratic Kampuchea  the only force capable of opposing their plans in Kampuchea  the expansionists are sparing no effort to hatch all kinds of plots and manoeuvres.121.	In the military sphere  the Soviet expansionists are in the process of providing a massive build-up of their military assistance to the Vietnamese regional expansionists in their new attempt to crush the national resistance of the people of Kampuchea and to pose even stronger threats to Thailand and the other countries of ASEAN.122.	At the political level the Vietnamese expansionists are making a great deal of noise about the so-called elections in order to lend the semblance of legitimacy to the Vietnamese administration in Phnom Penh  as if it were possible to organize general and free elections in a country at war  under the heel of 300 000 Vietnamese soldiers and occupation agents.123.	From the diplomatic standpoint  the Vietnamese expansionists are arrogantly continuing to propagate odious lies and slanders with a view to sowing confusion and division among peace-loving and justice-loving countries in order to prevent them from constituting an international anti-expansionist front. Their aim is to win through diplomatic means what they have not been able to win militarily  namely  recognition by the international community of the fait accompli of Viet Nam's invasion and occupation of Kampuchea.124.	To this end  they are trying to make everyone forget the underlying cause of the Kampuchean problem which is the Vietnamese invasion  and to present this problem as the result of a conflict among the three countries of the so-called ""Indo-Chinese federation"" and the five countries of ASEAN  while brandishing the so-called ""Chinese threat"". This is the substance of their four-point proposal  the so- called Vientiane proposal  which was in fact hatched in Moscow and brought forward following the Vietnamese aggression of 23 June of this year against Thailand. That proposal was quite properly rejected by the ASEAN countries  which saw it as a political trap designed to prevail upon Thailand to recognize  if not officially at least de facto  the Vietnamese administration installed at Phnom Penh. The proposal to create a demilitarized zone on both sides of the Kampuchea-Thailand frontier is nothing but a subterfuge designed to legitimize the presence of Vietnamese occupation troops in Kampuchea.125.	Furthermore  the agenda item of the Vietnamese expansionists entitled ""Question of peace  stability and co-operation in South-East Asia"" is all part of this diversionary tactic.126.	Here  in the United Nations itself  the expansionists are desperately manoeuvring in an attempt to deprive the Government of Democratic Kampuchea of its legitimate rights and to leave the seat of Democratic Kampuchea vacant. This vacant seat is merely the prelude to the usurpation of Democratic Kampuchea's seat by the Vietnamese administration installed at Phnom Penh. It is tantamount to United Nations approval of the violation of its Charter by the expansionists of Hanoi and Moscow.127.	Finally  through all these manoeuvres and plots  the Hanoi authorities want to avoid the implementation of General Assembly resolution 34/22  which calls for the immediate and total withdrawal of their occupation troops from Kampuchea. All these manoeuvres and plots have so far been thwarted by the international community  as amply demonstrated from this very rostrum by statements of representatives from peace-loving and justice-loving countries.128.	The people of Kampuchea wish only to live in peace and security  in honour and national dignity  within their frontiers  and to mobilize all their strength and national resources to build a prosperous country.129.	The Government of Democratic Kampuchea is committed to the search for a solution capable of putting a rapid end to the unutterable pain and suffering the Kampuchean people have endured for so long.130.	We believe that any solution to the Kampuchean problem must be subject to a pre-condition: that of the total and unconditional withdrawal of the Vietnamese occupation forces from Kampuchea  in accordance with General Assembly resolution 34/22. Any measure that fails to take into account the pre-condition is unrealistic and unworkable.131.	Wishing to restore peace  security and stability to Kampuchea and in the area  the Government of Democratic Kampuchea issued  on 5 May 1980  a statement containing a three-point proposal  which was reaffirmed in the communique issued by the Council of Ministers of the Government of Democratic Kampuchea on 7 June 1980  namely:""First  the Hanoi authorities must withdraw all their troops from Kampuchea  in compliance with the United Nations resolution 34/22 . . . and let the Kampuchean people solve by themselves their problems.""Secondly  after the total withdrawal of the Vietnamese troops from Kampuchea  the Kampuchean people will choose by themselves their national government through general and free election by secret and direct ballot under the direct supervision of the United Nations Secretary-General or his representatives. Kampuchea will remain independent  united  democratic  peaceful  neutral and non-aligned  without any foreign base  with the guarantee of the United Nations and the world community."" 132.	The Patriotic and Democratic Front of Great National Union of Kampuchea calls upon all patriotic parties to unite in this struggle for the national survival of our country and to form a government of national union committed to proceeding to general elections. The communique further states:""Thirdly  with regard to Viet Nam and the Vietnamese people  the Government of Democratic Kampuchea and the people of Kampuchea do not foster any hatred or rancour and they do not require any indemnity  provided the Vietnamese troops withdraw totally from Kampuchea. The Kampuchean people are ready to live in peace and on good terms with their neighbour to the east  and indeed with all their neighbours in the area.133.	In this regard  we would like to express our great appreciation and deep gratitude to the ASEAN countries and other peace-loving and justice-loving countries for the tireless and enlightened efforts they have made since the beginning of 1979 to solve the problem of Kampuchea by their resolute adherence to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and to the profound peaceful aspirations of their peoples and by calling urgently for the total withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Kampuchea.134.	These efforts are an important contribution to the sacred cause of Kampuchea. They are also a contribution to the restoration of peace  security and stability in South-East Asia and the establishment in that part of the world of a zone of peace  freedom and neutrality propitious to world peace. Such efforts also contribute to the strengthening of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations  of non-alignment and of international law.135.	My delegation wishes to express its conviction that this year our Assembly will again have the courage to defend the existence  independence and sovereignty of the Kampuchean nation  in accordance with the provisions of the Charter  by repeating its call for the total withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Kampuchea. For their part  no matter how great the sacrifices they are called upon to make  our people and our national army  under the leadership of the Patriotic and Democratic Front of Great National Union of Kampuchea and the Government of Democratic Kampuchea  are resolutely determined to continue their just struggle to drive all the Vietnamese aggressors from Kampuchea. They will earn the sympathy  the support and the assistance of all peace-loving and justice-loving peoples by fulfilling the difficult historical task that has fallen to them of successfully opposing regional and world expansionism and of making their modest contribution to world peace  to the independence of all States  to the social progress and to the well-being of all peoples of the world.136.	My delegation would like to repeat the unswerving commitment of the people and Government of Democratic Kampuchea to the cause of peace and freedom for all the world's countries and peoples  and particularly our devotion to traditional friendship with all neighbouring peoples and countries. A founder member of the non-aligned movement and a Member of the United Nations  Democratic Kampuchea still remain faithful to the ideals and principles of non-alignment and of the Charter."
"77",3911,"LAO",35,1980,"ï»¿I should like first of all  Sir  to voice my heartfelt congratulations to Mr. von Wechmar on his unanimous election to the lofty post of President of this session of the General Assembly. I am convinced that with his vast experience of the United Nations he will guide the work of the thirty-fifth session of the Assembly to fruitful results.181.	I should like to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to his eminent predecessor  Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim  who conducted the work of the last session of the Assembly with skill and devotion.182.	Permit me also to express the great appreciation of my delegation to Mr. Kurt Waldheim  Secretary-General of the United Nations  for his tireless efforts to promote the attainment of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.183.	The thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly has opened at a time when the new Disarmament Decade has begun and on the eve of the Development Decade which we hope will mark a new era that will bring humanity peace  justice and progress. The present session will also observe the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  an historic declaration which is due to the fortunate initiative taken by the Soviet Union and one which marked a decisive turning point in the heroic struggle of peoples of several countries in our world to bring about their emancipation. On this occasion we welcome with joy to the United Nations Zimbabwe  which has just recovered its independence  the fruit of a long struggle full of sacrifices. We also welcome the admission of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to our Organization.184.	The decade just ended has left us with a positive balance-sheet of the struggle of peoples for their liberation. The historic victory of the peoples of Laos  Kampuchea and Viet Nam represents a decisive stage in the bankruptcy of the policy of aggression and expansionism of imperialism and international reaction. The victory of the peoples of Angola  Mozambique and the recent victory of the people of Zimbabwe in Africa have further strengthened the determination of those still subjected to oppression  colonial domination and anti-democratic regimes to continue their struggle.185.	The victory of the April 1978 revolution in Afghanistan ushered in a new era of profound political  economic and social changes leading to democracy and progress for the Afghan people. The victory of the Iranian people put an end to Iran's long dependence on American imperialism and to the backward feudalist regime that had held sway for centuries. The victory of the people of Nicaragua set a brilliant example for the struggle of the peoples of Latin America against the Fascist dictatorial regimes in that continent. The great victory of 7 January 1979 of the people of Kampuchea and the victorious resistance of the Vietnamese people against Chinese aggression in February 1979 have inflicted an ignominious defeat on the expansionist and hegemonist policy of the leaders of Peking in collusion with the imperialists.186.	The decade just ended has also provided us with numerous proofs that  despite their successive defeats  the forces of imperialism and international reaction are still bent on perpetuating the old  retrograde political and economic order  indulging in the frenetic arms race  creating tensions and hotbeds of war and interfering in the internal affairs of States. However  a glance at the international situation since the last session of the General Assembly enables us to state that it has undergone a positive evolution towards peace  national independence  democracy and social progress.187.	Nevertheless  the imperialist circles and the forces of international reaction have tried to revive the climate of the cold war and to sabotage the peaceful development of peoples. This dangerous attempt  unless it is countered  may well challenge the cause of peace and international security and plunge the world into a new disaster. The peoples of the world must redouble their vigilance and act energetically to suppress this negative trend and guarantee peace and security to mankind.188.	In South-East Asia  after the brilliant victory won by force of arms over the American imperialists  the three peoples of Indo-China  instead of being able to enjoy their new-found peace and independence  are now faced with the danger of aggression and expansion.189.	The leaders of Peking have for some time now been pursuing towards the three countries of Indo-China an openly hostile policy aimed at sabotaging peace and the building of socialism in those countries and at dominating them and using them as a bridge-head for their expansionist designs in South-East Asia. In order to achieve their evil purposes  they have tried  in collusion with the imperialists and other reactionaries  to pit the other countries of Southeast Asia  in particular Thailand  against the three countries of Indo-China  to divide the three  Lao  Kampuchean and Vietnamese nations  to sow discord and division among each of these three peoples. These activities  which have bred tension in South-East Asia  endanger the peace and security of that part of the world.190.	The Lao People's Democratic Republic  in joining several other countries to request the inclusion on the agenda of the present session of the item entitled ""Question of peace  stability and co-operation in South-East Asia""  intends to work positively to establish in that region a climate of peace and co-operation that will put an end to the tension that now prevails there. We attach great importance to the debate in the General Assembly on that item  and we hope that a positive outcome will result from it.191.	After an anti-colonialist and anti-imperialist struggle lasting more than 30 years  the Lao people is deeply commit-ted to peace in order that it may turn to the work of national defence and construction. The three peoples  Lao  Kampuchean and Vietnamese  united in their struggle for peace and national liberation  are more than ever determined together to defend their national independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity won at the price of such great sacrifices. They are determined to defend at all costs their peaceful work to consolidate peace and stability in the region  together with all the peoples of South-East Asia. The Declaration issued at the Conference of Foreign Ministers of Laos  Kampuchea and Viet Nam  held at Vientiane on 17 and 18 July 1980  sets forth constructive and reasonable proposals that have received the increasingly active support of peace-loving countries and forces through-out the world. They reflect the will of the Lao  Kampuchean and Vietnamese peoples to live on good terms with their neighbours in South-East Asia and to seek the settlement of all questions  whether they be bilateral or of common interest to the region  through peaceful negotiations based on mutual respect for the independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and political persuasion and on non-interference in the internal affairs of States.192.	But it is extremely regrettable that the goodwill of the Governments of the three countries of Indo-China have come up against the obstacle set in their path by the leaders of Peking who  acting in close collaboration with the imperialists and using a group of extreme-right reactionaries in the Thai governing circles as pawns  have mounted a vast conspiracy against the peoples of Indo-China. The armed acts of provocation on the Thai-Kampuchean border in June this year  provocations which took place at the same time as the so-called ""voluntary repatriation"" operations of the Kampuchean refugees launched with inflammatory propaganda  the campaign of slander and denigration waged by the leaders of Peking and the extreme-right reactionaries in the governing circles of Thailand against Viet Nam and the armed acts of provocation against Laos of 14 and 15 June this year emanating from the Thai side and leading to the closing of the Thai-Lao border on the very eve of those that occurred on the Thai-Kampuchean border- all are an integral part of the aforementioned conspiracy. The peoples of Indo-China  who have suffered through many years of war against imperialist aggression  are fully aware of these manoeuvres  which are irrevocably doomed to failure.193.	Because they fought for decades against colonialist and imperialist aggression and oppression  the peoples of Indo-China attach inestimable importance to peace and cleave to independence  freedom and the construction of a better life in their respective countries. And more especially as Laos  a country with just over 3 million inhabitants  has never been and never will be a threat to any neighbour whatsoever. That is why we have  along with Kampuchea and Viet Nam  called upon the countries of South-East Asia to work together with us for the consolidation of peace and stability in the area and for a mutually advantageous co-operation. In proposing the conclusion of bilateral or multi-lateral treaties of non-aggression and peaceful coexistence between ourselves and the countries of ASEAN and other countries in South-East Asia  the settlement of differences through peaceful means and the creation of a zone of peace and stability  the Lao People's Democratic Republic  the People's Republic of Kampuchea and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam are convinced that such proposals provide solid bases which will lead to a genuine and lasting peace.194.	The negative reply to these proposals only helps the manoeuvres of the imperialists and international reactionaries for maintaining the item entitled ""The situation in Kampuchea"" on the agenda of this session. It does not create a climate propitious for dialogue; it is an attempt to mislead world opinion regarding the real situation in Kampuchea. Their propaganda and their treacherous manoeuvres attempt to create confusion  to preserve the seat of Kampuchea in the United Nations for a criminal gang that of Pol Pot and Ieng Sary  and to interfere in the internal affairs of Kampuchea and other countries in the region  and those manoeuvres will not be able to deceive peace-loving and justice-loving peoples.195.	The facts with regard to Kampuchea are that  after having risen en masse against the genocidal regime and after having toppled it once and for all  the Kampuchean people is now exercising its right to self-determination and has become the master of its own destiny. At the present time  under the guidance of the People's Revolutionary Council of Kampuchea  the only legitimate and legal representative of the country  it has made immense efforts to reconstruct the country and normalize its life after long years of war against imperialist aggression and three and one half years of the genocidal regime. The Kampuchean people is now in full control. Persisting in its wish to resuscitate a regime which has been condemned by the whole world and to have it represented in the United Nations  is not only contrary to the legitimate rights of the Kampuchean people and the Charter of the United Nations  but also an insult to the conscience of those peoples who are imbued with the love of peace and humanity in the world.196.	My country  as many other countries  deems that the People's Revolutionary Council of Kampuchea must occupy its rightful place in our Organization. That Council  apart from the fact that it is the sole legitimate and legal representative of the people of Kampuchea  is constantly animated by the sincere desire to live on good terms with its neighbours and to settle all differences through peaceful negotiations.197.	This attitude is clearly reflected in its statements and in its foreign policy. Its four-point proposal  which was endorsed by the Conference of the Foreign Ministers of Laos  Kampuchea and Viet Nam  held at Vientiane in July this year  is a just and realistic proposal which seeks to reduce tension and establish a climate of trust between Thailand and Kampuchea  as a prelude to a mutually advantageous co-operation between the peoples of those two countries. Not to take this constructive proposal seriously into consideration is not only to reject peace and stability ' the noble objectives for which the peoples of the region have ceaselessly worked  but also to fall into the trap of the expansionists and imperialists who wish to fish in troubled waters and accomplish their evil designs. This attitude is not in the interests of the peoples  nor is it in the interest of the peace and security of South-East Asia and of the world.198.	The Republic of India  one of the founders of the non-aligned movement  which has just officially recognized the People's Republic of Kampuchea  has shown itself to have a wise and realistic policy.199.	My country supports the just position and the conciliatory attitude of the Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  which has striven to settle through negotiations the problems between its country and the other countries of South-East Asia. My country also strongly supports the just struggle being waged by the fraternal Vietnamese people to defend its independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity against the acts of aggression  and subversion of the reactionary holders of power in China. We support the just position and the attitude of goodwill of theGovernment of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam in its efforts to settle through negotiations the disputes between that country and the People's Republic of China. We demand that the reactionary Chinese authorities immediately end all acts of hostility towards the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and make possible the immediate opening of the third series of Sino-Vietnamese negotiations  as the Vietnamese Government has many times proposed.200.	Since the founding of the Lao People's Democratic Republic five years ago  the Lao people have made enormous efforts in the task of our country's defence and national construction along the path of socialism which it freely chose. Our choice gave rise to a strong reaction on the part of international reactionaries and imperialists  who have throughout these five years done their utmost  at all levels  to destroy our work of peaceful reconstruction  as they are doing also in the cases of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the People's Republic of Kampuchea. Notwithstanding all this  the Lao people  united as one man  has succeeded not only in safeguarding its independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity but also in achieving successes in several spheres of national construction. These successes are due to the consistent efforts of our whole people under the wise guidance of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party. They are inseparable from the militant solidarity and multifarious co-operation between the Lao people and the Vietnamese and Kampuchean peoples  the fraternal and unselfish assistance given by the Soviet Union and other socialist countries and the aid from friendly countries and international organizations  including the United Nations  to which we should like at this time to express once more our profound gratitude.201.	The Government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic has always implemented a foreign policy of peace  independence  friendship and non-alignment  a policy of peaceful coexistence and co-operation with neighbouring countries  on the basis of respect for independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity  non-interference in internal affairs and mutual advantage. We welcome the development of special relations with the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the People's Republic of Kampuchea  relations of friendship and many-sided co-operation with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries  and relations becoming daily closer with friendly countries. We have developed our relations of friendship and good neighbourliness with the Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma and other countries of the region. However  we regret that our relations with Thailand  our immediate neighbour  have seriously worsened recently despite our persistent efforts to resolve questions in dispute between the two countries through peaceful negotiations and in a spirit of good neighbourliness. Notwithstanding the recent opening of a crossing point on the border by the Thai authorities  normal relations between the two countries have not yet been re-established. Only the full implementation of the joint communiques of Laos and Thailand of January and April 1979 will  in our opinion  contribute to improving the relations between the Lao and Thai peoples  who have always been good neighbours.202.	During the past year the imperialists and reactionaries have likewise stirred up tension and created pockets of discord in other parts of the world  threatening the peace and security of peoples.203.	In South Asia  in particular in Afghanistan  imperialists  together with international reactionaries and others  have exacerbated and continue to exacerbate the crisis by indulging in all sorts of intrigues to promote conflicts that would destroy the achievements of the April 1978 revolution of the Afghan people. We demand that an end be put to all those activities which are acts of interference in the internal affairs of the Afghan people  which is entitled to appeal to all friendly countries to defend its independence and sovereignty.204.	We highly appreciate the legitimate and necessary assistance given by the Soviet people to the Afghan people  in accordance with the Treaty of Friendship  Good Neighbourliness and Co-operation of 5 December 1978 between the two countries as well as with the Charter of the United Nations. We staunchly support the just proposal of President Babrak Karmal designed to settle with neighbouring countries  through peaceful negotiations  all problems concerning peace and security in that region.205.	In the Middle East  the Camp David agreements have led to a complex situation which shifts from day to day in favour of Israel's goals of expansionism and domination over neighbouring Arab territories. Ignoring universal condemnation  the Zionist leaders have ceaselessly proliferated their acts of aggression against the Arab peoples  the last of which was the Israeli decision to make the city of Jerusalem the capital of the Zionist State. Our delegation vehemently condemns that decision  which was declared null and void by the Security Council when it considered that issue. We staunchly support the struggle of the Palestinian people  under the leadership of the PLO  to recover their inalienable rights  including the right to establish an independent and sovereign State. My delegation firmly supports the struggle of the other Arab countries to recover all their territories occupied by Israel and to counter the plots of imperialism.206.	We are in favour of respect for Lebanon's sovereignty and territorial integrity and condemn Israel's attempts to sabotage and destroy that peaceful little State.207.	We support the Korean people in their struggle for the peaceful reunification of their homeland and for the withdrawal of United States troops stationed in South Korea. We condemn the barbaric acts of repression perpetrated by the authorities of Seoul against the South Korean population.208.	We are profoundly concerned by the strengthening of military bases and the increase in military activities of the United States in the Persian Gulf and in the Indian Ocean  and by the creation of the so-called ""rapid deployment"" force to defend its allegedly vital interests. These activities constitute a serious threat to the peace and security of all peoples throughout the world. We demand that an end be put to them in order to permit progress towards the transformation of the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace  in accordance with the profound aspirations of the peoples who live on its shores.209.	We should like to assert our unswerving support of the resolute struggle waged by the people and Government of Ethiopia against open acts of aggression by imperialist and reactionary forces to defend the independence and territorial integrity of their country.210.	We are in favour of the full and rigorous implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations on Cyprus.211.	We support the struggle being waged by the people of Namibia  under the guidance of SWAPO  for their national independence and strongly condemn the apartheid regime for its obstinate refusal to implement United Nations decisions concerning Namibia  as well as for its criminal racist practices in South Africa.212.	We reaffirm our solidarity with the people of the Democratic Sahraoui Arab Republic which  under the guidance of the POLISARIO Front  has been waging a resolute struggle to bring about the exercise of its basic and sacred national rights.213.	We firmly condemn the acts of aggression perpetrated by the racist regime of Pretoria against the people of Angola and voice our full solidarity with that people  which has been courageously fighting to defend its independence and sovereignty.214.	In Latin America the Cuban people continues to be the victim of an arbitrary blockade by the United States  and a part of its territory is still under the latter's occupation. We side with the Cuban people and demand that the United States put an end to that blockade  give back the Guantanamo base to the Republic of Cuba and stop any attempts to destabilize that part of the world.215.	We welcome the efforts that have been expended for a year now by the people of Nicaragua to rebuild its country and to consolidate the achievements of its revolution  and we wish it even greater success in that work.216.	Puerto Rico is still under colonial domination. Accordingly  we should like to assure the Puerto Rican people of our sympathy and support in its struggle for self-determination and independence.217.	Likewise  we support the valiant struggle of the peoples of El Salvador and Bolivia for the full enjoyment of their democratic rights and freedoms.218.	The people of Chile continues to be the victim of the bloody repression by the Fascist regime of Pinochet. Accordingly  we support the valiant struggle of the people of Chile to recover its genuine democratic rights and freedoms.219.	We fully support the tenacious struggle of the peoples and Governments of Grenada  Jamaica and other countries of the region against the manoeuvres of intervention and subversion of the imperialists and their lackeys and in defence of their independence and sovereignty.220.	The negotiations on disarmament measures are progressing too slowly  whereas the arms race is being stepped up and military expenditures for this year have exceeded the astronomical figure of $500 billion. This situation cannot go on without doing serious damage to the future of humanity. The will to engage in dialogue on disarmament and on genuine detente should prevail  and the desire to be assured of superiority in arms should be eliminated. That was the attitude that led to the Soviet-United States negotiations on strategic weapons and to the conclusion  last year  of the SALT II agreement  which was applauded by the whole world. But it is extremely regrettable that thus far the agreement has not been ratified by the United States  which does great damage to the climate of detente between East and West and has seriously affected negotiations on disarmament measures decided on at the tenth special session  which was devoted to disarmament.221.	We highly commend the sincere efforts of the Soviet Union and the other socialist countries  the non-aligned countries and the peace-loving countries that have worked resolutely to bring a halt to the arms race and achieve general and complete disarmament under effective international control. The States parties to the Warsaw Treaty also have worked with the greatest determination to consolidate international security  strengthen detente and reduce the danger of war  both in Europe and throughout the world. The submission last May by the Soviet Union and other socialist countries of a set of peace initiatives  designed to achieve detente in the military sphere and disarmament  was a constructive act firmly supported by my delegation. Likewise  we warmly support the initiative of the Soviet Union to submit for consideration by the current Assembly  as an important and urgent matter: ""Urgent measures for reducing the danger of war""  and the question entitled ""Historical responsibility of States for the preservation of nature for present and future generations"". We hope that the debate on these items will yield positive results. We also support the efforts of the African and Arab States to make Africa and the Middle East nuclear-free zones and we deeply deplore the collaboration of certain Western countries with South Africa and Israel in the sphere of nuclear weapons. We request those countries to put an end to that collaboration  which merely fosters the proliferation of nuclear weapons.222.	Another cause for concern for the developing countries is the protracted crisis besetting the present world economic situation  a crisis bred by the market-economy developed countries  but which has had more serious repercussions on all the developing countries  particularly the least advanced. Undeniably  this crisis stems from the unjust international economic relations at present in force. A remedy must be found. The adoption of the Declaration and Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New Inter-national Economic Order which would be more just and more equitable gave a glimmer of hope to the developing countries. But the attempts to implement the Declaration and the Programme of Actionâcontained in General Assembly resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 (S-VI) -have not yielded any significant results so far. The negotiations embarked upon both within the United Nations context and in the various specialized agencies have led to only meagre results  and the reason for this is the lack of political will on the part of most of the developed capitalist countries  which are clinging to their unjustly acquired privileges. The failure of the fifth session of UNCTAD  held at Manila from 7 May to 3 June 1979  and the stalemate in the subsequent negotiations held at Geneva are eloquent proof of that.223.	Similarly  the intransigent attitude adopted by certain developed Western countries at the eleventh special session  devoted to economic issues  which has just ended rather ignominiously  only reaffirmed once more the obstinacy of those countries in clinging to the status quo. As long as that unreasonable position is maintained  the world economic crisis will only worsen  thus ceaselessly widening the gap which separates the poor countries from the rich countries. This situation is not without risk for international peace and security and can be redressed only by a thoroughgoing and prompt restructuring of the present system of international economic relations. It is therefore in the interests of all States to realize these facts and to adopt an attitude consistent with them.224.	Given the complexity of the international situation  the work of the thirty-fifth session is bound to be difficult. However  the delegation of the Lao People's Democratic Republic will spare no effort to co-operate with the President so as to contribute to the success of the work of this session."
"78",3957,"LBN",35,1980,"ï»¿I am happy to present to you  Sir  the warm greetings of the Lebanese delegation on your election as President of the current session of the General Assembly. Your high personal qualities  your wisdom and your vast experience in international affairs will guarantee the efficient administration of our work with knowledge and competence.224.	I also wish to praise the work so ably undertaken by your predecessor  the Ambassador of the United Republic of Tanzania  Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim  during his term as President of the thirty-fourth session of the Assembly.225.	I further wish to welcome and to congratulate the Republic of Zimbabwe and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines on their joining the Organization.226.	One year ago  from this rostrum  I presented to the conscience of the world  in the name of Lebanon  the tragedy of a people and homeland and the painful dimensions of long-enduring adversities.  I set forth the many causes and the regional and international practices which made of Lebanon a main victim in the game of nations. With outcries of suffering and rancour  enduring our wounds  we voiced the aspirations and hopes of a people and its yearning for a real and just peace so long awaited. I need not reiterate what I explained at length last year  and yet it remains equally valid today.227.	One whole year has passed  replete with weighty events in various parts of the worldâevents that have stirred up international conflict and increased the vehemence of competition  exposing the course of international detente to dangerous pitfalls and almost wrecking the hopes of attaining stability  tranquillity and prosperity.228.	Lebanon has paid and continues to pay  in innocent blood and heavy destruction of its assets and institutions  a heavy toll that is far beyond its capacity for problems towards whose creation it has not contributed and for injustices of which it has always been innocent. This allows Lebanon to address itself to the world community  to speak out frankly to its bretheren and friends and to voice its opinions and demands at this precise time.229.	The prolongation of the Middle East crisis over so many years and its aggravation from day to day threatens not only the peace and security of the region and the welfare of its people  but the peace and security of the world.230.	Everybody is aware of the importance which the Middle East region represents  with its distinctive strategic location  its abundant human potential and its vital natural resources and heritage  for stability  prosperity and well- being in its immediate environment in particular and in the world in general.231.	This persistent depletion of human potential in our region and of its resources  which is caused by the chronic Arab-Israeli conflict and the increasing violence and disturbances to which this conflict has led  has an adverse effect on the peoples of the world at a time when political and economic dependence is increasing among the world's different regions and peoples.232.	Despite successive disappointments we remain convinced that peace in the Middle East is inevitable. It will be achieved if good intentions prevail and efforts are made to bring it about on sound and just bases. In this regard  we feel obliged to assert our convictions.233.	A proper climate for a peaceful solution to the Middle East crisis should first be ensured. This climate presupposes a minimum level of international detente so as to reduce the intensity of the repercussions of the struggle for influence in the region  with its consequent polarization  which increases tension and the danger of confrontation and explosion. In short  any attempt to deal unilaterally with the Middle East crisis by excluding principal parties to the conflict or disregarding their rights or their interests will not ensure sound bases for real peace in the region.234.	The problem is further aggravated when separate attempts are accompanied by ideas of fragmentary solutions that ignore questions intrinsic to the Arab-Israeli conflict and disregard legitimate rights which are recognized by principles of international law and justice and endorsed by various international resolutions  or seek to provide compensation for the possessors of these rights at the expense of the future and interests of others.235.	A long-range view and a true understanding of facts imply that the desired peace in the Middle East will have to be a comprehensive peace which recognizes the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to the establishment of a State on their land  otherwise there will be no peace under any circumstances.236.	The Palestine question has always been the core of the Arab-Israeli conflict and of the Middle East crisis. Any final solution to this crisis must include a just solution of the Palestine question on the basis of the participation of the Palestinian people in the peace process through its legitimate representatives. This is a fact which will inevitably impose itself sooner or later  and any delay in accepting it tends to increase the number of victims and senselessly spread destruction and also endanger peace in the region and the world.237.	A peaceful solution of the Middle East crisis must be brought about in conformity with sound bases and principles  foremost among which is the principle of the inadmissibility of acquisition of land by force and the consequent necessity of Israel's withdrawal from all occupied territories  including Jerusalem.238.	Instead  we see today  as in the past  Israel's continued policy of flouting and violating the resolutions of the United Nations  while totally disregarding the will of the international community and the principles of international law. This policy was lately capped by Israel's measures to annex Arab Jerusalem and to declare it to be its capital  thereby provoking the entire international community and causing serious repercussions.239.	This unfortunate situation leads to violence and complications whose consequences no one can foresee. We noticed recently that the majority of the countries of the international community  especially some European countries  are becoming increasingly aware of the gravity of the situation. We believe that if these countries move as a group in the right direction  and adopt bold attitudes  they will definitely generate a current that will greatly affect world opinion.240.	The heads of State and Government and the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the European Community at their meeting in June 1980 at Venice  and at their meeting in September at Brussels  favoured Lebanon with a praise-worthy gesture which we hope will be followed by other steps. The restoration of peace and stability in Lebanon is  in our view  the necessary prelude for peace in the entire Middle East region. Nevertheless  it is useless to seek final  stable peace in our region if Lebanon is left in the grip of conflicts and violence whose dangers and complications will inevitably reach beyond its borders to the entire region and so destroy any peace that might be to the detriment of that country or ignore its situation.241.	The fact is that in the Middle East besides the Palestinian question  and to a large extent because of it  there is today a Lebanese question which is becoming more complex and which requires responsible attitudes and effective treatment.242.	The Middle East crisis is at the origin of Lebanon's crisis  because the roots of the Lebanese crisis lie in the inequity which accompanied the creation of the State of Israel at the expense of the people of Palestine  in Israel's policy of expansion  and also in the imbalance the Palestine question and the displacement of Palestinians and their armed resistance have caused in the region as a whole and especially in our country  thus affecting the sensitive internal equilibrium which characterizes its life. This occurred in particular as a result of Israeli aggression and of clashes and excesses taking place on Lebanon's territory  not to mention the various forms of interference in our internal affairs.243.	Moreover  the Lebanese question took on international dimensions when Lebanon became the only setting in which the conflicting Powers in the regionâIsraeli  Arab and internationalâwere fighting  and became the military arena of both Israel and the Palestinian resistance. While Israel aims its blows against Lebanon on some pretext or other  the Palestine resistance carries out its revolutionary activity in such a way that Lebanon alone endures the consequences of action and reaction  even though the conflict essentially concerns the entire Arab community and the world community cannot remain aloof.244.	What complicates the situation further is the struggle for influence conducted by the two super-Powers by proxy and the outbreak of Arab disputes in Lebanon through the Lebanese and residents of Lebanon. This has led to the violation of our frontiers and the security of our country as a result of Israeli aggression and to irregular practices within Lebanese territory. The sanctity of our territory has been breached and the ability of the State to exercise its authority has been thwarted  especially as it applies to safeguarding sovereignty and security. That state of affairs has contributed to widening the gap between the various internal factions in Lebanon and even to further aggravating their differences.245.	It grieves us to say that some States are watching with indifference what is befalling Lebanonâwhich may become the scapegoat of a crisis that has reached alarming proportions owing to the violation of legal and ethical principles in international relationsâin the expectation that this crisis can be solved at Lebanon's expense.246.	We do not hesitate for a moment to assert that peace and security in Lebanon are vital to the peace and stability of our region and that a reinvigorated Lebanon  with its distinctive equilibrium and characteristics and its pioneering role in its region and in the world  is a fundamental element in the equilibrium and stability of the region.247.	While we are not unaware of the links between the Middle East crisis and the Lebanese crisis  we cannot neglect the crisis in Lebanon until the means for solving the Middle East crisis are available. Consequently  we have always maintained that the Lebanese crisis must be dealt with as an independent question per se  even through attempts to find a transitional solution  and that efforts towards this end must be given the priority they deserve.248.	In this connection  I cannot but quote what the President of Lebanon said at the beginning of this year:""Is it conceivable to say to this people  'Your hour has not yet arrived. Wait until visibility is clear in the region  and probably outside the region too? What wrong has Lebanon done to the region or to the world  to man and to his rights? If Lebanon has so far endured much more than it can stand  does that mean that it should be asked to allow itself to collapse completely under the load? Is this country condemnedâis it permissible to condemn itâto have all the problems of its bretheren and friends  not to mention its enemies  solved at its expense?""249.	It is reasonable that the Lebanese should feel that responsibility for rescuing their country and for restoring peace and stability to it lies primarily with themâthe people and leaders. In spite of the dreadful events that have befallen it during its long affliction  this people has often proved its unswerving attachment to its fundamental values  its homeland and its devotion to the constituents of its unity  freedom and independence.250.	Without exaggeration and without boasting  I say that I know of no country in the world that could suffer what Lebanon has suffered in the course of the past five years and yet maintain the fundamentals of homeland and statehood. What our citizens possess in awareness and potential  together with the continued endeavour of the Government in circumstances difficult to visualize  has made it possible to preserve the principles of legality and unity  the identity of Lebanon and its democratic and liberal system  and its openness towards the world. This is no small matter.251.	Since the beginning external factors have permeated the Lebanese crisis  giving it grave dimensions and putting appropriate solutions out of the reach of the Lebanese alone. In order for the Lebanese to solve their problems and rescue their homeland  external interference should cease  regional and international currents of struggle for influence on the Lebanese scene should recede and aggression on Lebanon's territory and against its national sovereignty should cease.252.	These external factors of the Lebanese crisis have aroused the concern of some sister and friendly States and made us resort on more than one occasion and for one reason or another to the Arab community as well as to the Security Council with the aim of finding effective solutions.253.	Several resolutions have been adopted proclaiming the necessity of safeguarding Lebanon's unity  its independence and the security of its land  and of extending its sovereignty over its entire territory. It pains us to say  however  that most of those resolutions were not provided with the means for their implementation because  in general  they avoided confronting the root of the problem. Purposely  or as a result of weakness  they put aside some aspects of the crisis  although their authors are fully aware of the various aspects of the problem  through their representatives and emissaries. They became similar to abstract resolutions  making us wonder about the real attitude of some States  despite their statements of full support for Lebanon.254.	During the past few months Israel has not stopped launching devastating raids on southern Lebanon. In these acts of aggression Israel has been using sophisticated American weapons  thus violating with impunity agreements that prohibit the use of those weapons for such purposes. The United States of America must reconcile its principles with its practices and take the necessary measures to impose respect for the agreements under which the weapons are provided  thus putting into practical terms its concern for Lebanon's independence and safety of its territory.255.	Southern Lebanon  this unfortunate district so dear to the Lebanese  which continues to suffer from repeated aggression and contradictions that result on its soil from the disruptions that often accompany Palestinian resistance action  appreciates the effort undertaken by the United Nations through the Security Council to deal with its problems  even though that effort has not been so fruitful as we and the Assembly would have wished it to be.256.	If Lebanon and the people of its southern region are at present helpless and unable to check this tragedy  they hold  more than at any time in the past  to their powers and their right to tell the world that they do not and will not agree to any measure or policy emanating from whatever source that has as its aim interference with their land and their sacred right to it. Their true patriotism and sincere commitment to the Palestinian cause carry with them the categorical rejection of any occupation or threat or blackmail that touches on their land or their rights.257.	In spite of the circumstances which limit its scope of action  the Lebanese Government can proclaim a position that is dictated by national duty and agreed on by all the Lebanese people  namely  that no one can derive from occupation or from resort to violence any right vis-a-vis Lebanon or its territory or any right to exercise tutelage over any part of Lebanon or its people.258.	While it is southern Lebanon which reveals these truths to us  they apply equally to Lebanon as a whole.259.	During the past year we urgently sought full implementation of the resolutions of the Security Council  and asked that UNIFIL be enabled to carry out its mandate to ensure Israel's complete withdrawal from Lebanese territory and help the Lebanese authorities to restore their sovereignty over all of southern Lebanon  and over all parties operating in it  up to the internationally recognized borders. We also wanted the Mixed Armistice Commission to resume its functions as provided for in Security Council resolutions.260.	We should  in this connection  praise the efforts of the Secretary-General and of his staff to ensure the success of UNIFIL's task  and we express to him and his staff our profound gratitude. We wish also to-express our deep appreciation to the Security Council  to the countries contributing to UNIFIL  and to its troops  officers and soldiers.261.	The peace-keeping mission which the Security Council has set up and still supervises has been a positive step in spite of the obstacles to its fulfilment. The Secretary- General refers in his report on the work of the Organization to the important role of this Force  despite the difficulties it faces  which are well known to the Assembly. The Lebanese Government has more than once expressed the extreme importance it attaches to the presence of UNIFIL  its earnest desire fully to co-operate with this Force  and the necessity of ensuring the full implementation of the Security Council resolutions.262.	Consequently we earnestly call upon the Security Council to safeguard its authority and credibility by taking whatever measures are needed to enable UNIFIL to carry out its mandate in southern Lebanon and put an end to the cruel Israeli aggression against the region.263.	We rely in this respect on the assistance of the major Powers and on the true co-operation of sister Arab States  in conformity with the dictates of real fraternal links and common interests  and we appeal to all States which believe in the Charter.264.	The Palestinian resistance is invited today  more than ever before  to provide proof of its desire to respect its commitments and demonstrate awareness and a spirit of responsibility with regard to its temporary presence in Lebanon  to exert every effort to reach a sincere understanding with Lebanon  to avoid anything that may harm its relations with the Lebanese authorities and citizens  and finally to guard against taking the slippery path it has not always succeeded in avoiding. It well knows how much Lebanon can endure without being destroyed.265.	Lebanon  its Government and people  have consistently supported the rightful cause of the Palestinians since the Palestine question first arose. Lebanon has offered to that cause sacrifices which exceed many times those offered by others who are in a much better position to do so. Lebanon has proclaimed and reiterated its keen concern to avoid the emergence of a contradiction between the Palestine cause  to which we are committed  and the Lebanese cause  on which the life of the citizens  the future of the homeland and the security of its territory  are dependent. Lebanon expects to receive understanding and a favourable response  especially from those directly concerned  in order to be able to persevere in this course and fulfil its well-known mission  which it freely chose without any kind of constraint.266.	Before concluding  I cannot but refer to a most serious matter concerning suspect plans being hatched to settle Palestinians in Lebanon  when in fact the Palestinians demand their right to their own land.267.	By what right and according to what justice do some intend to redress one inequity by a greater injustice  to solve the rightful problem of a people at the expense of another people  to disturb the equilibrium of a homeland  and to risk the entity of a State that is one of the founding Members of the United Nations?268.	We confirm what the President of Lebanon has announced on more than one occasion. We unequivocally reject any plan for settlement and any move to bring it about  directly or indirectly. We shall resist settlement under any guise and at any stage and we shall resist it with all our power  which springs from our belief in our sacred right to our homeland  a right that no one shares with us.269.	Lebanon's territory is not an abandoned land  and it is not a commodity to be bartered in international transactions. Our people have been deeply rooted in this land for hundreds of years  and succeeding generations have preserved and will continue to preserve every inch of Lebanese soil.270.	A homeland cannot be built on the ruins of another homeland. Whoever indulges in this line of thought is not only an enemy of Lebanon and of its cause  but also an enemy of the Palestinian cause itself  and of peace and justice in the world. The Middle East crisis which has arisen as a result of the plundering of Palestinian land is a living proof of the absurdity of such thinking.271.	When  as a young State  we participated in the founding of the United Nations  we were convinced  like scores of States that later on joined this great community  that the Organization would provide an adequate framework guaranteeing peace  justice and security in the world  and that its lofty tenets and the provisions of its Charter would put an end to the law of the jungle and the arbitrariness of force in international relations.272.	In spite of the wrongs  the tragedies  the failures  the weaknesses and the indifference we have witnessed  we remain convinced that there is still time for the Organization to dispel the prevailing frustration and fulfil mankind's hopes in the United Nations."
"79",4001,"LBR",35,1980,"ï»¿My delegation brings greetings to the Assembly from the Government and people of Liberia under the leadership of the People's Redemption Council  chaired by Master Sergeant Samuel Kanyon Doe.151.	We congratulate Ambassador von Wechmar on his election to preside over the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. His election is a manifestation of the esteem in which both he and his country are held. He can be assured of my delegation's fullest cooperation with him in the discharge of his duties.152.	His predecessor  Ambassador Salim A. Salim  has earned the deep appreciation of us all for the outstanding manner in which he conducted the affairs of the thirty fourth session and three special sessions of the General Assembly. We  as Africans  are all proud of him for the honour he has brought to his country  the United Republic of Tanzania  and to our continent.153.	We extend sincere thanks and appreciation to the Secretary General for his untiring efforts dedicated to the cause of peace.154.	Liberia is pleased at this time to welcome Saint Vincent and the Grenadines into the United Nations. We are happy also that our sister State  Zimbabweâwhich we welcomed to membership at the eleventh special session  on economic developmentâis actively participating with us in the work of this session. The admission of those new States brings us closer to the Organization's much cherished goal of universality.155.	The presence of our delegation here today is confirmation enough that the days are ending when Governments can come to this forum and advocate liberty  peace  security and social justice on the international level without attaching any significance to those principles and objectives in their own countries. International peace and security must be built upon domestic harmony and tranquillity. At times  however  domestic peace can be assured only by recourse to radical changes. This the Liberian people found it necessary to do.156.	Our people could no longer endure a political system which maintained a property qualification for voting or for seeking elective office. We could no longer accept a situation in which 70 per cent of the population derived an annual per capita income of $74 while 4 per cent earned $3 500. We were tired of 90 per cent illiteracy and one of the highest infant mortality rates in the world. We found unacceptable an existence in which thousands of people in our country had never seen a hospital or a school  despite the consistent and very punctual visits of the tax collector.157.	Thus it was that on 12 April 1980 the men and women of the armed forces of Liberia  acting for the Liberian people  removed from power the True Whig Party Government because of rampant corruption  misuse of public office and gross violation of the constitutional rights of the Liberian people. The events of 12 April were the climax of a long struggle by the Liberian people to inaugurate a new society in our country. It was a struggle of the broad masses of our people: students and teachers  workers and civil servants  the urban and rural public  and  decisively  our men and women in arms. It was a struggle to secure freedom  justice  equality  human dignity  equal opportunity and full participation by all citizens in the determination of their destiny.158.	The goal of our people's strivings and the resultant revolution is not the elimination of any ethnic grouping of our society or the replacement of one group of exploiters by another. The Liberian revolution seeks to remove the gross political  social and economic disparities by which a privileged few were able to subject the masses of our people to untold degradation. In spite of the tremendous popularity of the Liberian revolution and the massive support which the People's Redemption Council enjoys  the Council has repeatedly given assurances to the Liberian people that the armed forces will return to the barracks as soon as the deplorable conditions which led to their seizing power have been brought under control. The probability is high that this can be achieved by 1983  when the next presidential election would have fallen due.159.	Although Liberia has changed its Government  it has not changed the essential foundations of its foreign policy. Liberia's national interests  international obligations and friendships have not changed. What has changed  however  is our perception and interpretation of those interests  obligations and friendships. Our faith in the ideals and goals of the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity [OAU] is unshakeable.160.	Our confidence in the principles of the movement of nonaligned countries is steadfast. However  Liberia will be genuinely nonaligned. We shall vigorously resist becoming trapped in the web of superpower rivalry. We shall not permit our country to be used as a surrogate acting for external interests. Never shall we permit our friends to determine who our enemies ought to be.161.	We adhere to the principle of self-determination and the right of every people to determine its own political  economic and social systems without outside interference of any kind. Our commitment to the total liberation of Africa from colonialism  apartheid and other forms of discrimination and exploitation remains firm. We shall encourage greater emphasis on inter-African cooperation  while the safeguarding of our national interests shall remain paramount.162.	The free enterprise system  based on the private investment of domestic and foreign capital  will be maintained  while investors will be encouraged to show a greater sense of social responsibility. We shall continue to promote genuine partnership between domestic capital  public as well as private  and foreign investment through our open-door policy. We condemn the exploitation and the diversion of the resources of our people to uses other than for their advancement.163.	Having said that much about the Liberian revolution  I should like to make a few comments on some of the items on the agenda of this session.164.	South Africa remains an implacable enemy of African freedom and independence. By outright defiance and by one subterfuge after another it continues to pit its will against the international community over Namibia's transition to independence. Worse  South Africa continues unlawfully to use Namibia for committing incessant and unprovoked acts of aggression against neighbouring African States  while  on the home front  its apartheid policy has become even more vicious  strengthened by massive assistance in military aid and technology from its friends abroad.165.	From all indications  it is clear that South Africa will never end its occupation of Namibia nor abandon its racist apartheid policy without the intensification of the liberation struggle within South Africa and the imposition by the Organization of enforcement measures under Chapter VII of the Charter. The United Nations must  therefore  reaffirm and demonstrate its support for the people of South Africa and Namibia in their struggle to free themselves from oppression and the brutal and dehumanizing system of apartheid.166.	The situation in Afghanistan and Kampuchea suggests that the small States are exposed to dangerous threats to their independence and sovereignty if the principles of the Charter that offer them protection can be flouted with impunity at any time a major power chooses. If the credibility of the Organization is to be maintained  it must condemn any violation of the Charter  regardless of which State is responsible for the breach  and despite the pretext that State may advance.167.	The situation in the Middle East remains one of the greatest threats to international peace and security in our time. Liberia has consistently followed  and continues to follow  a policy based on the following: first  that a just and lasting peace cannot prevail in the Middle East without due recognition of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  including their right to a State of their own; secondly  Israel must completely withdraw from all occupied Arab lands; and  thirdly  all States in the region  including Israel  have a right to live freely within secured and internationally recognized boundaries  with the fullest respect for their territorial integrity and sovereignty.168.	Acceptance of those principles by many States has not produced peace while  for many others  the attainment of peace is a precondition for the acceptance of those principles. Thus  deadlock and stalemate persist in the Middle East  where grave threats to the peace of the world have already broken into open hostilities.169.	Against that background those who have advanced or supported agreements  even though partial ones  that are aimed at breaking the deadlock do serve the cause of peace. For us one thing is certain: that problem cannot be resolved peacefully unless communication and dialogue between and among all those desirous of effecting peaceful change can occur. For that reason  my Government believes that the time has come for all States that have severed diplomatic links with Israel to begin a re-examination of their policy with a view to the establishment of some links  however limited  that would facilitate communication. For us  that re-examination seems all the more appropriate since our sister African State  Egypt  in whose support our diplomatic ties with Israel were severed  has now established formal ties with that country.170.	The outstanding success of the country of the current President of the General Assembly in the years since the United Nations was founded demonstrates what can happen when nations devote their energies to peace. The lessons of that example ought to be marked by all of us during this year when the Federal Republic of Germany presides over the General Assembly."
"80",4047,"LBY",35,1980,"ï»¿On behalf of the delegation of the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya I should like to express to Mr. von Wechmar our delight and congratulations on this election as President of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. I should like also to commend his predecessor  Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim  for his sincere efforts during his presidency when the General Assembly was engaged in intensive activities represented by three special sessions in addition to the regular session. I take this opportunity to express the gratitude and appreciation of the Libyan delegation for his efforts.160.	My delegation also wishes to congratulate both Zimbabwe and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines on their attainment of independence and welcomes their accession to membership of the United Nations.161.	I should like to commend Mr. Kurt Waldheim  the Secretary-General of the United Nations  for his efforts and perseverance in consolidating the opportunities for peace and stability in the world. My country reiterates its support for his efforts in enhancing the role of the Organization and promoting its objectives so that humanity may enjoy peace and prosperity.162.	More than 34 years have passed since the establishment of this Organization and the promulgation of its Charter. No one doubts that it has done a lot in fulfilling the objectives set out in its Charter  which was approved by our countries and peoples. Yet  in spite of the achievements made in the field of international peace  in the area of decolonization and in the economic field  a glance at the current international situation will confirm that humanity  after being optimistic about the establishment of this Organization  is now experiencing a deep sense of despair. Pessimism is replacing optimism. If asked about the cause of this pessimism  our answer would be that there are still peoples deprived of their right to self-determination and others who continue to live under racist and colonial regimes.163.	There are also peoples which are still victims of abject poverty as a result of the reluctance of colonialist Powers to give up their privileges and monopolies in the world  as well as their persistence in exploiting the people  controlling their capabilities and preventing them from exercising their national rights.164.	As a result of the struggle waged by the people and the national liberation movements  as well as the political struggle within the United Nations  colonialism is now witnessing its demise but is still trying desperately to maintain its hegemony and monopolies in various regions of the world.165.	Everyone is aware of the deteriorating situation on the African continent resulting from the continuing imperialist intervention in the affairs of some African States  the war waged against the liberal and progressive regimes  the creation of weak subordinate entities  and the existence of the racist regime in southern Africa  with its repeated attacks on the people of the continent  its disregard for human rights and its persistence in violating the principles of the Charter and pursuing its racist policy. The insistence of the racist regime in South Africa on applying its racist practices against the black majority is an affront to the conscience of man and to the United Nations. It is the historic responsibility of this Organization to eliminate the disease of racism.166.	Our people can never forget that it was imperialism that created the Pretoria racist regime and that it was imperialism that helped maintain and supply it with deadly weapons and various forms of assistance. Imperialism can never be a mediator  for it is the foremost enemy of the African people. The solution of the Namibian problem is not possible  except by enabling the Namibian people  under the leadership of its national movement  SWAPO  to attain full and immediate independence. That is what we made clear to the United Nations Council for Namibia in the course of its recent visit to the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya when we said that the lack of progress in the negotiations undertaken  pursuant to Security Council resolutions 385 (1976) and 435 (1978)  was caused by the manoeuvres of the illegal regime in South Africa that are designed to frustrate the legitimate aspirations of the Namibian people. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya reiterates that a just and lasting settlement of the question of Namibia can be reached only through the direct and full participation of SWAPO as the sole and legitimate representative of the Namibian people.167.	The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya affirms its determination to continue all possible forms of support to the Namibian people and other front-line peoples in southern Africa. The racist regimes in the world do not differ in ideology or in style. Although they exist in different locations they remain one and the same. What is going on in southern Africa is no different from what is now happening in our Arab region.168.	The situation in the African continent cannot be viewed in isolation from what is going on in the Arab region. The imperialism that created and continues to help the racist regimes in Africa is the same imperialism that created the Zionist racist regime in Palestine. The American imperialism that succeeded British colonialism supports the Zionist racist regime in Palestine and supplies it with funds and weaponry  not only to strengthen its occupation of Palestine  but also to continue its aggression and expansion at the expense of the Arab nation. Palestine has been occupied and its people uprooted for more than 30 yearsâa period almost equal to the life of the United Nations. The international community has not taken any practical action to restore to the rightful owners their rights  put an end to injustice and enable the Palestinian people to return to their lands. It is true that hundreds of resolutions have been adopted by this Organization condemning the Zionist racist regime in Palestine  calling for implementation of relevant United Nations resolutions and compliance with international legitimacy. But what has been the fate of those resolutions and why have they not been implemented? Why does the Zionist racist regime ignore them?169.	The absolute bias of the United States Government towards the Zionist entity no longer requires any proof. Everyone knows that the United States extends full support and massive assistance to the Zionist entity in all areas- political  economic and militaryâto the point where such assistance has become a subject of publicity by the candidates for the presidency of the United States. All of them assert and boast of the fact that their respective parties have given to the Zionist entity much more than the others  Such a stand by the United States  which supports and supplies the Zionist entity  together with its open opposition to the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people and its reluctance to recognize the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  is a betrayal of its responsibility both as a super-Power and a permanent member of the Security Council  and also proves that the United States is not serious in trying to find a peaceful solution to the Palestinian question  as its authorities claim to be doing.170.	The United States  whose every action shows that it is against the rights of the people  and particularly the Palestinians  cannot be the mediator to resolve this issue. It is primarily responsible for the sufferings of the Palestinian people. It bears the full responsibility for the intransigence of racist Zionism in Palestine and its rejection of the relevant United Nations resolutions. The United States is responsible before history for the wars and tragedies from which the region has suffered and for preventing the Security Council from adopting any practical resolution.171.	The Palestinian cause is the cause of people who were driven out of their homeland and whose land was given to alien immigrants  while attempts were made to liquidate them. What is now happening in the Arab region  from moves towards surrender to the signing of the Camp David accords  is nothing but a series of attempts to legitimize the usurper and enable him to expand and occupy more Arab lands. What is called the peace process  namely what is now happening in the Arab region between the Zionist enemy and the Egyptian regime  on the one hand  and the United States on the other  is in fact nothing but a process of liquidation of the Palestinian people  designed to put an end to its existence  destroy its national aspirations and undermine the unity of the Arab nations.172.	What was signed at Camp David cannot be regarded as a basis for peace in the region  as it will only increase tension there and threaten international peace and security. A glance at those accords shows that they run contrary to international legitimacy  for they disregard the cause of the Palestinian people  which is universally recognized as the essence and origin of the Middle East problem. In addition  they deny the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. All that those accords refer to can be called the farce of a spurious rule of autonomy. The parties to the Camp David accords have also disregarded the United Nations resolutions relating to the right of refugees to return to their homes'. Those accords also infringe upon the sovereignty of other States by providing that they are to apply to the peace treaties between what is called Israel and its neighbours: Egypt  Jordan  Syria and Lebanon. It is thus clear that the parties to the Camp David accords have violated the primary principle of the Charter of the United Nations  which affirms ""the sovereign equality of all its Members""  Moreover  the Camp David accords were signed by parties which did not enjoy the legitimacy or the authority to speak on behalf of the Palestinian people  The United Nations has recognized the PLO as the legitimate and sole representative of the Palestinian people 173.	It has become clear to everyone  especially since the signing of the Camp David deal and the capitulation treaty  that tension in the region has increased and the danger of war has materialized. The best indications of that are the repeated Zionist attacks against Lebanon  the concentration by the Egyptian regime of troop; along the borders with the Jamahiriya  in co-ordination and co-operation with the United States  and the declaration by the Egyptian regime of a state of emergency along those borders.174.	My country's stand in confronting and rejecting the Camp David accords is clear and well known. Those accords have been condemned by resolutions of the summit meetings held by Arab  Islamic  African and non-aligned countries. They were even condemned by the General Assembly at its last session and they were condemned and rejected by all sectors of the Palestinian people. Such condemnation of the Camp David accords is the best indication of the fact that they represent only a deal  designed to strengthen the occupation and force the Palestinian people and the Arab nation to surrender.175.	A just solution of the Palestinian question can be achieved only by stopping the migration of invaders to Palestine  by returning the settlers to their countries of origin  and by enabling the Palestinian people to regain its right to self-determination through the establishment of a democratic Palestinian State consisting of Palestinians  Arabs and Jews alike  in which the three major religions shall exist in harmony.176.	It is time for this Assembly to shoulder it responsibility and impose sanctions on the Zionist entity  which not only rejects the resolutions of this Organization but also persists in defying those resolutions  behaviour which is certain to tarnish the reputation of the United Nations.177.	The disdain and rejection shown by the Zionist entity towards United Nations resolutions make it imperative that this Assembly adopt decisive and solemn resolutions to penalize the Zionist entity and expel it from the United Nations  if respect for the Charter and for the resolutions of this Organization is to be restored  in order that it may pursue its noble task.178.	The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya  out of its firm belief in the right of people to self-determination  in accordance with the principles of the Charter and United Nations resolutions  supports the struggle of the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic for the consolidation of its independence and sovereignty  particularly since that Republic has been recognized by over 42 States Members of the United Nations.179.	The United Nations and the international community have sought to achieve the noble objectives enshrined in the Charter. They have some achievements to their credit  such as a number of treaties banning nuclear tests and prohibiting the proliferation of nuclear weapons  and the convening in 1978 of the tenth special session  devoted to disarmament. The convening of that session on the initiative of the non-aligned States was an important step towards disarmament. Moreover  the Committee on Disarmament and the Disarmament Commission are endeavouring to save the world from the ravages of war and to devote all possible resources to the welfare and benefit of the human community.180.	Yet  all those attempts and efforts will not produce a positive result so long as international relations are not based on justice and democracy but rather on injustice  oppression  inequality  selfishness  exploitation and monopoly. The imperialist nuclear Powers are continuing to build up their arsenals and to develop new types of weapons of destruction. In general  they are in a continuous arms race Furthermore  they have not tried to share nuclear technology for peaceful purposes with the developing countries. The nuclear Powers seek to benefit from the privileges contained in certain agreements on disarmament such as the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons of 1968  but they do not fulfil the obligations contained therein; they exercise a monopoly and do not wish to transfer nuclear technology to third world countries for peaceful purposes. The aforementioned efforts are also hindered by the existence of foreign military bases  which had been reduced in number because of the liberation movements  but have begun to appear anew. The United States  for instance  is deploying its missiles and bases throughout the world  especially in our Arab and African regions. Those bases are a nuisance and a threat to the security and independence of the areas  a sort of domination  a political  economic and military hegemony  and a control over the capabilities of peoples whose Governments have allowed the presence of such bases on their territory.181.	Consequently  we demand that such bases be removed  especially from the Mediterranean  Africa  the Arab world  South-East Asia  South Korea and Latin America  in order to eliminate the danger of war and contribute to the cause of world peace.182.	All those factors create obstacles and difficulties for the efforts and attempts undertaken by the United Nations in the field of disarmament  and require colonized people and third world States to suffer enormous losses and to set aside substantial proportions of their budgets for the purpose of safeguarding their freedom  their security and their independence.183.	In that connection  I should like to note that  wishing to achieve peace and avoid the dangers of nuclear weapons  my country has signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty. It has also signed an agreement with IAEA on the application in Libya of safeguards under the Non-Proliferation Treaty. The Jamahiriya supports the call for making the Indian Ocean a zone of peace and it endorses the proposal made by the Democratic Republic of Madagascar for the convening of a summit meeting on that matter.184.	The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya  as one of the non- aligned countries  believes in the great role that can be played by the non-aligned movement in maintaining and promoting world peace and security and restructuring the world economy on a just basis that would serve the interests of the entire international community. Recent events have proved that the non-aligned group has played and continues to play a key role in political and economic events in the world  because of the effectiveness of its role in achieving peace  security and prosperity  and through its awareness of the international responsibility entrusted to it. The peoples of the world look up to the non-aligned movement as an impartial movement devoid of any notion of exploitation  monopoly and domination  and hence able to contribute to the achievement of economic and political justice  in the interest of world peace and of well-being for humanity at large. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya  confirming its  adherence and devotion to the principles upon which the non- aligned movement is based  will do its utmost to support this movement and to help it achieve its objectives of prosperity and security for all the peoples of the world.185.	With regard to the situation in Cyprus  that friendly country with which we have strong relations and which belongs to the Mediterranean basin and to the non-aligned movement  the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya hopes that the current efforts will be crowned with success by reaching an agreement that would preserve the rights of both the Greek and the Turkish communities and re-establish the unity  sovereignty  independence and non-aligned status of Cyprus.186.	The situation in Central America is becoming increasingly dangerous and explosive  particularly in El Salvador  where the United States is engaged in open intervention in the internal affairs of a small country with the purpose not only of terrorizing the people of El Salvador but  ultimately  all the peoples of the entire region. We in Libya strongly condemn the American imperialist challenges in the area and declare our solidarity with the people of El Salvador and the other peoples of the region which are waging a struggle for their freedom  independence and dignity.187.	The international economic order is still suffering from the crisis of the late 1960s  whose impact on the system has not diminished  despite all the attempts that have been made. Inflation continues to be the main characteristic of today's economy and unemployment still threatens millions of people. All the attempts designed to reform the international economic order have failed because they were merely superficial measures designed to alleviate the crisis and not to reform the system. This order can only be reformed by its restructuring to conform with current international economic and political conditions  which differ radically from those that prevailed when it was established. The existing economic order has become an obstacle to the developing countries  which did not take part in shaping it because some of them were suffering at that time from colonialist domination in both its political and economic forms. Today  having achieved their political freedom and entered the stage of economic liberation  those countries face the obstacle posed by the fact that the international economic order does not respond to their just demands for even- handed dealing and an equal opportunity for all nations to contribute to economic decision-making.188.	The whole world has recognized the need to change the economic order and expressed that need in the course of the sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly  at which resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 (S-VI) containing the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order and the relevant Programme of Action were adopted by consensus. Unfortunately  it has become clear that recognition is one thing and the will to effect the change is another. Although six years have passed since the adoption of those resolutions  the position of the developed countries still stands as an obstacle in the way of efforts being made by the developing countries and the international community to change the international economic order and implement the United Nations resolutions concerning the new international economic order.189.	The developing countries believe that their economic and social development cannot be carried out under this system  and they are therefore determined to change it. Their efforts in this field began in the 1960s with the creation of UNCTAD and were continued during the sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly  by the adoption of the International Development Strategy for the first and second United Nations Development Decades  and finally by the proposal for launching a series of global negotiations designed to examine economic problems on a comprehensive and coherent basis with a view to reaching comprehensive agreements. In those negotiations  studies will be conducted simultaneously on raw materials  energy  development and trade and money and finance  in order to ensure a coherent and integrated approach to the issues being negotiated.190.	The year 1980 is the last year in the second United Nations Development Decade. Although the Decade is nearing its end  the objectives set forth in its Strategy have not been achieved. Again  the failure of the Strategy is due to the fact that the developed countries have not fulfilled their obligations towards the developing countries. Even the goal of committing 0.7 per cent of their gross national product for official development assistance has not been met. On the one hand  those countries complain that the economic conditions do not allow them to increase the rate of assistance in real terms  and on the other  they hinder the changing of these conditions by avoiding implementation of the resolutions relating to the new international economic order. Military expenditure reaches approximately $500 billion annually  while development aid to developing countries has not exceeded 5 per cent of that figure. This is a clear indication of the unwillingness of the developed countries to assist developing countries in their development efforts.191.	The topic of the development strategy goes far beyond the appropriation of a certain percentage of the gross national product as development aid and embraces the universal recognition of the need to advance third world economies and to eliminate the elements of backwardness and hunger. Without this recognition and the necessary political will  no development could be achieved or any objectives met.192.	. The international monetary system has become unable to fulfil the aspirations of the developing countries. This system  established under the Bretton Woods Agreements when United Nations membership was 55 States  is no longer compatible with present-day aspirations. Since the establishment of this system  there have been major changes in the political and economic balance of power. Consequently  a change in the system has become unavoidable  if it is to conform to the new economic and political conditions. This system  which actually collapsed in August 1971 when the United States stopped the conversion of the dollar into gold  has become a counter-productive factor instead of being a helpful one in international economic co-operation in general and in the development plans and programmes of the developing countries in particular. This system  which relies on the dominance of one currency  has become incompatible with our era  the era of equality and mutual respect. It has become unacceptable  not only politically but also economically. All attempts to reform it have failed for one simple reason  that is  such reform was carried out under the auspices of an institution that is still controlled by a group of developed countries. No serious attempts at reform can be expected within the framework of such an institution. The reforms are still being made in the absence of the developing countries  which remain mere spectators. They are not given any significant role in this field. Reform of this system must be carried out in connection with the series of international global negotiations and in a forum of universal representation where every voice is heard and all points of view are taken into consideration.193.	The oil price increase is still one of the most important subjects preoccupying the mass media in the developed countries  as though it were the only problem now facing the world. These institutions continue to depict the oil- exporting developing countries as if they were responsible for the problems that the world economy faces. They have even influenced some of the officials in developing countries  for we hear every now and then statements from them that are consistent with what the mass media in developed countries are saying all the time. Officials in developed countries are lamenting the state of affairs in which the developing countries find themselves as a result of the increase in oil prices  while they forget their obligations towards those countries. This contradiction refutes the allegations of those countries and figures prove beyond doubt that the international economic crisis has developed as a result of the world economic system  on the one hand  and the extravagant and wasteful utilization of natural resources  on the other. Indeed  one is surprised to find that an individual in the United States consumes in one year an amount of energy equivalent to what an African consumes in 95 years and a citizen of a nation member of the Organization of Oil Exporting Countries [OPEC] in 26 years. These figures demonstrate an extravagance which characterizes the behaviour of developed countries in their use of limited natural resources. Even the claims we hear from time to time that developed countries have taken measures to reduce consumption are groundless  for the reduction of energy consumption was a result of international economic conditions and the recession that ensued and was not the result of a planned economic policy. The economic crisis is due to the unbridled increase in government expenditure in developed countries and wage policies which follow political slogans and which are not based on economic facts  and thus lead to a rise in world inflation rates.194.	The world has never before witnessed a small group of countries performing a service such as that proffered by the OPEC countries. They provide the developed countries with unlimited supplies of oil  in economic circumstances that allow only a certain level of production to comply with their limited economic goals. Recognizing the need to protect the world economy  those countries have been producing quantities of energy exceeding their current financing requirements of their only resource from which they finance their various development programmes and which belongs to future generations. As for the developing countries  the OPEC countries have extended to them every kind of financial assistance  at ratios exceeding 10 per cent of their gross national product in the case of some countries  and 5.6 per cent for the Organization as a whole.195.	Co-operation among developing countries is the right approach to achieve political and economic solidarity. It is also another means of achieving economic and social development for those countries. The importance of co-operation has increased especially after the failure of the dialogue with the developed countries and after the latter proved that the only thing they wanted to achieve from that dialogue was furtherance of their own interests  regardless of the pressing needs of the developing countries. Co-operation among developing countries has progressed considerably and has been further reinforced in the wake of the ministerial meeting held during March 1980.196.	In this connection  I should like to express the support of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya for that dialogue aimed at achieving the desired aims of co-operation and solidarity of the developing countries and at contributing to their economic and social development.197.	The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya  which has always affirmed its support for the United Nations and its adherence to United Nations resolutions  believes that it is high time for this Organization to assume a more positive role in achieving its objectives of bringing about peace and security  the realization of freedom for human beings and the elimination of injustice and colonization. The Jamahiriya believes that it is high time to re-evaluate the role played by this Organization and to eliminate everything that hampers its effectiveness and its contribution to seeking appropriate solutions to international political and economic problems. In this context  the Libyan delegation believes that it has become necessary to amend the Charter of the United Nations. For this Charter  which was formulated at a time when the membership of the United Nations was no more than one third of its membership today and in international circumstances that we all know  is no longer suitable for or compatible with current international conditions. Keeping the veto limited to a small number of States is one of the main factors that hamper the effectiveness of the Organization and prevent it from playing its desired role. It is time to amend the Charter to ensure equality among States  regardless of their human and material resources  in order to enable all Member States to contribute effectively towards the achievement of peace and prosperity for the world.198.	At the thirty-fourth session  the General Assembly  as a result of pressures exerted by the big Powers  failed to decide on the draft resolution recommended by the Sixth Committee in paragraph 21 of its report;  paragraph 1 of that draft resolution provided that the Special Committee on the United Nations Charter and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization should review the rule that requires the unanimity of the permanent members of the Security Council in the adoption of decisions concerning non-procedural matters  and that the Committee  in so doing  should bear in mind certain considerations  including: (a) the principle of equality among States; (b) the fact that maintaining world peace and security is a great responsibility requiring the active participation of all the countries and peoples of the world; (c) strengthening the Security Council's role in maintaining world peace and security.199.	That draft resolution also included a provision concerning the preparation by the Secretary-General of a study on the question of the right of veto so as to clarify  in particular  the following: (a) the views expressed within the interested United Nations bodies concerning the difficulties posed by the use of the veto with regard to the fulfilment of the United Nations aims and objectives; (b) the attempts made in the past to alleviate the impact of using that right and the effectiveness of those attempts; (c) the proposals made within the United Nations bodies concerned  to alleviate the impact of the use of the veto and the alternative formulas which might replace it.200.	The failure of the General Assembly at the last session to adopt the recommendation of the Sixth Committee in this regard and the consequent practices relating to the use of the veto during the past period have proved that the right of veto represents a weak point in the structure of this international Organization  that it limits its role in maintaining international peace and security and contravenes the principle of equality among States.201.	Consequently  the question of the right of veto should  objectively and with a sense of international responsibility  be reviewed and studied in a comprehensive manner  to determine the best ways of ensuring progress for the Organization and enabling it to exercise more successfully its responsibilities in maintaining international peace and security  by enhancing its ability to adopt and implement effective resolutions.202.	The territory of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya was a theatre of operations for the belligerent Powers during the Second World War. It was even turned into a battlefield. All the Libyan cities and lands suffered from destruction and sabotage. The damage incurred  whether in lives or in property  was serious. What is worse is that Libya  even 35 years after the end of the Second World War  is still suffering from the scourges of that war as a result of the minefields planted by those forces at that time. Thousands of Libyan victims were killed or maimed because of minefields that sowed death and destruction on Libyan soil.203.	Due to the selfishness and reluctance of the belligerent States  which are responsible for what has happened as a result of those mines  and their refusal to reveal and to co-operate in providing the maps showing their locations  the number of victims continues to increase.204.	The international community is now aware of this fact  which comprises three elements: first  that the countries and peoples of the third world have suffered damage in life and property  due to the colonialist wars that were waged on their territories; secondly  that the economic development programmes in those countries have been adversely affected by the vestiges of those wars  such as mines and so forth; thirdly  that the warring States and the aggressive colonialist Powers continue to be reluctant and evade their responsibility to eliminate traces of their war operations by not giving the location of planted minefields and failing to provide compensation for the losses in life and property caused by them.205.	The international community reaffirmed its awareness of these facts and its clear desire to find solutions for them through several international resolutions concerning the elimination of the traces of war  including planted minefields  especially those resolutions adopted by the General Assembly  the non-aligned countries  the Islamic Conference and the Board of Governors of UNEP. The latest of these resolutions was adopted by the Eleventh Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers held at Islamabad from 17 to 22 May 1980. It stressed that the colonialist Powers must compensate the developing countries for losses incurred because of mines planted on their territories. It also emphasized that the colonialist countries should not be allowed to evade their responsibility for the enormous damages resulting from those mines  that full responsibility must be shouldered by them and that they should take the initiative in compensating the affected countries for those losses.206.	In the context of United Nations concern with human rights problems  in 1976 the General Assembly declared 1981 the International Year for Disabled Persons  with the theme of ""Full participation and equality""  on the proposal of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. In this connection  we should like to take this opportunity to make a sincere humanitarian appeal to the international community to help make that year successful and help it achieve its humanitarian objectives. Initial statistics show that there are in our world more than 450 million disabled persons  most of whom live in the developing countries. Those persons  like their peers who are not handicapped  are entitled to enjoy a free and decent life.207.	We should like to take this opportunity to extend our thanks and gratitude to the United Nations and to all the international and non-governmental organizations that have made positive contributions to the preparations for the International Year for Disabled Persons and to ensuring its success. Given the importance of this subject  my delegation proposes the inclusion of an item on the International Year for Disabled Persons among the items to be discussed at plenary meetings of the thirty-sixth session  which will take place during the International Year for Disabled Persons.208.	The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya is following with most profound sorrow and concern the events taking place between its brothers in Iran and Iraq. It believes that such events should never have taken place  that the blood of innocent people should never have been spilled  and that all their strength should have been preserved to confront the real enemies  headed by colonialism and Zionism. The Jamahiriya therefore appeals to those brothers to put an end to the bloodshed  to take steps to find peaceful solutions so that the war may be terminated and their dispute settled amicably.209.	In conclusion  I am happy to point out that  on the basis of the fundamental goals cherished by the masses of the Arab nation throughout the Arab homelandâthat of achieving Arab unity  building socialism and liberating the occupied territories of the Arab homelandâand in the belief that Arab unity is that nation's destiny and fate and that in Arab unity lies its future and its salvation  a declaration of the establishment of a merger between Syria and Libya has been made  a merger for which we wish complete success and fulfilment and which we hope will be the nucleus of the unity of the Arab nation as a whole."
"81",4082,"LCA",35,1980,"ï»¿May I extend congratulations  on behalf of my country and myself  to Ambassador von Wechmar on his election to the presidency of the thirty- fifth session of the General Assembly. We have every confidence that he will carry out the tasks entrusted to him with appropriate diplomatic skills and objectivity.296.	This session has convened in a year already heightened by the sixth and seventh emergency special sessions  devoted respectively to Afghanistan and the question of Palestine  and the eleventh special session  on the question of economic development. Those sessions have focused on some of the economic and political crises that beset this international community and they emphasize the role that the United Nations must play in any effort to maintain and preserve peace in order to attain economic benefits for the poor and exploited people of this world.297.	We are particularly disturbed that the lessons of the 1960s and 1970s have not been learned. We are frequently faced with violations of the principles of territorial sovereignty  inviolability of diplomatic personnel and non-use of force in international relations. Those principles constitute prominent and notable corner-stones of international relations and law  to which the nations composing this international community continue to pay lip service while simultaneously flouting them with impunity. That is a sad commentary on the meaningfulness of international and diplomatic intercourse and the underlying values which are expected to provide a base of hope for our many destitute peoples.298.	The challenges facing the United Nations at this session are innumerable and perhaps most precariously poised. Never has there been such centrifugal force upon the principles of the Charter of the United Nations since its signing at San Francisco on 26 June 1945. Perhaps we have reached the watershed: the point at which constraining interests almost make us ignore and forget the real objectives of this community of nations.299.	There are many instances that appear to contradict the intent of the original founding fathers of the United Nations. For example  the ease with which States set up human rights standards only to compromise them on the alter of national and political interest; the reasons presented in convenient and different formats to justify intervention  which cannot be defended by logical  significant and acceptable argument; the use and misuse of the movement of persons to satisfy political interests  with little regard to the real issue in humanitarian and refugee terms; the problems that are created because the political interest negates the possibility of working out reasonable  logical and objective rules of procedure that will govern and reflect the existence of expanding interest groups within the Committees  the regional groups and the major organs of this Organization.300.	What they conceived was never intended to be a dogmatic  stultified Organization  but a dynamic entity with the ability to grow  expand and modify  realistically meeting the constraining pressures that inevitably arise and reflecting them within its own combustion in a distinct  sensible and objective manner.301.	While we must insulate succeeding generations from the scourge of war  while we recognise the reasons for the maintenance of international peace and security  while we strive to develop friendly relations among all nations based on mutual respect for the principle of equal rights and the self-determination of peoples  while we understand the necessity for co-operation in solving international problems of an economic  social  cultural and humanitarian character  the political will  as distinct from the political interest  to erect these pillars of our intercourse is not only weak but at times non-existent.302.	We have arrived at a point where we must effectively decide to survey the facts confronting our society and determine whether we have inherited the parameters and attitudes for inaction  or whether we shall lift ourselves from the ground and demand a proper  justifiable and significant consideration of our situation and the means by which we may achieve a fair measure of progress. This is now the beginning of the end of compromise  a word that is not lost on those who remember 1939. It is the end of glossing over the niceties of language and intercourse  and the commencement of a looking forward to a serious  concentrated  political involvement of those that haveâand I include the haves even among the developing worldâin redressing the plight  and the circumstances of the plight  of those that have not.303.	The questions of international security  territorial inviolability of States  non-interference in the internal affairs of States and the non-use of force as a means of solving disputes are vital not only to the existence of States  but to their functional progression. The only way in which a State  and in particular a small island State  can make appropriate economic advancement is by the creation of both the fact and the atmosphere of peace.304.	To this end  the Government of Saint Lucia calls for a reaffirmation of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security which was adopted on the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations in 1970 and which focuses attention on the indivisible link between international security and economic and social development.305.	Within this same context  we fully support General Assembly resolution 2832 (XXVI)  adopted on 16 December 1971  declaring the Indian Ocean a zone of peace. We are following the work of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean  and we look forward to the convening of the Conference on the Indian Ocean during 1981 at Colombo  and the implementation of that declaration.306.	It is indeed a truism that security for the small State lies within the United Nations system. This is even more pertinent for the small island State. Saint Lucia is a small island State and  as such  is vitally concerned not only for its own security but for that of every peace-loving nation. Moreover  whenever there are groups of peace-loving States  particularly those of the developing world  it is of paramount importance that their area should not be visited by the panoply of warfare. The means exist for the insulation of those areas from the unsettling strife of the superpowers  which is not consonant with and detracts from the necessary environment for the economic development of those States.307.	In this context  Saint Lucia believes in and will work assiduously for the realization of a zone of peace in the Caribbean. This concept has already received the approval of the Organization of American States [OAS] at its ninth general assembly at La Paz  Bolivia. What is now necessary is the implementation of the considerations that have been put forward in that resolution and continually reiterated by most member States of the OAS system. Yet we see nothing that we can perceive to be the measure of a dominant will to effect the movements towards a zone of peace. Perhaps it is time that our leaders reached out at the summit level and gave life to this important concept  which must not be still-born.308.	Further  it is necessary that the States of our region and other States should observe the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco)  of 1967. Saint Lucia is taking the necessary procedural steps to become a party to that Treaty. Similarly  Saint Lucia is intent on ensuring  through effective and appropriate measures  that the Caribbean basin does not become a depository for nuclear waste  which could seriously contaminate our environment and ecology  and will seek to obtain meaningful assurances from those nuclear States that have already set out to use the area in this way. It seems most retrograde that major maritime Powers should seek to use unsuspecting areas in this way simply because there is not the authority to refuse or the perspicacity to understand the inherent dangers.309.	In keeping with this approach  we support the implementation of the Declaration on the Denuclearization of Africa  the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East and South Asia  and the prohibition of the development and manufacture of new types of weapons of mass destruction and new systems of such weapons.310.	It seems unnecessary to reiterate the plea for a diminution of expenditure on arms. We have to ask ourselves whether any plea for the cessation of mass production of the means of war is ever entertained. But we must not fall into the politics of despondency and therefore must seek to keep up the continuing exercise of the dialogue of the deaf. Over $500 billion has already been spent on military research and development this year  and there will be those who will argue that the safeguarding of democracy is based on military strength  and still others who will equally argue that the ideological battle can only be sustained from an armed base.311.	Be that as it may  in the end it will be the social and economic growth that can be achieved that will determine which  if any  ideology remains to dominate this earth  if the logical conclusion of the armaments race is realized. Is it not rather strange when a State finds it difficult to grant $10 million for the economic development of a State but is prepared at a moment's notice to rush millions  unsolicited  to given areas simply because there is a supposed threat to its power balance? Or  alternatively  when the kind of strategic aid granted is inconsistent with and meaningless to the real needs or requests of the supposedly benefiting State?312.	The purchase of an XM-1 tank costs approximately $1.5 million. We do not even have to consider whether it will work effectively for two hours at a time without major maintenance and the pertinent recurrent costs. Yet many aspects of economic  social and human development  at significantly less cost  if redirected from the armaments build-up  could be instrumental in lifting a section of a small State's economic growth to a reasonable take-off stage. Let the record show that Saint Lucia favours total world disarmament. However  in recognition of the fact that there has been no positive move on the part of any State to implement the disarmament strategy adopted at the tenth special session of the General Assemblyâand as a consequence world disarmament at this time remains a myth  illusive and unattainableâSaint Lucia favours the concluding of an international convention to assure the non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons.313.	We are fully cognizant that a number of flash-points around the world  notably the Middle East  Namibia and Afghanistan  constitute grave dangers to mankind. It is imperative that acceptable and workable solutions be found  that States desist from furthering their power projections through a manipulation of these issues  and that the world community find the moral fortitude to confront the issues in an honest and objective manner.314.	On the economic front  the new Lome II Agreement between the European Economic Community and the African  Caribbean and Pacific States  presents a new vision for international co-operation. We  in a small island State  are thankful for the existence of STABEX which will assist us in overcoming the ravages of hurricane Allen in our banana sector. We expect that the architects of the Lome II Agreement and the appropriate United Nations agencies will consider similar formulas for our tourist and industrial sectors  for they are also extremely vulnerable to natural and human predators.315.	We are most satisfied that the Tokyo round of negotiations  by far the most comprehensive held within the purview of GATT  reached an acceptable conclusion last year. While we welcome the establishment of the Common Fund within the framework of UNCTAD  and recent moves by IBRD and especially IMF in mitigating their fundamental policies for alleviating the chronic balance-of-payments problems of the developing countries  we in Saint Lucia remain concerned that many of the developed countries will fail to meet the requisite recommendations of the international development strategy  leading to a further deterioration of the structural integrity of the world economic situation and consequently to a largely vitiated and ineffectual round of global negotiations.316.	It is pertinent that we should mention our increasing disappointment with the aid and assistance that is channelled to the small States from the developed States of the developing world. It is unfair only to point the finger in castigation of the aid policies of the developed world. While they must bear the brunt of the responsibility for our present economic morass  those of our developed brethren that have been fortunate enough  by way of resources  population or other pertinent factors  to show economic recovery and progress  should not turn aside and ignore our development needs. The same argument that they continue to address to the developed world can and must be addressed to them. Therefore they must show to the developed world  because they have an obligation to do so  that they can assist us in positive terms  even if their recovery and growth are not fully realized.317.	This is the moral and responsible gesture that must come from these States  which in turn will underscore the feeble efforts of the developed world  which are not in keeping with the economic principles to which it pays lip- service. It is important that neo-colonialism not be evident in the approach of our more developed brethren; that there be no miniature power play that is nurtured through the granting of economic aid or energy agreements. We did not trade colonialism for neo-colonialism. Perhaps it may be relevant to re-emphasize and draw the attention of those States to the principles of the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States.318.	We in Saint Lucia are most gratified by the work of the United Nations programmes. The allocation of resources approved by the Governing Council of UNDP last June represents a significant step in the right direction but we do not agree with the prima facie criteria used to separate the ""developing"" countries from those which are designated as ""least developed among developing"" countries. However  we do welcome the new global programme of action for ""the least developed countries"" which was adopted at the fifth session of UNCTAD  held at Manila last year. 319.	To belabour the issue  we cannot accept the superficial line which distinguishes the rather poor countries from the very poorest countries. As we all know  this designation is made on the basis of gross national product per capita. However  it is a known fact that per capita gross national product is a most unreliable index for gauging the extent  or even the level  of poverty which exists within a given country. Furthermore  at today's inflation rates  many of the modest increases in gross national product and gross domestic product in many developing countries represent not real growth but rather inflation rates. To accept gross national product per capita as the sole index of wealth or poverty is to say that there is only one truly poor country in the Western Hemisphere. I do not feel that we have to argue that this is not so.320.	But the criteria must also be adapted in terms of a new dimension  that is  of the small island States. Only Maldives and Haiti fall into the category of ""least developed among developing"" States. But what about the 24 other Member States whose geography  geology and resourcesâ human and financialâpose different considerations and a construction of factors that must be looked at anew and afresh? It is not only a case to be heard; it is a case to be met with adequate and proper provisions.321.	We must acknowledge that the work of UNIDO  that of the World Food Conference and that of the International Fund for Agricultural Development stand to be acclaimed. We may mention particularly the work of UNEP and that of IMCO in fostering co-operation for the prevention of marine pollution  an issue of which we in Saint Lucia are seized at present. Further  we pay a special tribute to the work of the Office of the United Nations Disaster Relief Co-ordinator  specifically in terms of its assistance in the wake of hurricane Allen. But we must add that it may be timely to indicate that disaster adopts varied dimensions  according to the resilience of the involved community and the nature of the cataclysm. Though it is an evil that is as significant to the land mass as it is to the island State  it cannot be met in the same way in both instances. There is a need to look at the procedures for disbursing aid to the island States which are ravaged by hurricanes  typhoons  cyclones  tidal waves and volcanic eruptions in a manner other than the accepted form that is now fashionable.322.	We in the Eastern Caribbean are a proud  hard-working people who recognize that the paucity of our number and the reality of our territorial constraints combine to create  at best  a difficult situation wherein economies of scale cannot be readily realized. This difficult situation is compounded by our sheer vulnerability to every natural disaster that cares to visit our area. We are not alone in this regard. Our sister island States in the Pacific and Indian Oceans share our fears and apprehensions. This Assembly must address itself precisely to the nature of this new dimension in much the same way as it has dealt with the land-locked States and the most disadvantaged States.323.	We do not wish to leave the impression that we view the events that marked the ending of the old decade and the point of departure of the new as allowing for only negative prognostications. The recent women's conference holds much promise for the eventual elimination of all forms of discrimination against women.324.	The independence of Zimbabwe and its subsequent admission to this Assembly are events which hold great promise for the future. We have heralded the admission of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to membership which sets a trend  not only for Namibia  but also for a number of island States such as Antigua  Saint Kitts  Montserrat and others  and marks the end of the decolonization period. However  we can no longer submit to the policy that it is sufficient to make peoples believe that independence has been achieved  disregarding the fact that they remain shackled by the bonds of colonialism or neo-colonialism. The struggle for self-determination does not end when the last colony has been released from its bondage. Colonialism is still alive in every State where minorities remain castigated and are denied their rights  where only the accident of geography and delineation of boundaries has created their position or where administrative niceties have engulfed their freedoms. We will watch the proceedings in these areas most assiduously.325.	There have been five resolutions on Belize considered by the General Assembly since 1975. In view of the effort and time spent on this issue  Belize should have already been granted independence  it should have achieved United Nations membership and been well on the way to consolidating its achievements after independence. This Assembly should now be addressing the situation of post-independence Belize  not its pre-independence status. However  this is not the case and this Assembly must bear a fair proportion of the guilt for the omission of Belize from its ranks. The time has come for the cessation of words  of paper work and of inconsequential negotiations  and for a demand for the justice of Belize's proceeding immediately to independence and membership of our gathering  properly recorded. It is in this vein that we propose the submission of a resolution demanding  inter alia  that the metropolitan Power concerned convene with the shortest delay a constitutional conference with a mandate to set a date for Belize's independence before the end of 1981.326.	Only if that meaningful act is introduced can we realistically state that this forum is committed to the principles that it has itself established and applied in other instances. The diplomatic virtues of negotiation are not always beneficial  or expected to be beneficial  to the parties concerned and involved.327.	The recent session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea indicates that a final convention may be at hand. It has been a long road  but one that manifestly indicates that the international will to regulate and the desire to recognize growth in law and order have been rewarded. We will attempt to have that convention consider and take account of the real problems for small island States. The concept of the small island State does not exist per se in the convention  largely because in 1958  when the existing conventions on the law of the sea were negotiated  there was not a single small island State in existence. Today there are some 34 independent island States; they deserve proper recognition in much the same way as archipelagic States and land-locked States. In looking at the development of the law of the sea  we are mindful that a great deal of work has been devoted to the avoidance and mitigation of the effect of pollution. Our vulnerability is extremely acute in this area. We welcome any plan to mitigate the consequences of pollution  any measure to obviate the possibilities of oil spills  any consideration that will enable us to reduce the incidence of such disaster in given areas that are vital to our economy.328.	It is not responsible conduct for a State to look only at the omissions in behavioural terms of this community  without any introspection over the steps it has taken or will take in seeking to play a small but useful part in this world's problematic environment. Saint Lucia  bedevilled by hurricane Allen has applied itself to an approach to the calamity that recognizes an acceptance of its responsibility to the community at large. For my Government accepts that it has to live with natural disasters  and therefore the emphasis must be placed on a preventive policy in development  with an accent on preparedness and resilience to disasters of this kind. It is within this framework that my Government has approached the States Members of the United Nations to assist in the sectoral infrastructural development of our State.329.	But we must not forget that what is tangible in our efforts is the values that we leave in the form of guidelines for generations yet unborn. This is the historical value of our existence as States in this international community. We were most happy when  in 1965  the General Assembly adopted the Declaration of the Promotion among Youth of the Ideals of Peace  Mutual Respect and Understanding between Peoples- and later  in 1969  recognized the contribution of youth in the promotion of world peace  justice  social and economic rights  especially in the projection of the goals embodied in the Charter of the United Nations.330.	We eagerly look forward to 1985  the year designated as International Youth Year by the General Assembly with the aims of participation  development and peace. We have dedicated cur programmes in Saint Lucia to encouraging and developing an ethos of productivity for our youth and some countries have perceived and understood the nature of this thrust and have given assistance to that enterprise. The fruits of such productivity must accrue to the youth of our State. The legacy is theirs; the future lies beyond.331.	Moreover  Saint Lucia recognizes that the individuality of approach to problems in our area is not readily rewarded with success. Therefore we have embraced and committed ourselves to the fullest integration in our region  by way of the West Indies Associated States  which association is at present being negotiated into the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States  into the larger Caribbean Community entity and finally and futuristically within the complex Latin American entity that involves both the OAS and the Latin American Economic System. There is no ready and immediate satisfaction of geopolitical benefit within these communities. The roads are gradual  based on a necessary economic co-operation and co-ordination which are finally reflected in a strong political togetherness. It is an objective that we must all accept and towards the fruition of which we must all work.332.	The movement towards the interdependence of regions in the largest framework possible is even more important than the recognition of the interdependence of States. We consider the exchanges among the OAS  the OAU  the Caribbean Community and the League of Arab States as evidence of the manifestation of the collective interest. The recent mini-summit Commonwealth Meeting of the Asian and Pacific Countries marks a direction in the search for regional identities. These are movements of hope  of unity  of realism. With these multilateral projections  the bilateral focus has a new meaning.333.	Therefore  it is necessary  as we enter the 1980s  for the vision of this community of regions to be centred on a policy of adherence to principles  dedication and conviction. There is a need to extend beyond the realism of nation-State politics and to enter into the statesmanship of community relations. The universality that will soon be evident in this United Nations will cause a serious reconsideration in respect of the significance of the nation State in universal terms. This is our challenge; the arena is the circumstance of this world; the finality is the survival and growth or  alternatively  the destruction of our universe."
"82",4152,"LKA",35,1980,"ï»¿It is my privilege to address this premier international body and to convey to its members the fraternal greetings of the people of Sri Lanka. I do so as the first Prime Minister of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka under the New Republican Constitution of 1978.3.	As representatives will know  our new Constitution was adopted by the freely elected representatives of the people of Sri Lanka after a popular mandate which brought our Government into power with a five sixths majority in Parliament.4.	I have approached my task today not to indulge myself in the purple of high-flown rhetoric or to lecture this distinguished audience on all the problems of the world. I do not pretend to have a key to unlock the door to Utopia. I come before you in a spirit of humility to join you in the common quest of mankind for peace  for justice and for equality.5.	These are values which the people of my country hold sacred in the light of experience gained over many years in the practice of democracy. Next year we commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the attainment of universal adult franchise. They are also values which our people have consistently accepted as truths  by virtue of their deeply religious tradition.6.	I come before you to share some of my own thoughts  moulded in the crucible of working with people at all levels  in the slums  in the villages  in government and out of government  during a political career spanning over three decades.7.	May I  at the outset  extend to you  Mr. President  the warm congratulations of myself and my delegation on your election as President of this thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. Your country and mine have enjoyed a long and fruitful bond of friendship and cooperation  which we in Sri Lanka value very highly. Your rich diplomatic experience and your practical wisdom will  I am sure  be invaluable assets in guiding the deliberations of this session. May I offer the good wishes of my delegation and assure you of our cooperation in the discharge of your duties.8.	I would like to take this opportunity of expressing my appreciation to the outgoing President  Ambassador Salim of the United Republic of Tanzania. His tenure of office is probably unique for the number of special and extraordinary sessions he had to preside over. His impartiality  understanding and sagacity were of inestimable value during all those sessions.9.	It is also a pleasant task today to pay a tribute to the Secretary General  whose consistent dedication to the cause of peace and tireless efforts in pursuit of it are well known  for the work he is doing.10.	This year  the international community is the poorer for having lost some of its most eminent leaders. The death of Josip Broz Tito of Yugoslavia removed from our midst the last of the giants of the Second World War era. Few world leaders have helped to mould the structure of post-war international relations as President Tito did. We in Sri Lanka remember him with admiration and affection as a founding father of nonalignment  a policy which my President  Mr. J. R. Jayewardene  has said ""runs like a golden thread through the fabric of our country's foreign policy"".11.	We mourn with the people of Japan the passing of their Prime Minister Ohira. We grieve with the people of Botswana over the loss of their founder President Sir Seretse Khama  and we sympathize with the people of Jordan over the untimely death of their Prime Minister  Sharif Abdul Hamid Sharaf.12.	At this session we welcome to our midst two new MembersâZimbabwe and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. My welcome to Zimbabwe must inevitably be tinged with a very personal note of happiness. I had the privilege of being present at the Meeting of Heads of Government of Commonwealth Countries  held at Lusaka in August 1979  when the decisive step which led to the independence of Zimbabwe was taken.13.	It is a matter of personal gratification to me that the cause we argued for and supported on behalf of that country has been achieved and that Zimbabwe has emerged to join us as a sovereign State in this international body. The admission of these two Members illustrates once again the fundamental principle of universality in our membership and the equality of all Member States  irrespective of size  power  population or prestige.14.	I have the honour to convey to this august Assembly the greetings of President J. R. Jayewardene and his good wishes for the success of this session.15.	Over the last few months the view has been expressed increasingly by world leaders that the international situation is deteriorating. Indeed  I think there is hardly anyone who would disagree with this. The disagreement  if any  is in identifying the causes of this deterioration.16.	We are without doubt at a crucial juncture in international relations. What we do  much more than what we say  will shape the international order in the next two decades of the century. Perhaps today more than at any other time in human history we stand at a decisive crossroads. One way could lead us to a world of immense possibilities for the good of the human race; the other could be the path of decline and the destruction of all human values as we know them today.17.	What is our response going to be to this challenge?18.	The dimensions of the challenge are so large  the issues so complex that the response must perforce emerge from the Organization. Certainly  the problems cannot be solved by nations acting on their own or as small groups of countries. Unfortunately  at a time when our response should be global  we see increasing signs of nations trying to seek solutions to the problems individually.19.	Thirty-five years ago  the world established this international body  the United Nations  whose Charter still represents the highest ideals of mankind. It is a matter for concern that its credibility as an institution which is still capable of assisting in the resolution of these problems is being doubted today. The crisis situation we face makes it even more imperative that we act purposefully and positively through the mechanisms that the United Nations system provides for joint and collective action.20.	In our own region we welcome the convening in 1981  under the aegis of the United Nations  of a Conference on the Indian Ocean for the implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace. This is a collective effort on the part of the Indian Ocean countries and others to ensure that the Indian Ocean will  in fact  be a peaceful place. We seek this peace in order to permit the countries in our region to focus their attention  concentrate their energies and employ their resources to build prosperous economies for their citizens. We cannot afford the grotesque distortions that tensions  militarization and arms stockpiling can cause. Implicit in this Declaration are those cardinal tenets of international politics: non-interference in the internal affairs of countries and rejection of the use of force.21.	Sri Lanka has long been known as a centre of Thera-vada Buddhism. This is a philosophy where among the noble truths nonviolence is of paramount significance. This emphasis on ahimsa  or nonviolence  has made Buddhism a major international force and a means of promoting understanding among nations during its long historical career of over 2 500 years. The best known instance occurred at the very outset  when it inspired the famous dharma vijayaâ victory of righteousnessâof Emperor Dharma Asoka  in which he attempted to establish a moral basis for relations between States. Emperor Dharma Asoka sent personal emissaries to contemporary rulers in western and southern Asia bearing messages of good will and advocating a code of righteous conduct which to a large extent embodied the tenets of Buddhism.22.	The Emperor's action is unique in history and represents the only initiative of its kind by a ruler to bring a moral approach to international relations. Perhaps what is lacking in our countries is a moral approach to world problems and international understanding: and this may be the root of our crisis. Over the ages  human society has endeavoured to move from the rule of the jungle to the rule of law. Could we not work for the reconstruction of a world society based on the law of love  nonviolence? Could we  from here  set an example to all to follow this rule at every level of life  in our personal relations as well as in relations between nations? This  in my view  would be the ultimate fulfilment of this unique Organization to which we belong.23.	Armed conflicts and the threat of such conflicts remain a danger to mankind. The international situation has many flashpoints. To continue to let them exist and to allow new flashpoints to emerge leads to a dangerous mood of cynicism and indifference where the use of force is tolerated and accepted as inevitable.24.	There is disenchantment  too  among those who follow the rules  those who are law abiding; they feel that the lawless win the day. How often have we seen the righteous suffer while the wrongdoer prospers? It is the same in international relations as it is in normal society. Must one shout to be heard? Must one be feared to be respected? Must one threaten to be assisted? Are democracy and human rights to be taken for granted? Is force  and the threat of force  the only password to success? The world seems to be frighteningly close to such a mood of cynicism.25.	There is glib talk of a new cold war and plentiful offers of military aid. We must therefore take positive and collective action  not only to create our zone of peace  but to ensure that a hundred zones of peace are created  both in space and in the minds of men.26.	In this context  the nonaligned movement  with whose origins Sri Lanka is proud to be associated  continues to have a vital role to play. Ninety-four of the 154 nations of this world body subscribe to the principles of non-alignment. Many more  as observers and guests  have broad sympathy with the aims and aspirations of the movement.27.	There are several areas in our relationship within the United Nations which call for action of a kind which will take the international community forward together. Many of these are in the area of what are termed economic relations. We have for example made several declarations to the effect that developing countries should have a greater share of the industrial output of the worldâas much as 25 percent by the year 2000. At the same time  we see the erection of a wall of protectionism in the developed world which constitutes an effective barrier to the development of industries by the denial of markets.28.	We see this disparity between intent and achievement in other areas as well. In the area of concessionary aidâ official development assistanceâwe solemnly declared at the commencement of the 1970s that official development assistance should be at the level of at least 0.77 percent of the gross national product of developed countries if the developing world economies were to be rehabilitated. At the end of that decade the actual figure was only half of this: 0.35 per cent of the gross national product.29.	The prospects for the future  in the light of the deepening recession that the developed world faces seem  therefore  even more stark. The difference between the intention and the act which these two examples illustrate is  if I may say so  a result of our inability to see the mutuality of our interests and  consequently  of our attempts to resolve unilaterally the problems we foresee.30.	The facts are clear in the case of both protectionism and aid. It has been demonstrated that a progressive lowering of trade barriers in the North would not only reduce the number of unemployed in the third world but even result in an increase in jobs in the North as a direct consequence of the increase in North South trade. It has also been shown that protectionism holds a greater threat to jobs in the North  and self-interest would require the abandonment of policies which appear so self-evidently short-sighted.31.	The idea that there should be a reallocation of industries in the world which would benefit the developing countries is not likely to be easily accepted. But it is a fact that  in terms of the global economy  many industries in the developed world are no longer economically viable.32.	When developing countries take similar steps and band together to increase export earnings  they are criticized for taking measures contrary to the common good. What then  I ask  is the justice in this situation? Must we confront each other by adversary strategies of this kind?33.	The case of official development assistance is equally as clear. It is surely in the interests of the developed world to provide the poor countries with the concessionary aid that can help to restructure their economies. For as they grow in strength  their imports will grow with resultant benefits to the developed economies. But the sad fact is that at the present time  when concessionary finance is most needed  there is talk in the developed world of holding back inflation and the need to cut down public expenditure.34.	I hope that official development assistance will not be an area that has to bear these cuts. If the cut has to fall on public expenditure in the developed world  we make the plea that it may fall gently on overseas aid.35.	In addition to the moral dimension that should motivate the giver of aid  there is the more emphatic consideration of self-interest. The interdependence of the world economies is such that if the poor falter  they will not be able to buy the goods of the rich. The poverty of the poorâ which in many cases they have learned to live withâwill inevitably pull down the rich as well.36.	There is also the continuing anomaly that confronts us of aid flows being reduced while defence expenditures increase. In the light of third world poverty  the difference between annual global military expenditure  now approaching $450 billion  and official development assistance of some $20 billion can only be termed outrageous.37.	This means not only money but also the diversion of real resources  such as manpower in the form of scientists and engineers  and of the most modern technologies which could otherwise be used in the solution of the problems constraining growth in the less developed world.38.	We also know  speaking on behalf of a country which spends less than 3 per cent of its national budget on defence  that the disease seems to have spread  that even some of the poorest of our countries deem it necessary to spend heavily on armaments. These modern weapons of war which sometimes come in as aid are possibly the best examples of a misdirected transfer of resources. It is an open question whether money spent on armaments or defence would in the long run contribute more to international security than money spent on aid to the poorer countries.39.	Why is it that when religions of the worldâ Christianity  Hinduism  Islam and Buddhismâproclaim the folly of war and greed for power  nations continue to arm themselves? The Dhammapadaâthe words of the Buddhaâtouches the crux of this dilemma in the saying:""From craving springs grief  from craving springs fear ""For him who is wholly free from craving there is no grief;""Whence can there be fear?"" In the search for peaceâin our task of waging war against warâperhaps we need to heed the teachings of our great religions and free ourselves from fear.40.	As bilateral aid flows are likely to be reduced in the face of the impending recession  the need for a multilateral funding agency  such as the proposed world development fund  gains heightened significance. The mechanisms by which the surpluses of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries [OPEC] could be recycled to provide concessionary finance to the developing countries have been clearly described in recent studies. It is our hope that the creation of such a development fund will be speedily effected and will provide yet another source of capital for the restructuring of the economies of the poorer countries.41.	I should like also to make the plea that the increasingly stringent conditions imposed by the multilateral development agencies be reviewed in the light of the quite different circumstances that now apply in the world  particularly in the developing countries. The rules and regulations framed for a more ordered international economic situation must surely change to suit the more complex realities of today.42.	We have just concluded the eleventh special session devoted to international economic cooperation and development. We have identified several areas in which considerable work has yet to be done. I am heartened that the process of negotiation on a broad level of participation will engender fruitful results.43.	I want to emphasize the word ""negotiation"". We should not be preoccupied with speeches or strategies. It is unfortunate but true that development strategies have not done much to enhance development.44.	We have succeeded in the last 35 years in safeguarding ourselves from the scourge of global war. We have not  however  saved ourselves from the scourge of poverty  which brings sorrow to mankind and affronts the dignity and worth of the human person.45.	In global terms the poverty line seems to coincide with the North South divide. One quarter of the world's population living in the North enjoys three quarters of the world's income while three quarters of the world's population living in the South have to share the remaining quarter of the world's income.46.	The inequality in the use of real resources and the depth of the problem of poverty are tellingly expressed in this equation. The international community has engaged in numerous exercises to reduce this disparity and to remove this scourge.47.	Most recently we have had the Independent Commission on International Development Issues  popularly referred to as the Brandt Commission. Eleven years before Brandt  we had Pearson. It is chastening to recall some of the words of the Commission on International Development headed by the late Lester Pearson:""International development is a great challenge of our age. Our response to it will show whether we understand the implications of interdependence or whether we prefer to delude ourselves that the poverty and deprivation of the great majority of mankind can be ignored without tragic consequences for all."" 48.	The Brandt Commission is no less cogent in stressing interdependence; no less concerned with the moral imperative of development; and no less bold and imaginative in the action plan proposed  both for the present and for the future. Sadly  what gives cause for despair is the reaction of the world community to those significant reports. Rather than stimulate negotiation  the Brandt Commission report is in danger of being placed on a shelf  along with similar reports of the past.49.	Whenever an action plan or a strategy is mooted  countless reasons are put forward to delay its implementation. Either we are told that the time is inopportune or we are asked to scale down the plans. Whatever the reason  the result is the sameâinaction.50.	We in the developing countries are not asking for charity on a global scale. We do not believe that poverty can be alleviated by charity  it must be eliminated by removing exploitation. We cannot make everyone and every country equal; we can give everyone and every country an equal opportunity.51.	The exploitation which leads to poverty is endemic in the structure of international economic relations today. That is why the structure has to be changed. That is why we talk of a new international economic order. It is an order where human rights are respected  where economic inequalities and poverty are eliminated and where malnutrition and illiteracy are removed.52.	I am not talking of a new order which must exist among nations and among nations alone. We have to institute that order in our own countries. We cannot have world peace without being at peace ourselves  within our country  within our society  within our family and  if I may say so  within each of us ourselves.53.	Before we ask for restraint from others we must practise restraint and control ourselves. We cannot have a new international economic order abroad and an old economic order of exploitation at home. We cannot ask for the elimination of exploitation and inequalities among nations and allow economic depression and disparities to flourish within our nations.54.	The emancipation of mankind from exploitation must take place both nationally and internationally. The structural imbalances and inequalities within nations are linked together. That is as true for the South as it is for the North. These are many glasshouses. Let us change those houses. Let us also not throw stones.55.	A large part of my life and my own political endeavours have been in the fields of local government and housing. The need  therefore  for involving the people in the decision-making process  both locally and internationally  is clear to me.56.	I see the provision of adequate housing as a basic aspect of the global assault on poverty. We must eliminate the problems of overcrowding  lack of sanitation and insecurity. Housing is important in creating the environment in which our people have to live. In the rush for development  urbanization has run out of control  spawning ugly slums and ghettos  depopulating rural areas and overcrowding conurbations. Urban poverty  congestion and squalor are problems common to many of our developing countries.57.	It is said that as much as 20 per cent of our people in the developing countries are seriously undernourished; 50 per cent do not have pure water; 60 per cent do not have proper health care; and 20 per cent of the babies die before they reach the age of five.58.	There are equally depressing figures for unemployment  education and other basic needs. Each of us in his own way is attempting to tackle these formidable problems. It is my belief that housing provides a key to the elimination of several of these disadvantages. The problem of housing is not confined to Sri Lanka. It is not a problem confined to Asia. It is a global problem.59.	I therefore call for the declaration of an international year dedicated to homes for the homeless. Perhaps the year could be focused especially on the rehabilitation of the shanty dweller. The replacement of shanties by decent housing is not a peripheral part of development. It is at the very core. It is an investment in mankind.60.	I have touched  if only briefly  on some of the issues that the world will increasingly have to confront and resolve in the years ahead. Standing as we do on the threshold of the decade of the 1980s  it is our duty to face the problems fully and squarely.61.	Conflict  as much as cooperation  has been a part of the history of the human race. In past times the cause of conflict between peoples was almost parochial; language  race and religion have divided men and in their name men have fought and died. Sadly  even today  these symbols which man created continue to divide man. We have also had major confrontations on ideology  and we have spoken much of the antagonism between East and West.62.	The issues which have so clearly emerged today as symptoms of the malaise which afflicts the worldâinflation  the imbalance of payments  the monetary system  food  security  the commodity problem  and the likeâindicate that future battle lines would be drawn on even a more fundamental basis  perhaps between poor and rich  between South and North.63.	It is surely to forestall this conflict that the debate between the North and the South must be expanded into a dialogue and then quickened into an agreed agenda of action for today  tomorrow and the day after.64.	I believe that our collective will and our united action  not only at the national level but in the global context  will enable us to overcome the challenges of the present. We cannot pass the buck. It is our world. We must not only survive in it. We must improve it.""May the rain fall in time ""May the harvest be rich ""May the world be prosperous ""May the rulers be righteous."" "
"83",4196,"LSO",35,1980,"ï»¿I should like to extend to the President my delegation's sincere congratulations on his well-deserved election to the presidency of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. His experience in world affairs as a diplomat and representative of his great country  the Federal Republic of Germany  assures us that he will guide the deliberations of this session to a successful conclusion. We in Lesotho are particularly pleased at his being elected President because Lesotho enjoys happy relations with the great country that he represents. Our words of congratulation are equally extended to the other members of the General Committee. To them all I pledge the support and cooperation of my delegation.301.	I would also pay a tribute to the outgoing President of the thirty-fourth session  Ambassador Salim A. Salim of the United Republic of Tanzania. It was a great honour for Lesotho to serve as one of his Vice-presidents  not only because he is an able and illustrious son of Africa but also because he served his term of office with great zeal  dedication and distinction. His presidency was characterized by his punctuality  impartiality  spirit of compromise and great sense of humour. We wish him the best of luck in his future endeavours.302.	Thirty-five years ago  war weary nationsânot more than one third of the present membershipâfounded the United Nations and made solemn commitments to uphold the principles of its Charter. To save succeeding generations from the scourge of war was one of the main goals of the United Nations. As we commemorate its thirty-fifth anniversary this year  we cannot but note with satisfaction and contentment that the world has for three and a half decades been continuously without a global war. In making this remark I also pay credit to our Organization for having prevented the outbreak of yet another global conflict whose consequences would be catastrophic in view of the weapons of destruction at the disposal of nations. We nevertheless continue to live in a period of relative peace  albeit in an era overshadowed by horrendous arsenals of destruction and annihilation.303.	The United Nations has been seized of the question of disarmament for many years. At each session  this Assembly adopts numerous resolutions urging Member States to reduce their military budgets  to destroy chemical and bacteriological weapons in their possession  to respect various regions of the world as zones of peace or denuclearized zones and to prohibit the development and manufacture of new types of weapons with massive destructive potential. The number of resolutions has increased; more members have been admitted to the nuclear club; guarantees for nonnuclear power States have become meaningless while monies spent on armaments have trebled  to the neglect of millions who live in poverty  in disease  in hunger and without shelter.304.	Ironically  we are told that the world is safe  and that its security depends on a system of mutual deterrence controlled by those who have the maximum military potential for destroying life.305.	We have said before  and we repeat today  that it is those nations that have nuclear weapons that can effect disarmament. If we are not so vocal on this grave issue  it is not out of acquiescence. We have no nuclear weapons and desire to have none. As we move towards the close of 1980  with one Disarmament Decade having ended  we continue to look with great expectations to those who have nuclear arms to live up to their verbal commitment to the need for universal disarmament.306.	Recently  the General Assembly concluded its eleventh special session  devoted to the establishment of the New International Economic Order. Seven years ago  on the initiative of the nonaligned movement and many third world nations represented in this Hall  this Assembly  under the chairmanship of the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria  adopted resolutions 3201 (SVI) and 3202 (SVI) of 1 May 1974. It is indeed with regret that we are forced to acknowledge that the ills that faced the world then remain with us today  despite a clear-cut plan and action programme to substitute a more equitable world economic order for the current unjust economic order.307.	Towards that end  certain concrete decisions were taken in the special cases of commodities  the external debts of developing countries and the transfer of technology  to name but a few. Not all of these decisions have been implemented  to the dismay of millions in the developing world. The tragedy of the present imbalance in economic relations is clearly demonstrated by the fact that while much of the world's population is barely scratching out a living  a tiny minority is overfed and alienated by the luxury of choice.308.	The establishment of the New International Economic Order demands a great amount of political goodwill throughout the world. It is regrettable to note that this General Assembly has not been able to solicit a general political goodwill  as is evident from the results of the eleventh special session. While we are grateful that a consensus on the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade has been reached  we remain concerned by the failure to launch the global round of negotiations which is intended to be an instrument for implementing the agreed international development strategy. We are encouraged  nevertheless  to note that the door is still open to further negotiations  and it is hoped that if it pleases the Assembly to reopen the negotiations all the negotiating parties will adopt a spirit of compromise in order to facilitate the launching of the global round of negotiations.309.	The unanimous adoption of the two most important resolutions in favour of the least developed countries and many other disadvantaged countries is a source of great satisfaction. This we regard as a demonstration of a genuine disposition on the part of the international community towards the plight of those extremely disadvantaged countries that lack the basic infrastructure for development.310.	It is hoped that these resolutions will not merely swell the number of those which have been passed but which still remain largely unimplemented.311.	This Assembly endorsed the need for financial institutions  both national and international  to accord special attention to the needs of these countries by extending adequate financial and technical assistance to projects and programmes designed for their economic viability and the improvement of their infrastructures. Not much  if anything  has been done. Fifteen years ago  this Assembly urged States to become parties to the Convention on Transit Trade of Landlocked States of 8 July 1965. This Convention laid down exhaustive guidelines and programmes designed to alleviate the disadvantaged geographic position of the landlocked developing States. All of these remain empty promises and documents as yet to be implemented.312.	As the United Nations strives to achieve the effective implementation of Article 1 of its Charter  namely  the achievement of international cooperation in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race  sex  language or religion  it has also to guard jealously against external forces that are aimed at infringing these rights and freedoms on grounds of geography. Coastal as well as landlocked States  under articles 22 and 27 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  of 10 December 1948 owe their peoples the full enjoyment of economic  social and cultural rights. We rely on this historic Declaration as well as on the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and Optional Protocol and the International Covenant on Economic  Social and Cultural Rightsâwhich entered into force in 1976âthe solemn commitment of States in 1979 to the promotion of equality between men and women  the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  adopted in 1960 by this Assembly  and other decisions of this Assembly  in order to enjoy the freedom to move on the high seas  in air space and on earth  as common heritage of all mankind.313.	Mankind has evidenced unprecedented excellence in scientific feats over the forces of nature in the field of technology. Since the first man was launched in a manmade spaceship  cooperation among nations in conquering outer space has been without comparison in other spheres of human endeavour. We thus call upon the Member States of this Organization to display similar goodwill and cooperation in facing the challenges confronting mankind. These challenges are clearly demonstrated by our heavy agenda. This agenda underscores the need for universal cooperation in order to make our one world a better place for posterity. The issues are intricate and contentious. Since my delegation will be discussing some of them in depth in the various relevant committees  I shall limit myself to only a few comments.314.	Open clashes have broken out between neighbouring nonaligned States on the Persian Gulf. We appeal to the two States for a ceasefire and a return to talks and fraternal and amicable relations  and to solve the crisis through meaningful dialogue.315.	The peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula still remains elusive. We firmly believe that unification can only be achieved through a direct dialogue between North and South. Such a dialogue should not be prejudiced by demands that may threaten the security of the parties concerned. We call on the parties to resume their dialogue based on the South North Joint Communique of 4 July 1972. 316.	The Middle East remains an area of great tension and instability. At the centre of the problem is the Palestine question. The position of Lesotho with respect to this tragedy has not altered since it was clearly set out from this and many other rostra by various spokesmen of the Lesotho Government. We should like to reaffirm that for a lasting and peaceful solution to come about  all parties should be involved in the peace efforts. The inalienable right of the Palestinian people to its own State is not negotiable. The Palestinian territory alienated and expropriated by force of arms still belongs to the Palestinian people and should not be considered as permanently alienated. This land should be returned to the people of Palestine. All parties must accept each other and then negotiate meaningfully. The Israelization of the international city of Jerusalem is an affront to efforts to bring about a solution to the Middle East problem. We call upon all parties to the conflict seriously to map out a negotiating strategy to resolve the Middle East deadlock.317.	Southern Africa continues to constitute another major area of tension in the world today. Not long ago the Security Council and the OAU had to consider atrocious bombings and ferocious attacks by South Africa on the people's Republic of Angola. A few weeks earlier  South Africa troops had committed acts of aggression in Zambia  thus displaying unrestrained contempt for the territorial integrity arid sovereignty of its neighbours. The attacks on Angola are a ploy to disguise South Africa's intention to deny the people of Namibia their right to self-determination and independence despite the numerous resolutions and decisions of the General Assembly and the Security Council.318.	In its resolution 2248 (SV) of 19 May 1967  the Assembly established the United Nations Council for Namibia as the legal Administering Authority of Namibia until that international Territory's independence. It is a matter of common knowledge that South Africa has frustrated the Council in the fulfilment of its mandate. What is even more unacceptable is that Namibian patriots continue to languish in South African gaols. Apartheid and bantustans have been introduced into Namibia and an internal settlement built on the Turnhalle groups is being pursued relentlessly  if not insidiously. Namibian resources continue to be illegally exploited. South Africa has thus far flouted all Security Council decisions on Namibia. One might mention Security Council resolutions 385 (1976)  435 (1978) and 439 (1978) and clearly discern a constant pattern of refusal to comply with the Security Council's decisions and of the promotion of bogus arrangements aimed at creating a neo colonial puppet regime.319.	We should like to register our support for the struggle of the Namibian people for freedom. By now  South Africa should have learned that no amount of distortion  intimidation or oppression can stifle a people's desire to achieve freedom  independence and human dignity. SWAPO is a force with which the South African Government has to reckon. Nobody can afford to brush it aside in any negotiations on Namibia and act as if it did not exist.320.	The continent of Africa is plagued by three more critical spots: the Horn of Africa  Western Sahara in the north and Chad in the west. The OAU is seized at the moment of these serious issues and my delegation wishes to register its support for its endeavours. We urge great vigilance and honest counsel in approaching these issues. My delegation notes with appreciation the humanitarian assistance being extended to the displaced persons and refugees in these sub regions. We appreciate the efforts of the Secretary General of the OAU  as documented under item 23 of the agenda of the Assembly. May goodwill prevail on the part of all concerned in efforts to normal the situation in these areas.321.	We should also like to express concern for the speedy resolution of the Cyprus problem and the situation in Southeast Asia. The world has seen enough human suffering. Our collective efforts should thus be directed at the final solution of such problems. How otherwise can we talk of progress and development in the midst of so much human suffering?322.	Under agenda item 28  entitled ""Policies of Apartheid of the Government of South Africa""  sufficient time will be devoted to consideration of the very lucid report of the Special Committee against Apartheid  and I do not intend to take any more of the Assembly's limited time by going into that item.323.	The simmering crisis inside South Africa itself is a matter of great concern to us. Because of our geographical and political situation  we cannot watch the escalation of disruption and violence in South Africa with equanimity. To the extent that we cannot escape unscathed from a conflagration in South Africa  we are an interested party. We should be caught in the crossfire if anything were to happen. Hence our concern over South Africa's apartheid policies  which are the root cause of the economic and political instability in southern Africa.324.	Economic cooperation among States of any region is always a good thing. In Africa  both the OAU and the United Nations regional commissions have encouraged such cooperation. The independent African States of the southern sub region recently concluded a conference in Salisbury aimed at such cooperation and at reducing their economic dependence on South Africa. It is against this background that a distinction should be made between their efforts and South Africa's brand of cooperation  styled ""Constellation of southern African States"".325.	South Africa's so-called constellation of States  consisting of itself and its Bantustans  which it wants to sell to the independent African States  is nothing but a political mirage. In our view  it is yet another attempt by South Africa to bring about the recognition of her Bantustan creations  which have so far been rejected by the international community. Through this strategy South Africa hopes to win support and respectability for her grand apartheid  which fragments southern Africa into weak black satellites dominated by a strong white State. We reject this constellation while it is operated within the framework of apartheid.326.	I cannot leave this rostrum without conveying to the Assembly the Lesotho Government's gratitude for the support our people have received since 1976 following the Soweto upheavals and the closure of some of the border posts between Lesotho and South Africa. The assistance was aimed at expanding educational facilities in the country to create rem for displaced South African students who had fled to Lesotho and to improve Lesotho's economic viability  to enable it to withstand external coercion and lessen its dependence on South Africa. The latest review report by the Secretary General on the fourth review mission to Lesotho is before the Assembly. It will be noted that we have been the recipient of massive aid from a variety of sources  but mainly from some Governments represented here. We are indeed greatly indebted and we are glad to acknowledge such gracious assistance.327.	Notwithstanding this  the pledges  grants  loans and technical assistance extended still fall short of targets set four years ago. South African and Namibian students are still with us and continue to arrive in Lesotho. The need to remedy our geographical isolation still exists. We thus earnestly reaffirm our commitment to the international airport project to which Lesotho attaches great importance. In this connection  I should like to express my delegation's gratitude to those countries which have made modest contributions to our current efforts towards the construction of our one and only international air bridge. This was one of the leading projects recommended to and subsequently approved by the Security Council in 1977. It is our wish that Governments will reconsider their position on this expensive but vital project and become involved in it. So far only a few Governments of the European Economic Community and the Arab world are involved in it  with the Lesotho Government shouldering the biggest share of the funding.328.	I should like to observe  in conclusion  that we have reached a critical point in the struggle for the liberation of the rest of Africa. Heavy sacrifices have already been made and will continue to be made. To assist any of the frontline States or any of the independent African States neighbouring Namibia and South Africa is also to contribute to the final elimination of apartheid and alien occupation in southern Africa. This is a task to which we must direct our united force and energy. The lesson of Zimbabwe has proved  more than any other lesson in recent history  that racial bigotry and colonialism are myths which have no place in the community of free nations. Thus we also wish to associate ourselves with the congratulatory words already addressed to the new State of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. We are confident that the world community will respond to any request that this new State may wish to make for assistance in its reconstruction and development.329.	I wish this Assembly success in the consideration of the serious agenda items before us."
"84",4264,"LUX",35,1980,"ï»¿Since Luxembourg is President of the Council of Ministers of the European Community and the Political Cooperation Council for the second half of this year  I have the honour of addressing this Assembly on behalf of the nine countries of the European Community.2.	As we embark upon the work of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly  I am particularly happy to convey to you  Mr. President  the very sincere congratulations of the nine member countries of the European Community on your election to the presidency at this session.3.	I take a particular personal pleasure in seeing a personality of your stature enjoying the unanimous confidence of the international community. Having had the opportunity to work with you on numerous occasions and having on each occasion appreciated both your professional and personal qualities  I am convinced that your commitment to serving the ideals which we all share is a good augury for the work of this thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. I should like to extend to you  together with our wishes for your success  the assurances of our loyal and sustained cooperation.4.	I should also like to convey my warmest congratulations and express my utmost admiration to the outgoing President  Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim  for the extraordinary expertise and mastery with which he conducted the proceedings not only of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly  but also of the three special sessions that have been held this year.5.	Lastly  it would be remiss of me not to mention the merits and the tireless efforts of the Secretary General  whom we wish to encourage most warmly to persevere in his noble task  which is that of reconciling  for the greatest benefit of us all  the often divergent interests within this Organization.6.	The admission of new Members to our Organization is always an occasion of rejoicing for us  because it brings us ever a little closer to our common goal  that of universality. Just a few weeks ago  during the eleventh special session of the General Assembly  Zimbabwe joined us here. Today we see with deep satisfaction Saint Vincent and the Grenadines taking its place among us. We are convinced that this new Member will make a notable contribution to the realization of our common ideals. On behalf of the nine member countries of the European Community  I should like to extend the hand of brotherhood to Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  and to assure them of our full and wholehearted cooperation.7.	The general debate in this Assembly is an opportunity for all delegations to define their positions in the present situation of the world as compared with the past  and also as it relates to what awaits us in the future. Sometimes  we may have a tendency to prefer clear-cut change to vague  slow moving evolution.8.	The year that has gone by since the autumn of 1979 has certainly not been lacking in important events. Yet international relations in the world were probably not marked in a decisive way by isolated events. The basic characteristic seems to us to be the need to provide appropriate responses to new problems that arise  both in the political field and in the economic and social field. That process  although not without its difficulties  is nevertheless an inevitable one.9.	There is an increasingly widespread perception of the interdependence of States in the world  and of their vital need to increase and improve their cooperation.10.	In the face of this interdependence  which must be taken into account in the everyday reality of international relations  we can adopt one of two paths. The first  a brutal one unworthy of civilized man  consists in freeing ourselves from our own independence by making others even more dependent upon ourselves  that is  upon our goodwill. The history of the world since the Second World War has taught us that this path is a dead end and that it should no longer be seen as applicable to the future.11.	The other path is that of the search for negotiated solutions  with the aim of reconciling  in respect for the principles of the United Nations Charter  the essential and legitimate interests of all parties. Freely accepted by them  this is the path that we are attempting to follow within this Organization. 12.	It is also the path which the nine countries have chosen to take within the European Community. By its very existence the Community has demonstrated that it is possible to create an ever closer union among peoples and countries that were in the past rent apart by particularly bloody wars 13.	The fact that the nine countries are soon to become ten at the beginning of next year  upon the admission of Greece  and are also waiting to welcome Spain and Portugal  illustrates our outward looking policy  which is also reflected in our cooperation with other States and groups of States. As an example  I would recall in this connection the signing of the ACPEEC Convention on 31 October 1979  at Lome  between the Community and 59 States of Africa  the Caribbean and the Pacific  and the signing of a cooperation agreement with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations [ASEAN] in the course of the past year. 14.	With regard to world economic problems  the Community intends to make a contribution in keeping with its potential and its ideals. It will strive to face its own problems in the interest of the international community as a whole.15.	In the face of the slowdown in the growth rate  which is likely to be very marked in industrialized regions this year  the Community is determined to contribute to the strengthening of an open and multilateral international commercial system. We particularly hope that all the problems that may arise in its relations with its partners will find solutions that are in keeping with the content and spirit of the results of the recent multilateral commercial negotiations.16.	The European Community has embarked on a resolute course of action to reduce the dependence of its own economy with regard to oil consumption. Its action is based primarily on the search for economic growth that would be accompanied by a considerably less rapid growth in energy consumption brought about by economizing on energy. Considerable progress in this direction is already becoming apparent.17.	Putting into effect its commitment strictly to limit its reliance on world oil resources  the European Community has set a limit for its oil consumption at the end of this decade. In order to attain this goal  many activities are being undertaken to replace oil by other resources. Thus  in the field of the production of electricity  no new oil based power stations will be constructed. Nuclear energy and coal are progressively taking the place previously occupied by oil. Within this framework  the Community attaches great importance to the development of the best safety conditions for all our populations. This abandonment of oil in the production of electricity is being accompanied by the gradual replacement of oil in industry and in domestic use.18.	Furthermore  the conversion of coal into synthetic oil and gas is being actively encouraged. Investments for the development of renewable sources such as solar and geo thermal energy  as well as longer-term research on thermonuclear fusion  complete the range of the Community's internal efforts.19.	All the problems I have just mentioned transcend the mere regional scope of the Community itself. They are closely connected with the other major problem facing the world  that of the development and restructuring of international economic relations.20.	I had an opportunity to make a clear statement of the views of the Community with regard to North South problems at the beginning of the eleventh special session of the General Assembly   devoted to development  which has just concluded its work. I shall not dwell on this  therefore. However  I feel it necessary to recall briefly the position of the Community and its nine member States with regard to the outcome of the work of the General Assembly.21.	Although  technically speaking  the General Assembly has not succeeded in bringing about a complete agreement  there can be no denying that  politically speaking  it has reconfirmed the fact that  in the extremely difficult circumstances which at present affect the international community  the North South dialogue is more necessary now than ever in order to ensure stability in international relations and to meet the needs of development.22.	The Community is gratified at the fact that it has been possible to work out a text acceptable to all with regard to the new international development strategy  and it considers this as a definite success. It now remains for this session of the General Assembly formally to approve this text. Thus  the orientations and approaches it contains will inevitably underlie the actions of member States and institutions of the Community within the framework of their development policy.23.	With regard to the global negotiations  I should like to make it absolutely clear here  first  that our Community is committed to global negotiations; that it is ready  as soon as possible  to pursue discussions in a positive spirit; and that it hopes that a consensus will be reached on the procedures and agenda in the course of this session of the General Assembly.24.	Having mentioned the economic crisis situation in the world  I should like to tackle a subject that is particularly dear to the Community  that of the defence of human rights. In the countries of the European Community  citizens enjoy a political system that guarantees fundamental freedoms. It is natural  therefore  that our citizens should have an interest in the lot of those who are still denied these liberties. Human rights  in our view  embrace at once and indissolubly the right to the integrity of the human person and the right to enjoy civil and political liberties  as well as economic  social and cultural rights. We are convinced that human rights are an important element in international relations. Peace and stability in the world are  indeed  better safeguarded once they are based on respect for the rights of individuals and once the necessary changes and adaptations are brought about through the expression of the will of those most directly concerned. The right to self-determination certainly is an essential factor in international life  and the countries members of the Community would wish to reaffirm their commitment to this principle. The members regret therefore the numerous violations of human rights  whether they be wrongful imprisonment  torture  actions resulting in the disappearance of persons or persecution of the very defenders of human rights.25.	I should like to lay particular stress on one of the fundamental rights of the human person  namely  the right of persons to live normally in their own country. Unfortunately  this right has often been trampled on and the need to seek refuge outside one's country has always existed  despite the efforts of the United Nations. The creation of the post of High Commissioner for Refugees illustrates this grim reality. But  in the course of the recent history of international relations  we have witnessed  unfortunately  the phenomenon of mass exodus  which affects whole groups of the population which are constrained to emigrate. We cannot justify such exoduses on the pretext that the departure of thousands of citizens is a voluntary act when we know that it is the intolerable conditions of life imposed on a minority or out and out repression that underlie that departure.26.	In the view of the Community  these events constitute a violation of the most fundamental human rights. Furthermore  such a policy violates the rights of neighbouring countries by imposing on them an often overwhelming burden which imperils their own balance and thus prejudices their sovereignty. The members of the Community continue actively to oppose these practices because they believe that this means of pursuing a policy should be stopped and eliminated.27.	Not content now with condemning this state of affairs  the members of the Community have exerted considerable efforts to come to the assistance of these uprooted populations. This assistance has been given both on an individual basis and out of the budgetary resources of the European Community. The Community hopes that as many Governments as possible will make their own contribution to this effort  which can  of course  at best only be a palliative. It is incumbent above all on the Governments responsible for these human tragedies to put an end to them.28.	The members of the Community remain committed to detente  which they consider as global and indivisible. The events in Afghanistan  as well as the repeated violations of human rights by certain countries  have inevitably had a negative effect on the situation of detente and  therefore  on the process of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe ' which the Community continues to consider extremely important.29.	The Madrid meeting   a new stage in this process after that at Belgrade in 19771978   is going to begin its work within six weeks in an international climate which  unfortunately will be far from propitious. This fact will not discourage the members of the Community from doing everything in their power to contribute to its success  which will  in their view  depend on the following two conditions: all signatory States must be ready to participate in a frank and profound discussion of the respect accorded the principles of the Final Act  and the implementation of its provisions; these same States must also demonstrate genuine political will to take part in the examination of proposals designed to improve concretely and substantially the application of the provisions of all the elements of the Final Act.30.	In the view of the Community  the tasks of nuclear disarmament as well as those of conventional disarmament must continue to figure among the highest priorities of our Organization  In this regard  the consensus which has emerged with regard to the results of the first special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament  in 1978  has constituted a positive factor. The Final Document adopted on that occasion must continue to guide us in our work.31.	The deliberations of the Disarmament Commission are of undeniable interest from this standpoint. The recommendations adopted by this Commission will certainly provide a useful contribution to our work 32.	The members of the Community are gratified  furthermore  at the agreement that was worked out at Geneva during the spring session of the Committee on Disarmament on the creation of four working groups. We think that the work of those groups should enable the Committee to make progress in negotiations  in particular in regard to the important and difficult question of banning the manufacture and stockpiling of chemical weapons.33.	Furthermore  the Community wishes to welcome the conclusion of the work of the group of governmental experts whose task it was to assist the secretary General in the study of all aspects of regional disarmament  the results of which will be submitted to the General Assembly at this session.34.	The spring of 1981 will mark the beginning of the process of preparations for the second special session that our Assembly has decided to devote to disarmament. Here  on behalf of our Community  I should like to stress that we will spare no effort in seeing to it that this session makes a positive contribution to peace and security  which is something that all members expect of it.35.	The African continent during the past year has been the scene of some remarkable events. The international community fortunately has been able to note that certain African countries have made real progress towards democracy. Furthermore  recent history demonstrates that Africa is confronting with growing confidence the complexity of the problems that that continent has to face. The members of the Community note this evolution with satisfaction  because they are convinced that the best way of ensuring peace in Africa lies in the action of the African countries themselves  and in particular in their cooperation in the Organization of African Unity. Therefore  the members of the Community are convinced that only a debate free of outside interference can bring about lasting stability in Africa.36.	In the same spirit  the European Community welcomes the willingness manifested by the African countries to set up systems of continental or regional cooperation and integration. The most recent initiative in this context was that recently decided upon by nine African countries at Lusaka.37.	The settlement of the Zimbabwe crisis constitutes a particularly positive element. Thanks to the joint and tenacious action on the part of all those concerned  it was possible to bring about a peaceful solution. The members of the Community once again convey their congratulations to that country on its admission into our Organization  an admission that was awaited with impatience for some years. They are convinced that the process embarked upon in Zimbabwe shows that it is not Utopian to conceive of a multiracial State in southern Africa based on the equality of all its citizens. We express the hope that this solution will serve as an example  in particular with regard to the establishment of the independence of Namibia and the abolition' of apartheid in South Africa.38.	Despite these encouraging developments  it is appropriate to note that  unfortunately  the search for a greater measure of political stability has given rise to clashes and  indeed  acts of actual warfare often involving the exodus of large masses of the population. In sub-Saharan Africa  vast regions have  furthermore  once again fallen victim to drought. These combined phenomena exacerbate even further the tragedy of the refugees in Africa.39.	With regard to Namibia  the members of the Community continue to be concerned at the slow rate of the search for a peaceful solution that should lead to the independence of that country  in accordance with Security Council resolution 385 (1976). Taking note of the recent South African response8 to the letter from the Secretary General ' they regret very much indeed the delay in the application of the United Nations plan  adopted under Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  a delay for which South Africa cannot deny that it has a certain responsibility. In the view of the Community  it is essential to sustain the efforts of the secretary General and of the contact group of the five Western Powers and the frontline States so that the plan worked out within our Organization may be applied. The members of the Community stress the unacceptable nature of an internal settlement that would not guarantee lasting peace in the region. Furthermore  they wish to remind the Assembly that they do not recognize the body known as the ""Council of Ministers"" set up at the beginning of July  which has no legal basis and is incompatible with the United Nations settlement plan.40.	The policy of apartheid pursued in South Africa is a matter of profound concern to our Community. The members of the Community vigorously condemn that system based upon institutionalized racism and regret that it should be maintained in an authoritarian way in spite of clear-cut disapproval and opposition. They regret that the internal debate  which they followed with interest  has not made it possible so tar to bring about real progress towards creating a more just society. The members stress that the persistence of that situation will entail a growth of tension  thus jeopardizing the chances of an equitable and lasting solution.41.	In their statement of 28 July 1980  the members of the Community publicly expressed their satisfaction at the encouraging nature of the initial results of the implementation by European companies of the code of conduct adopted by the States of the European Community in September 1977. They have no doubt that progress can still be made in defining and applying that instrument within the framework of the struggle against racial discrimination. The members recall their commitment as a European Community to the promotion of positive and peaceful development in South Africa that would put an end to the policy of apartheid in that country.42.	The democratization process requires courage and determination on the part of the countries of Latin America also. The members of the Community attach value to that process and also to the elimination of violence from political life. In that regard  it is to be regretted that there has been an absence of significant progress in many cases and also that obstacles have been placed on the road to democracy when the establishment of democracy seemed assured 43.	In the face of those events  the Community welcomes the path chosen by Peru and also the encouraging attempts at regrouping on a regional basis. The assistance of Europe  itself committed to a similar process  will not be lacking  in particular for the democratic States members of the Andean Pact.  Europe is aware of its traditional ties with Latin America and we are therefore keenly interested in seeking ways and means of strengthening our economic and political relations with it.44.	In Asia the situation continues to deteriorate seriously. While only last year that region was the scene of just one major hotbed of tension  that is to say the IndoChinese peninsula  we now have to add a second  Afghanistan. Underlying the two conflicts  we find the flagrant violation of the principles contained in our Charter  which is the basis of our Organization  that is the right of peoples to self-determination and the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of another State. Those rules of international life have been and continue to be violated unacceptably by States which take advantage of their military superiority in order to establish their spheres of influence  even at the risk of jeopardizing peace and stability. Such a policy stems from concepts which the community of nations had believed obsolete. Unfortunately  the lessons of history do not seem to have always been understood by everyone.45.	At the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly following an initiative by the ASEAN countries  a resolution was adopted by a very large majority condemning the invasion of Kampuchea and calling for the withdrawal of all foreign occupation forces from that country. That resolution was not complied with in any way  and if the food situation of the Khmer people inside the country or on the frontier with Thailand has slightly improved over the last few months  the political situation  as we know  has not changed.46.	The members of the Community recall their determination to see a continuation of international assistance by sea  air and land. They encourage the secretary General to persevere in his contacts with international aid organizations in order to ensure that food is provided to the peoples that have so shamefully been uprooted and left to starve. The Community is convinced that only a political solution can bring about stability in the region and they appeal to all parties to the conflict to make possible a solution along the lines of General Assembly resolution 34/22. In that regard  the withdrawal of the Vietnamese troops occupying Cambodian territory is an indispensable condition. In the view of the Community such a solution should be based upon the existence of an independent and neutral Cambodia  with a genuinely representative Government that would have friendly relations with all countries in the region.47.	In Afghanistan  nine months after the Soviet invasion  resistance continues. Fierce fighting is going on between underequipped patriots and a foreign army equipped with highly sophisticated material. In spite of the disproportion of forces  it does not seem likely that there will be an early end to the conflict. Last January  the General Assembly adopted by an overwhelming majority a resolution calling for the cessation of the invasion of Afghanistan. In order to permit the reestablishment of a situation in accordance with that resolution  which has not yet been complied with  the Community.it will be remembered  put forward the concept of a neutral and nonaligned Afghanistan outside the competition among the great Powers. To that end  the great Powers and the neighbouring States should undertake to respect the sovereignty and integrity of Afghanistan  to abstain from interference in its internal affairs and to refrain from establishing any form of presence or military association with it.48.	Further efforts to promote a solution to the conflict have been undertaken by the Islamic Conference  particularly following the creation by it of a special commission to explore the possibilities of bringing about a political settlement with all the parties concerned. The members of the Community express once again the hope that it will be possible to avoid the indefinite continuation of this particularly cruel war through a solution in keeping with the resolution by our Assembly providing for the withdrawal of Soviet troops and the free exercise by the Afghan people of their right to determine their own future.49.	The members of the Community have frequently repeated that they fully respect the independence of Iran and the right of the Iranian people to determine their own future. I repeat that before this Assembly: the members of the Community are definitely motivated by the sincere desire to achieve good relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran  which has embarked upon a new phase in its history. I regret  however  to have to add that  unfortunately  the major obstacle to such relations is still constituted by the problem of the hostages.50.	On behalf of the Community  it is my duty to say before this Assembly  one of the major goals of which is to promote peace and to create the necessary conditions for the maintenance of justice and respect for the obligations engendered by treaties and other sources of international law  how much the Community is concerned by the continued detention of the American hostages in Iran. The Iranian authorities persist  unfortunately  in ignoring the unambiguous appeal issued by the Security Council in its resolution 461 (1979) and the judgement of 24 May 1980 handed down by the International Court of Justice."" In the face of the continued detention of the hostages  the countries members of the Community  like other countries  have felt prompted to reflect in concrete measures their profound disapproval of this flagrant violation of international law.51.	At a time when the Islamic Republic of Iran has established democratic institutions and the new Government has taken office  the European Community and  I believe  the whole international community hope that this question will be resolved  that the hostages will be freed and that Iran will respect all obligations of international law  particularly those ensuring the protection of foreigners residing in that country.52.	Is there any need for me to state that the immunity of diplomatic personnel is the very basis of secure and normal relations among the peoples of the world community? Furthermore  the general respect for human rights in that country too remains a subject of concern in Europe. Unfortunately  the recent acts of war between Iran and Iraq can only serve to aggravate tension dangerously and make the normalization of the situation even more difficult.53.	Since the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly  the situation in the Middle East has deteriorated dangerously. In the last few months  problems relating to that situation have been dealt with by the Security Council eight times and have been the subject of an emergency special session of the General Assembly. The steady increase in tension and the hardening of positions on all sides make it all the more necessary and urgent to find a global solution to the Israeli Arab conflict. The time has come therefore to abandon the language of violence and replace it by that of dialogue  a dialogue among all the parties concerned on the conditions and modalities for the restoration of peace.54.	A year ago  the Irish Foreign Minister  speaking on behalf of the Community  noted with satisfaction the progress achieved in the improvement of relations between Egypt and Israel following the signing of the Camp David agreements. So far those agreementsâand we recognize their great merit with regard to Egyptian-Israeli relations  particularly in that they have made it possible for the bulk of Sinai to be evacuated in compliance with Security Council resolution 242 (1967)âhave nevertheless not yielded the desired results  particularly with regard to the promotion of a just  lasting and global peace settlement involving all the parties concerned  which is  after all  our ultimate objective.55.	For years now  the members of the Community have persistently recalled at this rostrum and elsewhere that such a settlement must be based essentially on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  applied in all their parts and to all the parties concerned  as well as on the basis of the principles which they have stipulated on various occasions. Disturbed at the development of the situation in the region and aware of the particular role imposed upon them by the traditional ties and common interests which link Europe with that part of the world  the Heads of State and Government of the Community published at Venice  on 13 June last  a declaration bringing their position up to date and stating their intention fully to fulfil the particular role incumbent upon them and to work more specifically for peace  as is stated in our Venice declaration  the time has come to promote the recognition and implementation of the two principles acknowledged by the entire international community  namely  the right to existence and security of all States in the region  including Israel  and justice for all peoples  which entails recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.56.	From that twofold requirement flow logically all the consequences  including the right of all countries in the region to live in peace within secure  recognized and guaranteed frontiers. The guarantees of a peace settlement must be provided by our Organization on the decision of the Security Council and  if necessary  on the basis of other mutually agreed upon procedures. The members of the Community declare their readiness to participate within the context of a global settlement in a system of concrete and binding international guarantees  in the area itself.57.	Furthermore  the Palestinian problem  which is not a mere refugee problem  must finally find a just solution. The Palestinian people  which is conscious of its existence as such  must be enabled  by an appropriate process defined within the global framework of the peace settlement  to exercise fully its right to self-determination 58.	The solution of the Middle East problem consists in reconciling and bringing about the coexistence of two essential realities: the State of Israel and the Palestinian people. Consequently  recognition of Israel's right to exist and implementation of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination will be the very basis of negotiations which should lead to a global peace settlement.59.	Israel must therefore put an end to the territorial occupation that it has maintained since 1967. In this regard  the Israeli settlements represent a serious obstacle to the peace process. The members of the Community consider that those settlements and the demographic modifications and  I would even say  changes in property ownership in the occupied Arab territories are illegal under international law. Similarly  in view of the particular importance of the question of Jerusalem for all the parties to the conflict  the Community will accept no unilateral initiative aimed at changing the status of that city and stresses that any agreement on the subject must guarantee freedom of access to all Holy Places.60.	Finally  anxious to put an end to violence  the Community considers that only the renunciation of the use or threat of use of force by all the parties can create a climate of confidence in the region and constitute a fundamental element in a global settlement of the Middle East conflict. Such a settlement presupposes  of course  the adherence and assistance of all the parties concerned. The principles to which I have just referred are incumbent upon all the parties concerned  without exception  including the Palestinian people and the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]  which should be associated in the negotiations.61.	That is the position of the countries of the European Community  and it is on that basis that they will strive to contribute actively to the search for a peace settlement in the Middle East.62.	According to the Venice declaration  the nine Governments of the European Community have decided to make the necessary contacts with all the parties concerned. Those contacts should be aimed at securing information on the position of the various' partiesâ vis a vis the principles laid down in the declaration of 13 June and  in the light of the results of those consultations  determining the form which a European initiative should take.63.	The contact mission on which I have just embarked in accordance with that declaration has taken me to the following countries: Tunisia  where I met the authorities of that country and the secretary General of the League of Arab States  Israel  Lebanon  where I was in touch with the Lebanese Government  Mr. Yasser Arafat  Chairman of the Executive Council of the PLO  and representatives of the different communitiesâSyria  Jordan  Kuwait  Iraq  Saudi Arabia and Egypt. Furthermore  I have also had talks with the Palestinian side  with the Cardinal Secretary of State of the Vatican and with the United States Secretary of State. At the end of this monthâin a few days' time  that isâI hope to meet some local Palestinian representatives in the occupied territories.64.	I should like to thank all those who have received meâthe governmental authorities and the representatives of the various organizations and communitiesâfor their courteous and even warm welcome  the interest which  without exception  they have shown in the European mission and their appreciation of the role that Europe is playing in that part of the world.65.	There is no need for me to say that the principles enumerated in the Venice declaration  which underlie the contact mission  are only partially and unequally accepted throughout the world. But the members of the Community are confident that the sincerity of their intentions and their determination to contribute to a solution of the conflict will be recognized and appreciated by all those concerned.66.	The conclusions of the European contact mission can only be drawn when it comes to an end. However  it is possible now to make a certain number of comments.67.	First  I have noted the concern  even the distress  of those with whom I have spoken at developments over recent months. This has led most of the leaders whom I have met to insist on urgent and decisive action in favour of peace. In Israel  the need for security is clearly more than a strictly military concept and is in keeping with an aspiration which is profoundly resented by the Arabs in the immediate vicinity and continues to be denied. However  that need for security is not exclusively an Israeli concern; it is something which is very much felt throughout the region  in particular by the Arab countries which are neighbours of Israel and among the Palestinian people in the occupied territories.68.	Secondly  I have noted that all the Arab countries and the Palestinians unanimously consider Israel's withdrawal from the occupied territories and the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people to be two fundamental principles. This requirement  I feet  is part of a deeply felt demand for justice. That is why the creation of settlements and the recent law passed by the Israeli parliament declaring Jerusalem the capital of Israel are particularly resented by the Arabs. Each of the parties directly concerned categorically rejects an imposed solution prepared without its participation. That  of course  applies particularly to Israel and the Palestinians.69.	I should like to inform this Assembly of a personal reaction. The sight of so much human suffering and so much effort wasted on war  and thus lost to the cause of peace  should encourage us to work even harder for a solution of the conflict.70.	The indications which I was able to garner in the course of my mission confirm the line which the members of the Community hitherto have been following. It has seemed more than ever true that only a global settlement can bring about a just and lasting peace in the Middle East. This means that all parties concerned must be associated in the negotiation but also  as everyone must concede  that the problem of Israel and that of the Palestinian people are indissolubly linked.71.	There is no point in trying to solve those two problems independently of each other. That is why the members of the Community believe it to be necessary for Israel clearly to manifest its intention to put an end to the territorial occupation which it has maintained since the conflict of 1967. The conditions in which this evacuation would be brought about and the guarantees with which it would be accompanied should be the subject of negotiation. In the meantime  Israel should refrain from creating any faits accomplis by installing further settlements which could only serve to erect new obstacles to the search for an agreement.72.	At the same time  the Arab countries and the Palestinians must explicitly recognize Israel's right to exist. Within the framework of a peace settlement  the Palestine people should be placed in a position to take an unhindered decision  through the exercise of its right to self-determination  as to its future national identity.73.	I shall conclude by stressing the keen concern of the European countries in the face of the situation prevailing in Lebanon  particularly in southern Lebanon. As the members of the Community stressed in their declaration on Lebanon  they wish toreaffirm their total and unswerving solidarity with this friendly country  the balance of which remains dangerously threatened by confrontations in the region  and wish to repeat their urgent appeal to all countries and parties concerned to put an end to any act which may jeopardize the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon and the authority of its Government. The Community will support any action and any initiative likely to return peace  security and stability to Lebanon  which is an essential factor for balance in the region.74.	It has emerged from the contacts which I have had with the Lebanese authorities and with the other parties that the problem of Lebanon is directly connected with the problem of the Middle East  taken over all  and particularly the Palestinian problem. The international community cannot  however  refrain from reacting right now  regardless of the overall Israeli conflict  to the prejudice which has been done to the very existence of the Lebanese State in its internationally recognized frontiers.75.	Following the recent events in southern Lebanon  the members of the Community thought it necessary to state publicly their profound concern and to issue a warning against any endeavour which might be prejudicial to Lebanon's sovereignty  unity and territorial integrity and which would entail the gravest consequences for that country and the entire region.76.	These events have hindered the role of UNIFIL  to which four countries of the Community have been making an appreciable contribution. In their Luxembourg declaration on 22 April 1980  the Community stressed the need for all parties concerned to make it possible for UNIFIL to perform fully the tasks which have been entrusted to it  including the carrying out of monitoring work right up to the international frontier. These events also have contributed to an aggravation of the situation in the region and are contrary to the efforts undertaken  by the European Community in particular  to restore peace in the Middle East.77.	The Community wishes to call on all parties to demonstrate the greatest restraint and to refrain from any action or any position which is liable to negate the chances of a return to a just and lasting peace in the Middle East.78.	These efforts  in conclusion  are going on and will continue. The contacts which I have had so far have been very positive and provide us with some very useful indications. We are studying them most attentively in the desire to take some effective action for peace. The objective today is for the countries members of the European Community  on the basis of these reflections  to work out orientations and concrete proposals which will mark the role of Europe in the search for the implementation of a peace settlement in the Middle East.79.	In the meantime  we appeal to all parties concerned to refrain in the months to come from any acts or statements which may serve to inflame a situation which is already very disturbing and which may serve to destroy the minimum of confidence and tranquillity which we the members of the United Nations need so much in the search for peace.80.	Another problem which affects the Community is the Cyprus conflict. It was therefore with great satisfaction that we learned that the intercommunal talks resumed  at Nicosia  in the presence of the representative of the Secretary General. The Community wishes to express the hope that the conversations will lead to a just and lasting settlement in keeping with the needs and aspirations of the parties. I have personally had an opportunity to express to the highest leaders of the two communities Europe's desire finally to see these negotiations making substantial progress. We should like to thank Mr. Waldheim for his efforts to this end. We also believe that  pending a final settlement of the dispute  it is indispensable for calm to be maintained in the island.81.	Permit me now to deal with certain questions concerning the functioning of our Organization.82.	The countries members of the Community are of the view that the representativeness of our Organization is a primary question. The authors of the Charter constantly are at pains to take into account at the same time the principle of the universality of our Organization  the needs for equitable geographic distribution and the maintenance of a balance among its organs. The members of the Community are profoundly convinced that we should be particularly cautious and careful before doing anything to affect these balances  and it is in the interest of all Members of the United Nations to weigh most carefully the advantages liable to follow from an institutional reform against the disadvantages which it might entail. They think that it will be essential in the future to avoid anything which may do damage to the foundations of our Organization. Furthermore  an independent and effective Secretariat  in accordance with Articles 100 and 101 of the Charter  is indispensable. It is necessary  therefore  to give considerable thought to ways of bringing about a genuine and lasting consensus before effecting any changes in the Secretariat  particularly those which may touch upon its effectiveness.83.	In the face of the economic difficulties engendered by the world crisis  the problem of allocating funds to the United Nations is one faced by all Member States. The members of the Community think that the United Nations should react positively to this climate of austerity by avoiding duplication and identifying activities which have now become outmoded with a view to eliminating them as far as possible  a real increase in the budget might not even be necessary. It goes without saying that strict respect for the financial rules of our Organization should be assured.84.	Peacekeeping operations constitute a particularly important task of the United Nations. The members of the Community declare themselves ready to support efforts of the United Nations in this field and to participate in these measures to the extent that they are able. They appeal to all the parties concerned to see to it that they permit effective functioning of these operations according to the directives laid down in our resolutions. In this regard  it is appropriate to mention once again the difficult position of UNIFIL to which four States members of the European Community provide selfless contributions.85.	I have just set forth at some length the common positions of the nine members of the European Community on major world problems. I do not wish to add to this any national considerations  essentially because Luxembourg is fully within the European Community and fully supports its activities. I feel it important  however  to state two personal points of view.86.	A month ago  I carried out a contact mission in the Middle East  in the course of which I collected a mass of information and impressions about the Israeli Arab conflict. I did so as emissary of the European Community and I spoke as such. I now wish to express a pressing appeal for reason and to call on all the parties concerned to demonstrate a spirit of conciliation. Time is not in favour of anyone. Those who believe that the consolidation of illegitimate territorial gains will ensure their security are seriously mistaken. Also mistaken are those who believe that preconditions or refusal to discuss with the adversary may be an advantage to them. Either of these ways will inevitably lead to confrontation  in which we shall all be the losers. I address a pressing appeal to all to contribute to this climate of confidence which alone will make it possible to emerge from the circle of violence and make progress towards a solution based not only on justice and law but also on mutual understanding. All those outside parties too would be mistaken if they believed that any possible advantage could be derived from deliberately maintaining tension. They run the risk of ending up like the sorcerer's apprentice.87.	Fundamentally  the security of all parties depends much less on a square kilometre more or less or the conquest of any strategic positions than the acceptance by all of the crucial fact that in the future the two communities will be living together in peace and confidence in this part of the world which is so important in history.88.	I should like also to say a few words on the eleventh special session of our Assembly  devoted to development  which was just concluded a week ago. I will not bow to my initial inclination  which would be somewhat bitter in the face of the scanty results achieved  nor will I make any comments of disillusionment as to the attitude of certain countries which did not believe that they were able to keep in line with the general trend of opinion. It is up to each Government to take its own responsibilities and in all independence to judge the positions which it wants to adopt.89.	As Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the European Community  I should like to say how sorry I am that the Community has been unable fully to assume the generous and dynamic role which it had usually played. I must say that I am disappointed.90.	The important thing  howeverâand I turn towards the futureâis what happens at the thirty-fifth session of the Assembly as a result of the eleventh special session. It seems to me essential for the future of humanity that concrete steps be taken with a view to narrowing the gap between the rich and I he poor on the world level. The opportunities  however slender  offered by the eleventh special session must be fully seized and exploited by all  primarily by the affluent countries  whether they be industrialized countries  whatever their economic system  or those States members of the Group of 77 which  because of their natural wealth  rank among the richest countries in the world.91. These two comments which I have just made on behalf of my own country relate to the two fundamental tasks of our Organization  namely  to ensure peace and to reduce economic inequalities throughout the world. Important progress on those two levels is necessary  but the small positive steps already taken  thanks to the work done here  provide ample justification for this meeting of 154 countries. It is my conviction and hope that progress will indeed be made if we all cooperate."
"85",4337,"MAR",35,1980,"ï»¿Mr. President  it is with great pleasure that I voice my sincere congratulations  on behalf of the delegation of the Kingdom of Morocco  for the excellent choice which has been made by the international community  represented by this Assembly  in electing you President of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. Your election to that high office is a confirmation of your outstanding merits  your skill and the eminent qualities which we recognize you to possess. At the same time it is a deserved tribute to your country  which is making a valuable contribution to the consolidation of peace in Europe and to the easing of tension throughout the world. The delegation of the Kingdom of Morocco  which has the closest friendly relations with the Federal Republic of Germany  would like to assure you of its full co-operation in order to facilitate your task and to ensure the complete success of the present session.75.	The admission of new Member States to the United Nations is likely to complete and consolidate its universality. Morocco is very pleased to welcome the delegations ofZimbabwe and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and would like to assure them of its complete co-operation. We are particularly happy for the people of Zimbabwe  which has been waging a lengthy struggle to regain its freedom and its dignity and whose delegation has now taken its rightful seat among us. That people has now assumed responsibility for its own destiny after having taken a decisive step on the road leading to the complete and final emancipation of the entire African continent.76.	While celebrating this important victory of Africa  we consider the event an additional reason to redouble our efforts in our action and in our commitment to the other peoples of southern Africa which are still struggling for their emancipation and their freedom.77.	I should also like to congratulate the Secretary- General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  for all he has done and is continuing to do to implement the purposes and principles of the Charter.78.	In the early years of the last decade  the beginnings of international detente raised immense hope that dialogue would prevail over confrontation  and that compromise would take the place of conflict. Unfortunately  today that hope is fading and the world is actually faced with an international situation which hardly gives rise to optimism because the factors which make for tension and instability are multiplying in several areas of the world. Latent conflicts run the risk of escaping the control in which we imagine them to be held  of spilling over their geographical boundaries and of leading to generalized confrontations.79.	The chronic tension  threat of war and deadly confrontations in the Horn of Africa are a striking example of that. Equally  the present dispute between Iraq and Iran  which was provoked by a clear violation of the historical rights of Iraq  is another bloody manifestation of those deplorable tendencies  the consequences of which could be catastrophic for international peace if the parties to the dispute do not positively and swiftly enough respond to the appeal for a cease-fire made by the Security Council and the Islamic Conference.80.	The hegemonistic tendencies  on the political level and in the economic field  the tenacious desire of some to impose their own ideology  the struggle to gain influence and benefit  the ever-growing gap between increased prosperity and overwhelming poverty  the chronic under-development of most of mankind  the heavy burden of debt which affects the emerging countries and the unbridled arms race are also factors which give rise to fear of cataclysms the consequences of which for the stability of the world are easy to imagine. It is therefore essential for us to increase our vigilance so as to avert the dangers looming in the decade of the 1980s  which has just begun  lest they degenerate into destructive conflicts.81.	A number of nerve centres in Asia and elsewhere are still flash-points of tension. There can be no doubt that the Middle East remains our greatest concern because it represents one of the most serious potential threats to peace and international security. The international community concluded that the Palestinian problem was undoubtedly at the core of the Middle East tragedy and that any solution of that conflict must necessarily entail the complete restoration of the inalienable rights of the fighting Palestinian people.82.	It is heartening to see the broad degree of international support and the ever-growing sympathy which is accorded to the Palestinian cause as well as the striking success which the Palestinian people has achieved under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]  The overwhelming majority of States in our community recognize the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people and also that people's absolute right to self- determination and to the establishment of its own sovereign State in its territory. I should also like to recall that the seventh emergency special session of the General Assembly on the question of Palestine adopted this summer by an overwhelming majority an important resolution  which reaffirmed the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination  free from any foreign interference  and confirmed its right to establish a sovereign State on its national territory.83.	However  we note with deep concern that the fighting people of Palestine continues to be the victim of the blind stubbornness of the racist Zionist entity and that it is threatened daily with genocide and large-scale massacres. In the meantime  we have witnessed  without any effective reaction  the Judaization of the Palestinian Arab lands  the distortion of their religious and historical characteristics  the methodical modification of the original population  all in flagrant violation of numerous resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly and in complete disregard of world opinion in a desperate attempt to destroy Palestinian identity.84.	The Israeli Knesset recently adopted a fundamental law designed to turn the Holy City of Jerusalem into the ""unified and perpetual capital of Israel"". That decision is another challenge by Israel to the numerous resolutions which have condemned Zionist attempts to Judaize the Holy City and demonstrates  if indeed that is necessary  Israel's total rejection of any just and equitable solution to the Palestinian problem. It should also be recalled that this attitude is in blatant contradiction of Security Council resolution 478 (1980)  which determined that all legislative and administrative measures and actions which purported to alter the character and status of Al Quds were null and void and must be rescinded forthwith.85.	In this connection we should like to express our deep appreciation to those States which have decided to transfer their embassies from Jerusalem pursuant to the resolution of the Security Council and in response to the appeal of the Islamic Conference  namely  Bolivia  Chile  Colombia  Costa Rica  the Dominican Republic  Ecuador  El Salvador  Guatemala  Haiti  the Netherlands  Panama  Uruguay and Venezuela.86.	The Islamic world quite properly considers that the Israeli steps to integrate Jerusalem are a definite provocation and a challenge to the hundreds of millions of Moslems and Christians. In order to meet this challenge  His Majesty King Hassan II of Morocco convened the Al Quds Committee in an emergency session at Casablanca under his presidency  during which the Islamic Conference reaffirmed its commitment to counteract Israeli actions and to work for the liberation of Jerusalem. The Conference considered this pledge as an Islamic and humanitarian duty incumbent upon all Moslem countries and all countries which love peace and justice and support the struggle of the Palestinian people for the restoration of its rights to self-determination  to return to its land and to establish its own State on that land.87.	My country also had the honour to host last month the special Conference of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Islamic countries who adopted a number of resolutions whereby the participating countries committed themselves to liberating the Holy City and mobilizing their full potential to combat the Israeli decision to annex Jerusalem.88.	The Kingdom of Morocco  whose sovereign is President of the Al Quds Committee  considers the question of Palestine and of the Holy City of Jerusalem as its own and has reaffirmed its total commitment to support the struggle of the Palestinian people until it achieves self-determination and independence and establishes its own sovereign State in its own territory.89.	We therefore ask the General Assembly to take all necessary steps to put an end to the repeated acts of Israeli aggression and to demand the implementation of the sanctions provided for in Chapter VII of the Charter against Israel  which continues to occupy the Arab and Palestinian lands and to defy United Nations resolutions and all the decisions of the international community.90.	Morocco is following with extreme alarm the continued acts of aggression by Israel in the southern part of Lebanon and resolutely condemns the criminal raids carried out against Lebanese towns and villages. It strongly reaffirms its complete solidarity with the fraternal people of Lebanon and its full support for the Lebanese Government in the efforts to defend its independence and protect its sovereignty and territorial integrity.91.	The people of Afghanistan  which for centuries has been paying a very high price to safeguard its independence  is day by day sacrificing the best of its sons to preserve its freedom  its sovereignty and its faith. By an overwhelming majority and in this very hall  the international community has expressed disapproval of the new situation which has arisen in Afghanistan and declared its firm will to put an end to it and reject the status quo.92.	My country  which is linked by ancient ties of friendship to the Soviet Union and still wishes to develop those relations ' can only reaffirm its solidarity with the Moslem people of Afghanistan and will continue  within the framework of the Islamic Conference  to seek a satisfactory solution to this unhappy problem  in accordance with the resolution adopted at the Eleventh Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers  held at Islamabad from 17 to 22 May 1980. It is also the duty of our Organization to support the Afghan people and their inalienable right freely to determine their own way of life. Morocco  which is the repository of an important part of the Islamic heritage and a defender of its eternal ideals and principles  assures the Moslem people of Afghanistan of its complete solidarity with them.93.	Another Asian people  that of Democratic Kampuchea  is today being subjected to a policy of wholesale Vietnamization and is enduring physical and moral agony under the law of a Government imposed from outside. International solidarity is being mobilized  despite the obstacles  to save the people of Kampuchea from famine  epidemics  insecurity and disorder and every effort must be made to support the right of that people to peace  dignity and freedom of choice.94.	The Powers which  a quarter of a century ago  began a thorough reconsideration of their behaviour in Africa on the basis of a more tolerant ethical system and a more comprehending awareness of the aspirations of the peoples  must understand the desire of the African continent today to resist the violent infiltration of ideologies which are alien to it  attempts to cause destabilization  introduce hegemonism and shamefully exploit its wealth and the economic dependence which maintains the existence of many areas of unjustifiable under-development.95.	At a time when we are welcoming the advent of the Republic of Zimbabwe  we cannot forget that the Namibian people is still waging a heroic struggle in order to hasten the process of decolonization started by the United Nations  which has been frustrated so many times by the South African racists. The tireless efforts of the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  as well as the United Nations proposals made last June  have been met by intolerable delaying tactics on the part of the authorities in Pretoria  who reject with disdain the numerous resolutions adopted almost unanimously by our Organization.96.	May I say here that the Kingdom of Morocco hails the struggle of the heroic people of Namibia and supports its fight for unrestricted independence and absolute territorial integrity.97.	Now that tolerance has become more and more widespread in the behaviour of nations and at a time when the world is becoming aware of the need to respect human rights in all forms  South Africa and its racist regime continue to practise the odious policy of apartheid against the people of South Africa who are constantly subjected to acts of mass repression. Those who directly or indirectly lend their support and co-operation to South Africa impair the force of the numerous resolutions of the United Nations and become the de facto accomplices of the South African racists who preach the doctrine of apartheid and racial discrimination.98.	There is an evil which affects a number of regions of the world and which is for Africa a particularly disquieting tragedy  and that is the problem of refugees  who now number in the millions. It can escape no one that this tragedy has a very deleterious effect on the African countries whose economies are already in a precarious state  and thus adds to the present problems. From Sudan to Somalia  from Cameroon to Zambia  millions of human beings are in a state of total deprivation and are anxiously and impatiently awaiting a gesture of international solidarity  which has not as yet been forthcoming. The action which has been undertaken by the High Commissioner for Refugees is extremely beneficial and welcome  but it is far from having obtained all the funds and assistance that is needed  despite the impulse to international solidarity that it has succeeded in arousing.99.	North-west Africa is also unfortunately subjected to tension that has been artificially created and deliberately maintained by forces from abroad. What we now call ""the problem of Western Sahara"" is really only a reflection in the region's politics of a methodical hegemonism that aims to take over the economy and the ideology by unscrupulous force  all disguised as the defence of principles which certain countries proclaim with highly suspicious enthusiasm. Last year  I denounced  the manoeuvres of the enemies of Morocco's sacred cause of national unity  who tend to create belief in the existence of an entity for which a specific identity has been devised and the existence of a so-called ""Sahraoui State""  for which titles of legality are being sought  against every rule of law and common sense. I recalled also how Morocco had suffered from the most pernicious form of colonialism  which  by alienating its independence  has been particularly prejudicial to its territorial integrity since it involved the organization of five separate zones of foreign occupation and a sixth area under international jurisdiction.100.	Despite the fact that the colonial occupation of Morocco lasted almost 50 years  our territory was not invaded in a single operation. The invasion was gradual and stretched over a long period of time  proceeding by stages in which the territory was reduced province by province. For that reason  the independence of Morocco was also won piecemeal  while the national struggle was being carried out.101.	The central part of Morocco  which was a French protectorate  became independent on 2 March 1956. The northern part  which was a Spanish protectorate  was reintegrated into the motherland on 7 April of the same year. The international zone of Tangier was recovered in the autumn of 1956. The northern part of the so-called Western Sahara was returned to Morocco in 1958 under the name of Tarfaya. The Ifni enclave was detached in turn from the so- called Spanish Sahara and returned to Morocco in 1969  in accordance with the pertinent resolutions of the United Nations which asked Spain to negotiate with my country on the problems involved in decolonizing that territory and the then so-called Spanish Sahara. Finally  the territory of the so-called Western Sahara was restored to Morocco in 1975  and this was noted by the United Nations in General Assembly resolution 3458 B (XXX) of 10 December 1975.102.	Morocco's struggle for the restoration of its territorial integrity lasted many years; it covered the whole colonial occupation period and continued after the independence of the northern and central areas. The national independence movement began its fight in all the provinces of Morocco  from the north to the south of the territory.103.	When in 1956 colonialism was forced to make major concessions by abandoning regions where it could no longer withstand the national movement  it attempted  by the ploy of giving them different kinds of status  to perpetuate its domination over fringe areas  whose economic potential was foreseeable but as yet unexploited. However  both in the liberated areas and in those areas that remained under Spanish and colonial domination  the national movement called the tune and  where necessary  organized the struggle for total liberation and national reunification.104.	Thus  at that some time  in the spring of 1956  the Congress of the Western Saharan peoples  held at Oum Chgag in the region of El Ayoun  adopted a still famous manifesto by which all the tribes in the region swore to the late King Mohammed V complete faith in and loyalty to the Alaouite throne and the Moroccan nation  of which they are an integral part. The delegation that represented the peoples of that region visited Rabat and was received by the sovereign  King Mohammed V  who welcomed them during an official ceremony in the course of which he committed himself to ensuring their protection and their reintegration into the mother country.105.	The Spanish colonial Power was particularly hesitant in permitting Morocco to recover its rights and so a Moroccan liberation army was formed in that region and successfully undertook direct action in order to recover our national territory. The decisive battle of Dcheira in the region of El Ayoun in 1975 sounded the death knell for foreign military presence in Moroccan Western Sahara by routing the occupying forces. That was when the famous Ecouvillon operation was mounted  in which the Spanish forces of the region and the French forces that came from Algeria and western Africa had to combine their efforts for many weeks in order to overcome the resistance of the liberation army at a time when it had already virtually liberated the major part of the territory.106.	At the same time and later as well  an independent Morocco used every means available to it in order to make its voice heard and to recover its rights. Thus  without ever getting out of touch with the Spanish Government with regard to this point  Morocco was the first and the only country to introduce in the United Nations the question of ""Ifni and the Spanish Sahara"". Thus  for many years  Morocco was the prime mover in all action aimed at the final decolonization of its Sahara.107.	Within the Territory  the National Movement was organized around various fronts and parties whose actions converged to the same end. Besides the liberation army  we had the Front de l'Unite  the Front pour la liberation du Sahara marocain  the Mouvement revolutionnaire des hommes bleus  the Front pour la liberation et l'unite  and the Parti de l'Union Nationale Sahraouie. Most of these movements have since 1966 reaffirmed  in the Fourth Committee of the General Assembly  their commitment to Morocco and explained the meaning of the struggle they were waging.108.	After the reincorporation of the Saharan provinces into the motherland  democratic life resumed in these provinces  as in the case of the other Moroccan provinces  and the populations were consulted four times  at the local and national level  on the basis of universal suffrage. There were the communal  provincial and professional elections in 1976  legislative elections in 1977 to appoint seven deputies to the national House to represent the Saharan provinces  a national referendum on 23 May 1980 for an initial amendment to the Constitution and  finally  a referendum on 30 May 1980 for a second amendment to the Constitution.109.	Thus  more than 95 per cent of the population of the Saharan provinces is actively involved in all aspects of the life of the nation  is going about its business peacefully and regards the question of its liberation and reincorporation into the mother country as a matter which has been settled once and for all.110.	In view of the fact that the territory is freely open to observation from outside  this situation gives the lie to the wrongful and tendentious claims whereby our adversaries have tried to mislead world public opinion.111.	The latest population census carried out in 1973 by Spain  which was at that time the administering Power  was performed in conditions of technical precision that no one can call into question. It establishes  in a document which has been registered with the United Nations  that the total population of the territory at that time was slightly in excess of 73 000 inhabitants.112.	The simple fact that approximately 68 000 inhabitants have at present been recorded in the towns and villages of Moroccan Sahara shows just how unworthy of credit are the false claimsâemanating from Algiersâregarding representation of the populations of the Sahara.113.	Morocco would like solemnly to recall that the decolonization of its Saharan provinces was carried out in conditions which met all legal and diplomatic standards and that its complete achievement of territorial integrity in accordance with international rules is an irreversible and definite fact.114.	Africa  which realized the dangers for the entire continent involved in the persistence of this artificial problem  at the time of the seventeenth ordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU  held at Freetown from 1 to 4 July 1980  instructed the ""Committee of Wise Men""âor Ad Hoc Committee of Heads of State and Government on Western Saharaâto carry out a mission of reconciliation among the parties to the conflict. Despite the reservations which were made by my country in connection with certain members of the Committee whose impartiality was by no means certain  Morocco took part in the Freetown meeting to demonstrate its desire for peace and its willingness to co-operate in an African context in order to restore to the area an atmosphere of harmony and good neighbourliness.115.	Furthermore  the presence at Freetown and the presentations before the ""Committee of Wise Men"" of the OAU of 10 organizations representing movements of resistance to Spanish colonialism and political entities from the Saharan provinces militating in favour of a return to the mother country  provided irrefutable proof that the peoples of the Sahraoui region had once and for all chosen to remain Moroccan. Those organizations also provided sincere testimony which definitely impressed the ""Committee of Wise Men""  who had before them all the necessary direct evidence which enabled them to get a better understanding and a fairer picture of the problem.116.	Despite the fact that our cause was just and our desire for peace unshakable  our national territory has been subjected to constant aggression from abroad which we are meeting with vigour and determination  as our duty dictates and in accordance with our right to self-defence.117.	Throughout its history the people of Morocco has always fought successfully  when it was necessary to preserve its faith  its national unity or its territorial integrity. Nevertheless Morocco  which has constantly cherished and sought peace has always invited its opponents to seek ways and means of restoring peace  stability and traditional good- neighbourly relations.118.	During the seventeenth ordinary session of the Assembly of the OAU at Freetown  the heads of African States decided to consider the problem of the prevailing tension in north-west Africa from a new angle  by placing it in its true context  that of a dispute between African States. Thus  they opted for a peaceful approach in accordance with the spirit of fraternity and solidarity advocated by the charter of the OAU. In paragraph 2 of the decision adopted by the Assembly at Freetown  the ""Committee of Wise Men"" is clearly requested  under its new mandate  ""to continue its work with a view to reconciling the parties to the conflict and seeking a peaceful and lasting solution thereto"".119.	Thus  the Conference decided to cease enclosing the members of the ""Committee of Wise Men"" or the parties involved in the strait jacket of references and narrow principles which up to now have only succeeded in paralysing the attempts at achieving peace. Throughout the world voices are being raised  calling for concrete measures to strengthen international security and to advocate the peaceful settlement of disputes between States.120.	We hope for the emergence of real international detente  and we deplore the fact that the problem of disarmament  which is intimately linked with international security and the survival of mankind  remains in a state of deadlock and that the encouraging results of the tenth special session of the General Assembly  devoted to disarmament have produced no positive effects on the unbridled ar e. The great Powers  which hold considerable stockpiles of nuclear weapons and which devote no less considerable financial resources to perfecting them and to making them more sophisticated  should not remain deaf to the appeals of mankind  which is so distressed by the threat represented by these stockpiles of weapons.121.	I should like to take this opportunity to express my strong disapproval of the biased campaign launched against certain developing countries  Iraq among others  which are trying to develop programmes for the peaceful use of nuclear energy. The developing countries in general are perfectly entitled to acquire nuclear technology  and to use it for peaceful purposes; they are also entitled to improve their knowledge and experience in this area.122.	Morocco noted with profound concern the failure of the second Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons recently held at Geneva as well as the lack of a consensus on the strengthening of the Treaty. This failure has further increased our anxiety about the fact that no progress has been made towards nuclear disarmament  which is the first step in general and complete disarmament. Morocco  which is working actively for disarmament at both the world and regional levels  will combine its efforts with those of all peaceful forces with the object of concluding international conventions prohibiting all weapons of mass destruction.123.	In the quest for detente and collective security  the non-aligned movement  which was able to resist the pressure exerted on it during the most crucial years of the cold war  can play a very important part if it remains faithful to the principles which have been the mainstay of its strength and is able to keep clear of blocs  to avoid allegiances  and to oppose the movement being monopolized by a minority of States wishing to take advantage of it. For its part  Morocco will spare no effort to restore to non-alignment its purity  its strength and its influence.124.	In a few weeks the second review session of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe will convene at Madrid. Morocco wishes member States all success in their efforts effectively to ensure security for their continent and to organize fruitful and sincere co-operation among themselves. But we cannot reasonably conceive of the consolidation of peace and security in Europe as long as the Mediterranean basin is beset by conflicts. This is why Morocco is greatly interested in being invited to this Conference to express its views on co-operation with Europe and its concern about the indivisible security of the whole of the region.125.	Because of its geographical position in the Mediterranean basin  the Kingdom of Morocco has special responsibilities with regard to the historic role of the Strait of Gibraltar. For that reason my country has  since the dawn of history  been a dynamic bulwark in the interplay of civilizations between Africa and Europe  which has made it possible for it to fill a decisive role in the links established between the Islamic and Christian civilizations. It is also for that reason that Morocco is determined to continue to shoulder its responsibilities in drawing the two continents closer together and in bringing about understanding among the communities of the entire region. This determination can be seen today in what my country is doing to establish a permanent link between the two shores of the Strait of Gibraltar  a link on which preliminary technical studies are under way with a view to its taking effect shortly. This gigantic project shows our faith in the establishment and consolidation of ties of peace  mutually beneficial development and fruitful co-operation among the peoples of the Mediterranean Sea  and particularly at the Arab-African- European level  for the benefit of all the peoples of the region.126.	The world economic situation has reached a level of deterioration whose consequences will spare neither developed nor developing countries. International economic leaders and institutions are studying with profound concern the upheavals of recent years. The developing countries are viewing with trepidation a number of phenomena which  born of ossified and ill-adapted structures  are beyond their control. The now chronic crises of indebtedness and unemployment  and the social upheavals and political unease which follow them  accentuate the vulnerability of the economy of the third world  are likely to mortgage its development  and also nullify the rare signs of progress achieved despite unforeseen circumstances.127.	The international economic conferences which have met in recent years have revealed the need to reorder the world economy by reducing the gaps between the poor and the wealthy and by eliminating economic injustices and inequities. This was the objective of the fifth session of UNCTAD and the Third General Conference of UNIDO. The third world took part in these various meetings in the hope of finding a working platform acceptable to all. But  here again  there was a lack of political will among the other participants who  concerned only with perpetuating their primacy  were reticent on the subject of the establishment of the new international economic order.128.	Now that we are on the threshold of the Third United Nations Development Decade  analyses and studies of the second strategy show that we fell far short of its goals. Moreover  the situation has grown increasingly worse for the developing countries  which feel more severely the effects of the international economic crisis: inflation  increased commodity and equipment prices  worsening of their balance of payments  and so forth.129.	Therefore  co-operation has become imperative for all  co-operation in a spirit of equity towards the developing countries which are entitled to demand measures which will make it possible for them to increase their share in world industrial production  the reform of the international monetary system  the setting up of foreign financial support for their development programmes  relief of their external debt  the adoption of new measures which will enable them to process their own raw materials  the abolition of the protectionist policies pursued by the developed countries and technology transfer adapted to the needs of developing countries and within their financial means.130.	Even more recently  the eleventh special session of the General Assembly  which was devoted to development  unfortunately ended its work in partial failure. The third world  which was entitled to expect a comforting degree of compromise  once again noted the hesitation expressedâ hesitation all the more intolerable because it comes from what is called the ""solidarity of the wealthy"". Nevertheless  Morocco attaches great importance to having the thirty- fifth session continue the work that was started at the last special session and would like to appeal to all Member States to reach general agreement on the development strategy  in order that preparations can be made for joint action which will eventually be crowned with success.131.	Africa  which became acutely aware of the importance of this question during the second extraordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU  held in the capital of Nigeria on 28 and 29 April 1980  will make its own contribution and welcomes the fact that the Plan of Action drawn up at Lagos is taken into account in the text of the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade  which will come into effect in January 1981. We hope also that in the course of this session the Assembly will be able to remove the final obstacles which still face us in the North- South dialogue  so that no later than next year global negotiations may be undertaken.132.	The Kingdom of Morocco is very satisfied with the results of the ninth session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  which this year gave us greater hope and  indeed  opened new prospects for success next year. Nevertheless  in the final stage of this arduous negotiating process  it is important that we consolidate what has already been achieved by making necessary improvements which  by taking account of the fundamental national interests of States and by effectively contributing to a more equitable distribution of world resources  will ensure that the future universal convention on the law of the sea will win the largest possible degree of adherence as quickly as possible. It is also important that  until all the institutions of the international sea-bed regime are set up  States should display wisdom and restraint and abide by the terms of the Declaration of Principles Governing the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor  and the Subsoil Thereof  beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction  which solemnly declares the international area of the sea-bed and ocean floor to be the common heritage of mankind.133.	To ensure international security  to work towards peace  to promote economic development  to help colonial peoples to become free: these are all lofty objectives to which the United Nations has been devoting itself faithfully and with perseverance. That lofty enterprise will be stopped if the international community does not devote itself with renewed vigour to promoting civil  political  economic  social and cultural human rights and if it does not ensure the strict implementation of the respective covenants.134.	We are living in a world which essentially needs confidence and security and which wishes to spare mankind from the evils of war and total destruction. Our world is crying out for economic self-sufficiency  but also for respect of human dignity.135.	Morocco is determined for its part to persevere in its efforts to create a social and political atmosphere  both internationally and regionally  propitious to the establishment of relations of constructive co-operation  which it hopes will represent a co-mingling of the genius of all peoples who are carried by the same impetus for construction and development  away from rancour and conflict.136.	We remain convinced in Morocco that respect by all for the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the strengthening of the Organization itself  so that it can become the ideal forum for fruitful dialogue among Member States  will help us in our common progress towards achieving the ideals to which mankind aspires."
"86",4432,"MDG",35,1980,"ï»¿The delegation of Madagascar is happy to join those which have addressed their congratulations and praise to Mr. Rudiger von Wechmar  for we are convinced that the choice judiciously made by the Assembly in entrusting the presidency to him was motivated  inter alia  by recognition of the signal contribution he has made to this Organization as well as by the role played by his country and his continent in international cooperation.189.	To his predecessor  Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim  we are ever happy and proud to repeat our thanks for the masterful way in which he presided  during the past year  over the successive sessions of the Assembly  always displaying the affability and effectiveness for which he is known.190.	The Democratic Republic of Madagascar warmly welcomes the admission of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  another island country  to our Organization. Since in many respects the problems facing us are similar  we assure the delegation of this new Member State of our complete fraternal cooperation.191.	Finally  it is appropriate that we express to the Secretary General the great appreciation of the revolutionary authorities of the Democratic Republic of Madagascar of the campaign he is carrying out in various international bodies for peace  the elimination of hotbeds of tensions and the peaceful solution of the problems facing us.192.	Twenty years have passed since the adoption of the historic Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  which  in the context of the promotion of world peace and cooperation  embodies the principle of the liberation of peoples who are henceforth to be the sole masters of their destinies.193.	We had hoped that this irreversible process would be manifested in the rapid and unconditional elimination of all manifestations of foreign subjugation  domination and exploitation  but in the enthusiasm of the moment we had not taken account of the deviousness of the colonial Powers  the appearance of new forms of colonialism and the insidious resurgence of practices which have enabled certain Powers to twist the provisions of the Declaration in order to justify the continuance of an illegal occupation and the denial of the rights of peoples.194.	Thus it is not surprising if  in spite of the positive results achieved  we tend to feel a certain disenchantment  not because the Organization has failed in its mission but because international ethics seem to be able too easily to accommodate themselves to faits accomplis and to failure to honour prior commitments.195.	Thus  in Namibia  we are still waiting for the just aspirations of more than 1 million Africans to be realized and for an end to the colonial presence of South Africa. The situation has been complicated by the request that SWAPO  the legitimate representative of an oppressed people  make the same concessions as South Africa  despite the fact that the latter abuses its aggressive military power and shelters behind its alleged position as the holder of a mandateâ which is now obsoleteâto set up an institutional framework favourable to the maintenance  in the Territory and the region  of its political and economic dominance  as well as that of its Western allies.196.	So we have every right to ask who gains by these dilatory tactics. Certainly it is not the Namibians! The elements of a political solution are well known  and because of those Powers who have shirked their responsibility of imposing them on South Africa  we must anticipate an intensification of the war in Namibia. The accession of Zimbabwe to independence shows that the time for coexistence has come; but we have yet to put the Namibians in a position to accept the form and substance of that coexistence.197.	A similar situation obtains in Western Sahara. The economic and other interests of the Western Powers in northwest Africa should have led them to exercise pressure on Morocco bilaterally or multilaterally in order to lead it to the negotiating table and to peace  and so that the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic may take its rightful place at both the regional and the international level.198.	This pressure  together with the conciliation efforts of the OAU  might have made Morocco abandon its intransigence and its claimsâwhich have been rejected by the Sahraoui people itselfâand begin a process inspired by respect for the rights of peoples and the safeguarding of peace. Is it not significant that the OAU  faithful to the spirit of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  has many times advocated a ceasefire and the holding of a referendum  with which the United Nations could be associated?199.	As an international community  must we continue to accept the manoeuvres of a country that has replaced by force the former colonial Power and  because of our passive attitude  delay the application of a solution consonant with the interests of the Sahraoui people and  in the final analysis  of the peoples of the region? Here  as in Namibia  any imposed solution based on false premises is doomed to failure  because it is for the Sahraoui people to decide in complete independence  and without any pressure  the nature of its relations on the sub regional level.200.	The adoption of the Declaration contained in resolution 1514 (XV) also marked a new approach to the concept of human rights and the rights of peoples  and it is normal that we should base ourselves on this when we deal with the question of apartheid  in a perspective which emphasizes the necessary political liberation of African man  determined to decide his own economic and moral destiny.201.	It is pointless  we think  to deny the fact that apartheid has always been one of the devices used by colonial domination to justify or maintain a system of morals that we have denounced for its exclusivity. It is also pointless to try to consider apartheid as an epiphenomenon that can be reabsorbed by reformist measures. The serious incidents which have taken place in South Africa in recent months  the worsening tension and the persistence of demands by the majority and the exploited minorities show quite clearly that the race struggle is over and that we are now seeing the growing awareness of an entire people that has risen up against imperialist domination and capitalist exploitation and that is bound together by decades of oppression and discrimination.202.	The solution no longer merely includes the granting of civil  political  cultural  economic and social rights to the non-white South Africans  but calls for the advent of a genuine majority Government  in which other sectors of the people will be fully represented. It is in this sense that we say that the settlement of the apartheid question is also tied up with the problem of decolonization.203.	The awakening of peoples  supported by the action of the United Nations and the solidarity of progressive and socialist forces in the world  has contributed to the breakup and the disappearance of colonial empires  while our Organization is gradually moving towards universality in accordance with its vocation.204.	Can we say  however  that we have succeeded in establishing a new order which guarantees respect for the independence  sovereignty and rights of all peoples? To what extent have we responded to the aspirations of States  in particular the most vulnerable of them  by helping them to solve their problems in a climate of security and peace  sheltered from any interference and external constraint?205.	Since the 1960s  the international community seems to have entered upon a long phase of transition marked by crises of adaptation which give rise to tension  uncertainty and disarray  and  while the quest for a more stable  more just and more balanced system remains our primary concern  we must nevertheless recognize that the demands for the necessary changes in relations of force are not accepted by the wealthy and the most powerful.206.	The eleventh special session of the General Assembly  which has just taken place  provided us with an illustration of this phenomenon in the field of international economic relations. We are not unduly concerned by the fact that this opportunity to negotiate did not achieve the results hoped for  or that the normal functioning of our institutions was sacrificed to the search for consensus at any price. What is more disquieting for us is that  by a skilful politicization of procedural questions  certain people managed to side-track the debates in order once again to put back the deadlines and conceal their refusal to undertake precise commitments to solidarity and cooperation in the economic field.207.	Politically it has become a truism to say that no State can enjoy absolute security. The peace in which we live has already been disturbed in many places and is essentially precarious  and authoritative voices have warned the international community of the dangers that threaten it. But  beyond the warnings  action is indispensable and it is urgent for us to set in motion the means available to us within the framework of the United Nations significantly to improve  if we cannot radically change  the prevailing situation in the military field and in the fields of security and interstate relations.208.	Naturally  priority  should be given to halting and reversing the arms race  for which the great Powers and the superpowers are largely responsible  but in which an ever-growing number of countries are taking part. This year it will devour considerable resources  of the order of $500 billion.209.	Together with this unprecedented wastage  and while we see no real progress in nuclear or conventional disarmament  new threats are appearing. We would cite two: first  the elaboration of doctrines which extend on a global level the concept and the system of defence of some countries in the northern hemisphere and make nuclear war plausible and imaginable; secondly  the risk of the collapse of the legal and political barriers to the proliferation of nuclear weapons.210.	In the face of this state of affairs  we wonder what other consequences will ensue from the suspension of the negotiations on the limitation of strategic arms and the difficulties encountered in applying the Programme of Action  adopted by consensus and contained in the Final Document of the tenth special session.211.	The problems of disarmament are complicated because in the field of security  which  like peace  is indivisible  the States Members are divided. There are two main groups here: one consists of the nonaligned countries and a few neutral countries  which have put their faith in the United Nations system  in spite of its imperfections and its limitations  for the defence of their security; the other consists of the most powerful countries  which have decided to ensure their own security outside the United Nations by means of military alliances or defence pacts.212.	In some specific cases  this latter attitude has deteriorated into one of promoting imperialist power policies and has led certain countries to designate unilaterally so-called areas of vital interest  which are subject to the threat of intervention by forces that are specially trained and equipped for the purpose. The outcome of that policy is that some countries of the third world are dragged into the dangerous game of military alliances  to the detriment of their nonalignment.213.	All these factors are reflected in practice by differences in approach and divergences which have a negative effect on the common initiatives at the level of the world Organization  whether it is a question of settling particular crises  the number and gravity of which never cease to grow  or of defending the integrity of the principles of the Charter  which  it is said  are valid in all places and at all times  but which events have obliged us to make explicit or to reaffirm only too often.214.	How  in these conditions  can we conceive of progress towards a new world order that would ensure the sovereign equality of States and put an end to all kinds of diktats and interference of any kind? How can we achieve this  if not by once more exhorting all States to observe more scrupulously the purposes and principles of the Charter? The nonaligned countries  individually and collectively  have never failed to show the way here.215.	This year again  they are considering a draft declaration on the principle of non-intervention and non-interference in international relations. We support that draft  as in the past we supported the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security and the declaration concerning the strengthening of the role of the United Nations.216.	Among the other initiatives taken by the nonaligned movement  there is one that is of particular interest to us  to the extent that the President of the Democratic Republic of Madagascar  Mr. Didier Ratsiraka  proposed  on 15 June 1980  on the fifth anniversary of the Malagasy socialist revolution  that it be taken up at a summit conference to be held in Antananarivo towards the end of 1981 or the beginning of 1982. I am talking about the establishment  or rather the reestablishment  of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace.217.	The devotion that we have unswervingly shown for the principles likely to preserve peace and security  our geopolitical position as well as our determination to practice towards our neighbours and our more distant partners and interlocutors a policy of open-mindedness in all directions and our awareness of the importance of the Indian Ocean to international communications  result in a situation in which we cannot resign ourselves to the installation of a zone of confrontation in our region to the detriment of the permanent interests of all the parties concerned.218.	Another element that would enable us better to appreciate the situation is the imminent conclusion of the Convention on the law of the sea after the recent work of the ninth session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  held at Geneva  and we are glad to welcome the positive results achieved. That Convention will open new prospects for the peaceful uses of the oceans for scientific research and the exploration and exploitation of marine resources and the seabed  and it is important that all those activities be placed under an effective security regime. If such a regime is not specifically provided for by the Convention  it could be dealt with regionally within the framework of the establishment of zones of peace.219.	Finally  everyone is aware  particularly in this crucial period  of the fact that the Indian Ocean is a link between the various hotbeds of tension which quite rightly are of concern to the international community. I am referring to the situation in southern Africa  the Horn of Africa  the Middle East  Southwest Asia and even in Southeast Asia  not forgetting the case of Diego Garcia and of the Malagasy islands of Glorieuses  Juan de Nova  Europa and Bassas da India  whose return to the countries to which they belong has been rightly demanded.220.	The latent or open crises affecting the sub region of the Indian Ocean are potentially explosive and they imply  to varying degrees and according to each case  the transgression of principles which are dear to us  such as respect for the rights of peoples  the prohibition of racial discrimination  respect for the sovereignty of States and their territorial integrity  the peaceful settlement of disputes  non-interference and non-intervention  and the duty of cooperation among States.221.	The fact that the above problems remain unsolved prevents implementation of the concept of the zone of peace  particularly since it offers the great Powers a permanent temptation to intervene and to justify their military presence in the Indian Ocean.222.	Conversely  the establishment of a zone of peace would eliminate the factors of insecurity which prevail in the region and would therefore promote the restoration of peace.223.	It is in the light of all these considerations that we should like briefly to explain our position on the various crisis situations within the Indian Ocean area before mentioning the problems posed by the military presence of the great Powers in that zone.224.	I shall not revert to the situation in southern Africa except to denounce the policy of aggression  threats and intimidation of the apartheid regime against neighbouring States in the north  while it strengthens its military apparatus in order to put an end to the growing number of internal disputes. The arms embargo has not affected that regime  which is treated as a de facto ally of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO]  with which it so ably bargains in exchange for its cooperation and the benefits of its strategic position.225.	With respect to the Horn of Africa  the Democratic Republic of Madagascar has always sought to understand the position of the parties concerned. It is prepared to continue to offer its mediation  because the relinquishing of apparently irreconcilable positions can be facilitated by negotiation and not by confrontation  as has been shown by the recent conclusion of the Good Offices Committee of the OAU. We are convinced that the recognition of specific regional interests and the determination of the two countries to remain independent  socialist and nonaligned will open prospects that will enable the two peoples to live in harmony and to achieve their aspirations for progress and greater welfare.226.	Is it surprising that peace and stability in the Middle East have not yet been restored 18 months after the conclusion of the Treaty between Israel and Egypt?  The proof is now quite obvious that there is no viable alternative to the solutions proposed by the United Nations  which would fully recognize the rights of the Palestinian people  in particular those on the establishment of its own independent State. That truth must be recognized notwithstanding Israel's determination  in collusion with the imperialist circles  to hold the Palestinian people in a state of subjugation.227.	Meanwhile  the situation in that region is getting very much worse  which does not help the Palestinian cause or that of the peoples of the region  while the conflict between Iraq and Iran has assumed proportions which can only be of deep concern to the international community. The consequences of the escalation of those armed activities are too clear for the countries in the region not to be alarmed  and the Democratic Republic of Madagascar joins with those that have appealed to the two parties to consider all the courses of action available to them in settling their dispute in accordance with the principles of the Charter and those of nonalignment.228.	Still within the context of the area around the Indian Ocean  we should like to repeat our position regarding the so-called Afghanistan affair  which some people wish to impose as a prior condition to any substantive discussion of the establishment of a zone of peace in our region. In passing  I should say that that argument is rather specious and that it could be quite easily used against those who have adduced it  reminding them that in logic there is another acceptable step which goes from the general to the particular.229.	We are told that a political solution is essential  and we would agree with that view. But then why do they not include in that solution the rights of a revolutionary people  the validity of treaties of alliance  the proposals made by the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan in its declaration of 15 May 1980  the seventh clause of which quite rightly deals with the military and political activities carried out in the region of the Indian Ocean and the Gulf by States that come from outside the area? Truth cannot be one-sided and we would do better to submit the programme for a political settlement submitted by the Afghan Government to an objective examination rather than to engage in a debate based on unsound premises  which in itself amounts to interference in the internal affairs of a Member State and exposes the Organization to criticism which it cannot easily refute in view of its past silence in other cases of flagrant intervention in other continents.230.	With respect to the problem of Kampuchea  so long as the nonaligned movement has not expressed its position  our position will be the same as the one we adopted at the last session.231.	But I would remind members that Kampuchea is a State Member of this Organization  a sovereign and independent State. The people chose a regime which once and for all liberated them from genocide. It hardly behoves us to question that choice and those methods in the name of a so-called democratic morality  or to advocate what amounts to trusteeship of the Kampuchean nation through an international conference  with the mandate of trying to find an overall political settlement. In this respect  what we have said about a search for a solution to the Afghan problem remains valid.232.	In the Far East  a region remote from ours  it is true  but of interest to us because the tensions and manifestations of imperialist power policies have moved westward and the same causes are producing the same effects  we are witnessing a persistent and abnormal division of the Korean peninsula. And it is partly thinking about what could happen to our countries in case of a confrontation of this kind that we call for fulfilment of the conditions for a lasting peace in Korea and  therefore  in Asia  by promoting that country's independent reunification  putting an end to the interference and intervention by an external Power  eliminating foreign military bases and withdrawing foreign troops.233.	I cannot close my remarks on this subject without mentioning the Malagasy islands of the Indian Ocean  which will be the subject of a subsequent debate in the Special Political Committee  as decided by this Assembly. At this stage I would confine myself to recalling that those islands are situated in a so-called strategic zone the control of which has a direct impact on Madagascar's military  political and economic security. But what assurances have we from the present administering Power that those islands will not be used for purposes incompatible with the maintenance of national and regional security and  therefore  at variance with the principles and purposes of the creation of a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean? This is one of the reasons  among many others  we have evoked in support of our call for retrocession.234.	What relationship is there then between the various crises of which we have just spoken and the military situation in the Indian Ocean?235.	In their anxiety to control what they call the ""uncontrolled upheavals in the third world""  which they regard as threats to their vital interests  and which they are trying to resolve to their advantage  certain great Powers have used these situations to justify stationing or maintaining in the Indian Ocean considerable military forces enabling them  so they say  to confront any eventuality.236.	Do those forces have broader missions in the context of the military confrontation between the two blocs? Great care is taken not to say so  even if the presence of strategic nuclear arms gives us every reason to believe it. A dangerous situation still exists in the Indian Ocean  which prompted the President of my country to address a message on 22 June 1980 to the United Nations Secretary General in which he stated  inter alia:""We realize that each State is concerned to protect its own interests  but we cannot accept the idea that this should be at the expense of ours. We recognize that there may be conflicts of interest between certain nations  but we cannot tolerate the creation of a balance of terror in our area as a result of such conflicts. On the pretext of guaranteeing the security of their petroleum supplies  the industrialized countries are currently engaging in a power contest in the Indian Ocean and are posing very serious threats to our security  if not indeed to our very existence  even though we ourselves have provided neither the cause nor the justification for such a formidable deployment of opposing forces. It is evident that all the resolutions adopted by the United Nations  the movement of non-aligned countries and the Organization of African Unity have failed to halt this escalation  for each Power is continuing to increase its presence in the Indian Ocean or is preparing to do so. All these trends are creating an increasingly dangerous situation which makes us fear a conflagration fatal to all the littoral countries  whose voices  interests and protests have been systematically ignored."" 237.	The peoples of the region are uneasy at seeing the perpetuation of a situation which cannot be ignored without the risk of its deteriorating  and the implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace is the best way of averting that possibility. The Democratic Republic of Madagascar is gratified at the fact that in the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean all nuclear Powers  the main maritime users and the States of the region were able to study together ways and means of harmonizing their views.â238.	We are encouraged by the fact that during preliminary discussions no delegation tried to question the basic political consideration underlying the concept of a zone of peace.239.	My country has no doubt  therefore  that there is an area of agreement among all the interested parties and that it is possible to explore and to extend that area  as long as the great Powers concerned abide by the principle of the sovereign equality of States and agree to negotiate without selectivity all of the principles for a zone of peace.240.	In that regard  the President of the Democratic Republic of Madagascar  in the same message I have just quoted in part  stressed that:""... from the outset... we will forfeit all effectiveness in advance if we do not focus the discussions on the following basic points:""1. The guaranteed freedom and security of merchant shipping  and particularly tankers  in this part of the world.""2. The progressive and controlled reduction of the forces and armaments deployed in the Indian Ocean.""3. The dismantling of all foreign military bases established on the territory or in the territorial waters of the littoral countries.""4. The implementation of all measures or procedures which would facilitate the establishment of a genuine  totally demilitarized and  above all  denuclearised zone of peace in the Indian Ocean.""16241.	It is appropriate here that we should renew our support for the Conference on the Indian Ocean  to be convened under the auspices of the United Nations at Colombo in 1981. That Conference will be entrusted with achieving the necessary consensus on the various implications of resolution 2832 (XXVI) and facilitating its implementation.242.	The success of that Conference  for which my delegation will spare no effort  will certainly prompt the parties concerned  during the Antananarivo summit  convened at the initiative of my President  to expand already agreed principles and to define the nature of the commitments that will govern their mutual relations.243.	If some snag should unfortunately prevent the emergence of a consensus at the Colombo talks  the difficulties that arise on that occasion and the work already accomplished under United Nations auspices would help the participants in the Antananarivo summit to spell out the necessary conditions for the drafting of an international convention applicable to all parties concerned and to be implemented by them.244.	Whatever the case  the two conferences at Colombo and Antananarivo are not mutually exclusive and one would sincerely hope that their work will be complementary. In this respect  I should like to impart to the General Assembly the contents of the message which my President has sent today to the Secretary General concerning both the situation in the Indian Ocean and the Iran Iraq conflict. It says in part:""Without pretending to have foretold the future  we must observe that the prevailing situation of overt militarization and the frenzied construction of military bases in the zone and the armed conflict between Iraq and Iran unfortunately confirm our analysis and our fears. More than ever before this situation justifies the convening of the Sri Lanka conference on the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace and the urgent necessity of holding the Antananarivo summit conference.""245.	We have just expressed to this Assembly our concerns relating to the maintenance and the strengthening of peace in our region and the analysis of this situation which we have made leads us to affirm that the establishment of a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean under a contractual legal regime is an essential element of global peace that would also be based on the interdependence of different forms of security  be they military  political or economic.246.	This naturally leads us to support the idea that recourse to a system of collective security  which would be original and without military alliances  is the sole means of preserving the rights of the medium and small Powers in the face of the more complex demands of the great Powers. It would have been easy for us simply to rely on the Security Council  as was done at the time of the conclusion of the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. But the considerable changes in the strategic and economic world environments  aggravated by the functional shortcomings of the Security Council  have led us to consider other means of assuring our security.247.	It would be tempting to give to the term ""collective security"" a new definition  which we shall not do at this stage; but it is a fact that the step which we envisage for the Indian Ocean  like that which the Latin American countries advocated for the elaboration and the conclusion of the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America rests upon the concerted affirmation of a group of directly or indirectly concerned nations of their willingness to harmonize the promotion and the defence of their interests in the name of a peace based on an equal and guaranteed security  as well as on respect for international law and practice.248.	We do not reject the principles of the Charter; but as far as we are concerned  in the case of the Indian Ocean and in other cases  the cooperation which recognizes the responsibilities and interests of all parties is fundamental if we wish to eliminate all risks of confrontation and conflagration. It goes without saying that the mutual acceptance of respective interests permits of no grading of such interests  but presupposes on the contrary their integration in the search for the common good which some among us call the new international order.249.	That search  supported by a number of political  diplomatic and parliamentary moves is concerned  however paradoxical this may seem  with the maintenance of peace as we  Members of this Organization  understand it; for this puts to the test our capacity and our willingness to have recourse to our collective responsibility without paralysing effects  to ensure the advent of an era of lasting peace  justice and social progress."
"87",4470,"MDV",35,1980,"ï»¿Allow me to extend to Ambassador von Wechmar my warm felicitations and those of the delegation of the Republic of Maldives on his election as President of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. We are confident that his vast experience  skill and personal wisdom will guide our deliberations to a fruitful and constructive conclusion.290.	I should like to take this opportunity to express my deep appreciation to his predecessor  Ambassador Salim Ahmed Salim of the United Republic of Tanzania  for his important contribution to the work of this Assembly during the past year. We shall certainly remember for a long time his personal qualities of dedication and impartiality. I sincerely wish him continued success.291.	I also recognize with gratitude and profound appreciation the dedicated efforts of the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  and my delegation wishes to compliment him on his devotion and on the exemplary manner in which he discharges the responsibilities of his high office as progressively greater  more urgent  more complex and more delicate international issues confront this Assembly  in which 154 independent nations are represented.292.	We are happy to welcome Zimbabwe and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to the United Nations as new Members. We are particularly delighted to observe in this the growth of this world Organization towards the attainment of its ultimate objective of universality of membership and equality among nations  big or small  powerful or weak  thus fulfilling the fundamental principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.293.	We are meeting at a time of increasing tension and anxiety. The problems and challenges which face us today are so pressing that we need more than ever before shared responsibility and a high level of political will. The imbalances in the state of affairs which we are experiencing today are leading the world to an intolerable situation  and unless we all sincerely join hands today to eliminate the causes  without the prejudices of nationalism and protectionism  future generations of mankind will have no choice but to suffer the consequences of our failure.294.	We do not lack the wisdom to give effect to the principles of peace  justice and equality. All these and other noble principles that have evolved in the human mind from man's sufferings and experiences are clearly inscribed in the Charter of this great Organization. It is our solemn duty to uphold these principles and to fulfil our commitments to our peoples.295.	Peoples and nations today insist on the right to be heard and to take an active part in shaping world developments  politically and economically. Therefore we must not allow the politics of strength to dominate our work  or the policies of suppression to return within our ranks. The achievements of freedom  peace and equality which we have been able to foster together must be protected and further enhanced.296.	It is the dream of every one of us to live in a world free from wars and conflicts and free from poverty  hunger and disease. However  the events of today seem to take us far back to an era of anxiety and uncertainty. The armed conflicts between countries  as well as the subversive trend of armed interventions  are not only undermining international peace and stability but also give rise to the possibility of devastating consequences  especially in view of the proliferation of nuclear technology and the acquisition by States of destructive weapons.297.	On the other hand  the armament race is bound to continue unless the world community is able to enforce effective measures for disarmament. At the same time  he who is oppressed has no choice but to fight back for his cause as long as the aggressor is being supported and comforted by the strong and the powerful.298.	The questions of world peace  disarmament  the prevention of aggression by one State against another  the elimination of intervention in the internal affairs of one State by another and the settlement of international conflicts by peaceful means  cannot be solved without the political will of the super-Powers. The sooner they realize that and act effectively towards that end on the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations  the safer it will be for mankind.299.	No longer shall we tolerate any form of colonialism or imperialism. Nor shall we condone any discrimination on the basis of colour  race or creed. We do not look with any degree of favour on the settlement of any problem on the basis of the survival of the strongest. It is on those principles that we hope solutions will be found by this great Organization.300.	The question of the Middle East still remains unsolved  with Israeli aggression continuing against the Arab territories and peoples. The denial of the rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination on their own land will impede the realization of a just and lasting solution of the issue. Israel's recent unilateral decision illegally to annex the City of Jerusalem to its territory has added serious dimensions to the problem.301.	My delegation wishes to emphasize once again its support for the Palestinian people in its struggle for self- determination and freedom. No one can now deny that the Palestinian question is at the core of the Middle East crisis and that without the equal participation of the Palestinian people  represented by their legitimate representative  the PLO  there can be no just and lasting solution of the crisis. We shall also continue to support the efforts of this Organization to end the Israeli aggression on the Arab territories  including Jerusalem.302.	My delegation views with anxiety the situation in the region of South-East Asia and the Indian Ocean. Continuation of the rivalry between super-Powers in the region bears the threat of escalation into conflicts of wider dimensions. We should like to emphasize that an urgent and sincere search for grounds for a political compromise is needed. In that context  we hope that the major military Powers will co-operate with the countries of the region in easing tensions as well as in the solution of the existing problem .Among those tense issues we should like to make special reference to those of Kampuchea and Afghanistan. It is our view that the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of countries should be upheld  even when moral  national or other justifications may tempt some of us to violate it. We remain convinced that international peace can be preserved only when the people of every country have the unimpaired freedom to decide their own destiny.303.	The key to the solution of the problems in the region  we believe  is the removal of the elements of intervention  including the withdrawal of foreign troops and the abandonment of schemes to install and strengthen foreign military bases. Though we realize the complexity of the current situation  we sincerely hope that the countries of the region and the other major Powers will continue their dialogue with a view to making the region peaceful and free from nuclear weapons and conflicts by proxy.304.	We are disappointed to find the problem of apartheid and racial discrimination still among the most pressing issues of the world. That is a problem which has taken us too long to solve  again because there has not been the collective will amongst us to eliminate it. However  with the independence of Zimbabwe and the glimmer of freedom spreading down towards the south  along with the determination of the heroic people of Africa  we hope that that age-old problem will soon be eliminated. We  for our part  will continue to support the people of South West Africa under the leadership of SWAPO  in their struggle for self- determination  freedom and independence for Namibia.305.	I come now to the international economic situation  which  during the past few years  has been moving in a direction such as to make all of us seriously think about the future  our children and the generations to come. The growing gap between the developing and developed countries is clear evidence of an impending catastrophe of mass suffering. The awareness of the dangers by the international community has prompted us to start our search for a new international economic order based on justice  equality  interdependence and mutual respect. It has become obvious that the existing system of privileges is the source of many disruptions in the world economy and that the new realities of human existence  if not human prosperity  demand that we attempt a major change.306.	We therefore attach special importance to the recently concluded session of the General Assembly devoted to the problem of economic development. Although the session did not adopt a decision on the launching of global negotiations  owing to the absence of political will on the part of some of the developed countries  we are happy to mark our deliberations there as being a further step towards the fulfilment of the aspirations of the peoples of the world. We hope that during this regular session this Organization will be able successfully to complete what we had started and to add new needs and perspectives to this important issue.307.	Despite the many disappointing developments across the world political and economic spectrum  my country remains consistent in its support for the work of this Organization and as firmly as ever committed to the principles enshrined in its Charter. We shall extend our fullest support and co-operation to any efforts which will strengthen the role of the United Nations in maintaining peace in the world  restoring the rights of peoples and upholding the values of human rights  justice and equality."
"88",4516,"MEX",35,1980,"ï»¿I should like first of all to extend my sincerest congratulations to the President of the General Assembly on his election to this important post. The Permanent Representative to the United Nations of a great country  the Federal Republic of Germany  which with Mexico maintains very close relations of friendship and fruitful cooperation  Mr. von Wechmar has on the basis of his personal qualifications gained the admiration and the respect of all.2.	I also wish to greet the President of the thirty-fourth session  Mr. Salim Salim  whom I congratulate on his brilliant performance not only at the preceding session of the Assembly but also during the special sessions that were convened during his term of office.3.	On the occasion of its recent admission to membership of the Organization  we wish to welcome the young Republic of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  with which we are linked geographically by bonds which are destined to become even stronger in the future.4.	Several weeks ago  at the eleventh special session  we expressed our delight at the admission of Zimbabwe to membership of the Organization.5.	We cannot at this time fail to refer to the conflict between Iraq and Iran  which is causing us the greatest anxiety. The United Nations  and the Security Council  must attempt forthwith to find a just solution. That is why Norway and Mexico have requested a formal meeting of the Security Council to allow it to exercise the authority vested in it under the Charter. In so doing  we believe that we have reflected the wish of the international community as a whole and  at the same time  fulfilled our responsibility as Members of the Organization.6.	We are  of course  aware of the attempts at mediation being undertaken in other forums and we wish them every success; but that does not absolve the Security Council from discharging its primary duty of maintaining peace.7.	The international situation has worsened considerably in the past year and a half. New dangerous international hotbeds of tension have appeared  threatening peace in the Persian Gulf  Afghanistan  Central America and the Caribbean  the Middle East  Southeast Asia and even Europe  where the situation had been stable for several years. It has so far been possible to prevent internal crises from degenerating into international conflicts or the latter from becoming generalized  even though all these crises are fraught with serious dangers.8.	The most serious aspect of this situation is that it has led to a new climate of tension and antagonism and of attitudes that can be termed hostile and even belligerent. This new climate has brought about not only a halt to  but also a clear reversal of the process of detente  which had steadily gained strength during the last two decades.9.	Relations among European countries had become stable  especially since the normalization of relations between the Federal Republic of Germany  on the one hand  and the German Democratic Republic and the other countries of Eastern Europe  on the other  so much so that active and fruitful cooperation in all areas had been initiated in that region  one which only a few years earlier had been the most dangerous centre of tension. It would seem that an objective basis for peace  reconciliation and security had been established  one which was specifically embodied in the Helsinki Final Act ' which led to prospects of broader cooperation and even a reversal in the stockpiling of weapons in Central Europe.10. Relations between the superpowers  never friendly  had nevertheless reached a level which made it possible for them to agree either specifically or tacitly on a number of issues in different fields  including the political and military; that had a decisive stabilizing effect throughout the world. Mankind was very hopeful when the SALT II Treaty  was signed  an agreement which  in spite of its limitations  was perhaps for the first time in history a serious attempt to put an end to the senseless and continuous arms escalation. That agreement meant  above all  that Governments had finally come to realize what the people already knew  that is  that the increase and improvement of weapons by one party irrevocably led to an escalation by another and that that  far from strengthening the real security of anyone  actually weakened it. This new conviction was to be the basis for the SALT III negotiations  to be held for the purpose of finally undertaking a process of gradual and balanced arms reduction. Peace  fragile and precarious in the 1950s  seemed to become ever stronger.11. Today  everything has changed. Suddenly  and withoutany apparent motive  the difficult achievements of thelast 20 years seem to be fading away. The dialogue hasstopped or has assumed harder tones. The military balancein Central Europe is being questioned  with the emplacementof nuclear weapons in that region. The future of theSALT 11 Treaty is undecided. Even worse. the clearly absurdand dangerous thesis is advanced that there can be victors ina nuclear conflict. I believe that if a nuclear war were tooccur  the survivors would envy the fate of the dead.12. The major Powers demand respect for their spheres ofinfluence as if that were a right  and they even invade them forgetting that the inhabitants of those areas are the onlyones who have the right to self-determination and thatgeographic proximity does not create any rights or confer onothers a mandate to defend the areas from real or imaginarydangers. and particularly not the right to intervene in thesettlement of their domestic problems.13. The revolutionary struggles of peoples to shed dictatorialyokes and to choose an internal system suited to theiraspirations are viewed and appraised in the context of aglobal ideological and political struggle which distorts thenatural expression of the rational forces at play  through theassistance which the major Powers give to the faction whichcomes the closest to their global political and strategic interests.This has taken place in all continents but  of course Mexico is particularly concerned when it takes place inCentral America and the Caribbean.14. The struggle of some peoples of Central America andthe Caribbean to free themselves from tyrannies or tochange obsolete economic and social structures has contributedto bringing about a new political situation in that area to which not all countries interested in the area have been "" able to adjust.15. Mexico has followed these developments closely withconcern  but also with optimism: with concern because theincrease of internal tensions in that part of the world cannotbut affect us; with optimism because there are real prospectswhich enable us to think that such tensions can be limitedand that there could be. a positive outcome if the majorPowers decided not to distort the natural historical process.16. The policy of the Government of Mexico ill that areahas precisely been aimed at contributing to the reduction oftension. As a guide to our action  we have taken the followingconsiderations into account: first  recognition that thenew situation obtaining in' the area is the result of thelegitimate struggle of peoples to change archaic and anachronisticstructures of power and domination; secondly defence of the right of peoples to choose the form of political  economic and social organization best suited to their aspirations; thirdly  full respect for the principle of non-interference:and  fourthly  open dialogue with all countriesof the area. These struggles of peoples cannot be consideredas part of an ideological or political competition among thesuperpowers. Further still  the military presence of thosePowers in the region  in whatever form  merely contributesto increasing tension.17. This approach has enabled Mexico to maintain anddevelop close relations with all the peoples of Central Americaand the Caribbean  in particular with those which havebeen or could be subjected to a certain degree of isolation.The constant dialogue with those countries  at the veryhighest level  despite the obvious differences between thepolitical  economic and social systems of Mexico and someof theirs  has led to a better understanding based on mutualtrust and respect. In brief  we understand the political processunder way  we respect it and we have therefore adjustedto the new situation which obtains in the region.18.  The Government of Mexico is hopeful about indicationsthat other countries also are seeking formulas alongthose lines. We can only express our hope that thoseformulas which reveal statesmanlike vision  as in the caseof the present assistance of the Government of the UnitedStates to the Government of National Reconstruction ofNicaragua or the wise decision not to intervene militarily atthe time Somoza was overthrown may extend to otherparts of the region. What happened in Nicaragua is the bestproof of the fact that if a people is allowed to decide its ownfate without outside interference from one side or another the solution it will find will be the best one not only for it butfor the international community as a whole.19. In the economic field Mexico has tried to help in thesolution of the serious problems which are faced by countriesof the area. The agreement on oil supplies and financialfacilities recently signed by President Jose Lopez Portillo ofMexico and President Luis Herrera Campins of Venezuela ispart of the broader effort at a worldwide rationalization ofenergy which was proposed by the President of Mexico. Webelieve that this type of concrete action  however limited andmodest  may provide real solutions and may reduce thepossibilities of confrontation and conflict which exist in thatregion.20. A new geopolitical concept has emerged which although inadmissible and spurious  is being put forward asthe most natural thing in the world: not only are there zonesof influence near the great Powers that are subjected to theirprotection  but there is beginning to be talk now of ""zonesof vital interest""  perhaps thousands of kilometres away  butover which there is also a claim to exercise the right ofprotection.21. All these forms of domination and subjugation whichhave appeared recently not only are contrary to the internationalorder established by the Charter but are obsolete  andthat is their worst defect. Contemporary internationalsociety must find standards and formulas that may governrelations among all States  whether small  medium sized orlarge  wealthy or poor  belonging to the West or to the East and these must be in keeping with the conditions and aspirationsof present international society; no attempt should be made to revive solutions which were valid in the nineteenth century and at the turn of the century. History does notrepeat itself.22. The causes of this strange and sudden deterioration ofthe international situation are not well understood  nor canits effects be foreseen. Perhaps we still lack the necessaryhistorical perspective; but there is no doubt that a newclimate of cold war now exists  with all the dangers it entails.23. Positive events have also occurred in recent times. Thetrend towards peace and detente  which was clearly manifestin the 1960s and the 1970s  is too powerful and too deep; itcoincides with the interests of the peoples to such an extentthat it is impossible to destroy through errors of judgementor circumstantial occurrences or even through resistance which we hope is transitory  to changes in the status quo ininternational economic relations.   24.	The peoples' awareness has grown in recent years. Groups of countries  and even countries individually  are today convinced that the interests of their regional groups  and even their own national interests  do not always coincide with those of the major political and military blocs they belong to. This identification of autonomous and specific interests has largely led to a true multi polarity of world power. This was dearly seen this past year in Western Europe  Eastern Europe  Latin America  Africa and Asia. The diversification of independent political attitudes is something that we consider to be a healthy and positive phenomenon. As President Lopez Portillo recently stated  Mexico wishes to have a worthy place in the world; it wishes to stand in the world and not to have a seat in a sphere of influence. It seems to me that this attitude  in addition to being intrinsically valid for every country  in the final analysis fosters regional and world peace.25.	It is also fair to recognize that in this recent period  in spite of manifest hostility  statesmen of the two major Powers have shown restraint and prudence  in the face of the provocations and temptations that have arisen. While some serious problems dividing the two superpowers are still outstanding  we think that  precisely as a contribution to their possible solution  it would be useful and desirable for the two leaders to meet early next year. The United Nations should encourage and facilitate such a meeting  in keeping with its best traditions  in order to signify and symbolize the interest of all mankind in the reduction of international tension. Along the same lines  I would express best wishes for the outcome of the second review session of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe  to be held at Madrid  for the purpose of reducing international tension.26.	I believe that everyone recognizes the important role that some nonaligned countries have been playing since the end of the 1950s. They encouraged and facilitated the dialogue between the two blocs  in the middle of a cold war  and they truly built bridges between them. Later on  as detente gained ground between the West and the East and dialogue was restored  the main effort of the nonaligned countries focused on the process of decolonization and on trying to improve the economic situation of countries struggling for their full development.27.	Today  faced with a re-emergence of the cold war  an effort is required similar to the initiatives those countries and their distinguished leaders took 20 years ago; but it will be necessary to adapt these efforts to the new circumstances of contemporary international society  particularly with regard to the relative degree of polycentrism which is its characteristic. Today some countries  irrespective of the political or regional groups they may belong to  irrespective of their ideologies and of whether they are rich and developed or developing  large or medium sized  could unite and pool their efforts at the international level. Their concerted action could be exercised in the political field in favour of detente  as well as in the economic field in favour of a more just international order. I believe that the essential requirement to enable their actions to be effective would be that they be countries that have shown an independent attitude  to the extent that that is possible today  and countries that because of their size  population  wealth  activities  prestige or other factors have a certain pre-eminence in international affairs. These would be some of the so-called medium sized Powers. Their number is changing. Obviously  no one is thinking of a recognized grouping  even less of an organization. We are merely speaking of the possibility of such countries acquiring greater awareness of the fact that their interests as members of the international community are relatively similar and that cooperation among them should be closer for the benefit of certain causes.28.	The negotiations conducted this past year on cooperation for development have not yielded the expected results. While a consensus was reached on the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade  it was impossible to reach significant agreement on the items to be dealt with in the global negotiations or on the manner in which to negotiate them. One would say that some Governments of the industrialized world have no other view or objective than that of maintaining the existing order  without any changes or adjustments other than those necessary for a return to the golden times prior to 1973  when their economies were expanding thanks to cheap and assured sources of energy  and without much importance being attached to the developing economies  which continued to deteriorate.29.	This attitude does not take into account the fact that a new objective situation has emerged in the world and that the developing countries have acquired a new awareness of the problem and its root causes. The firm solidarity  unexpected by some  which has been maintained since 1973 between the exporters of oil and the developing consumer countries  which are the ones that have suffered most from the price increases  should lead the industrialized Powers to reflect on the necessity to negotiate seriously with a view to establishing new and more just bases for international economic relations. There is a growing awareness  shared by Governments and independent personalities  that that is the only possible way in which to prevent the vast crisis which is approaching.30.	It has also been suggested recently that in order to promote negotiations  it would be necessary to hold one or more meetings of a small group  which would none the less be sufficiently representative of heads of Government  to bring North South relations out of the present deadlock  to act as a catalyst to encourage more effective negotiations and to respond imaginatively to the crisis in the world economy. The purpose of those meetings would be to express a specific political will to establish certain minimum bases of agreement to support the series of global negotiations to be held within the United Nations. That is why in this context and together with other Governments Mexico has been exploring the possibility of holding a high level political meeting early next year. We believe that every possible formula should be explored and every opportunity taken for making progress. That is the only motive behind the efforts that have been made at present by the Government of my country.31.	An important element of the complex economic situation in the world today is the question of energy  which obviously cannot be approached  much less negotiated  in isolation but only as an integral part of a broader group of questions.32.	Rationalization of the international handling of energy sources cannot be delayed. Without that it would be impossible for developing countries to attain their objective of accelerated and sustained growth; and it would be impossible for advanced countries to restore their dynamics of growth.33.	A year ago  in this same forum  President Lopez Portillo of Mexico invited the international community  to undertake  as part of the vast effort to change the prevailing international economic order  the preparation and adoption of a world plan for energy which would ensure an orderly  progressive  integrated and just transition from the present energy structureâbased on the sometimes wasteful utilization of the most rapidly exhaustible fossil fuels  especially oilâto the future  sustained  rational  orderly and progressive utilization of new and renewable alternative sources of energy  which could be of benefit to all mankind  within a system of shared responsibility and a more just and equitable world economic order.34.	In no way did the Mexican proposal concerning energy suggest that this question be dealt with in isolation  but rather as it related dynamically to other structural changes in the international economy. It did not suggest a limited discussion on prices and supplies between producers and consumers  but rather broad international negotiations  in which all would participate  dealing with long-term questions relating to the transition in the field of energy. Nor did it counsel dealing in particular with the main source of energy at present  that is  oil  but rather taking a global approach to all energy sources.35.	One year after that energy proposal was submitted  we see that it has had an influence on the debates and decisions on the new International Development Strategy and on the as yet inconclusive decision on the programme and procedures for the global negotiations. My country remains convincedâand a growing number of nations share this convictionâthat changing the present unjust system of international economic relations requires far-reaching global decisions in the field of energy of benefit to all and binding upon all.36. Among the most encouraging events of recent times is the agreement reached  after ten years of hard efforts  at the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. Except for minor outstanding issues  an important draft convention has been completed governing all uses of the sea and its resources.  This ambitious undertaking  as stated in the preamble to the draft convention  represents an important contribution to the maintenance of peace  justice and progress for all peoples of the world  as well as to the attainment of an equitable international economic order.37.	Despite the vast divergence of interests and political and legal views of the various groups of States  it was possible to attain those impressive results. The draft convention will not totally satisfy anyone  but it is acceptable to all or almost all. The alternativeâthat is  failureâwould have been tantamount to anarchy and confrontation. This experience shows that the problems of the world  difficult though they may seem  can be solved when the participants give overriding importance to the overall long-term community interests instead of to immediate national interests.38.	In conclusion  I wish to reiterate our view about what is at this time the main concern of peoples and Governments: the maintenance of a just peace permitting progress for all States. To this end we must dispel the threats that are hanging over mankind at the dawn of the 1980s. Intervention in defence of ""vital interests"" must disappear from the practice and even the language of today's international relations. Let us not forget that while those ""interests"" were identified with geographical areas yesterday  today they are being identified with energy sources  and tomorrow those same interests could be invoked in connection with food and other raw materials.39.	The unilateral defence of vital interestsâwhoever might invoke them and whatever the euphemism used to cloak themâwhenever they affected the fate of other peoples would be tantamount to accepting a new colonialism in which the weakest would be the exclusive preserve of the strongest. No ""vital interest"" can or could ever justify the domination of one people over another. The only vital interest everyone has is peace."
"89",4611,"MLI",35,1980,"ï»¿After the signing of the Charter of the United Nations mankind thought the nightmare of the scourge of war had been for ever laid to rest. A new world was open to mankind; universal and permanent peace was at hand. The weapons of war were to be cast aside and the spirit of tolerance and brotherhood was to reign; mankind was to unite to make everybody content with his way of life  his destiny.93.	But the scourge of war did not disappear and the dream came to naught.94.	You  Mr. President  on assuming the heavy but ennobling burden of the presidency of the Assembly  emphasized that the thirty-fifth session is taking place at a time when the world is entering upon a difficult decade. But you went on to say that we are capable of solving all the problems facing us and of concern to us all as long as we approach them with the firm determination  the true political will  to resolve them.95.	Such a keen perception of international problems and such lofty thinking in setting them in their proper context and finding universally valid solutions to them further demonstrate your outstanding human and political qualities.96.	The people and Government of Mali welcome your unanimous election for two reasons: first  because your country  the Federal Republic of Germany  my country's friend  was the first to establish diplomatic relations with the young Republic of Mali; secondly  because the bonds that have been forged over 20 years have increased and strengthened  thereby offering a notable example of international co-operation. The remarkable manner in which you have been conducting our debates augurs for the success of our work. In conveying to you our best wishes for success  we assure you of the full and sincere co-operation of the delegation of Mali.97.	Permit me also to congratulate once again Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim  President of the thirty-fourth session  for his wisdom  competence and skill which left a special imprint on the work of an exceptionally busy inter-sessional period. It also gives me pleasure to recall that it was only logical that  as an African and as Chairman of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  it should have been he who welcomed into our midst the heroic Republic of Zimbabwe  that republic to which the people of Mali once again renews its militant support.98.	We also take this occasion to convey to the Secretary- General and to the competent team which surrounds him our appreciation for their invaluable service in the cause of peace and understanding among peoples and nations.99.	Sir  your distinguished predecessor transmitted to us the following message:"". . . our world is now at a critical crossroads and that we must choose between the road which will lead mankind to its own fatal destruction and the road towards mutual understanding  peaceful coexistence  progress and prosperity.""100.	Indeed  the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly is opening in a world in crisis  which has been brought about by distrust in the relations among States and the serious deterioration in the international economic situation.101.	On 3 September last  in the general debate of the eleventh special session of the General Assembly  we stated from this rostrum that the crisis which is shaking our planet to its deepest foundations illustrates once again the common destiny of nations and peoples  the great hopes of which we are bound to translate into concrete realities. Unfortunately  one of those hopes is about to fade away.102.	The eleventh special session of the General Assembly  convened amidst turmoil in the world economy in order to deal with one of the most difficult  albeit most important  questions of our time  has closed without attaining any profound perception of the future or even succeeding in meeting the legitimate hopes of millions of people who once again live in fear of the future.103.	Just as it was termed special  so the measures which the Assembly was to adopt at that session in order to bring order to and revive the world economy should likewise have been exceptional  because the challenge which it was to meet concerned our common fate. The encouraging statements of some speakers about the need to establish a new balance in international economic relations and the meritorious efforts made by others to initiate global negotiations next year on vital questions for the maintenance of international peace and security have only yielded watered-down results and this will have the effect of overcrowding the already impressive agenda of this session of the General Assembly.104.	The recognition by everyone of the serious and disturbing deterioration of the world economic situation and the need to correct it immediately has led to the preparation10 Sec Official Records of the General Assembly  Eleventh Special Session  Plenary Meetings  13th meeting  of the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade  the text of which will  we hope  be formally adopted at this session.  Nevertheless  the absence of unanimous and firm political will prevented the Assembly  at the eleventh special session  from reaching the anticipated positive results regarding the procedure  which has become unavoidable  for beginning negotiations towards a new international economic order.105.	As a result the extreme interpretation of the notion of consensus introduced into the economic sphere the power to block action  which the Charter conferred on some Member States in other fields. Thus  that lack of flexibility has led to the deferment of this crucial question  which has once again been held in abeyance.106.	Not having dared to act  we run the risk of allowing the infernal spiral of inflation  recession and unemployment to continue. We risk seeing the most terrible threat to peace emerge on the horizon  the threat of millions of people mounting an assault on an economic system which for them is synonymous with frustration  poverty and absolute destitution.107.	""Absolute poverty"" is the expression used by the World Bank to refer to the condition of 800 million human beings on our planet  among whom are included the populations of most of the African States south of the Sahara and particularly States members of the Inter-State Committee on Drought Control in the Sahel  an organization which comprises the eight countries of the Sahel which since 1973 have been severely hit by the scourge of drought and desertification.108.	One of the most tragic consequences of that climatic hazard is the chronic grain deficit besetting that region  which is thus converted into a famine area that requires the care of the international community. That community should step up its efforts with regard both to its emergency assistance  rendered even more indispensable by the recent low levels and uneven distribution of rainfall and to its actions in the medium and the long term aimed at ensuring self-sufficiency in food based on the complete control of the surface and subterranean waters.109.	The head of State of Mali  President Moussa Traore  in his capacity as current President of the Summit Conference of that group of countries which is coherent in the geographical  economic and ecological senses  will once again in the coming days issue an anguished appeal to the international conscience.110.	Because of its anachronistic nature the present inter-national system  which is intrinsically un-egalitarian  must inevitably lead to trouble. The present world situation is characterized by severe tensions  among them the phenomenon of decolonization  local conflicts and the unbridled arms race  all of which are causes of instability and threats to peace.111.	Only the strict application of the excellent principles inscribed in golden letters in the Charter of the United Nations can prevent the advent of the direst of consequences. Among those principles we note especially the right of every people to control its fate. There is no force in the world which can destroy forever the will of peoples to decide their own destiny.112.	This December we shall celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the historic resolution 1514 (XV)  which subsequently came to constitute the basic charter of decolonization  thanks to which oppressed peoples obtained their inalienable right to self-determination  a universal and eternal right. It was on the basis of that principle that the General Assembly 20 years ago consecrated the international sovereignty of 18 young States  among them my own  the Republic of Mali. Subsequently  the international community became prouder and richer with the accession to independence of 53 new States. The accession to membership in the international Organization of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines on 16 September last is a two-fold symbolâ of the irreversibility of the phenomenon of decolonization and of the political maturity of peoples which are still dependent  regardless of the size of their population or the geographical configuration of their territory.113.	The United Nations moves year after year towards the universality which it upholds because it is that universality which is its strength and which determines its future. I was going to say because it is our strength and determines our future. We have resolutely chosen to hasten such a future and support with all our strength both those peoples that achieve their independence and those that continue to fight  devoting all their energies to the affirmation and the exercise of their national rights. For want of obtaining them by persuasion  they are wresting those rights by force of arms.114.	It is because the doors to negotiation on its future have remained closed after a long wait and much bloodshed that the valiant people of Namibia  after other heroic peoples  has undertaken the stubborn struggle for national liberation.115.	The plan for a peaceful settlement of the Namibian crisis adopted by the United Nations which the Secretary- General is endeavouring to implement with his usual tenacity and the proposals made along the same lines by the five Western Powers are at an impasse. The racist and illegal administration of South Africa  unable to rise above the level of violence  hatred and duplicity  continues to use all kinds of excuses to delay matters  in the absurd hope of imposing ""its peace"" on the heroic people of Namibia  resorting at the same time to the use of arms  organizing masquerades of popular consultations  with constant evasions and interminable requests for clarification after receipt of every letter sent by the Secretary-General.116.	On the initiative of the late President Neto  the settlement plan of the United Nations provides for the creation of demilitarized zones between Namibia and its neighbours  which would permit the initiation of talks on the future accession to independence of the international Territory of Namibia. But Pretoria has responded to this initiative of peace with bad faith and acts of war. The delaying tactics it uses are designed to gain respites so that it may satisfy its hegemonistic ambition.117.	Actually  while South Africa pretends to pursue dialogue with the Secretary-General and the representatives of the five Western Powers  it continues to attack the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Angola.118.	The illegal and racist regime of South Africa has no option but to engage in dialogue with the sole authentic representative of the Namibian people  the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO]  its fighting flank which embodies its hopes and has shown it the road to national liberation.119.	SWAPO has taken up arms in order to liberate its homeland. Negotiations are with those who fight.120.	It is in that context that we urge the Secretary- General  the five Western Powers and the international community to make use of all available resources so that the Namibian people may exercise its sacred right to self- determination.121.	South Africa not only will never reverse the course of the liberation struggle of the Namibian people but will never realize its dream of maintaining in slavery the population of Azania under the heinous system of apartheid.122.	The chameleonic characteristics of the leaders of Pretoria whenever international pressure makes itself felt and whenever internal resistance deals them fatal blows do not in any way change the true nature of apartheid. That hideous policy continues to be the apotheosis of racism and hatred  of hatred of the black.123.	Men who love peace and justice are not duped by this. They redouble their efforts in order to awaken man's con-science to this new scourge which threatens our civilization. The fires they have started in the oil installations at Sasol- burg will continue to light the long and difficult struggle that they will have to wage to recover their dignity in their own homeland and to save humanity from that cancer which saps it.124.	It would be work for peace to isolate South Africa and impose on it the provisions of Chapter VII of the Charter.125.	It is also in order to speak of peace that we now turn to one of the most sensitive areas in Africa  Western Sahara in the north-west of our continent.126.	As is well known  the United Nations continues to be seized of the question of Western Sahara  a decolonization problem. However  in its wisdom and in keeping with the provisions of Chapter VIII of the Charter  the Organization has allowed  as a first resort  the OAU to search for an appropriate solution.127.	The Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU  after having debated this matter many times  set up  at its seventeenth ordinary session  an Ad Hoc Committee to which it gave the imperative mandate of assisting it in finding a peaceful settlement of that crisis.128.	The Ad Hoc Committee has heard all parties concerned or interested in the question of Western Sahara in the context of on-the-spot visits at the highest level and by listening with patience and interest to all the spokesmen who have come forward. That Committee  which has just met again at Freetown  has adopted a number of recommendations which  being precise and realistic  should secure the unqualified adherence of all parties to the conflict. It would  in any case  be very wise of them to act thus because  as President Moussa Traore has frequently said  when a people is denied its right to speak  it seizes that right  and it resorts to violence to do so.129.	Mali and the rest of Africa ask the international community  the United Nations  the non-aligned movement  the League of Arab States and the Islamic Conference to trust them to resolve this delicate question of Western Sahara.130.	My country is motivated only by the desire to put an end to the spiral of violence which would internationalize the conflict. My country also asks all interested parties to listen to the voice of reason and to place their trust in history in order to ensure the success of their demands however legitimate they believe them to beâin short  to see to it that that fertile area of Africa is freed from a war the outcome of which is inevitable.131.	As the philosopher said  the greatness of a nation  especially of a nation with a history  is not measured by its capacity to wage war but by its capacity to make peace.132.	For its part  the Republic of Mali is resolved to co-operate loyally in the Ad Hoc Committee. In so doing  however  it will not depart from the principles and political ideals to which it is deeply committed. It will never compromise on the right of peoples to self-determination.133.	The Malian people and their leaders will never depart from the African positions which they have freely chosen and which  need we recall  are summarized in two themes: first  for nothing in the world will the people and the leaders of Mali be accomplices  not even passive accomplices  in a plot against the right to self-determination of peoples in general and the people of Western Sahara in particular; secondly  the people and the leaders of Mali will be scrupulous in ensuring that the circumstantial and therefore ephemeral dispute among peoples that are friends and neighbours of Mali  peoples that have the same history  the same culture and the same faith  does not dangerously compromise the stability of the region.134.	The sequel to colonization is seen not only in the African continent. The Middle East feels it painfully on its flank owing to the expansionist policy of Israel and its lack of respect for the legitimate right of the Palestinian people to self-determination.135.	We will not cease to repeat that the Palestinian problem is at the heart of the Middle East crisis. To disregard that would be to accept political illusions. Nevertheless  this evidence has not yet enabled the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People to lead the Security Council to face its responsibilities  given the growing deterioration of the situation in Palestine.136.	However  the world has seen the Palestinian reality. Suffice it in this context to refer to the resolutions adopted on the question by the Islamic Conference and by the OAU; to the Venice Declaration issued on 13 June by the Heads of State and Government and Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the nine member States of the European Community; the Declaration of the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries; and the appeals made everywhere in the world by democratic organizations and high-level international political and moral leaders in favour of recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people and its sovereign exercise of that right under the dynamic direction of its political organization and sole legitimate representative  the PLO.137.	Israel has clearly learnt nothing from history. If it had  it would not have set Lebanon ablaze with its expansionist actions; it would not  in its vanity  have declared Jerusalem its eternal and indivisible capital  thus flagrantly and arrogantly violating the provisions of resolution 181 (II)  adopted by the General Assembly on 29 November 1947 concerning the future Government of Palestine  and thus also seriously offending the conscience of millions of people who believe in the Eternal.138.	In fact  Jerusalem  because of its historic and religious characteristics  transcends the dimensions of a single State. That thrice holy city  eternal testimony to the spiritual heritage of the three revealed religions  certainly belongs to mankind and must continue to do so.139.	The international community must vigorously denounce the policy of Judaization of the Holy City which has been undertaken and pursued by the Zionist entity in contempt of international law. There is no doubt that the appeal made and the specific measures advocated on the subject at the Tenth Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers  held at Fez from 8 to 12 May 1979   will find a ready response in the Assembly.140.	Nor has the political situation developed in Korea since the joint North-South communique of 4 July 1972 and the adoption by the General Assembly of its resolution 3390 B (XXX). The events currently taking place in the southern part of that country  which are of concern for more than one reason  call for the early implementation of the five-point peace proposal formulated by the People's Democratic Republic of Korea.141.	A glimmer of hope may be perceived in Cyprus. The two Cypriot communitiesâTurkish and Greekâhave agreed to resume the talks on the political future of their country  thus showing that the maturity of peoples  will  always win out over the most subtle political machinations.142.	The situation in Chad continues to be one of the main concerns of OAJ and especially of the Republic of Mali  a member  like the battered country  of the Organization of Saharan States. The fratricidal war which has set in there seriously threatens the territorial integrity and independence of that country  the security and stability of our region and  if we are not careful  may well jeopardize international peace.143.	As with all African conflicts  the solution to that problem must first of all remain an African one. Of course  organized Africa must be able to count on the very precious support of the international community with the aim of safeguarding national unity  of which the Lagos Agreement of 21 August 1979 is the sole guarantee.144.	It is also the lack of respect for the principles of the Charterâthe principles of non-recourse to force  avoidance of foreign military intervention  non-interference in the internal affairs of States and the peaceful settlement of disputesâwhich has given to the crises in Afghanistan and Kampuchea dimensions which go beyond the national borders of those countries.145.	From this rostrum  the people and leaders of Mali  through our delegation  would like to make  in conformity with our traditions of respect for the will of all peoples and for the sacred principles of effective non-alignment  an urgent appeal to all the parties involved in these regrettable crises to replace guns with ballot-boxes and negotiating tables so that the peoples concerned may in full freedom have the opportunity to choose the final solutions to their concerns.146.	Hotbeds of tension have not only continued; they have unfortunately multiplied. The current session of the General Assembly began during the border conflict between Iran and Iraq  two countries friendly to mine  members of the Islamic Conference  and of the non-aligned movement. Mali supports the opportune initiatives of the Islamic Conference and the non-aligned movement towards the complete cessation of hostilities and a quest  by peaceful means  of a lasting solution to the crisis.147.	Alliances forged by war have been shattered by the demands of opposing ideologies. While international relations suffer less and less from the clash of ideologies  they are more and more subject to the efforts of nationalism and selfish interests to the detriment of the ideals of peace and justice so dear to the international community.148.	Detente  to be real  must be extended to all the nations of the world  all the peoples of the world because of the correlation of their interests and their equal ability to direct the course of international affairs.149.	Because this profound reality has not been recognized  because it has been forgotten that the Charter recommends uniting the strength of all to maintain international peace and security  fear continues to hover over the world. The balance of fear has returned in the form of the fear of tomorrow.150.	Ratification of the SALT II Treaty on the limitation of strategic offensive weapons  which we earnestly desire  has been thwarted by the resurgence of international tension. The Disarmament Decade which the General Assembly decided to proclaim at its thirty-fourth session has opened to the clash of weapons. Furthermore  the arsenals are stuffed with engines of devastation as though to clear one's conscience by having  out of a love for peace  prepared for war.151.	In fact  despite international agreements  despite the legitimate concern of peoples  nuclear explosions have not halted during the past year. Existing stockpiles of strategic weapons would suffice  according to experts  to reduce our planet to ashes 1 001 times over. But this is not enough: arsenals are to be stocked with neutron weapons. Chemical weapons  although banned  have rediscovered their patent of nobility. According to the international press  the flash of light recorded by an American satellite over South Africa was that of an atomic bomb jointly developed by South Africa and Israel.152.	What could be more absurd than to note that more than $500 billion a year continues to be spent on armaments  when a far smaller sum would suffice to bring the Sahel back into bloom  to open schools and hospitals for hundreds of millions of people and to drive back the advance of hunger and malnutrition.153.	But the arms race has demonstrated its own futility  for it has not decreased the policy of zones of influence  prevented the maintenance and strengthening of blocs or extinguished hotbeds of tension.154.	Mankind must necessarily  then  respond to all the different challenges with which it is faced. Zones of influence and blind distrust are among the ills in modern international relations  the sole remedy for which  we believe  lies in non-alignment  steadfast and dynamic non-alignment  a non-alignment which goes beyond blocs  a non-alignment which will lead to true interdependence  in which a community of interests will replace conflicts of interest in a world in harmony.155.	Such ambition requires the mobilization of the political will of all. The establishment and maintenance of peace is not a matter for the Powers alone  however militarily developed they may be  or for blocs; it is right and truly a matter for all. 156.	The problem of the democratization of international relations  the need for which was affirmed in September 1970 at Lusaka at the Third Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  is thus clearly posed.157.	Respect for human rights is among the questions of world-wide importance  and it must therefore be placed in its precise context and comprehensively if we wish correctly to resolve it.158.	To grasp thoroughly the import and scope of the question of fundamental human rights  we must first of all rid ourselves of ideological contingencies which do not merely circumscribe our consideration  but also tend to permit the notion of a selective approach to take root  while  in fact  the basic rights of the individual cover all aspects of daily lifeâpolitical  civil  economic and social. To emphasize political rights at the expense of social and economic rights would be tantamount to depriving millions of people who live in sordid and abject conditions of their freedom to escape starvation  ignorance and disease. Conversely  not to consider civil and political rights is tantamount to believing that man can live by bread alone. Economic  social and cultural rights are inseparable from civil and political rights. They all move towards the same goals: development and peace.159.	On the one hand  since man is the be-all and end-all of development  the right to developmentâthe recognized right of each individual to meet his needs in accordance with his legitimate aspirations and in harmony with the degree of development of the society in which he livesâmust be the first human right to be respected by Governments.160.	On the other hand  since there can be no peace and security in the world if the enjoyment by all people of their fundamental rights is not an effective reality  equal rights for all the members of the human family remains the cornerstone of peace and justice in the world.161.	In this connection one should be convinced once and for all that human rights apply to all people  irrespective of race  sex or creed. This implies the effective participation of all people in the development of the society in which they live. Human rights cannot be discriminatory  applicable  for example  to the whites who immigrated into South Africa  but withheld from the blacks  who are the authentic children of the country.162.	Man is but an element of society  the harmonious evolution of which requires respect for the collective right of all the elements which make up that society. In other words  because the right to development is first and foremost a collective right  human rights cannot and must not transcend the right of peoples.163.	The right to self-determination  the right to the free exploitation of natural resources  the right to organize societies according to political  economic and social rules that each people must freely chooseâin sum  the right to exist  the right to live  the right to be must be admitted and applied by all.164.	In Mali  a young State but an old country  human rights are part of our ethic. There  as in all societies of an old civilization  man is happy because he is never alone  he is never lonely  he is never in despair because he can trust in his family  his clan  his country  to which he remains attached by an emotional and therefore indestructible bond  which is nevertheless destroyed by a certain form of development.165.	My country  Mali  on acceding to international sovereignty  of course  adhered to the Charter of the United Nations  the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic  Social and Cultural Rights  both of 1966. Moreover  on the national level  the sacred rights of the human person are protected by our laws and above all by our Constitution  in which they are embodied not only in several provisions of its preamble but in an entire chapter  the first.166.	This means that my country  our people and its leaders have no complex as regards the question of human rights  which has suddenly become a useful instrument for the destabilization of young States. No nation  no people  no State  can claim to have attained perfection in such a fundamental and delicate field as this. The critics of today must first be convinced that while it is undeniable that human rights are intangible at the level of principle  the daily modalities are in general a function of many factors  many contingencies  among which are the ethic of each society  the preoccupations of the moment  the political circumstances and the economic and social conditions.167.	These few thoughts should lead the manipulators of consciences and public opinion  which  unfortunately  certain mass media have become  to show more circumspection  more restraint  and more justice.168.	Such a policy  although quite common  is all the more unjust in that there is this imbalance in matters of information. The unequal exchange of information between North and South  the distortions which are found  the concentration of the mass media in developed countries  the increasingly commercial nature of the important press  which in the main practises crisis journalism  are the major themes of the important debate taking place in UNESCO on a new world information order  which we heartily wish to see emerge so worrying is the present dangerous tendency to treat the news from the third world in a distorted way in the service of what are often unworthy ends. The media in the major industrialized countries often give our countries a false and distorted image. The familiar demand for the free circulation of information between the strong and the weak incontestably has negative consequences for the latter. The disadvantaged passively receive second-rate cultural works and values which alienate them because they are foreign to them. It is therefore essential to correct this other imbalance  which is detrimental to the South in its exchange of news with the North.169.	The freedom of the press  which is a fundamental right  must cease to be an unrestricted freedom  a commercial product or an instrument of power. The press should not seek only to free itself from control by the political power. It must also be on its guard  perhaps  above all  lest it fall under the in some ways more severe yoke of the economic power  whose subtle enormous and powerful methods are still more restrictive.170.	The freedom of the press must be at the service of man  and this must be its only purpose. As a means of education the press must contribute to the formation of the individual personality. As an instrument of progress  mass media must be at the service of development.171.. These are the few thoughts which my delegation wished to express in this debate as a modest contribution to any efforts to seek solutions to the major problems of our time. We are pressed for time  for  as was recognized by the non-aligned movement in 1970: ""We are at a crossroads in history  and every passing day brings new proof of the exceptional power of the human spirit and points to the dangerous paths into which man may be led by his imperfections"". We must apply that exceptional power of our creative spirit to international problems.172.	The sovereignty of States  the equality among them recognized by the Charter  the development of the international situation since the end of the Second World War and the necessary democratization of international relations enable us to hope that no effort will be spared to be worthy of the trust which the peoples place in us and to provide ourselves with more effective instruments in order to give dynamism to our action.173.	We have already said that we are at a crossroads in history. Serious events assail us on all sides. Decolonization has not been achieved  apartheid takes innocent lives  brother countries are tearing each other to pieces  the world economy is undergoing an unprecedented crisis. In short  peace has never been more seriously threatened.174.	On 26 June 1945 men of good will signed at San Francisco the finest instrument of peace that has ever existed  the Charter of the United Nations. They did this because of their horror of war  to spare future generations the torment and untold sufferings  through their love of peace  that vibrant love which animates us all  the peoples of the world."
"90",4652,"MLT",35,1980,"ï»¿Last year in this Assembly I expressed unease over the dark clouds gathering on the international horizon and detected early warning signals of a new round of escalation in lethal weapon systems. Malta's forebodings of yesterday have transformed themselves into the grim realities of today.43.	Old problems have become more complicated and new ones have emerged. The political world is behaving irrationally. Adventurism  interference  and even intervention arrogantly stride the world stage. Military options are being applied to problems which are essentially political in nature. Here  at least  we all seem to agree that the very foundations of peace are in acute danger  that we must inject new momentum into our efforts to halt our reverses and so change direction to forward movement.44.	We have in fact been declaring the same objectives  perhaps in different words and with different emphases  for the last 35 years. Our methods and our approaches have not changed much. We give rise to great expectations in debate  but negative factors overwhelm our modest collective gains.45.	We still have the protagonists of each military alliance continuing to engage in the apparently all-absorbing activity of the pot calling the kettle black. For instance  the only significant additions to their repetitive statements on disarmament have mostly been dictated by the new weapons systems that they themselves have commissioned in the period intervening between one session of the Assembly and the next. That seems to be the end-product of their commitment to what has now become almost a meaningless ritualâ a verbal commitment to ""general and complete disarmament under effective international control"". In reality  as the study on nuclear weapons by the Secretary-General concludes  the major Powers are toying with a perpetual menace to human society. In a recent survey carried out in Britain  almost 50 per cent of ""the people interviewed predicted an outbreak of nuclear war within the time span of the current generation.46.	For how long  then  can reasonable hope prevail over barren performance? Have the major Powers not yet realized that every action taken by either of them has worldwide ramifications and calls for an inevitable response from the other? With detente always considered so fragile  why are there elephantine lurches by one side or the other  which are bound to destroy  perhaps at a single stroke  all the patient attempts at progress made in the past? Is it possible that there can be such a lack of perception and communication in the world of today?47.	We do not lack the tools. The Charter of the United Nations is our prescription and our objective  and the Organization is our means to attain our ends. What we lack  desperately  is the will to use its institutions and to use them efficiently. Next to political will  our scarcest commodity is time  which is fast running out.48.	A lasting legacy of the imperturbable performance of Ambassador Salim of the United Republic of Tanzania  the previous President of the General Assembly  is the clarity and perception with which he reviewed the performance of this Assembly over the past 12 months  objectively highlighting the major problems confronting us.49.	Similarly  our hard pressed Secretary-General has once again helped us to focus attention on the major problems we face in his concise  analytical and dedicated report on the work of the Organization  which convincingly reminds usâbecause we need to be remindedâthat ourOrganization is here to serve the international community  to the extent that all Members utilize its services in their duties as representatives of the peoples of the United Nations.50.	And the President of the current session has now taken up the challenge of leadership in the strenuous months ahead. My country and I personally welcome your election  Mr. President. It is a well-merited acknowledgement of your personal qualities and of the important role that your country has assumed in the present stage of international relations. I am confident that your experience and dedication will serve us well.51.	It is symbolic of your country's effective stimulus to economic development that  in the short span of less than a decade  the pragmatic efforts of the small team of experts on industrial promotion that the Federal Republic of Germany sent to Malta have been so successful that  I am glad to state  your country is the only industrially developed nation with which Malta maintains a favourable balance of trade  in a mutually advantageous partnership of German technology and Maltese skilled labour.52.	This model of modern friendly relations between two countries  forged through the vicissitudes of past history  inspires Malta's foreign policy; it is a success story that is a good foundation for Malta's hopes for the future regarding all other countries. We therefore augur that this session also will produce similarly positive and enduring results.53.	As others have pointed out  we have two outstanding elements on the credit side of our performance rating. The first  the long drawn-out saga of Zimbabwe  finally ended in a significant achievement which we have already welcomed  overdue as it undoubtedly was. Even that achievement  however  reminds us of the continuing frustration over Namibia and the even more insidious anomaly of apartheid  practised as national Government policy by South Africa. That system continues to outrage the conscience of mankind at a period in history when human dignity  social equality and racial harmony should be the. hallmark of modern times.54.	The second achievement  the progress in the hitherto slow-moving Conference on the Law of the Sea  welcome as it is  does not blind my delegation to the severe dent in our original expectations as to what should derive from the concept of the common heritage of mankind.55.	During the negotiations  it has become clear that extensive  rich and more readily accessible areas of the ocean floor are now likely to fall under national jurisdiction  mostly benefiting a few well-endowed nations  at the expense of the international community as a whole. The originally envisaged international area has shrunk considerably as a result.56.	The recovery and utilization of the resources in the international area  moreover  require a most sophisticated technology and highly capital-intensive efforts  of which only a handful of countries are capable. We now have grave doubts as to the financial benefits that will actually accrue to the international community as a whole  and particularly to developing countries  from the eventual utilization of those resources. Therefore  apart from our readiness to host the proposed international sea-bed authority  it is to these sober expectations that the high hopes raised by Malta in 1968 have been reduced in 1980. And the litigation likely to arise in future from some of the vague provisions in the proposed convention will create a paradise for international lawyers but a nightmare for national leaders.57.	Already ominous signs are emerging. Apart from the national legislation on sea-bed mining by one country  there is the refusal of some States to agree to an enforceable system of law  or even to existing disputes being subjected to the procedures that would apply to future disputes of the same kind. Those disputes are not theoretical; they are now being encountered in practice and applied against the weak to the advantage of the strong.58.	With advancing technology  dwindling energy and mineral resources  and escalating prices  offshore exploration is bound to assume increasing and frequently competing importance. Powerful technologically advanced nations fronting the oceans are currently extracting resources from dozens of rigs operating hundreds of miles offshore. Malta has been forcefully prevented from operating one single rig at a modest offshore distance of 50 miles.59.	The recognized right to exploration and exploitation of natural resources has now become an acute and actual need for ail countries  but particularly for developing countries which depend on energy imports and are faced with constantly escalating costs. That was stressed by the President of OAU in his statement to this Assembly of 24 September. It was referred to by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in his statement of the previous day [6th meeting]  and it has been highlighted by the representative of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  the newest Member of the United Nations.60.	We again compliment that nation  not only on its admission to the United Nations  which we were honoured to sponsor  but also on its perceptive statement  as an island developing country  on the importance of offshore resources and the relevance of the median line as the boundary between opposite States for the territorial sea and the economic zone  within internationally recognized limits.61.	Those rights have been enunciated in numerous resolutions proposed by developing countries. They are recognized by current international law and practice. Yet the attitudes and interpretation of States in various regions in relation to those rights and legal principles vary considerably; already in some areas there has been armed confrontationâover the past month aloneâin Africa  in Latin America and in the Mediterranean. Malta was at the receiving end of the confrontation in the Mediterranean and has suffered bitterly as a result of action taken against it by a country which professes to be Malta's best friend.62.	I shall not repeat all the details of the incident  since the matter is before the Security Council. I only mention that we have spent eight years of expensive and wearisome negotiations with Libya  to no avail. For four years Libya has delayed ratification of a painstakingly negotiated agreement to refer the matter for adjudication by legal process.63.	Faced with those delaying tactics  Malta finally decided  on the advice of several friendly countries consulted in advance  to authorize exploration activities well on its own side of the median line separating Libya and Malta. Without explanation  without reason  Libya sent armed naval forces and insisted on a cessation of the peaceful and legitimate activities so vital for Malta's economic viability  on the unfounded pretext that the area of operations was a ""disputed area"".64.	Libyaâor any other country for that matterâcannot apply two weights and two measures; once it has exploited resources on its own side of the median line  it simply cannot deny the exercise of the same rights to Malta  by using force to impede our legitimate activities on our own side. We  for our part  have not presumed to impede lawful Libyan activities  but the Libyans have impeded ours and say that they intend to continue to do so. In the circumstances which Libya has provoked  our only honourable course  as a peace-loving country  and after all efforts at good offices had been frustrated  was to seek the protection of the Security Council  instead of answering threat by counter-threat.65.	Like the Secretary-General  we feel that  as experience has abundantly shown  the Security Council should not be used as a last resort when any given situation has gone out of hand. We believe firmly in the Security Council as the promoter and the guarantor of international peace and security. We therefore do not believe that it should vacillate in the face of actions which are clearly in violation of international law and of the Charter of the United Nations. There cannot be two codes of international conductâone for the strong and the other for the weak. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs of France so correctly stated in his address to this Assembly  ""When law is violated  silence acts as an accomplice""66.	We knowâthere is already evident proofâthat the incident provoked by Libya is not an isolated one. It is bound to occur again in the future  as it has in the past. Therefore the Security Council must pronounce an appropriate code of conduct; it must not condone breaches of the peace; it must ensure that they do not recur.67.	The proposed law of the sea convention is innovative  but it does not inhibit established international law and practice. In fact  it foresees the necessity of practical interim arrangements until boundary agreements are reached. Article 83  paragraph 3  provides that  pending agreement ""... the States concerned  in a spirit of understanding and co-operation  shall make every effort to enter into provisional arrangements of a practical nature and  during this transitional period  not to jeopardize or hamper the reaching of the final agreement."" 68.	Malta  in its search for agreement  although constantly faced with dismaying delaying tactics and totally unfounded claims by Libya  has made a practical suggestion. Up to this very moment the only Libyan reply has been a deafening silence.69.	A heavily armed  richly endowed country thus  consciously or unconsciously  stifles the legitimate rights of a small  unarmed country  totally lacking any natural resources  from peacefully exercising those rights  thereby impeding its indigenous potential for economic development. That  like any other self-respecting country  Malta will never accept. And that action  whatever its source  the international communityâprimarily through the Security Councilâcannot condone.70. That is the only issueâa vital one for Malta  though perhaps minor for Libyaâwhich is exacerbating relations between the two countries. That provocative and illegal attitude flies against the interest of Mediterranean cooperation and of reducing tension in the Mediterranean  to which Libya allegedly is dedicated.71. In the past  it has given me great pleasure to praise Libya's understanding. Today  I have no option but to call it into question and to ask Libya to change its present attitude. I do it with the utmost candour  which is the true expression of friendship  so that existing doubts and anxieties will be removed. It is the least we can expect from a nation that has stood by us in difficult circumstances in the past.72.	Therefore  I very much regret that in his statement of 6 October the representative of Libya  while reviewing Mediterranean problems  did not even see fit to mention the acute controversy between his country and mine  as if that question  of such vital interest to Malta  is of no concern to his country.73.	The Security Council suspended its examination of Malta's complaint so as to give Libya time to study the matter  and to this date Libya has not provided any reply  beyond stating in letters that: first  the question is a complex and technical matter which cannot be settled overnight; secondly  the law of the sea has not yet resolved the question of delimitation; thirdly  Libya is ready to go to the International Court of Justice; fourthly  Libya did not use force against Malta; and fifthly  since ""the area"" is disputed  Malta cannot carry out any activities therein until the border demarcation line is determined.74.	To those points I would reply briefly as follows.75.	First  eight years of patient but fruitless effort is not exactly ""trying to settle the question overnight"". In any case  if the Libyan People's Congress can ratify a complicated constitutional and political question of a merger with the Syrian Arab Republic in a few weeks  I feel justified in asking why it needs four years to ratify a comparatively simple agreement already negotiated between the two Governments.76.	Secondly  it is  of course  true that the Conference on the Law of the Sea has not yet completed its work  including the question of delimitation. But the world did not stop while the Conference proceeded with its discussions. Neither Libya  nor any other country  has ceased its own exploration activities. The proposed convention  in any case  does not inhibit current international law and practice  and Malta's activities were fully in compliance with those requirements. Besides  as I have already indicated  the proposed convention does foresee the necessity of interim arrangements until final agreement is reached.77.	Thirdly  Libya says it is ready to go to the International Court of Justice. Respectfully  I point out that this has been confirmed to us  repeatedly and at the highest level  over the past four years. But no action has been taken as yet  and the negotiated agreement remains unratified by Libya.78.	Fourthly  Libya says it did not use force against Malta  and does not intend to do so. To this fundamental point I have to reply at somewhat greater length.79.	It is  of course  true that no foreign forces landed in Malta  although we judged it prudent to take precautionary measures. But  as the representative of Libya would appreciate  through the actual experience gained by his country from the 30 or so off shore oil wells it is currently exploiting  expensive drilling operations are not voluntarily suspended before the operation is considered complete. The fact is that Malta's solitary oil drilling operation  well inside Malta's side of the median line  had to suspend operations under the threat of armed Libyan naval units pointing menacing guns against defenceless citizens and expensive equipment.80.	The telex sent on 20 August 1980 by the Libyan Minister for Oil  to the captain of the oil rig  stated explicitly:""We hereby warn you that your company should immediately refrain from performing any drilling operations  withdraw the rig and leave the area; otherwise  the Jamahiriya is obliged to prevent your company from doing so by all means including force  on the ground that what is being done by your company is a hostile action against a sovereign State.""81.	I also happen to have available photographs of the Libyan warshipâshowing its identification numberâtaken by officials of the Maltese Government from the rig that was being threatened by the Libyan warship. Those photographs were witnessed by citizens of other countries and give the exact geographical co-ordinates and the date and time when the photograph of the incident was taken.82.	There is therefore no question but that force was used and that its use is still being threatened. The rig did not leave of its own accord  and any other rig in future will need either armed protection or an assurance from Libya that it will not be threatened. We prefer the latter alternative.83.	The fifth and final point is the claim by Libya that ""the area"" is disputed. But in order for a dispute to be genuine and not just a convenient pretext  it has to have some foundation. In Libya's case there is none; neither historical rights  nor geological criteria  nor contemporary international law and practice support Libya's unfounded claim. Libya itself seems to have so little faith in its own arguments that  as I have indicated  it has failed to honour its commitment to go to the International Court. Malta has been ready to do so from the very beginning.84.	Our latest contribution to an equitable accord was the honest though rather unusual step of declaring in advance that the benefits of any activities carried out by Malta would accrue to Libya if the International Court of Justice found in favour of Libya. But Libya remains singularly deaf to all approaches except those that put Malta in an economic strait jacket.85.	However  that is in the past and  despite the costly set-back inflicted on Malta  it is to the future that we must look. The issue has now been narrowed to two essential points. May I therefore  through you  Mr. President  ask the representative of Libya two specific questions.86.	First  is he publicly and solemnly willing to commit his country  in an appropriate manner  to go to the International Court this year?87.	Secondly  is he publicly and solemnly willing to state before this Assembly or in any other appropriate manner that his country will not in future use force against peaceful exploration activities carried out by Malta  under current international law and practice  on its side of the median line  subject to the understanding given by my Prime Minister and without prejudice to the claims of either side until the demarcation issue is settled by agreement or by legal process in accordance with the relevant provisions of the proposed law of the sea convention?88.	If the representative of Libya is willing to give a categorical answer to those two specific questions the whole world will be able to determine whether Libya's protestations of friendship towards Malta's independence and prosperity have any practical content  and the Security Council would then be guided accordingly.89.	In that perspective I am pleased to express my country's appreciation for the understanding shown by the Italian Government  as outlined in the statement delivered by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Italy on 23 September . It is the end result of a long series of negotiations which were finally concluded successfullyâanother example of the favourable evolution of history. We are endeavouring to negotiate more or less similar approaches with other Mediterranean countries and our efforts have also succeeded with friendly non-aligned Yugoslavia. We are dedicated to bringing peace eventually to the Mediterranean and to promoting ever increasing co-operation between Europe and the continents bordering upon it.90.	It is against the background of those objectives that  once again  we are forced to note with increasing dismay the paucity of political progress concerning the plight of the friendly Mediterranean sister island of Cyprus  caught as it is in a vice-like grip by outside influences which tend to ignore the real needs of the indigenous people of the island  who suffer the scars of artificial division brought about principally as a result of the heavy-handed events of 1974.91.	Subsequently  belatedly  the persistent efforts of the Secretary-General managed to break through the procedural morass that had paralysed the intercommunal talks  but it remains to be seen whether the progress that the Cyprus Government seeks and the international community has repeatedly urged will in fact be forthcoming. Malta encourages the restraint now being shown and hopes that a dynamic momentum for progress can be generated.92.	No one would dare to underestimate the complexity of the Middle Eastâthe most recent regrettable conflict is a sharp reminder of itâbut that is no reason to overlook the core of the problem  which persists. The legitimate aspirations of the people of Palestine remain thwarted although they are now recognized and upheld by a quasi-universal consensus. The Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO] remains artificially excluded from the negotiating process even though the future of its people  the Palestinian people  is at stake.93.	Malta was foremost in taking a prominent role in alerting the conscience of previously marginally involved countries and in advocating a comprehensive solution to that problem by forcefully raising its voice  not in the cosy company of the like-minded  but in the halls of the Council of Europe  the Commonwealth and the Socialist International. We therefore welcome the fact-finding mission of the European Economic Community and trust that the combined efforts under way through the United Nations will result in remedying the deficiencies of past and recent approaches  whose main features have been dismal failure and simmering resentment periodically exploding in wide- scale conflict. In the same context  we trust that friendly Lebanon will be spared further suffering and that the status of the Holy City of Jerusalem will henceforth be respected.94.	Despite these and other dark clouds that hover over the Mediterranean and that are fed by the divergent approaches of the major Powers  Malta has resolutely held to its policy of freedom from military attachments. We intend to entrench that policy in our national Constitution and to register it with this Organization under the terms of Article 102 of the Charter.95.	We shall declare the Republic of Malta a neutral State  and shall actively pursue peace  security and social progress among all nations by adhering to a policy of non-alignment and by refusing to participate in any military alliance. Our constant objective will then be to seek resolutely to increase the sectors of co-operation among Mediterranean countries. We have maintained regular contact with all those countries and have sensibly sought to bring them together in preparation for the Madrid meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  of which the Mediterranean is among the most sensitive components.96.	We are strenuously striving to make the dialogue that has been initiated something more permanent  more representative and more action-oriented and to give all Mediterranean countries a better role in the process  since Mediterranean issues can be discussed productively only on the basis of adequate participation by all concerned.97.	We believe there can be little prospect of easing tension in that sensitive region until some adequate mechanism is devised for planning and executing agreed programmes between the largest possible number of interested countries. Otherwise  the present tension and division will deteriorate even further and the concept of the Mediterranean as a zone of peace and co-operation will become more difficult to achieve.98.	Though Asia is far away from Malta geographically  we are very sensitive to its problems. We have watched with interest and encouragement the gradual but steady progress of the countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations  but have noted with concern the events in Kampuchea and Afghanistan. We believe firmly in  and strongly reiterate our support for  the self-determination of peoples  free from outside interference.99.	We regret that the aspirations of the people of Korea to peaceful reunification remain static  while foreign troops remain stationed in the southâa permanent symbol of the country's division and an obstacle to the genuine and open dialogue required for the prospects of reunification. The time has come to generate the necessary momentum by gradually overcoming the economic  administrative and political divisions artificially inherited from the hostilities of the past.100.	The more recent evolution in the region provides an impetus for the reunification of the country and new initiatives could be taken so as to reach an agreement satisfying the wishes of all the Korean people. The death sentence passed on the South Korean opposition leader was a further set-back to the prospects for a popular dialogue. We urge that that retrograde decision should not be implemented.101.	We are closely following the discussions designed to promote the concept of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace. We fully support the realization of that objective and we believe it would receive a major impetus if the suggestion by Madagascar of a summit conference of the interested countries and parties were agreed to and the conference were held at an early date so as to complement and to consolidate the outcome of the scheduled meeting at Colombo.102.	In the obligatory glance backwards at international economic co-operation over the last months  it is only natural to determine whether a common theme has pervaded all the developments. That theme perhaps emerges best from the results of the recently concluded eleventh special session.103.	Where no binding commitment for fundamental structural reform was expected  as in the case of the new international development strategy  some sort of agreement was reached. But no such agreement could be reached in the case of the procedures for the global round of negotiations  precisely because what the developing world is demanding through those procedures is that full commitment to negotiation which has so far eluded all important aspects of the North-South dialogue. We are therefore still facing the original dilemma over the lack of political commitment. The special session did  however  have the merit of clearly identifying as never before the exact source of that lack of political commitment. Indeed only a very small number of countries persist in believing that the present inequitable and unjust international economic system can evolve in a piecemeal and haphazard fashion. The vast majority of nations are now committed to a bolder and more thorough approach. It is to be hoped that the hesitant few will agree to join the common endeavour and permit the global negotiations to commence early in the new year.104.	That brings me back to Ambassador von Wechmar's opening statement and to some considerations which I expressed in this same hall last year. He very rightly inquired whether everything had been done to reach a consensus and pointed out the enormity of our task and the limitations of our time. Last year I also asked that some consideration be given to devising techniques to render the process of attaining a consensus more rapid and that the consensus itself should not be set at so low a degree of common accord that it became almost devoid of content. I also felt that a process for ensuring an adequate follow- through on decisions reached by consensus should be devised to review progress at reasonably spaced out intervals. I believe we should encourage flexible and variable approaches this year under the pragmatic leadership of the President  which could usefully set a pattern for the future. If we could  with the help and experience of the Secretariat  improve our working methods which are quite haphazard at the moment  we should all benefit  as would our Organization  which desperately needs a new lease of life.105.	The fact is that  unless universal and regional institutions prove able to meet the challenges with which they are faced  the course of world politics may well assume a sinister direction towards head-on collision. The signs are already there; we should act now to avert possible calamity.106.	As we pass through this dark period in international relations  we may perhaps derive some comfort from the old truism that the darkest hour comes before dawn. At this session we have at least thrown the collective spotlight of our analysis in an attempt to penetrate the darkness. Now it is up to all of us to act  each one in accordance with his capacity and responsibility towards the international community. If we fail  we shall all be losers.107.	As far as Malta is concerned  I believe that what I have stated above is sufficient practical and unequivocal evidence of our deep  abiding faith in this Organization and of our credentials to serve its highest organs.108.	Malta may be one of the smallest and least armed States Members of the United Nations but we do have the moral fibre unflinchingly to defend the principles of law and justice from being threatened from any source  no matter how strong  no matter how near or far that source may be."
"91",4699,"MMR",35,1980,"ï»¿146.	The delegation of Burma would like to congratulate you most warmly  Mr. President  on your election to the presidency of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly and to assure you of our fullest cooperation in the discharge of your responsibilities. We are confident that the wealth of experience and wisdom which you bring with you will prove valuable in guiding us successfully through the present session.147.	We also take this opportunity to convey our tribute to the outgoing President  Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim  for his distinguished and sagacious stewardship of the thirty-fourth session of the Assembly.148.	It gives us great pleasure to welcome in our midst the delegations of the Republic of Zimbabwe and of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. We offer them our warm felicitations and friendly greetings on the occasion of their admission to the family of the United Nations.149.	We are gathered here at a time when the world is passing through a critical juncture in international relations  both politically and economically. The perilous trend in world developments that have been worsening for some time has now reached an acute phase  and such developments now pose a grave threat to international peace and security.150.	We are today witnessing a decline in the respect for and observance of the basic principles and obligations we have assumed under the Charter  principles which the world Organization has laboured so unremittingly to uphold and sustain as the pillars of international order. This is frequently evident in the increasing recourse to force  military intervention and interference in the internal affairs of sovereign States  as well as in the undermining of international norms and principles which have long governed the conduct of relations between States. As a result  new sources of tension and dangerous areas of crisis have emerged on the world scene which defy virtually all efforts at finding acceptable and reasonable solutions.151.	Recent political and military events have brought about changed strategic circumstances in our Asian regional neighbourhood. It is in the nature of such developments that a major move by one great Power invariably provokes a countermove by the other great Power  thereby exposing the world to the dangers of a conflict which could well result in world disaster. These have found expression in the present surge of rearmament on the one hand and the emergence of the spectre of the cold war on the other.152.	In the domain of international economic relations  the serious ailments which afflict the world economy have their adverse impact on all nations. At the same time the structural imbalance of the international economic system continues to aggravate the relations between developed and developing countries.153.	All in all  the broad trends which have been described are indicative of the difficult and daunting circumstances the world community faces and must tackle as it enters the decade of the 1980s.154.	Taking the broadest view of the basic changes now going on behind the march of events  we can only conclude that the whole international system is undergoing an enormously important transformation. We now stand at a decisive turning point in world history. What we require is to direct and influence the evolutionary process in a way that is positive and conducive to furthering the interests of mankind. All nations have a common stake in overcoming the present threats to world peace and human survival and giving strong support to the work of the Organization to further the unity of mankind in a vast and vital collective effort. At this historical moment it is essential that a better world of peace  justice and security emerge.155.	Burma considers that today the United Nations alone provides a basis and a hope for such a world order and is the most broad-based international centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in pursuit of peace  friendly relations and cooperation among nations.156.	In common with other nations  Burma is deeply concerned at the deteriorating situation in international relations. In the forefront of our concern is the worsening relations between the great Powers  which also extend to the outlying arenas of their power interests. In military and economic terms  the great Powers stand apart from the rest of us. The disproportionate military and economic power which they possess imposes a very great responsibility on each of them individually to resist the natural temptations of self-interest and the arrogance of power and to show exemplary dedication to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.157.	Among the most regrettable effects of the present strains in great Power relations is the status of disarmament negotiations. these strains dissipated most of the momentum gained from the last two decades of the disarmament dialogue. The fate of the SALT II Treaty  which the Assembly welcomed last year  is now in doubt. This prompts serious concern  as hopes for limiting the arms race and for nuclear non-proliferation hinge very much on the outcome of the SALT Treaty. Without continuing negotiations  or a SALT treaty  there would be nothing to control the pace of technological advances in weapons systems. As a result  the great Powers may turn once more to unrestrained competition and the arms race may get out of control. The delegation of Burma very much hopes that the SALT II Treaty will be ratified in due course  believing that it would be conducive to international stability.158.	We also view with concern the long delay in the achievement of a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. Concrete steps towards cessation of the qualitative improvement and development of nuclear weapons can only proceed effectively on the conclusion of a total test ban. We therefore urge the nuclear Powers which are engaged in current tripartite negotiations to make a sustained effort to contribute to the successful conclusion of a draft treaty for submission to the Committee on Disarmament.159.	At the same time  it is a disturbing fact that there have been recent reports of the use of chemical agents in certain areas of conflict. Whether or not those reports are substantiated  negotiations on an effective  total and universal ban on chemical weapons assume major importance and urgency. Eight years have passed since the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development  Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction was concluded  and parties to it are committed to the conclusion of a chemical weapons ban. We share the general disappointment at the lack of any material progress towards agreement on the prohibition of chemical weapons.160.	The question of disarmament is of universal concern. Recent events have cast a shadow on prospects for early progress and we are no nearer to our professed goal of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control. The pace of disarmament negotiations during the coming decade will be determined by the nature and extent of political factors in the international situation and whether they are favourable or otherwise. This underlines the fact that any serious worldwide disarmament strategy  to be effective  must be accompanied by sustained efforts to eliminate tensions and by measures and initiatives aimed at increasing international confidence and security.161.	I should now like to focus on three key areas of the world where the situations present an imminent threat to international peace arid security. I refer here to the situations in Kampuchea  Afghanistan and the Middle East region.162.	Kampuchea and Afghanistan have been on the anxious minds of representatives for quite some time  and the situations in those two strife torn countries are once more before the Assembly. Burma ventures to think aloud and say that whenever the Assembly considers such items  it is of vital importance that it take the global perspective and search deeply for the root causes instead of seeking the mere surface symptoms.163.	Kampuchea and Afghanistan are not  in our view  isolated cases or independent happenings. The root causes of their troubles are inseparably linked with those which generate tension and disturbances elsewhere. They arise in some cases from rivalry among small nations and in others from rivalry among the great Powers and their readiness to arm and abet small unwary nations or groups in order to expand their spheres of interest.164.	As matters stand today  many questions of a fundamental nature arise in the consideration of the issues arising from the situations in Kampuchea and Afghanistan. The firm and consistent policy of Burma is that it cannot condone the employment of armed intervention by an outside foreign Power in the internal affairs of another independent sovereign State to bring about a change in the Government of that State. Any breach of the basic principles of international relations as enunciated in the Charter creates a dangerous precedent that may have wide-ranging implications and far-reaching consequences for the world community.165.	It is the hope of the delegation of Burma that conditions will mature sufficiently in time in both countries to enable a political solution to be found  based on the international recognized principles of respect for the sovereignty  territorial integrity and independence of States. We are strongly convinced that these principles constitute an honourable basis for maintaining friendly relations between States. Our wish is to see the restoration of unity to the peoples of Kampuchea and Afghanistan and the return of conditions in which they can work out their own destiny free from all external interference and pressures.166.	In the Middle East  we are clearly facing a dangerous situation of rapidly unfolding events and mounting crisis. The positions of the disputing parties in the region remain poles apart. On the one side  there is continuing intransigence and a penchant for unilateral actions; on the other  there is growing inflexibility. Such attitudes can only contribute to a hardening of hostility and long-term bitterness between the parties involved. In these circumstances  where there is an obvious lack of political will  it is difficult to see how conciliation can be achieved in the quest for a peaceful solution.167.	The position of Burma on various aspects of the Middle East problem has clearly been stated at past sessions of the General Assembly and remains unchanged. We do not underestimate the highly emotional and complex difficulties inherent in the situation. None the less  we venture to say that the continuing dispute should be seen in the context of long-term relations in the region. As we see it  realism calls for some serious rethinking by both parties  Israeli and Arab  on the need to try to achieve an understanding on the basis of tolerance and mutual respect for one another's people. Without mutual recognition of each other's legitimate rights  it will not be possible to achieve a just and lasting settlement in the Middle East.168.	The brighter side of the general international scene is the end of the bitter struggle for majority rule by the people of Zimbabwe. The independent Republic of Zimbabwe has now emerged as a full-fledged member of the international community. To its people go our heartiest congratulations and best wishes. The progress that has been made in Zimbabwe is due to the commendable spirit of compromise shown by all parties concerned. Credit is also due to the British authorities for their realistic and farsighted approach to the question of Zimbabwe. We should also like to extend to them our sincere congratulations on the successful conclusion of an extremely delicate task.169.	The delegation of Burma hopes that the solution in Zimbabwe will help engender the same spirit of accommodation and lead the way towards independence in Namibia. To our mind  it is imperative to break the Namibian deadlock before that country becomes wholly engulfed in war.170.	We regret that in South Africa the overall pattern of apartheid has undergone no real change. This policy of institutionalized and legalized racialism remains the most persistent abuse of human rights and explains the recurrent violent unrest which continues to make the South African political scene.171.	As far as the world economy is concerned the outlook is sombre. Leading authorities have voiced serious anxiety over the deepening world economic crisis. We share this international concern  as no country is immune from the disruptive pressures of a declining world economy. The continuing crisis is a problem of interaction among social  political and economic forces. This brings more than ever into perspective the need to go beyond isolated and piecemeal approaches in tackling major issues of economic import.172.	In a world of nations grown so closely interdependent  a coordinated and comprehensive effort at international cooperation for mutual benefit and advancement is imperative.173.	Inflation  recession  protectionism  unemployment  payments deficitsâthese are words which arise in describing the general character of the world economic scene. Since the start of the energy crisis and the breakup of the international monetary system in the 1970s  there has been no cohesion in the international economic mechanism. Conflicting economic interests among and between nations  rising protectionism and restrictive policies mark the desperate search for economic security. There has been no reversal of these adverse trends and the intervals of relative stability have been brief and uneasy. A development strategy for the coming decade would need a much more favourable environment.174.	Major economic challenges facing the world community are the problems of population growth  shortages of food and energy and environmental pressures. The question facing the world community is whether man has the ability to reorganize the material conditions of life so as to create a reasonable international economic system.175.	We meet in the Assembly just after the eleventh special session  devoted to the consideration of global economic issues and negotiations and international economic cooperation for development. Such cooperation can be secured only if all the nations concerned can forsake their set attitudes  which originate in the mutual apprehension and  in part  in the economic insecurity which hold them in their grip  and make a generous move towards more flexible positions in a spirit of mutual need and mutual responsibility. It is common knowledge that mutually advantageous exchanges of goods and services between countries are the foundation of both the prosperity and the peace of the world.176.	Perhaps in voicing the main concerns of Burma on the international situation as the world community faces the decade of the 1980s  we have presented a rather pessimistic picture of the world situation. We have merely given the hard facts of life as we see them. Of course  we must all make what contribution we can towards the solution of world problems and hope that what we say or resolve here will weigh at least a little with those Powers on which the solutions will largely and ultimately depend."
"92",4755,"MNG",35,1980,"ï»¿Allow me  Sir  to congratulate you sincerely on your unanimous election to the lofty post of President of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. I am sure that your many talents and rich experience will help you to make a valuable contribution to the work of this session.99.	I would also join previous speakers in paying a tribute to Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim for the work he did as President of the thirty-fourth session and of the special sessions of the General Assembly.100.	Our delegation would like to take this opportunity heartily to congratulate Saint Vincent and the Grenadines on its admission to membership of the United Nations.101.	The present session of the General Assembly is being held at the juncture of two decades  in the year of the thirty-fifth anniversary of the victory of the forces of peace and socialism over fascism and militarism. In our view  that fact will help us properly to concentrate on the main issues of the present world political situation in terms of drawing the necessary lessons from the past and correctly defining the tasks of the international community in implementing the aims and purposes of the Charter and strengthening peace and international cooperation.102.	During the last three and a half decades since the end of the Second World War  positive profound changes have taken place in world development. This is primarily related to the creation of the world socialist system and the steady growth of its might  and to the historic successes achieved by the forces of national and social liberation. In this connection our delegation wishes specifically to underline the historic importance c military and strategic parity that has been attained by the socialist world with the West with the purpose of ensuring a peaceful future for mankind.103.	The 1970s are significant in that the ""cold war"" policy was overcome  relaxation of international tension ensued and the principle of peaceful coexistence of States having different social systems was further confirmed.104.	On the other hand  recent events provide clear evidence that the forces of imperialism and reaction refuse to put up with the strengthening of the positions of socialism and the progressive changes occurring in the world. They are desperately trying by every means to hinder the objective course of history  and they have set for themselves the adventurist goal of obtaining military superiority over the socialist world  which is the main bulwark of the forces of peace  national independence  democracy and progress. They have embarked upon a course of unprecedented escalation of the arms race and of undermining the very foundations of international detente.105.	Of particular danger to the cause of peace is the decision of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] to produce and deploy in Western Europe the new American medium range nuclear weapons  as well as the creation by the United States of the so-called rapid deployment forces designed to commit acts of aggression in various parts of the world. A long-term programme of increasing the military expenditure of the NATO countries has been adopted.106.	Moreover  the United States recently adopted what is called Presidential Directive 59  which in essence advocates the concept of so-called limited nuclear warfare  and the possibility of using nuclear weapons and the permissibility of waging nuclear war have begun to be discussed with dangerous frivolity at high official levels in that country.107.	The reactionary forces are carrying out their actions against peace  security  freedom and the independence of peoples under the false pretext of fighting against a bogus ""Soviet military threat""  and they are thus grossly distorting the peace-loving nature of the foreign policy of the Soviet Union and the socialist community  which fully conforms to the vital interests of all mankind.108.	The particular danger of the present situation lies in the active collusion of the forces of imperialism and hegemonism based on anti-Sovietismâin other words  based on hostility to the cause of the national and social liberation of peoples. Beijing's antisocialist  anti-Soviet course encourages the most reactionary forces of imperialism and abets the new outburst of aggressiveness and adventuristic trends in their actions.109.	Nevertheless  imperialism and reaction are today being countered by the forces of peace  democracy and socialism  which are able appropriately to rebuff their intrigues. There exist objective conditions which will not permit a return to the ""cold war"" and would forestall the danger of a nuclear conflict. The growing economic and defence potential of true socialism and its ever-increasing international influence serve as a reliable bulwark in the struggle of peoples to strengthen peace and international cooperation. The World Parliament of the Peoples for Peace now being held in Sofia  the capital of the People's Republic of Bulgaria  is a particular case demonstrating the immense scope of this struggle. Representatives of more than 130 States and 100 public organizations are discussing there such vital issues as strengthening peace  developing international cooperation and disarmament  and so on.110.	Detente has become more deeply rooted in international relations and real conditions exist for it to remain as the prevailing tendency. This is demonstrated  in particular  by the results of the meetings and talks held by Leonid I. Brezhnev  General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and President of the Praesidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR  with President Giscard d'Estaing  of France  last May and subsequently by the leaders of the Soviet Union with those of the Federal Republic of Germany. The Mongolian delegation is of the view that  in the light of the adventuristic actions of the ultra-reactionary forces of imperialism and hegemonism  the outcome of these meetings acquires particular importance.111.	The Mongolian People's Republic  like other socialist States  believes that the strengthening of detente will not come about by itself. Detente will be preserved and strengthened only in a resolute and persistent struggle by the forces defending the cause of peace  national independence and social progress.112.	The first material condition for strengthening detente and peace is to halt the arms race and move towards genuine disarmament. These objectives should be achieved by preserving the existing military and strategic parity on the basis of steadily declining arsenals of weapons and on that basis of strict observance of the principles of equal security for all sides.113.	The numerous constructive initiatives of the socialist countries are aimed at the achievement of these goals. These initiatives as a whole have been reaffirmed and further developed in the declaration and the statement of the Political Consultative Committee of the States Parties to the Warsaw Treaty of 15 May 1980.114.	The States parties to the Warsaw Treaty have proposed to begin practical negotiations immediately and  where negotiations have commenced  to complete them effectively in order to reach agreements on concrete measures on a wide range of problems  starting with the reduction of the military budgets of the big Powers and coming to such important measures as full and comprehensive prohibition of nuclear weapons testing  halting the production of nuclear weapons and the gradual reduction of nuclear stockpiles until their complete elimination  prohibition of the creation of new types and systems of mass destruction  banning of chemical weapons and eliminating existing stockpiles and prohibition of radiological weapons and others.115.	In the field of political measures  the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty have proposed the convening of a conference on military detente and disarmament in Europe and the holding in the near future of a summit meeting of the leaders of States of all the regions of the world for the purpose of considering the problems of eliminating the hotbeds of international tension and preventing war. They have also put forward concrete proposals aimed at making the forthcoming meeting at Madrid a success  so that its outcome will confirm and articulate in practice the provisions of the Final Act of the Helsinki Conference.116.	In its statement of 20 May this year the Government of the Mongolian People's Republic fully supported these initiatives as a new constructive contribution by the Warsaw Treaty Organization to the cause of strengthening peace and security and developing international cooperation in Europe and throughout the world.117.	These constructive steps of the socialist countries have recently been effectively supplemented by a new exceptionally important initiative of the Soviet Union that talks be started forthwith on the question of medium range nuclear weapons  organically connecting it with that of American forward based nuclear weapons. The Mongolian delegation is of the view that the other side should display a constructive approach to this vitally important issue.118.	The proposal for the item entitled ""Urgent measures for reducing the danger of war""  submitted by the Soviet delegation on 23 September this year for consideration at the current session of the General Assembly  contains the most concrete and practical proposals relating to renunciation of the expansion of military and political groupings  the increase of armed forces and conventional weapons and relating also to the strengthening of security guarantees of nonnuclear States and reaching an agreement on a general and comprehensive ban on nuclear weapon tests. The proposed measures are of an urgent and pressing character. The Mongolian delegation believes that the General Assembly is duty bound to undertake concrete measures based on the provisions of the draft resolution proposed by the Soviet delegation.119.	The good will and determination of the socialist States effectively to promote military detente are being supported by practical measures. The Government of the Mongolian People's Republic  like other peace-loving forces  considers that the unilateral withdrawal by the Soviet Union from the territory of the German Democratic Republic of 20 000 troops  1 000 tanks and other military equipment is of paramount importance for the creation of an atmosphere of mutual trust  which is so vital to the realization of measures to reduce military confrontation in Europe. Similarly  the Mongolian People's Republic commends the new proposals of the socialist countries parties to the Vienna Talks on Mutual Reduction of Forces  Armaments and Associated Measures in Central Europe. As the main measure in the first stage  it is being proposed that the armed forces of the United States and the USSR stationed in Central Europe be reduced by 13 000 and 20 000 troops respectively.120.	The conclusion of a world treaty on the non-use of force in international relations is of great importance for strengthening detente  the security of States and the creation of favourable conditions for halting the arms race and for disarmament.121.	It is in the same spirit that the Mongolian People's Republic supports the proposal of the nonaligned countries to draft a declaration on non-interference in the internal affairs of States."" The activation of expansionist and hegemonistic forces is making this issue particularly pressing.122.	Turning to regional measures for strengthening the security of States  my delegation would like to emphasize that the struggle for turning the Indian Ocean into a zone of peaceâwhere the United States of America continues to step up its military presenceâis acquiring particular urgency. The Conference on the Indian Ocean to be held in 1981 should pronounce itself with utmost clarity on the key issue  namely the the elimination of military bases in that region.123.	On the specific problems of halting the arms race and disarmament  the Mongolian delegation would like to emphasize the enormous military and political significance of the speedy ratification of the Treaty on the Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms  SALT II. The United States should heed the will of the international community  which demands the earliest ratification of that treaty. Our delegation further emphasizes the urgency of the problem of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. The actions of those circles which not only failed to accede to this important instrument but also did everything to provoke and encourage others to acquire nuclear weapons arouse serious concern throughout the world community. The situation is aggravated by the fact that the aggressive regimes of Tel Aviv and Pretoria as well as some other circles do not conceal their intention to acquire that weapon of mass destruction. We deem it necessary that additional effective measures be taken to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. A positive assessment can be made of the Second Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  which  having reaffirmed the importance and viability of the Treaty and the need to ensure its universality  has favoured a further strengthening of the non-proliferation regime.124.	We support the prohibition of radiological weapons and express the hope that the Committee on Disarmament will be able at its next session to complete the elaboration of an appropriate draft convention.125.	The problem of banning chemical weapons is becoming more urgent in view of the continuing reports of the intentions of certain Western countries  under various false pretexts  to improve this weapon of mass destruction and increase its production. We hope that the firm intention expressed by the Soviet Union and the United States in the Committee on Disarmament to continue their persistent efforts in the search for mutually acceptable solutions to the problem of prohibiting chemical weapons will help to clear the way towards attaining this vital goal.126.	The arms race not only has enormous negative socioeconomic consequences  it also results in devastating effects on the environment as well. Today  when the testing of different types of weapons  including nuclear weapons  is still being carried out in the world  when the means of annihilation of every living being on earth are being accumulated in ever greater quantities  the question of protecting nature from the dangerous consequences brought about by the unchecked arms race becomes an urgent issue of the day.127.	It is precisely in this light that the Government of the Mongolian People's Republic sees the primary importance of the new agenda item entitled ""Historical responsibility of States for the preservation of nature for present and future generations""  proposed by the Soviet Union  and fully supports this initiative. The adoption by the General Assembly of a resolution  the draft of which was proposed by the Soviet delegation  would be an important step in the development of international cooperation  in protecting nature on our planet  and in limiting and eliminating the pernicious consequences of the arms race on nature.128.	The Mongolian People's Republic  as before  supports the early convening of the World Disarmament Conference and favours the extension of the mandate and the enhancing of the work of the Ad Hoc Committee on the World Disarmament Conference.129.	The international situation in Asia is being influenced by various forces. The prevailing feature of the political life on that vast continent is the further strengthening of the positions of the forces of peace  international cooperation  national independence and social progress.130.	Socialist and revolutionary democratic gains are being further consolidated in the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  the Lao People's Democratic Republic  the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and the People's Republic of Kampuchea. Fraternal cooperation and interaction by the Soviet Union and other socialist States of Asia have a most favourable effect on the political situation on the continent. A positive role is played by the peace-loving policy and realistic positions of many other countries of Asia  above all the Republic of India.131.	On the other hand  the forces of imperialism  hegemonism and militarism are intensifying their dangerous activities on that continent. The ruling circles of the United States are working towards formalizing a kind of triple alliance directed against the socialist countries  the forces of national and social liberation  against all that is progressive  just and reasonable.132.	The Mongolian People's Republic  which 35 years ago made its contribution to the restoration of peace in Asia and the Far East  calls upon the peoples of Asia to draw a lesson from the past  to be vigilant and wary of the various designs of the reactionary forces. It is a fact that while preparing for the Second World War  Fascist and militarist circles concealed their criminal actions under the false pretext of fighting against the ""communist threat"". It is clear to everyone that the same trick is being used today when the enemies of peace and international cooperation trumpet the non-existent ""Soviet military threat"" or the ""threat from the North"".133.	These very forces cause the further deterioration of the longstanding Middle Eastern crisis  organize the undeclared war against the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan  exert open armed and other pressures on the nations of IndoChina and flagrantly interfere in the internal affairs of the States members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Regrettably  there are certain circles in Asia which  to say the least  connive at such aggressive attempts to the detriment of the vital interests of peace and security of the peoples of the continent  including their own peoples.134.	The Mongolian People's Republic  as before  consistently strives for the safeguarding and consolidating of peace and security in Asia through the collective efforts of all States of the continent. The Bandung Conference convened a quarter of a century ago on the initiative of a number of Asian countries  demonstrated the objective necessity and the possibility of uniting all the interested forces on the basis of a common struggle for peace and international cooperation  for national independence and social progress. The spirit of Bandung is gaining particular relevance today.135.	The Government of the Mongolian People's Republic is of the view that the speediest elimination of the hotbeds of tension and conflict is of paramount importance. The annexation of Jerusalem by Israel  its new adventures of aggression and expansion  particularly in regard to the sovereign State of Lebanon  have demonstrated anew the essence of the Camp David deal which is hostile to the cause of the Arab peoples. At the seventh emergency special session  on the Palestinian question  the Mongolian delegation once again reaffirmed the principled position of its Government on the comprehensive settlement of the Middle East problem in the interest of ensuring a durable and just peace in that region. 136.	The Government of the Mongolian People's Republic favours an immediate political settlement of the situation concerning Afghanistan which emerged as a result of intervention against that sovereign State organized by Washington and Beijing through their accomplices. The basis for such a settlement is contained in the proposals put forward by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan on 14 May of this year  Cessation of the counterrevolutionary intervention is the basic prerequisite for achieving that goal. The question of the withdrawal from the territory of Afghanistan of the limited contingent of Soviet troops could be solved in the course of a political settlement if the aggression against the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan is discontinued and such discontinuance is properly guaranteed. In the General Committee  our delegation categorically opposed the discussion in the General Assembly of the so-called question regarding the situation in Afghanistan. Such a discussion would be a gross violation of the spirit and letter of the Charter of the United Nations and constitute flagrant interference in the internal affairs of the Afghan people. No one can change the revolutionary reality irreversibly established in Afghanistan. The United Nations should not allow itself to be embroiled in such an illegal and hopeless affair.137.	As a result of the so-called parallel action of Beijing and Washington  a serious hotbed of tension has been created in Southeast Asia. The frontier between Thailand and Kampuchea has been turned in reality into the borderline of yet another ""undeclared war"". In the light of the prevailing situation  my Government readily subscribed to the proposal of the Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam to include in the agenda of the current session of the General Assembly a vital item entitled ""Question of peace  stability and cooperation in Southeast Asia"". It is exactly in this spirit that we fully endorse the constructive programme for the improvement of the political climate in Southeast Asia put forward by the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Laos  Viet Nam and Kampuchea held in July this year in Vientiane.138.	We consider that only the People's Revolutionary Council of Kampuchea  which enjoys the support of the entire Kampuchean people  should occupy its rightful seat in the United Nations and in other international organizations. The very fact that Kampuchea's seat in the United Nations is occupied by people who do not represent anyone at all cannot but undermine the prestige of this Organization.139.	The inclusion in the agenda of the current session of the General Assembly of the concocted question of ""The situation in Kampuchea"" against the will of the legitimate Government of the People's Republic of Kampuchea is an intolerable interference in the internal affairs of that sovereign State. It is the duty of the Organization to strive for the reduction of tension in Southeast Asia and therefore resolutely to counter any manoeuvres interfering in the internal affairs of the States in the region and to promote among them a normalization of the situation and the establishment of good neighbourly relations.140.	Our people resolutely condemn the persecution and repression being committed by the military regime of Seoul against the democratic forces in South Korea. The situation prevailing in that part of the country demands the speediest implementation of the provisions of General Assembly resolution 3390 B (XXX) which envisages dissolution of the ""United Nations Command"" and withdrawal from South Korea of foreign troops. The Mongolian People's Republic  as before  endorses the constructive proposals by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea directed at the reunification of Korea by peaceful means without any outside interference.141.	I cannot but express the deep concern of my delegation at the worsening armed conflict between Iran and Iraq. The interests of peace and tranquillity in that sensitive region and the wellbeing of the two peoples demand restraint and statesmanship on the part of the leaders of these countries to prevent a further deterioration of the situation.142.	The date of 14 December this year will mark the twentieth anniversary of the adoption by the General Assembly of the historic Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples . Today we welcome the emergence of the sovereign State of Zimbabwe as the most significant event of this jubilee year in the realization of the ideals of the Declaration. The initiative of the Soviet Government  which proposed to the General Assembly the adoption of that Declaration  involved the United Nations in one of the revolutionary events of the post-war period  namely  the elimination of the colonial system of imperialism.143.	The disintegration of the colonial system gave a fresh impetus to the broadening of the movement of nonaligned countries  which today plays an important role in the struggle against imperialism and colonialism  and for peace and international security.144.	We consider that the question of full implementation of the provisions of the Declaration on decolonization has not lost any of its urgency. This is particularly true in relation to the elimination of the colonial heritage in the political  economic  social and other spheres.145.	The vestiges of colonialism and the neo-colonialist manoeuvres of the imperialist Powers continue to poison the international atmosphere. The recent turn of events in southern Africa demonstrates that the imperialist forces time and again engage in attempts to preserve the colonialist and racist regimes as a stronghold for the suppression of the struggle of peoples in that region for national and social liberation.146.	The Mongolian People's Republic resolutely supports the national liberation struggle of the people of Namibia  carried on under the leadership of its legitimate representative  the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO]. Likewise we stand for the strengthening of the economic embargo against the racist regime in South Africa and we support the struggle of the people of the Republic of South Africa for their political and social rights and freedoms.147.	At present the national liberation movement of the peoples is extending to new spheres of social development. It is in this light that my delegation sees the struggle of the developing countries for the establishment of a new international economic order. We share the disappointment of the developing countries that the recently held eleventh special session of the General Assembly was unable to carry out the tasks entrusted to it. The main reason for the fruitless outcome of the session was  in our view  the lack of political will on the part of certain Western countries to participate in the cause of restructuring international economic relations on a just and democratic basis. The leading Western Powers not only are unwilling to give up their privileged position in the economic relations of the capitalist system but are also trying to use it as a means of blackmail and pressure and of destabilizing the established international relations in their own selfish political interests.148.	My delegation would like to emphasize that the adoption by developing countries of progressive socioeconomic reforms and the mobilization of their internal resources and potential constitute the most important prerequisite to the creation and development of independent national economies. In this we see also an important means of strengthening the position of every individual country in the struggle for the establishment of just and democratic world economic ties.149.	The Mongolian People's Republic has always attached and continues to attach great importance to the activities of the United Nations as an instrument for strengthening peace and international security and developing peaceful cooperation among nations. In the present situation of growing tension in the world that role of the Organization is still further growing. This makes it indispensable to enhance the effectiveness of its activities on the basis of strict observance of the provisions of the Charter. Conscious of this  my delegation will do its utmost to facilitate the successful completion of the work of the current session in order that it may make an important contribution to the cause of strengthening international detente and fostering an atmosphere of trust  mutual understanding and cooperation."
"93",4797,"MOZ",35,1980,"ï»¿First of all  I should like to express  on behalf of the FRELIMO  Party  the Government and the people of the People's Republic of Mozambique  our profound condolences to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  to the Government and people of the Soviet Union  and in particular to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Byelorussia  on the untimely death of Comrade Pyotr Masherov.63.	Comrade Pyotr Masherov  who at the time of his death was an outstanding and experienced leader of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic and of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  was a true representative of the working class of his country  but most of all he was an internationalist and a good friend of peoples fighting against oppression and for national liberation. As he had fought heroically for the defeat of fascism during his participation in the great patriotic war  so too he contributed throughout the ensuing years to the safeguarding of peace in the world.64.	His demise is a great loss to his country and people  as well as to the international community.65.	On behalf of my delegation  I salute you  Sir  on your unanimous election to the presidency of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. You have assumed the heavy responsibility of presiding over the deliberations of the most universal organ of the international community at a time characterized by ever-growing tensions. However  we are convinced that  guided by the principles and the objectives of the Charter of the United Nations and by your experience in diploma  you will be able to maintain the equity and meet the responsibility required of the presidency of the General Assembly. The delegation of Mozambique assures you at the outset of its full co-operation in ensuring that your endeavours are crowned with success.66.	Allow me also to salute your predecessor  Ambassador Salim Ahmed Salim  who is not only a friend but also a faithful interpreter of the peoples' determination in their struggles for national liberation. The brilliant way in which he conducted the thirty-fourth session of the Assembly  the sixth and seventh emergency special sessions and the eleventh special session  honours all of Africa  and in particular the United Republic of Tanzania  a front-line country  which has once again demonstrated the greatness of its political stature and sense of responsibility through Ambassador Salim  who presided over the General Assembly until the opening of the present session with great knowledge  perceptiveness  nicety and fairness.67.	The growth of the United Nations family is for us a reason for great joy. It is the materialization of the principle that the determination of peoples in their struggle for national liberation is invincible. In liberating themselves from colonialism  the peoples also liberate the colonizer  making possible the establishment of new international relations.68.	The political  economic and social liberation of peoples brings us closer to the objectives of our Organizationâ justice  peace and social progress.69.	It is with deep feeling that we salute the people of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines on their attainment of independence and upon their admission as the one hundred and fifty-fourth Member of the United Nations.70.	During the eleventh special session of the General Assembly  we had an opportunity to salute the independence of Zimbabwe  which gave a new impetus to the liberation struggle of the people of Namibia and South Africa.71.	The people of Namibia  under the rightful leadership of SWAPO  their sole and legitimate representative  have for long years been waging an heroic struggle for national liberation and independence. This struggle  which has inflicted heavy defeats on the army of the racist minority regime of South Africa  is a direct consequence of the blind obstinacy of Pretoria  which insists in perpetuating its policies of colonial domination  racism and apartheid. For the people of Namibia and for the international community  armed struggle became the only alternative remaining by which to force South Africa to comply with the decisions of the United Nations and the legitimate aspirations of the Namibian people.72.	However  SWAPO has always been ready to collaborate in any initiative leading to a peaceful solution of this problem. On many occasions  SWAPO has displayed a spirit of understanding and good sense by making substantial concessions in order to arrive at an acceptable negotiated formula. The whole process of negotiations by the Security Council which culminated in the adoption of resolution 435 (1978) is living proof of this spirit of understanding  good sense and political maturity on the part of SWAPO.73.	With the adoption of that resolution  which approves the United Nations plan for the decolonization of Namibia  we were convinced that we had found the ways and means that would lead us to the independence of the Territory and to the restoration of peace in the area. It is now over two years since that plan was unanimously accepted by the international community. However  South Africa has not yet taken a single positive step since then. To each gesture of goodwill made by the United Nations  to each letter of the Secretary-General  the Pretoria regime has always given evasive answers  accompanied by senseless demands and an unprecedented arrogant attitude which makes even more remote the possibility of achieving a negotiated peace in the Territory.74.	To the positive contributions of the People's Republic of Angola  the Republic of Zambia and the front-line States in general  Pretoria replies with armed aggressions or military threats  and by promoting  encouraging and supporting puppet groups  all aimed at destabilizing those States.75.	It surprises us that certain Western countries can still say that South Africa's replies contain some positive elements. As a matter of fact  what we do find in them is only the irresponsible and aggressive character of the Pretoria regime.76.	Due to the tolerance shown to South Africa  it feels encouraged to leave the dock and to play the judge who demands that the United Nations and the entire international community withdraw their recognition and any other type of support from SWAPO. And it does this in the name of so-called impartiality.77.	What kind of impartiality? Is it an impartiality which allows South Africa to perpetuate its colonial domination over the Namibian Territory? Is it an impartiality which facilitates the unrestrained exploitation of the natural resources and bloody repression and continued aggression against its people and which allows constant aggression against the People's Republic of Angola and the Republic of Zambia?78.	South Africa wants us to embrace a kind of impartiality which can lead us to take the criminal for the victim of a crime. We have just talked about the crimes practised by the South African regime against the Namibian people. But the thorniest problem is the apartheid practices which still prevail in South Africa itself. The Western Powers' failure to face this problem with due seriousness is to be regretted and even condemned. They tell us that apartheid will die a natural death  that the South African people should be patient and that it is not necessary to react violently against apartheid.79.	For how long will they continue to give the South African people that kind of consolation? As a matter of fact  it is not consolation that the people need in South Africa. What they want is to liberate themselves from apartheid  â that kind of Nazism which is applied in South Africa  a Nazism that should revolt the whole world as Hitler's Nazism revolted us in the past. Apartheid and Nazism are based on the same political and ideological principleâthe superiority of one race over the other races. They use the same instruments to suppress and massacre the peoples.80.	How  then  do people in the West differentiate apartheid from Nazism? We  in the People's Republic of Mozambique  have no racial resentments but we believe that the difference  then  lies in the nature of the victims. The direct victims of Nazism in Europe were whites while those of apartheid are blacks. It is forgotten that African people fought against Nazism and fascism. Africans in the north and south died for the liberation of Europe  which was threatened by the fury of the dictatorships. And now  the same Africans are told that South Africa Nazism should not be fought; that time will solve the problem.81.	And as if that were not enough  they even create conditions for the economic and military consolidation of apartheid.82.	South Africa's power and its military self-sufficiency are so great that today the Western countries cannot be proud of their performance with respect to the application of the arms embargo against that racist Republic. The Western Powers  while verbally condemning the Pretoria regime  at the same time prepare conditions for the regime to be immunized against the application of economic mandatory sanctions whenever these are imposed in accordance with Chapter VII of the Charter of our Organization.83.	In the country of apartheid  students are massacred daily in the towns and suburbs of South Africa. Women  men and children are starving in one of the wealthiest countries of the world and one of the major exporters of food. That is the nature of apartheid. That is what the Western press is trying to hide.84.	In the so-called free world  few know about the nature of apartheid and of those who practice it. However  the mass media intoxicate public opinion with the so-called Kampuchea and Afghanistan issues. For them  the aggressions in Lebanon have no more than a statistical significanceâthey are considered normal acts. They make references to those aggressions when they pretend to show their military superiority. In any case  they avoid condemning Israel  which commits the aggressions.85.	The Western Powers do not dare to condemn apartheid and zionism  since imperialism  apartheid and zionism are fundamental chessmen on the chessboard of their strategy of domination and exploitation of the peoples  in which some of their followers and defenders are no more than mere pawns.86.	Despite brutal repression  the South African people  guided by the African National Congress of South Africa  heroically continues to oppose apartheid. Hence  the strikes of the working classes  the growing demonstrations of studentsâoften violentâwhich mobilize an ever-increasing number of the South African people to fight against racial discrimination and apartheid.87.	The African National Congress  when hitting important and strategic economic targets  proves that there are no obstacles which can impede a people's determination to liberate itself and to exercise its rights.88.	Shaken by the struggle being waged against it by the African National Congress  the minority regime tries to introduce cosmetic reforms which in fact will not touch the essence of the system of racial discrimination. It is within that context that  for instance  they conceived the Bantustans  the attempts to create a representative chamber for Coloureds and Indians in the Pretoria Parliament  and so on. That is why certain Western circles  together with the Pretoria regime  try to make us believe that apartheid is reforming itself. Apartheid  like Nazism  can never be reformed; it must be destroyed. It is the duty of the international community to participate by all means in this combat so that Sharpeville  Soweto  Guguletu and Langa shall not be repeated.89.	In the Maghreb area  the Sahraoui people  who are engaged in the struggle for their total liberation  guided by the POLISARIO  Front  are undertaking very important military operations. Theirs is a war imposed on them by the colonial regime of Rabat. It is a struggle in defence of the sacred principles of the OAU and the United Nations. It is a struggle for affirmation of the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic's sovereignty and of the dignity of its people.90.	From Port Louis to Freetown the POLISARIO Front has been achieving successive victories on the military  political and diplomatic fronts. The signing of a peace treaty with Mauritania is the corollary of the justness of the struggle of the people of the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic. That Treaty  far from putting Mauritania in a defeated situation  returned to it the dignity and prestige it enjoyed in the international community before its involvement in the Moroccan adventure.91.	At the summit at Freetown  the majority of the States members of the OAU pronounced themselves favourably on the admission of the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic as a member of the organization. However  another opportunity was given to Morocco to reconsider its position so that bloodshed might be stopped by a peaceful solution and so that Morocco could recover its honour and dignity. But unfortunately the Kingdom of Morocco  imbued with arrogance and with its expansionist mind  once more did not respond to the good gesture of the OAU.92.	The United Nations must condemn the Government of Rabat and demand the withdrawal of its forces of occupation to enable the people of the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic to rebuild its country in peace.93.	On our side  we are honoured by the recent establishment of diplomatic relations between the People's Republic of Mozambique and the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic. Once more we reiterate our solidarity with the people and Government of the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic and the POLISARIO Front.94.	Previous speakers have referred to the critical international situation characterized by the return to the cold war following the emergence of new focal points of conflict and the revival of the aggressive language which characterized the post-war period.95.	It is not by mere chance that this situation came into being. It has been created by imperialism and by military dictatorships. The transnationals  threatened by bankruptcy after the military defeat of American imperialism in Indo-China  are the beneficiaries of this situation. The armaments factories are maintained by war. That is why imperialism creates war where it does not exist. Whenever it is not viable or possible to create a war  they work out propitious conditions for one. Their pretexts are always the same: the need to defend the vital interests of the so-called free world; the need for power equilibrium; the need to guarantee the oil routes; the need to halt the ""communist threat""  which ""violates human rights""  and so forth.96.	But the truth is that imperialism is frightened by the conquests of the peoples in Africa  Latin America and Asia. That is why it tries to impede their advancement. Once again imperialism uses the scarecrow of ""communism"" because it knows that socialism is a system that liberates man and brings immediate progress and happiness to the people. That is why those who now speak so heatedly about the so-called situations in Kampuchea and Afghanistan are the same people who unconditionally supported American imperialism in the criminal war in Indo-China. They are the same people who kept quiet when the dreadful B-52s were emptying tons of bombs over Viet Nam and Laos  and then Cambodia  spreading pain  hunger and death.97.	For them  at that time there were no refugees. The Vietnamese  the Laotians and the Cambodians were not human beings then. According to their logic  peace and international security were not in danger. Today  as they intensify the installation of bases and naval forces in the Caribbean and in the Indian Ocean  which threatens the security of our countries  they want to make us believe that in so doing they are protecting us. From whom are they protecting usâfrom ourselves?98.	The only protection we need is protection from imperialism. It is imperialism that impedes us from controlling our natural resources. It is imperialism that impedes us from developing our countries and prevents us from being happy. The increase in and enlargement of the imperialist nuclear presence in the Indian Ocean is a flagrant violation of General Assembly resolution 2832 (XXVI)  which declares the Indian Ocean a denuclearized zone and a zone of peace  and it is the true threat to international security and peace. All of us must condemn it.99.	In the last two sessions of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean  the collusion of imperialism with certain littoral countries was evident in the attempt to postpone the world Conference on the Indian Ocean  scheduled for 1981  in Sri Lanka. They allege that it is not opportune to hold it because there is a state of tension in the zone.100.	It is precisely because there is tension and war that we are convening that Conference. We want to achieve at that Conference a multilateral treaty that will be able to secure the demilitarization and denuclearization of the entire zone and  at the same time  guarantee the internationally recognized right to freedom of navigation.101.	It is within that framework that the People's Republic of Mozambique supports the convening of a conference at the level of heads of State and Government of the zone of the Indian Ocean and of the big Powers and others  in conformity with the proposal put forward by His Excellency the President of Madagascar  Mr. Didier Ratsiraka.102.	The denuclearization of the Indian Ocean  Africa and the Middle East constitutes a very important step towards the achievement of complete general disarmament.103.	The People's Republic of Mozambique condemns the policies of imperialism  which exploits the difficulties of some littoral States of the Indian Ocean with a view to obtaining concessions enabling it to increase its military presence in the zone and to establish military bases  thus threatening the peace and sovereignty of those same States as well as of their neighbours.104.	The withdrawal of American forces from Guantanamo  which is Cuban territory  is essential in order to safeguard the inalienable rights of peoples and the dignity of our Organization.105.	In El Salvador the people are waging an heroic struggle against a military dictatorship. On behalf of the people and the Government of the People's Republic of Mozambique  I affirm our militant solidarity with the Revolutionary Democratic Front of El Salvador which  despite the threat of direct American intervention  is triumphantly guiding the people of El Salvador to victory.106.	The people of Chile are maintaining resistance against the Fascist regime of Pinochet and improving their organization and strategy in order to tight and overthrow that evil regime.107.	In Nicaragua  the Sandinist Frontâthe revolutionary vanguard of the Nicaraguan peopleâis consolidating the revolutionary process in the country. It is the duty of the international community to guarantee respect for the sovereignty of the Nicaraguan people and to show solidarity with the peoples of El Salvador and Chile in their struggle against the dictatorial regimes.108.	In Asia the people of East Timor are still prevented from exercising freely their right to self-determination and independence because of the annexation and military occupation of their territory by Indonesia  which continues to refuse to conform with the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council. Indonesia's military intervention in East Timor is a flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations and of the most elementary standards of international relations. The Indonesian military occupation of East Timor cannot be taken as a fait accompli; as a matter of fact  the Maubere people  although surrounded by very difficult conditions  continue to demand respect for their sovereignty and territorial integrity through an heroic armed struggle for national liberation. For us  the importance of a people does not depend on the size of its territory  the number of its inhabitants or the amount of its natural resources. People are people  regardless of any statistical data. We admire the determination of a people to be free.109.	The Portuguese Government has just taken a very important decision in stating that it does not recognize the annexation by Indonesia. We hope that Portugal will fulfil its historical responsibility by strongly condemning Indonesia and actively demanding its unconditional withdrawal from the territory  so that the Maubere people may develop their country free from any external pressure or threats. My country reaffirms its unconditional support for and solidarity with the people of East Timor and its vanguard  FRETILIN. 110.	The reunification of Korea  which is demanded by the people of Korea and by the international community  is a pre-condition of the maintenance of peace in that region of Asia. The People's Republic of Mozambique demands the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea in order to facilitate peaceful reunification.111.	An old and thorny problem continues to afflict the Middle East. Israel  supported by the Western Powers  continues to occupy Palestine and the Arab territories  categorically refusing to recognize the inalienable right of the Arab people of Palestine to self-determination and to form its own sovereign State. That is the core of the entire Middle East problem  the global and ultimate solution of which must be in accordance with the Charter and the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.112.	The Camp David agreements were not in accordance with such United Nations instruments. That is why we condemned those agreements and will condemn any future efforts to revitalize them. We condemned the agreements because  as practice proved  they did not consider the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and independence and to the creation of a sovereign State of Palestine. We condemned the Camp David agreements because the PLO was not considered in the process  as it should have been  as the only authentic representative of that people  on the same footing as all other parties at any international conference where the Palestinian problem is being discussed. We condemned the Camp David agreements because their promoters did not contemplate the total withdrawal of Israel from all the occupied Arab territories.113.	Israel's intensification of the repression of the Palestinian people  the imprisonment of the most dedicated Palestinian leaders  the establishment of new settlements in the occupied Arab territories  the constant attacks against the southern part of Lebanon and Syria and the recent declaration of Jerusalem as Israel's eternal capital  all show clearly how vicious the Camp David agreements were and explain Israel's obstinate refusal to seek a global solution to the problem of the Middle East. The People's Republic of Mozambique reaffirms its support for the struggle of the Palestinian people and of the Arab nation for their legitimate rights.114.	The people of East Timor  like the people of Palestine  are waging an heroic struggle against foreign occupation and colonial domination. Indonesia and Israel find themselves on the same side of the barricade. Foreign domination  colonialism and annexation are the essence of the situations prevailing in the Middle East and in East Timor. In the Middle East  as well as in East Timor  people are being oppressed and massacred  but they are people who resist.115.	When we addressed the General Assembly of the United Nations at the eleventh special session  devoted to the new international strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade  we said that the struggle for economic liberation was an integral part of the entire process of the liberation of peoples started by the struggle for political independence.116.	Our opponents continue to be those same ones who tried to convince us that we were not yet ready to run our own countries. They are the same people who point out to us the energy crisis as being the reason for the ever growing gap between the rich and the poor.117.	While daily wasting astronomical sums of money in the armaments race  the imperialists see illiteracy  disease  malnutrition  hunger and misery as the natural fate of the people of the developing countries.118.	That is why  during the eleventh special session  the imperialist countries kept on rejecting all the measures proposed for the radical transformation of existing international economic structures. This proves that those countries are against justice  equity and people's progress.119.	The new development strategy for the next decade which by itself does not correspond to the totality of the demands of the developing countries will be void of content if the developed countries do not have the necessary political will and realism that the present situation requires of us. The situation requires the convening of global negotiations in conformity with the proposals presented by the Group of 77.120.	It was with deep disappointment and preoccupation that we noted the adverse attitude taken recently by the United States of America  the Federal Republic of Germany and the United Kingdom. We appeal to the developed countries and in particular to the aforementioned countries to take a more positive attitude which will permit the adoption of the necessary procedures which will guarantee the convening of global negotiations.121.	The People's Republic of Mozambique supports the declaration of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Group of 77 adopted on 30 September of this year.122.	As regards the co-operation between the developing countries which this declaration refers to  I had an opportunity during the recent special session of the General Assembly to mention the role which my country is playing  particularly in regard to regional co-operation. It is not my intention to repeat what I said. On that occasion I informed the international community of the difficulties with which we are faced as a consequence of our support for and solidarity with the struggle of the people of Zimbabwe. As we also indicated during that session  the report of the Secretary-General on assistance to Mozambique will be discussed in the course of the present session. My duty now is to repeat the appeal which my country made recently in connection with the critical situation resulting from drought which has aggravated the already-mentioned economic hardships.123.	Drought is a misfortune for countries like ours which do not have food security because they do not yet produce enough food for their own domestic consumption. At the present moment two thirds of our country  namely six out of the ten provinces  is heavily affected by the prolonged drought which is affecting one and a half million inhabitants. Besides the lack of rain  there are some additional factors which make the situation even more drastic  namely: lack of hydraulic pumps and their respective spare parts  scarcity of wells  lack of water tanker trucks to provide water to the population and the irregular distribution of the population as a result of the colonial policy of occupying the best lands  while pushing the people into the poorest areas.124.	I will not go into detail since a detailed document of the situation will soon be circulated by the United Nations. However  on behalf of my Government and people  I would like to express our profound gratitude to those countries and organizations which have generously responded to our appeal.125.	The second Conference on the women's decade was held this year at Copenhagen.  Generally speaking  we consider that the results were positive. Representatives from the four corners of the world got together to discuss and define concrete programmes designed to achieve greater integration of women into the global process of development. However  we notice that in certain countries women are still held as appendices of men and their faculties are still being questioned. In our country  since the period of the armed struggle for national liberation  women have been taking an active part in the reconstruction of Mozambique which means that they have the right and the duty to participate in every domain of national activity. This is not merely expressed in the Constitution; today  the Mozambican women participate on an equal footing with men in political  economic and social life.126.	We hope that the programme adopted by the Copenhagen Conference"" will not be just another document with no meaning or one that produces no reaction in our respective countries. We bear in mind that all our political and economic goals necessarily include a true integration of women into the general process of the liberation of mankind.127.	During the decade which will soon begin  the international community will have an opportunity to celebrate  in 1985  the International Year of Youth. This event is of great importance because youth is the guarantee of a nation's future. Youth is a fundamental force in the history of a country through its capacity to assume responsibility for new political  economic  cultural and social values  which respond to a people's aspirations for peace  liberty and development. In the People's Republic of Mozambique youth plays an avant-garde role in national development and in the construction of a socialist society.128.	The People's Republic of Mozambique is prepared to celebrate 1985 in a suitable manner. We hope that the international community will not spare any effort to make the 1985 celebrations successful in bringing about a progressive transformation in young people  as in the case of International Women's Year and the International Year of the Child.129.	At the beginning of this address  we said that Ambassador von Wechmar had assumed the heavy responsibility of presiding over this body at a peculiarly difficult moment characterized by increasing tensions around the world. It is with apprehension that we are following the escalation of war in the Middle East  a region which has been in a state of war for many decades. The present armed conflict between Iran and Iraq could become generalized and increase the threat to international security and peace  as the region is highly sensitive and vulnerable. So we would like to make an appeal to both sides scrupulously to respect the principles guiding the non-aligned movement of which both countries are members. We hope that both Iran and Iraq will observe the principles of the peaceful settlement of disputes  non- resort to violence  respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity  and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries. These are the political  moral and diplomatic standards in accordance with which we think it will be possible to achieve the correct solution of this problem.130.	We want to express our great esteem to Cuba  chairman of the non-aligned movement  and to the Secretary- General of the United Nations for their promptness and for the total readiness they have shown in taking the initiative to bring to an end this armed conflict between two sister States  which  we believe  when united can play a very important role in finding solutions to the problems affecting their region and other developing countries.131. It is  nevertheless  the duty of the international community to be vigilant so that imperialism may not take advantage of the war situation existing between the two countries to interfere in their internal affairs or to reinforce its zones of influence. A luta continua."
"94",4842,"MRT",35,1980,"ï»¿We are pleased to extend to you  Mr. President  at the very outset of our statement the congratulations of the delegation of Mauritania on your election as President of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. Your unanimous election is a tribute to an experienced diplomat  but it is also a token of confidence in the Federal Republic of Germany. My country  which has forged friendly relations with your great nation  both bilaterally and at the level of European-African co-operation  most sincerely welcomes your election.111.	I should like to take this opportunity also to thank your predecessor  Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim  on his enlightened and responsible leadership of the deliberations of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly  which was without a doubt the most active session in the life of the Organization.112.	I would also greet our faithful and determined Secretary-General. Finally  I warmly welcome to the Organization the State of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.113.	In about two months the international community will be celebrating the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  contained in resolution 1514 (XV). That resolution was the first massive  consistent demonstration and the first genuine mobilization of the Organization's determination to accelerate the end of colonialism which indeed was already on its last legs. The year I960 also saw the emergence on the international arena of a large number of new nations  which had thirsted for freedom and had finally won it. The year 1960 saw the dawning of great hopes that with the end of political subjugation  there would be an era of prosperity in a world that had finally recognized that the struggle of the peoples was sacred  that their liberation was inevitable.114.	The Declaration is  in fact  but a reflection in this forum of the admirable historical process that began in Bandung in 1955 and spelled the end of the old colonial empires. The spirit of Bandung and the struggle of the peoples of the world have made possible what had hitherto seemed unimaginable  have made commonplace certain ideas that in the past had been regarded as heretical by the colonial Powers. And  what is more  the Declaration in resolution 1514 (XV) has made possible the rehabilitationâ timidly  it is true  but effectivelyâof ""subversive"" ideas that  thanks to the blood shed by martyrs  have become so natural and so necessary to the equilibrium of the world.115.	But the euphoria did not last. The promises of the 1960s did not outlast the celebrations that marked the attainment of sovereignty in the new nations. There has been a brutal awakening from the splendid dreamâindeed  the delirium. We have had to confront a sad  bitter and sometimes terrible fact: the rejection by the wealthy countries of the just aspirations of the third world.116.	Not everything about the ending of the illusions that followed independence is negative. Indeed  realism triumphed and gave us a more just  truer and often more complex and sadder vision of international relations. Thus the rights of peoples are no longer limited to political dimensions. Scarcely three months after the adoption of the Declaration  the First Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries in February 1961 at Belgrade was to usher in a new era  the era of non-alignment and of the undeniable awakening to the other dimensions of the rights of the peoples of the world  and particularly those of the third world. It was the emergence of a new world  in which the economic  social and cultural rights of the peoples that had formerly been dominated became an objective essential for the maintenance of genuine universal security based on justice and independence for the powerful and the weak  the rich and the poor.117.	Why be surprised then if the aspiration of the peoples of the third world to a reassessment of their wealth should have given rise to the demand for the establishment of a new international economic order? Why be surprised if the aspiration of those peoples to the diversification of centres of interest throughout the world should have given rise to the demand for a new information order? If tomorrow those same peoples  refusing to accept polarization around a single ethical standard  a single civilization  call for the rehabilitation of mankind's cultural values and civilization as a whole  that  too  will be only just.118.	The anti-colonial aberrations of yesterday have become today's self-evident truths. Certainly no one ventures to challenge openly the economic  social and cultural rights of developing peoples. Of course  it is nice to believe in dÃ©tente and in the moral improvement of international political life. Yet the serious problems of the Middle East and southern Africa have dragged on throughout the years. Furthermore  new conflicts in Africa and elsewhere have broken out  complicating the international situation and threatening peace and security.119.	However  since the thirty-fourth session we have had a real cause for satisfaction where Africa is concerned: the independence of Zimbabwe after the implementation of the principle of one man  one vote  and the emergence of a democratically elected African national Power. Thus the maturity and sacrifice of the people of Zimbabwe  together with the undeniable statesmanlike qualities of Prime Minister Mugabe  made it possible for the majority to accede to power in Salisbury in order and dignity  contrary to the alarmist prophesies of the racists 120.	None the less  in our continent there remain many reasons for sadness. In a country next to Zimbabwe there is an implacable regime that openly despises all universal values and maintains in South Africa a system whose excesses have exceeded in horror all other modern examples of fascism.121.	We reiterate our support for the successive decisions of the Credentials Committee of the General Assembly which  year in year out  has regularly refused to accept the credentials of the delegation of the Pretoria authorities. Mauritania will join any plan aimed at making the South African regime act in accordance with the unanimous will of the community of nations and restore the fundamental freedoms of the victims of apartheid. Finally  we hail the struggle of the people of South Africa and express our full solidarity with ANC and all the patriotic forces of that country in their struggle for dignity  freedom and democracy.122.	That same apartheid regime  scorning the decisions of our Organization and the right of the people of Namibia to national independence and territorial integrity  maintains its illegal occupation of the Territory of Namibia by refusing any dialogue with Namibia's legitimate representative  SWAPO.123.	The Islamic Republic of Mauritania  while supporting the framework for the independence of Namibia laid down in Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  condemns the manoeuvres of the South African occupying Power and reiterates its support for the implementation of sanctions against it in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. It is worth reminding the Assembly of Africa's understanding attitude to the settlement plan of the five Western Powers. That plan  which was approved by the Security Council  apparently received the support of South Africa. Unfortunately  despite the efforts of the Secretary- General and the approval of that plan  the South African authorities have not fundamentally changed their position. Experience has shown that all the attempts at a peaceful settlement that the Organization has made have been in vain because of the totally negative attitude of Pretoria. In this connection the Islamic Republic of Mauritania wishes to state that it endorses the Algiers Declaration and Programme of Action adopted on 1 June by the United Nations Council for Namibia at the extraordinary plenary meeting.124.	Our Government thus believes that all possible material and moral support must be given to SWAPO to enable it successfully to oppose any plan to destroy the territorial integrity of Namibia or to install a puppet regime. Our country also reaffirms its full solidarity with all the African front-line countries in the face of the acts of intimidation of the Pretoria regime. We should like especially to extend our fraternal support to the People's Republic of Angola in its resistance to South African aggression against its national territory.125.	By equating Zionism with racism the Organization has simply legalized what South Africa and Israel have long demonstrated in diversifying and accentuating the many forms of co-operation between them. The similarity and the community of interest between the South African and the Israeli forms of colonization need no further proof. In Palestine as in southern Africa we witness the same suicidal arrogance  the same denial of the rights of peoples  the same provocations regarding the United Nations.126.	The General Assembly  which has so often dealt with the problem of the Middle East and specifically with the question of Palestine  is well aware of the facts of a process that began long before the creation of our Organization and which has led to the plundering of the land of Palestine and the oppression of its people. The work of the seventh emergency special session devoted to that problem earlier this year and the outstanding efforts of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People have shed further light on all aspects of this distressing conflict. I should like to take this opportunity to extend our heartiest congratulations to that Committee and in particular to its Chairman  Mr. Falilou Kane  for the application and competence that characterized his work.127.	We do not wish to repeat the statement we made at the emergency special session devoted to Palestine  but we should like to recall the position of our Government on a problem which concerns us directly. Any genuine  just and lasting peace in the Middle East must  in our opinion  satisfy certain conditions.128.	The first is the complete and unconditional withdrawal by Israel from all Arab lands occupied as a result of the aggression of 1967  including the Holy City of Jerusalem.129.	The second is the complete restoration of the inalienable rights of the Arab people of Palestine including their inalienable right to create an independent State in the land of their ancestors.130.	The third is the urgent need to associate the PLO  the sole representative of the Arab people of Palestine  with any settlement in the Middle East. Consequently  we reaffirm our opposition to any partial settlement  especially the Camp David one  which creates confusion in the Arab ranks and causes the Israeli occupying authority to become even more arrogant.131.	The fourth is the rejection of all attempts to make demographic  institutional or other changes in the Arab  Moslem and Christian character of the Palestinian lands which have been occupied  particularly the Holy City of Al Quds.132.	In this connection  the General Assembly in its resolution ES-7/2 and the Security Council in its resolution 478 (1980) of 20 August 1980 reaffirmed their condemnation of Israel's unilateral decision to declare Jerusalem the eternal and indivisible capital of its State. We express our satisfaction and gratitude to those countries which  out of respect for international law  have decided to transfer their embassies from the Holy City.133.	On the other hand  we vigorously condemn Israel's systematic refusal to abide by the decisions of the international community and we believe that the Organization should apply sanctions against Israel and should in particular reject the credentials of its delegation at the present session because of that country's permanent obstruction and its scorn for all forms of international consensus.134.	We condemn Israeli aggression against Lebanese territory and extend to the fraternal people of Lebanon our solidarity with their courageous struggle for the unity  independence and territorial integrity of their country.135.	Our total identification with the tribulations of the Palestinian and other fraternal Arab peoples and our horror at the systematized racism in southern Africa does not make us forget other places in the world where peoples are suffering and dying. The Islamic Republic of Mauritania  whose fraternal solidarity with Iraq is only natural and which welcomed the birth of the Islamic Republic of Iran  is painfully concerned over the fratricidal conflict which is taking place between those two nations in the Middle East. We add our voice to those of the Islamic Conference and the international community and call upon Iraq and Iran to end their bloody confrontation and to settle their territorial dispute in a fraternal  just and lasting manner.136.	In Afghanistan  we find a dangerous source of tension which since the end of 1979 has further complicated a regional situation that was already quite complicated. The Islamic Republic of Mauritania  bound to Afghanistan by spiritual ties deeply rooted in the multi-secular history of the two peoples over past centuries  is very aware of the Calvary of the Afghan nation resulting from the inadmissible occupation of its national territory and the stifling of the sovereignty. Our bonds of solidarity with the Afghan people  and also our concern for the triumph of moral principles in international relations  require that we remain faithful to two principles: first  the refusal to compromise on the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Afghan territory and on the free choice of that fraternal people of the political and social structures which best suit their cultural heritage and development needs  in accordance with resolution ES-6/2 adopted by an overwhelming majority at the sixth emergency special session of the General Assembly; second  total condemnation of the attitude of those who arrogate to themselves this rather strange right to change by force the internal balance of a neighbouring country which they judge to be hostile  a theory which  in our view  is completely reprehensible and dangerous.137.	Turning to South-East Asia  we consider that the occupation of the national territory of Democratic Kampuchea and the aggravation of the indescribable suffering of its people are inadmissible. No ideology and no motive can justify that flagrant and brutal interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign State. We demand  along with the overwhelming majority of the community of nations  the unconditional withdrawal of foreign forces from Kampuchea also so that its people can exercise its full sovereignty.138.	Unfortunately  as I have already stated. International political relations over the years have not led to the acceptance of the right of others to be different or to the refusal of States to succumb to the temptation to use force in the settlement of conflicts.139.	Economic relations as well  despite well-intentioned declaration  have not in fact led to the recognition of the interdependence of nations  the solidarity of peoples  the unity of the world and the need to bring about some sort of balance in economic relations based on equity and on the realities of today. In fact  it is rather difficult today to draw a picture of international economic relations without being pessimistic. The basic truth would show that  since the adoption almost seven years ago of the historic Declaration and Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order  the actual progress achieved has fallen far short of the expectations of the international community  which had unanimously set certain goals for itself.140.	That situation is an insult to the principle of the interdependence of nations and has led to a good deal of disappointment. The most bitter disappointment and the most recent one was the conclusion in haste and confusion of the special session  which ended on the eve of the present session. My Government believes that the lack of agreement on procedural matters concerning the global negotiations can only exacerbate an already serious situation  which cannot help any country or group of countries represented here hope that those delegations which blocked the consensus on this question will  in their own interest and in the interest of the international community  join in this new effort of the community of nations. International solidarity requires that that be done  as does the urgency of outstanding problems.141.	In the field of trade  finance and food  to mention only those areas  the reasons which set off the process of negotiations of the past 10 years remain basically unchanged.142.	The imbalances in international trade  which are the legacy of the colonial era and which were at the origin of the initiative aimed at establishing a system of compensation  continue generally to characterize relations between the North and the South. It must also be pointed outâand we are gratified by thisâthat UNCTAD successfully carried out certain negotiations on a code regarding restrictive commercial practices  a multimodal international transport system and a common fund for raw materials.143.	With respect to monetary and financial problems  it would also seem that the decisions of the Assembly have not been applied. The balance-of-payment difficulties experienced by a growing number of developing countries cannot be separated from the lack of initiatives which continues to characterize this particularly sensitive area of international economic relations.144.	The actions taken thus far have been too timid and too fragmentary to lead to any concrete benefits for the developing countries. Any partial solution  it seems to us  would be vain inasmuch as the present system  by its very nature  is in contradiction with the types of reform which we should like to see carried out. Thus  an increase in financial assistance for development and the lightening of the debt burden  among other things  are only palliatives compared to full and effective participation of the developing countries in the international decision-making process.145.	Another problem which I should like to take up here and which has a special significance and importance concerns agriculture and food. Here again there is a distressing gap between the needs of the international community and its achievements. The developing countries have two thirds of the world population and represent 91 per cent of the agricultural jobs  but produce only 44 per cent of the food of the world. A billion human beings living in 40 countries with a permanent food deficit are in danger of dying if the shortages are prolonged; 450 million human beings are chronically underfedâand all this at a time when the world continues to allot $1 million a minute to military expenses.146.	These figures  which seem to us to beggar comment  make it necessary to give some thought to solutions that can change the situation. The General Assembly has  on a number of occasions  taken up that problem and proposed a series of measures which  if they had been implemented  might have led to a solution. The net results are  in the meantime  easy to tabulate. Apart from the conclusion of a new Food Aid Convention which brings the guaranteed minimum to 7.6 million tons  which is well short of the objective of 10 million tons recommended by the World Food Conference  everything else remains in the area of intentions.147.	Finally  I should not like to conclude my comments on food assistance without mentioning the timely initiative of the Director-General of FAO  Mr. Edouard Saouma  in convening a meeting of donors last month in Rome  with a view to mobilizing food assistance to benefit a certain number of African countries particularly affected this year by the drought. We hope that the commitments made at that meeting will be followed up.148.	. With regard to the negotiations of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  we welcome the results of the ninth session held recently at Geneva. We are thinking particularly of the agreement on a system for exploiting the sea-bed and the informal draft of a convention on the law of the sea. We hope that the tenth session of the Conference  scheduled to begin on 9 March 1981  will at last make possible the conclusion of these difficult negotiations  which  moreover  is in our view an essential factor for the future of international economic relations.149.	Indeed  the approach which is taken in the final negotiations on the law of the sea will be the best test of the good or bad faith of the industrial Powers of the East and the West with regard to the technological lag of the third world and the temptation to plunder  without regard to principle  the incomparable wealth of the sea-bed of the world.150.	Those are the thoughts which occur to us with regard to the state of international economic relations in general.151.	In respect of Africa  aware of its share of responsibility in the building of a more just and equitable economic order but aware too of its tragic  paradoxical condition of being the continent at once richest in resources and least developed  it devoted an extraordinary session in April of this yearâthe first of its kindâsolely to problems having a bearing on the economic development of the continent. To that end the needs were identified  the priorities determined  the means surveyed and the Lagos Plan of Action adopted. We hope that international solidarity will not be found wanting in the implementation of the Lagos Plan.152.	I should like to conclude this statement by expressing our sorrow at the continuation on our doorstep of another conflict  which concerns us more closely  that of Western Sahara. Shortly after the changes in our country in July 1978  the head of our delegation to the thirty-third session of the General Assembly stated at this rostrum:""We in Mauritania want to turn this dark page of our history and commit ourselves resolutely to the search for peace  which requires that the protagonists in this drama clearly understand that they share the same ineluctable destiny.""... our ingenuity  our courage  our fighting spirit must henceforth be directed to producing concord among our peoples to promoting their development and to achieving all their aspirations. That is the firm belief of the Mauritanian people and its Government.""Â®153.	We have thus knowingly taken historical action in favour of the peaceful and fraternal coexistence of the peoples of the western Maghreb sub region  in keeping with the spirit and the letter of the charter and the resolutions of the OAU and those of the United Nations. More specifically  on 5 August 1979 we put an end to the state of war which then existed between us and the people of the Western Sahara by signing  with the Frente Popular para la Liberacion de Saguia el-Hamra y de Rio de Oro [POLISARIO] the Algiers agreement  which was then reported to the Assembly.10 In so doing we put an end to this fratricidal war and we believe we have made a positive contribution to the quest for a lasting and general peace in our region.154.	No longer making any territorial claim to Western Sahara  but particularly affected by the continuing confrontation on its borders  the Islamic Republic of Mauritania has since July 1978 consistently given its total  loyal cooperation to the efforts of OAU and the international community to find a just solution to the problem. Thus we participated in September in the work of the Ad Hoc Committee of the OAU and approved the plan for a settlement of the Western Sahara conflict that it had adopted  The proposed peace plan provided for a six-point process and  in particular  a cease-fire in December 1980 at the latest  and the organization of a referendum on self-determination in the Sahara.155.	Having emerged from an anachronistic situation  and in a desire to leave behind a dark chapter in its history  the Islamic Republic of Mauritania  for its part  recognized the inalienable and undeniable right of the fraternal Sahraoui people to self-determination in accordance with our long and fraternal common history  with our understanding of good-neighbourliness and with the recommendations contained in resolutions of OAU and the United Nations.156.	In more general terms  by deciding to put an end to our military commitment in the Western Sahara conflict and by affirming our neutrality with regard to the protagonists in this fratricidal tragedy  the Islamic Republic of Mauritania is at the same time determined to have that neutrality and the inviolability of its national territory respected by all its neighbours.157.	My country makes that commitment from this rostrum. It also makes another: to plan not on the permanence of tension  hatred and fratricidal confrontation but on the necessary return of the Maghreb sub region to tranquillity  peace and fraternal harmony. At the dawn of the fifteenth century of our Muslim era  that is the most sincere wish of the Islamic Republic of Mauritaniaânot only for the Maghreb but also for the Arab nation  Africa  the Islamic Ummah and the entire human community."
"95",4888,"MUS",35,1980,"ï»¿First  permit me  Sir  to congratulate you most heartily on your assumption of the presidency of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly.3.	The founding fathers of the United Nations reserved the presidency of the Assembly for Powers other than the big Powers  yet the Federal Republic of Germany  which is really a big Power  is using its strength and its power in the ways of peace  freedom and development. The remarkable victory for moderation in the elections of the Federal Republic of Germany is a pointer to the stable economic and social policy pursued by your Government. In fact it is in parallel with your personal initiative  in the short time you have served  of keeping your office open to contending States which seek peaceful negotiations through the channel provided by statesmanship  diplomatic skill and personal ability  which are your outstanding and recognized qualities.4.	I should also like your distinguished predecessor  Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim  to know how greatly his contribution to the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly and the recently concluded eleventh special session is appreciated.5.	I should also like to pay a tribute on behalf of my country to the Secretary General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  who in a difficult year of great turmoil  has maintained an almost unprecedented and sustained initiative in the art of peaceful negotiation and preventive diplomacy in a world caught up in a whirlwind of confusion  transition  violence  revolution and war. History will certainly record this one-man Herculean effort in the search for peace.6.	It is also with great joy that my country and my people greet the admission of Zimbabwe which joins the already impressive list of African States. Zimbabwe has rightly been hailed by all of us as a great achievement in the entire range of African liberation  having attained its freedom by a rare combination of armed struggle and outstanding leadership.7.	Above all  the triumph of the people of Zimbabwe has strongly asserted an indomitable will to liberation which will now move on to the complete liberation of the entire African continent. We in Mauritius can confidently state from this rostrum that it cannot and will not be otherwise. Those who are haggling over Namibia are wasting their time and losing a rare opportunity to cultivate the multiracial friendship of Africa.8.	We also warmly greet the admission to United Nations membership of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  which  like Vanuatu  although situated in another sea far from us  is a sister State in the growing community of island nations.9.	With the admission of Zimbabwe and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  the United Nations membership has attained the amazing figure of 154. This is a triumph of near universality  which was the supreme goal of the United Nations from the very first days of its founding at San Francisco. The numerical goal we have reached is truly an astonishing figure when we recall that in 1945 the Organization was founded by only 51 nationsâabout the same as the membership of the League of Nations.10.	On this twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples [resolution 1514 (XV)]  we may recall how great empires have given place to new nations  thus enabling us to attain the supreme goal of total membership.11.	What was the objective of the historic achievement of universality of membership? Was it not the general assumption that the greater the membership  the greater would be the authority of the world Organization? Was there not the conviction that an Organization and a Charter deriving power from hundreds of millions of people liberated from the bonds of tutelage would serve to bring us much nearer to a more secure world? Was there not the un-refuted axiom that a joint effort of the totality of nations would facilitate an earlier achievement of world peace?â12.	Surely those were the hopes  reflecting the deep convictions held by all  for an Organization that enjoyed recruitment from the world's total family of nations. All believed  and still believe  that our numerical strength must make for a stronger United Nations  more firmly secured by the prestige that comes from maximum possible support in the fulfilment of its high mission of dealing with conflicts and establishing a world order based on peace  security  justice  and human rights  including the right of all nations to development. In such a pyramid of nations and peoples we envisaged a world  nurtured for centuries amid interminable conflicts and endless wars  at long last approaching an era of concord  harmony and peace  all built in a spirit of unanimity.13.	We must admit that the unanimity is there; but  ironically  what a terrible and terrifying unanimity. All are agreedâEast and West  North and South  big nations and smallâthat the past year has witnessed a world of violence  fragmentation  conflict and war. The number of refugees in flight from death and destruction threatens to exceed the number of those who fled before invading armies in the Second World War. The small beginning of a painfully achieved detente and coexistence collapsed seemingly overnight  and the big Powers  blind to the future  returned to the past with their cold war  plunging into an arms race that exceeded the furious rearming that attended the first cold war. The so-called deterrent of nuclear balance seemingly vanished with the accretion of new and more destructive weapons so sophisticated and complex as to cast doubt on the ability of Governments to control their policies. Leading scientists today bluntly predict that the forces of nuclear war may now be running beyond the control of men and Governments. The most powerful economies of the mighty industrial Powers are sliding into recession and inflation while the smaller economies are staggering under back breaking deficits  with some on the verge of national bankruptcy.14.	To their sinking economies Governments are adding the greater and heavier load of some $US 500 billion annually for more and more deadly armaments  while not less than 500 million people are estimated to be living in a state of malnutrition  starvation or famine.15.	Finally  in this climate of strife  came the Middle East war  with all the danger any war in the Middle East may entail.16.	If all this sounds harsh and abrasive  permit me to note that these are not my personal observations. Mauritius is not the first or the second speaker in the general debate; I only repeat and reaffirm what almost all those who preceded me have said and repeated with shuddering unanimity. The only addition I shall make is a comment on the supreme irony that this holocaust of the world peace effort has come on the thirty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations  in the year when its new high membership of 154 brings it close to universality  the 35yearold dream and aspiration of the Organization.17.	What conclusions may we draw from this analysis and diagnosis of the world situation? Are we to conclude that the United Nations has failed to fulfil its commitment to the peoples of the world? That  I hasten to say  would not be true to the facts or to the Organization's achievements.18.	The conclusion we would draw is just the opposite: that in today's world peoples and their Governments must turn more and more to the only Organization dedicated to the attainment of a new world order. We must shun the common fallacy of the confusion of cause and effect that besets post-war history. It is not the United Nations that is the cause of the world malady but those which  exploiting its weaknesses and even responsible for its inadequacy  have littered the international scene with their warped national interests  their foreign policy drift and their mad drive for control and domination  utilizing in this drive for power political intrigues and pressure alliances without regard for the needs of the international community  and demonstrating what the Secretary General in his brilliant annual report called a preoccupation with short-term interests at the expense of long-term aspirations.19.	When the storms become more furious those manning the ship must apply themselves to making the ship stronger  to riding out the waves and the winds and bringing their cargo safely to port  and certainly to preventing the catastrophe of sinking.20.	So must it be with the United Nations ship of state. It must be admitted that  while not the cause of the unhappy world situation  the United Nations has not been sailing through the problems of the world with fool proof navigation.21.	In a world of accelerating change the United Nations has been prone to procrastinate and mark time. In this sense  the familiar clichÃ© that the United Nations is only a mirror reflection of the world is far from the truth. According to that stale imagery  contemporary society would not have moved an inch from the 1 000yearlong feudalism of Europe. When there has been a call to make peace  the United Nations has too often responded with a peace-making truce that has soon become a permanent substitute for peace. I might say that any truce more than one year old is merely a deferred war  or at best a festering foreign element in the world body.22.	The fiasco of disarmament was such a case. Just as the protracted truce was only a deferred war  so the so-called phased disarmament ended in the biggest arms race in modern history. While the United Nations was phasing  the scientists were churning out their new weapons at top speed  until today the per capita potential for killing is astronomically incalculable.23.	In the long years of disarmament negotiations  the great majority in the Assembly  the smaller and poorer nations  loudly berated for their allegedly unrealistic resolutions  have in reality only added to the arms race by voting for partial measures in the hope that  by preceding at the dragging pace of the great military Powers  they could somehow achieve some kind of an eventual breakthrough. And so the hope of general and complete disarmament was sacrificed to the idols of puny and adulterated measures.24.	Failure in the field of disarmament must go down as perhaps the greatest of the United Nations failures. The race for maximum armament as the means of national security is now being seen by leading military scientists as a boomerang resulting in greater insecurity than any that has ever befallen nations. And the glib argument that a super strong military establishment is the only deterrent to a potential adversary has now reached a point at which the unlimited arms race and the rivalry for more and more deadly arms is generating a fear that is itself liable to cause rather than prevent war.25.	Similarly  in the economic struggle  economic action programmes sacrificed action to weakening compromises by surrendering to soft words until nations were bled white of action. This reached the climax of naive trust in the folly of the near collapse of the eleventh special session  devoted to economic matters. Even if the old adage is true  that half a loaf is better than no bread  at that dismal session the developing nations were not given even the proverbial half.26.	So  just as the peacekeeping truce became the enemy of peace  and phased disarmament the spur to the arms race  so trusting compromises ended  as we are now told  in a world economic crisis.27.	It is said that the peoples of the world are disappointed in the United Nations  but no one has yet heard any people say they would therefore dispense with this formidable experiment in the achievement of an organized world peace. What people do not want and will not respect is a weak United Nations suffering from muscular dystrophy.28.	The development of the dramatic United Nations attempt to halt the Iraq Iran war or even to issue a prompt ceasefire in an area where the sparks of that war could easily ignite other conflagrations is a signal to all of us that the Security Council may also have become a victim of this dystrophy. The complaints rise to a crescendo year by year that the Council is no longer the reliable custodian of peace and securityâa responsibility assigned to it by the Charter. Its failure to act promptly or effectively  tolerating the bypassing of its resolutions and of the enforcement of its own decisions  and dubious use of the veto power have reduced the prestige of the Council to a sad point  as in the current situation  where the contending parties avoid the Council altogether. The tendency now is for regional  sub regional and other groups to resolve their own differences.29.	These are commendable initiatives  but must necessarily fall short of the challenge when it takes on world proportions. They cannot stop a world war and it is doubtful whether they can effectively undertake the making of world peace. It is every year more obvious  and perhaps inevitable  that there should be a serious review of the Security Council; a study should be undertaken as to how it can be strengthened with a view to becoming an organ that commands the confidence of the nations and peoples of the world. Here my country agrees with the suggestions of President Senghor and of President Shagari that the Council be enlarged to make it more representative.30.	At the same time  there might be a similar review of the General Assembly with a view to strengthening its effectiveness  authority and moral leadership in the world.31.	There are nations in the world that pride themselves on the practice of self-criticism. For a nation this may be sufficient. For the United Nations  which bears a greater responsibility even into the distant future  this cannot be enough: the United Nations does not want for criticism. For the United Nations to command the prestige necessary for the fulfilment of the aims of the Charter  self-criticism must be followed by self-correction. Given the stormy climate of the world today  the impatience of peoples with unresolved problems and the expression of their frustrations by resort to violence  rebellion  armed action  revolutions and civil wars  it is obvious that we have little time to lose. The gap between analysis and action must be narrowed. I respectfully submit that this process of self-correction  painful but creative  must begin at the current session.32.	In the international power relations  we must encourage restoration of the concept of detente. In this area  my Government is pleased with statements by leading countries in Western Europe that they are determined to return to detente rather than to cold war and the bitter power struggle.33.	Some  discouraged by such developments as those in Kampuchea and Afghanistan  would abandon other peace efforts as futile and dangerous. Detente  like all peace efforts  will encounter difficulties and even setbacks  but peace efforts should not be lightly thrown away at the first negative encounter. The peacemakers should not be discouraged. We now know that to abandon detente or any other peace effort means an interminable arms race that must  from the lessons of history  almost certainly lead to war.34.	I have already said enough to make it clear that a new approach is desperately needed to halt the arms race  which tends to involve us all in threats of war and economic crisis. It is our view that the General Assembly must develop a new approach to disarmament negotiations. Delegations and Governments must be less generous in underwriting half-hearted resolutions contrived by the great military Powers and military alliances. Non-military Powers must assume a greater responsibility for the arms race and match their responsibility with boldness in taking the initiative by strong and comprehensive draft resolutions  regardless of whether this suits the convenience of the armed giants  whose caution  while understandable  is no longer acceptable when warfare now kills more people by hunger than it does by bullets.35.	This Assembly must put the derailed special session on economic questions back on its track. In this connection  Mauritius  a member of the Group of 77  considers the resumption of negotiations in the Second Committee a major challenge to this Assembly. We are happy to hear that some of the Western Powers that failed in the efforts to achieve success are ready to resume consideration  we hope in a more promising manner  of the issue of global negotiations.36.	Positive results in these two not unrelated areas would go a long way towards restoring the self-confidence of the United Nations and rehabilitating the confidence of the peoples in the world Organization.37.	There are other areas for fruitful achievements but  in the interest of saving time  I shall refer only to the question of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace. In this area  as in other similar attempts to establish zones of peace  developments have been slow  completely out of step with the galloping course of world events. The General Assembly has a report from the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean [A/35/29] bringing up to date developments since the issue was first raised in 1971.38.	But let us see what has happened in the intervening years. Strategically; the Indian Ocean has completely changed its geopolitical dimensions. Reading the statements of some speakers in the general debate  we find that this Ocean has gradually expanded beyond its own waters: it is now linked to the States of southeast Asia and  by developments in Western Asia  to the most vital features of the Middle East. Naval ships are now mobilizing in its expanded waters and mighty air armadas are filling its skies in the accelerated strategy of acquiring military bases on the Horn and on the Saudi Arabian peninsula  surrounding the vital area of the Persian Gulf.39.	Given that situation  where are the optimists who would now seriously bank on the conversion of the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace? Ironically  time is gradually converting this intended zone of peace into a zone of war and mobilization for war  and is one more illustration of the point we have made that procrastination  long-drawn-out procedures  delay and deferment have served to erode the major peace efforts listed on the long and ponderous United Nations agenda  while world developments outrun and out space our efforts.40.	Here it is necessary for me to emphasize that Mauritius  being in the middle of the Indian Ocean  has alreadyâ at the seventeenth ordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity [OAU]  held at Freetown from 1 to 4 July this yearâreaffirmed its claim to Diego Garcia and the Prime Minister of Great Britain in a parliamentary statement has made it known that that island will revert to Mauritius when it is no longer required for the global defence of the West. Our sovereignty having been thus accepted  we should go further than that  and disband the British Indian Ocean Territory and allow Mauritius to come into its natural heritage as before its independence. The United States should make arrangements directly with Mauritius for the continued use of the island for defence purposes. And then  there are the inhabitants of Diego Garcia who are domiciled in Mauritius and for whom better arrangements should be made. It must be the duty of both the United States and Great Britain to discuss with the Mauritius Government how best to give satisfaction to all concerned and at the same time provide better prospects for the islanders.41.	In conclusion  we repeat our major thesis that the shaky and dangerous world must be confronted by a stronger  better and more efficient United Nations. We hold that the thirty-fifth session can begin this laborious but challenging task in a number of ways  but begin it must  if it is to command the respect and the support of all the peoples of the world."
"96",4929,"MWI",35,1980,"ï»¿On behalf of the Malawi delegation  I should like to extend to Mr. von Wechmar our warmest congratulations on his election as President of the current session of the General Assembly. In extending our congratulations to him  I wish to take the liberty of recording our satisfaction at seeing him preside over the deliberations of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly.2.	In this connection  we wish to recall that the friendly Government which he so ably represents  that of the Federal Republic of Germany  was the first to promise economic aid to Malawi when  in 1963  our Government served notice to quit the now defunct Central African Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. We also wish to recall that  since then  not only have the two countries enjoyed the most cordial bilateral relations  but these relations have waxed from strength to strength. Therefore  it is only natural that our delegation should assure him of our fullest co-operation and support in the discharge of the responsibilities of his presidency that lie ahead. It is in this spirit that we salute him and convey to him our great personal pleasure in seeing him preside over the Assembly.3.	Our delegation would be remiss if an appropriate public tribute were not paid to his predecessor Ambassador Salim A. Salim of the United Republic of Tanzania  who acquitted himself so ably and with such total dedication that the special sessions over which he presided not only added to his stature as a seasoned diplomat but also did tremendous honour to his country in particular and Africa in general. Our delegation is indebted to Ambassador Salim for his outstanding contribution to the work of the United Nations. We salute him for an excellent job of work  which he accomplished for the good of the entire international community.4.	The Government of the Republic of Malawi continues to follow with very keen interest the efforts deployed by the Secretary-General as he attempts to give positive expression to the resolutions of both the Assembly and the Security Council. Our Government has taken special note of his visits to several parts of the worldâincluding South-East Asia and the Middle Eastâin his quest for a peaceful settlement of explosive situations which seem to undermine international peace and security. Accordingly  on behalf of the Malawi Government  we wish to record our sincere thanks to Mr. Kurt Waldheim for those efforts and to congratulate him and his dedicated staff for their invaluable service and contribution to the cause of international peace and stability. Our Government also commends the Secretary-General on his report on the work of the Organization  on the objectivity of the annual report and its careful analysis of the international political developments during the past year. Indeed  we take pride in the very high standard of performance that he has set for the entire United Nations system.5.	The Government of the Republic of Malawi  in concert with other Commonwealth Governments  joined the international community in welcoming the advent of the two newly independent sovereign States of Zimbabwe in Africa and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines in the Caribbean. Both States were former possessions of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and were admitted as the one hundred and fifty-third and one hundred and fifty- fourth Members of the United Nations  respectively. With the admission of these two new Members  the United Nations took bold and positive steps towards its desired objective regarding the fulfilment of the principle of universality of its membership. It is in recognition and appreciation of this achievement that we wish to take the liberty of extending our delegation's sincere and heartfelt congratulations to the Governments and peoples of Zimbabwe and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. We also wish to congratulate Her Majesty's Government of the United Kingdom on facilitating the independence of its two former colonies. The Malawi Government has noted with complete satisfaction and jubilation the removal  for the first time  from the agenda of the General Assembly of the item entitled ""The situation in Southern Rhodesia"". Accordingly  it is the hope of my Government that similar items that still remain on the agenda of the Assembly might equally be dropped  sooner rather than later.6.	At the seventeenth ordinary session the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity [OAU]  held at Freetown  last July  agreed to authorize Mr. Siaka Stevens  current chairman of the Assembly of the OAU and head of State and Government of the Republic of Sierra Leone  to convene the Ad Hoc Committee on Western Sahara  with a view to reconciling the parties to the conflict and seeking a peaceful and lasting solution to that problem. Accordingly  the fourth session of the Ad Hoc Committee was convened in Freetown early last month. My Government notes with considerable interest the fact that since the establishment of that Committee  the parties to the conflict not only now appear willing to discuss the issues  but also have participated in at least one such meeting which formed the basis for current recommendations which have been forwarded to the heads of State and Government of the OAU. The decision to participate in an exercise of this nature would seem  in our view  to augur well for the future. Accordingly  we wish all the participants and the Committee every success in their determined search for a peaceful solution to this African problem. Above all  we commend the OAU for its determination to attempt to contain and even resolve the problem within the framework of its charter.7.	During the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly  the international community expressed both dismay and disappointment at the negative turn of events when agreement on a formula for resolving the Namibian problem initially submitted by the five Western Powers through the Security Council eluded the feuding parties. This disappointment notwithstanding  efforts to maintain the search for a peaceful solution to the problem have been stepped up by the Secretary-General and as a result we hear that all outstanding issues militating against the settlement proposal approved by the Security Council in its resolution 435 (1978) have now been resolved. However  we are unable to understand and appreciate the apparent reluctance of the Government of the Republic of South Africa to facilitate the immediate implementation of the formula that not only has been carefully worked out but also has been exhaustively examined by all concerned. We believe that the assurances given by the Secretary-General are genuine and that they are aimed at ensuring the peaceful transfer of political power to the Namibians themselves. We believe that under United Nations auspices not only would free and fair elections be feasible  but the participation of each Namibian in any such election would be guaranteed.8.	In this connection  we wish to recall our Government's belief in the Western initiative  which has now culminated in what has been agreed to by all parties. Addressing the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly last October  the then Chairman of our delegation  Mr. D. T. Matenje  Minister of Education  had this to say about our Government's reaction:""My Government is convinced that this is still the way that offers the most hope of leading to a just and internationally acceptable solution to the Namibia question. It is therefore encouraging to note that efforts are under way to pursue the Western initiative  and I would appeal for good faith among ... the parties concerned so as not to lose again an opportunity to bring this problem to a successful conclusion."" 9.	Accordingly  it is in the same spirit that we would venture to reiterate our Government's appeal to all parties  in particular to the Government of the Republic of South Africa  to facilitate the implementation of the formula currently under active consideration. Time is running out  and the time to resolve the problem is now.10.	We would venture to submit that the views of our Government on apartheid and racism and what they connote arc well known  not only to the Assembly but also to the Government of the Republic of South Africa. It will be recalled that last year the leader of our delegation had this to say on the policies of apartheid and racism espoused by the Government of the Republic of South Africa:""My Government remains resolutely averse to the policies of apartheid and the methods used to enforce it  including the establishment of 'homelands'. This is a stance that is well known to the Government of the day in South Africa. But my Government remains equally convinced that the best way to induce the white people to the south of us to change is by contact and example  by engaging in a dialogue with them."" 11.	The black people of South Africa continue to challenge the legal instruments of their oppression because for upwards of three centuries they have been reduced to the status of aliens in the country of their forebears. Alas  even black school children  too  have for quite a spell now shown utter defiance  and this in broad daylight  of the armoury that has been assembled there for what appears to be their perpetual political subjugation. The black people of South Africa abhor the creation of Bantustans  which they perceive as a summation of apartheid and downright racism. They resent the balkanization of beautiful South Africa and rather yearn for its unification. Their desire for the total integration and cohesion of their land prompts them to step up the fight for freedom and prosperity for all its people  irrespective of colour or creed. Therefore  the continued balkanization of South Africa can only mean an affront to the dignity of sovereignty  aimed at entrenching the enduring myth of baaskap.12.	The black people of South Africa will continue to insist on respect for their lives and dignity. For  as long as those basic human rights continue to be ignored  the fight not only to participate in but also to govern  the affairs of their land will not cease. Therefore we  like the international community  believe that there is merit in the people's quest for social justice and political emancipation. We believe that they loathe violence just as they abhor political injustice and racism. We believe that neither confrontation nor intransigence is in the best interests of the racial groups in that land. We believe that the black people of South Africa are crying out for and committed to the building of a united  dynamic  strong and prosperous nation capable of providing enlightened leadership in the African continent.13.	South Africa has always been  is and will continue to be part and parcel of the African continent. Therefore we are unable to understand why the white minority that now governs that country should insist on creating a mini- Europe there while at the same time justifiably insisting on being called Africans themselves. We would  as in years gone by  urge those who have influence over the white population and Government of South Africa to prevail on them to come to the conference table with a view to resolving the country's political  social and economic problems  which have not only bedevilled racial relations within the country but have also succeeded in isolating it from the international family of man. My delegation's prayer is for a quick resolution of the problem so that that country may return to this forum and occupy its legitimate place.14.	No instant solution to the Middle East problem capable of commanding the immediate support of all parties seems feasible. But Malawi believes that  given a suitable political climate and willingness to engage in meaningful discussions among all the feuding parties  a solution might be found sooner rather than later. Unfortunately  the tendency in recent times to assail the efforts of the United Nations in the region  the most recent decision to take unilateral action on certain disputed aspects of the problem  the continued acquisition of weaponry of death and mass destruction  which goads the feuding parties into acts of violence  the refusal to recognize and accept each other's existence  the temptation to ignore the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  the unwillingness that has been demonstrated so far to give effect to the myriad resolutions of the United Nations calling for withdrawal from occupied territories  and so on  seem in our view to have succeeded only in undermining the credibility of United Nations peace initiatives in that region. Naturally the Malawi delegation deplores this negative development. We believe that the region can ill afford to continue to bleed itself to death  because to do so is to set itself on a course of self-destruction and create general world instability and insecurity in its wake. Consequently  we submit that the Secretary-General made a very pertinent and timely observation to this body when he said in his report:""Any progress in the Middle East requires in the first place a vastly improved degree of communication and understanding at many levels. There can be no hope of peaceful progress if the peoples of the region and their leaders do not recognize and accept each other's ... right to exist. Conditions must be created in which positive and agreed solutions can be developed.""15.	We see no concealed innuendos or provocative epithets in that observation  which to us seems to be a fundamental truism that reflects the reality of the situation. We discern nothing in it that might incur the wrath of the gods of the Middle East. Accordingly we would urge the international community to join the Secretary-General in attempts to bring suitable pressure to bear on all the parties in the area to facilitate the creation of the type of conditions envisaged in that quotation and to facilitate the development of ""positive and agreed solutions"" aimed at a peaceful resolution of the Middle East conflict.16.	In the view of our delegation  the Secretary-General has made what seems to be a very intriguing proposal concerning the situation in Afghanistan. According to him . . the only way that appears open is to initiate a process of negotiation among all the parties concerned with a view to finding a political solution of the problem withfull regard to the principles of the Charter and the decisions of the Organization"". As far as we are aware  the Afghan representatives regard any such proposals as wanton interference in their domestic affairs. They have even objected to the inscription of an item on the subject on the agenda of the Assembly. As far as they are concerned  the foreign troops that have inundated their country are there by invitation because their sovereignty was allegedly threatened by imperialists and neo-imperialists in concert with their foster-cousins the colonialists and neo- colonialists. However  the international community still has not been informed why the Afghan people  on whose behalf the foreign troops are alleged to have been invited into their country  seem to be taking to the bush  and some even seeking refuge in neighbouring countries. If the question of the invitation cannot be discussed by the Assembly  at least that of thousands of refugees would seem to merit consideration. Therefore we would hope that the Assemblyâwhich is already involved by being looked to for material support for the well-being of the Afghan refugeesâmight be permitted to review the situation there before it deteriorates beyond redemption. It is in this light that we perceive the Secretary-General's constructive proposal  which would seem to merit prompt and positive consideration by the international community.17.	The situation in Kampuchea  like that in Afghanistan  is said to remain dangerous. We have been informed that even humanitarian relief operations carried out by the United Nations system in concert with voluntary organizations for the benefit of the uprooted and displaced Kampuchean men  women and children have run into serious political and military difficulties. We are concerned that hardly any progress appears to have been made in giving effect to General Assembly resolution 34/22  which does not merely deal with the situation in Kampuchea  but also specifically calls for the withdrawal of foreign troops from that land  which has literally been bleeding to death since the hostilities of recent years. We believe that the withdrawal of those foreign troops would certainly facilitate the search for a mutually acceptable political solution.18.	In this regard we have taken note of the Secretary- General's efforts in using his good offices to assist the parties to the conflict to try and come to some accommodation Although those efforts have not yielded any spectacular results  the Secretary-General seems to have succeeded in getting at least two of the Foreign Ministers to continue the dialogue during the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly here in New York. We wish them every success in their endeavour  and for our part we shall watch their efforts with keen interest.19.	The meeting held on 9 August this year concerning the situation in Cyprus is said to have culminated in an agreement between the two communities to start discussing substantive issues pertinent to the dispute. But both parties are said to be lacking in an essential ingredient: the necessary political will and commitment to negotiate and compromise. In the absence of such essential political chemistry  it is proving difficult to get down to really serious business. In this connection we would once again appeal to the two communities to co-operate with the Secretary-General in the general search for a peaceful resolution of the dispute.20.	During the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly the Malawi delegation expressed the hope that the successful conclusion of the Treaty between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms  SALT II  might induce the big Powers to deploy the type of experience gained through the long drawn out negotiations in efforts geared to the achievement of general disarmament in the world. Unfortunately  this does not appear to have been the case.21.	In this regard it is pertinent to observe that the disarm-ament strategy elaborately worked out at the tenth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament has not in fact been translated into substantive action as expected. Instead  the international community has witnessed further escalation of the arms race. The international community has  during the past year  seen Governments giving priority to military preparedness while at the same time espousing the principle of disarmament. This mental attitude has resulted in meagre progress on this problem. The bottom line of all this would seem to be that by the end of the current year  according to the report of the Secretary-General  world military expenditures will exceed $500 billion  or roughly 6 per cent of total world output. We are horrified by the findings of a comprehensive study on nuclear weapons  commissioned on behalf of this General Assembly some two years ago  which has just been completed and which highlights the dangers of those weapons in the arsenals of major Powers. According to the Secretary- General  ""In 13 years the total number of strategic nuclear warheads has reportedly almost tripled. Can the international community afford further nuclear proliferationâhas the international community become so obsessed with technology that the objective is now to annihilate itself from the surface of the Lord's earth?22.	The Malawi delegation agrees with the view expressed by the Secretary-General that ""There must be tangible demonstrations of renewed commitment to the objectives outlined in the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session"". Our delegation also supports the Secretary-General in his assertion that ""The Second Disarmament Decade  which began this year  offers a suitable framework for setting politically attainable concrete targets and making substantive progress in that direction"" The Assembly has had more than enough of its share of empty professions flowing from those who claim never to have violated any international agreements on disarmament and arms control. Such professions cannot impress anyone in the Assembly as long as they are not related to what actually goes on in the backyards of those who advance them.23.	The development of the essential political will among nations at the highest levels of Government conducive to the transformation and restructuring of the current international economy seems to have eluded the participants in the eleventh special session of the General Assembly devoted to development and international economic co-operation. Consequently  yet another opportunity to give effect to the proposed establishment of the new international economic order appears to have been lost last month. However  our delegation joined the other members of the Group of 77 in taking note with satisfaction of the consensus reached on the text of the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade  which is scheduled to come into effect in January 1981. But we were both dismayed and disappointed by the failure to reach total agreement at that session on procedures and a time-frame aimed at launching the global negotiations. However  that failure to reach total agreement notwithstanding  we still cherish the hope that by the beginning of 1981 the three important Western delegations will  after careful reflection on what has been achieved thus far  reverse their original decision and facilitate the launching of the global negotiations on target.24.	Permit us to recall that during the closing hours of the eleventh special session  Canada took the first step in announcing that"". . . the Government of Canada has decided to reverse the trend of the last few years under which Canadian official development assistance was declining as a proportion of our gross national product. We shall now move upwards once again and our official development assistance will reach a level of 0.5 per cent of gross national product by the middle of the decade. Our intention thereafter is to accept the need to reach an official development assistance level of 0.7 per cent of gross national product by the end of the decade  and we shall employ all our best efforts to reach this objective"".''Clearly  once again Canada has taken the initiative in setting the pace for the major traditional donors. Accordingly  my delegation commends Canada for that gesture.25.	The Government of the Republic of Malawi is pleased to note that the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea last August completed its ninth session  at Geneva  on an extremely hopeful note. In terms of the reports that we have received  it is hoped that a convention might be adopted early in the new year and that it might be ready for signature by April 1981. Accordingly  we should like to record our thanks and indebtedness to all the participants for their outstanding contribution to the draft constitution for the seas. We hope and pray that the final conference  scheduled for early next year  will contribute positively to the advent of the new international economic order.26.	The Malawi delegation wishes to be among the first to salute the United Nations system and to commend its loyal  dedicated and hard-working personnel at all levels for the invaluable services that they continue to render and which have sustained the smooth administration of the entire system. We would wish to pay a particular tribute to the secretariat of UNCTAD for their determination to give positive expression to one of the objectives of the international communityâthe establishment of the new international economic order. In this regard  we would recall that  through UNCTAD at Geneva  yet another major step towards the realization of that goal was taken when on 27 June this year the United Nations Negotiating Conference on a Common Fund under the Integrated Programme for Commodities adopted the Agreement establishing the Common Fund.  It may further be recalled that the Final Act of the Conference was signed by more than 90 States. Thereafter  a Preparatory Commission consisting of representatives of 28 States was set up and charged with the responsibility of preparing draft rules and regulations and other related policy instruments for consideration by the Governing Council.27.	As the Assembly might already be aware  it is intended that the Fund should serve as a key instrument in the attainment of the objectives of the Integrated Programme for Commodities as enshrined in UNCTAD resolution 93 (IV).  It is our understanding that the Fund will also facilitate the conclusion and functioning of international commodity agreements or arrangements  particularly concerning commodities of special interest to developing countries.28.	From our perspective as a developing country  the significance of the Fund would seem to affect at least six major areas  as follows.29.	First  the Common Fund can be regarded as an important element of the new international economic order and the Programme of Action for the establishment of that order. The Programme of Action envisaged the need for the regulation of world trade in primary commodities with the objective of producing greater benefits to developing countries in terms of prices  earnings  opportunities for processing and marketing and control over their natural resources.30.	Secondly  the Fund represents the first major change that has taken place since the end of the Second World War in the organization of international economic relations. Unlike the immediate post-war financial institutions  that is  IMF and the World Bank  the Common Fund would permit developing countries to play a decisive role in the management of the world economy. The universal membership of the Fund would bring together countries with differing economic and social systems. It is hoped that the problems created by payments made by countries in either convertible or non-convertible currencies might be a non-issue  eliminating the current double standards within the United Nations system which adversely affect developing countries.31.	Thirdly  the operations of the First Account of the Common Fund  that is  activities related to stocking  would make for greater price stability for many commodities exported by developing countries. Price instability  as experience has shown  does affect the export earnings of developing countries. It contributes to inflation and in some instances it could hamper the planning of production  especially agricultural production in the developing countries. Price stability would eliminate these problems and contribute to greater security of investments in raw materials.32.	Fourthly  the operations of the Second Account  that is  activities other than stocking  such as productivity improvement  product development  marketing and distribution  would generate resources for developing countries to finance long-term developmental projects associated with the commodity sector. These projects will improve the competitive position of natural products exported by developing countries vis-a-vis synthetics and substitutes. It will also assist these countries in the processing  marketing and distribution of their commodities.33.	Fifthly  the capital structure of the Fund is such that developing countries should be able to subscribe to it without unduly straining their economies. The ratio of the subscribed to the borrowed capital of the Fund  as agreed  that is  one third subscribed to two thirds borrowed  would enhance the credit-worthiness of the Fund and maintain its financial integrity. For developing countries this is important  as the ability of the Fund to enter into capital market operations could directly affect its stocking operations.34.	Sixthly and finally  the voting structure of the Fundâ 47 per cent of voting power for the Group of 77 42 per cent for Group B  8 per cent for Group D and 3 per cent for Chinaâestablished a new principle of power sharing in international financial institutions. If all developing countries ratify the Articles of Agreement  they will constitute the largest voting bloc in the management of the Fund.35.	To us  the establishment of the Common Fund is recognition by the international community of the growing political and economic tensions which tend to undermine international relations and which must be addressed at the earliest available opportunity. The establishment of the Fund  we believe  introduces a new economic partnership in a world of increasing interaction and interdependence. Therefore  mindful of the myriad advantages of the newly created Fund  we would venture to urge all States Members of the United Nations to consider the immediate ratification of the Articles of Agreement  and let us move forward together thereafter. We commend the Common Fund to all Governments of the international community.36.	In conclusion  we would appeal to the Assembly to heed the overriding preoccupation of the African continent with the peaceful uses of the sea lanes of the Indian Ocean. Africa's commitment to peace and mutual international friendship is a matter of record. Therefore  mindful of that commitment  one of Africa's distinguished statesmen  the President of Madagascar  in a letter dated 22 June 1980 to the Secretary-General  made a specific proposal aimed at maintaining the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace. Accordingly he has called for a summit meeting of both littoral and hinterland States and of the major maritime users  including the five world major Powers  to be held at Tananarive  the capital of his country. As far as the timing is concerned  it has been suggested that it be held either at the end of 1981 or in early 1982. Therefore my delegation would urge the international community to give that proposal the consideration it merits with the urgency it deserves. Africa is for lasting peace and stability; hence Madagascar's initiative down that path  and we owe it to ourselves to commend and salute the President of that great African and Indian Ocean Republic."
"97",4971,"MYS",35,1980,"ï»¿I should like to congratulate Ambassador von Wechmar on his election as President of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. My country considers him eminently qualified for the post and we are confident his presidency will be carried out with distinction. My delegation pledges full co-operation with his presidency. His election is an added honour to his country  with which Malaysia has close and abiding relations.267.	I also wish to pay a special tribute to his predecessor  Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim of the United Republic of Tanzania  who so ably guided the thirty-fourth session  two emergency special sessions and the recently concluded special session on economic matters.268.	May I also take this opportunity to congratulate Saint Vincent and the Grenadines on its membership in the United Nations. Malaysia wishes to assure that country of its full co-operation and of its friendship.269.	Before I proceed further  I should like on behalf of Malaysia to join the international community in a common appeal for a cessation of hostilities between Iran and Iraq. We welcome the initiative of the Secretary-General and of the Security Council in urging an end to the fighting. We support the efforts of the Islamic Conference in sending a goodwill mission to Iran and Iraq. The conflict between Iran and Iraq can destabilize further the already serious situation in the Middle East with consequences that may threaten world peace. We sincerely hope that  whatever the issues between the two countries  urgent efforts will be made to negotiate a peaceful solution to the conflict.270.	This is again the occasion for us to declare our enduring commitment to the principles of international peace  security and co-operation. But even as we do so  as we must  it is with disquiet and anxiety that we realize that all our combined protestations have not advanced our search for a better world. The signs are not propitious at all. We have not moved forward. We may well have taken a slide backwards instead.271.	I am not being alarmist but the deterioration of the international situation due to increasing tension and rivalry between the major Powers  characterized by a tendency to use force in the pursuit of objectives  has taken on a very dangerous edge. The arms race which we are committed to reduce has been accelerated further  providing an inauspicious and grim start to the second Disarmament Decade. To exacerbate the situation  there is serious paralysis over the restructuring of the international economic order. The perspective of the South towards the North is becoming one of distrust. With zero growth and burgeoning poverty  the small and weak regard the established structures as far from friendly.272.	The earlier hope that the spirit of genuine detente  which brought about relaxation of tension and increased co-operation in Europe  would spread to other parts of the world has been dissipated. In the pursuit of national and strategic advantages  the major Powers have not hesitated to intervene directly in the internal affairs of another State  as events in Afghanistan have demonstrated. And if a major Power decides its interests could be advanced by supporting the regional ambitions of a State  then such support is readily rendered.273.	These are the aspects of major-Power rivalry that are holding the world to ransom now. The incredulous thing is that each action is carried out in the name of fostering and safeguarding peace and security when the contrary is the case. And the spiral grows. And action by a major Power invites corresponding action by another. Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan resulted in the United States withholding ratification of the SALT II agreement and increased military activity in the Indian Ocean and the Gulf area. Vietnamese intervention in Kampuchea resulted in Chinese troops moving across the Vietnamese border.274.	Malaysia condemns these actions. The major Powers must show more responsibility. Malaysia rejects the thesis that the interests of major Powers transcend national boundaries and that the fate of independent countries must pivot on the derivatives of major-Power actions. Acceptance of  or even acquiescence in  that would put us all back to the cold war of a bipolar world and would rob us of our precious gains of independent action and the right to progress unthreatened and unimpeded. Together with the countries of the third world and within the non-aligned movement  countries like Malaysia have been able to determine perimeters of action  singly and collectively  that have won for us a climate of stability and co-operation that has in turn contributed to international stability and progress. We are determined that these areas of positive action that we have gained shall not be whittled away as casualties of the interaction of major-Power politics. Malaysia therefore calls for serious stock-taking on the part of the major Powers. We do not expect them to be the policemen of the world. What we demand is the consciousness of their responsibilities and the exercise of restraint and co-operation in international relations. The trend towards using force as an instrument of policy must be arrested. There is no credible rationale that any country can provide for direct or indirect military intervention in the affairs of independent and sovereign nations.275.	In the present environment of such instability many problems remain unresolved. As we enter the second disarmament Decade  the prospects of a hopeful  if not a final solution to the problem of building a world free from any awesome threat of mass destruction appear remote and elusive.276.	The qualitative and quantitative development of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction is escalating as the major Powers vie with one another for military supremacy. The vast sums of money and scarce resources spent in the process are as staggering as they are alarming. If only a fraction of the estimated $400 billion spent annually by countries on military forces and armaments were to be channelled towards badly needed development projects  the benefits to mankind could be considerable.277.	Despite demands by the international community for a total and comprehensive test-ban treaty  nuclear testing continues unabated. In addition to that  more countries are developing or acquiring nuclear weapons. This dangerous trend goes against the spirit and objectives of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. My delegation cannot but view this with concern. It will only complicate the efforts of the United Nations to create a climate of confidence in which disarmament can proceed. The time for us to act is long overdue  but act we must if we are to avoid nuclear destruction.278.	I wish to join other heads of delegations that have addressed this Assembly in calling on all the nuclear Powers to work in earnest towards the realization of a comprehensive test-ban agreement which would represent the first step towards nuclear disarmament and a halt in the trend towards nuclear proliferation.279.	The Middle East conflict seethes in its intensity. Israel continues to defy the world  violating established principles and scorning United Nations resolutions at will. Jerusalem has been declared the capital of Israel  which is the most patent example of international irresponsibility in modern times  a direct challenge to the world  an action of extreme folly and an affront to Moslems all over the world. The people of Palestine are still being denied their inalienable rights to sovereignty and independence  which adds to the shameful catalogue of injustices being perpetrated in the Middle East. Malaysia calls on those countries which support and sustain Israel to desist from doing so and to join in the universal condemnation of Israeli actions. Together with other countries  especially those in the non-aligned movement and the Islamic Conference  Malaysia demands that Israel heed the injunctions of this world body. To continue with its irresponsible actions is to put at risk the future of Israel itself.280.	I should like  on this occasion  once again to reiterate Malaysia's full support of the people of Palestine in its struggle to exercise its inalienable rights as recognized by the United Nations: the right to return to its homeland  the right to self-determination and the right to national independence. We assure the PLO  the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  of our unflinching support for their cause.281.	In Asia  Afghanistan and Kampuchea stand out as examples of areas where  again  accepted international principles have been flouted  and the way opened to the exercise of military might and power imperatives. I must repeat here that no country  on any pretext whatever  can intervene in the affairs of another. In the case of Kampuchea  it has been argued that the Pol Pot regime had committed serious excesses. We are all agreed on this. Malaysia has condemned the killings and other atrocities of that regime  but this does not give any country the right to march into Kampuchea  remove a legitimate Government and install a puppet regime. A solution to the Kampuchean conflict must be found urgently  in accordance with General Assembly resolution 34/22 which was adopted overwhelmingly by the Assembly last year.282.	Malaysia  in conjunction with its partners in ASEAN  is prepared to co-operate with all parties concerned to find a political settlement of the Kampuchean conflict and to restore to that country its sovereignty and territorial integrity within the framework of the General Assembly resolution. We urge the Secretary-General to convene an international conference open to participation by all parties concerned to negotiate a comprehensive settlement of the conflict. I wish to stress that the essential point is to put an end to the foreign military occupation of Kampuchea and to ensure that a sovereign and independent Kampuchea will not be a threat to any of its neighbours. It is only on this basis that the seeds of future intervention and interference in the internal affairs of that country  either by regional or extra-regional Powers  will be removed and that South-East Asian countries can together determine factors of peace and security as envisaged in the concept of that region as a zone of peace  advocated by the ASEAN countries.283.	Afghanistan affords a parallel with Kampuchea. The common denominator of military intervention threatens to embroil both regions of Asia  affecting stability and order. Malaysia has deplored Soviet actions in Afghanistan and I reiterate the call here for an immediate withdrawal of all foreign forces in order to enable the people of Afghanistan to decide their own future  free from interference and coercion.284.	Events in Kampuchea and Afghanistan pose a grave challenge to the United Nations. This challenge must be faced if we are to maintain the strength and credibility of the Organization as the guardian of international peace and security. To meet this challenge it is incumbent upon the General Assembly to agree on measures to secure full compliance with the provisions of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security. Such measures must leave no room for doubt as to what constitutes intervention and what constitutes co-operation. They must not allow countries to twist aggression into co-operation or intervention into assistance. My delegation pledges its full co-operation to ensure the implementation of such measures.285.	South Africa  like Israel  continues with impunity to violate United Nations injunctions. Apartheid debases human dignity. It calls in question not only the legitimacy of the white minority Government of South Africa  but also the basic values and ethical mores sustaining that Government. The actions of South Africa in resisting United Nations action in Namibia are equally deplorable. Malaysia reiterates its full support for the struggle of the people of South Africa for equality and justice and condemns South African actions in Namibia. South Africa should learn from the developments in Zimbabwe  a country that has written a new and positive chapter in the struggle of colonial peoples for freedom and independence. In all its aspects  Zimbabwe's is a remarkable victory which enriches the human spirit and underscores the wisdom of collective negotiation.286.	I have dwelt at some length on the political situation facing us today. We are no less confronted by the world economic situation  and it is in no better shape.287.	Mass poverty  non-renewable natural resources  unpredictable food supplies  erratic monetary exchange regimes and world-wide inflation are some of the sorry aspects of the world economic scene. It was with the intention of collectively redressing some or all of these problems that we accepted the goal of working towards a New International Economic Order. The eleventh special session of the General Assembly  on international economic cooperation for development  was expressly intended to launch the global round of negotiations. Yet  sadly  what transpired falls far short of both our long-term goals and our immediate needs. Depending on one's position  either in the North or the South  one will take a stand in the continuing debate on what went wrong. But some truths are undeniable. The world cannot continue divided and organized into the rich and the poor  with no serious and continuing attempts to redress the situation. There can be no future  only chaos  in continuing to deny the imperative of negotiating and compromising with the aim of transforming and restructuring the international economy.288.	What is required is removal of obstacles to the goal that we already agree to. Resistance to restructuring and adapting to change  as evidenced by protectionism and obstructionism  clearly reflects a lack of political will or an unwillingness to broaden that will. It will only be on this basis that we can  as a community  work out lasting solutions to all the interrelated problems of growth  inflation  unemployment and monetary stability. The successful conclusion of the negotiations on a Common Fund under the Integrated Programme for Commodities is a significant landmark manifesting the presence of political will and international co-operation in both developing and developed countries.289.	Malaysia urges that the same spirit be maintained in the long and arduous tasks ahead. While these negotiations and issues are complex  and while there are no short cuts  those facts in themselves cannot be made reasons allowing for delays which clearly appear to arise from narrow national interests. Malaysia believes that national interests can best be served in a healthy environment of international interdependence. We therefore urge that determined and positive negotiations be resumed to bring about a convergence of the views held by the countries of the North and the South. We should all draw hope from the recent developments at the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  when a multiplicity of views and interests were reconciled  which promises well for future co-operation.290.	I should like now to turn to a subject of special concern to Malaysia and which warrants the urgent consideration of all countries. I am referring to the problem of illicit drugs and drug abuse. Malaysia brought this matter up at the sixth special session of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs  held at Vienna from 11 to 20 February this year. The Prime Minister of Malaysia  in turn  further underlined the seriousness of the problem at the meeting of the heads of Government of the Asian and Pacific States members of the Commonwealth  held at New Delhi in early September.291.	To date  international understanding has generally regarded drug abuse as a social problem and taken a humanitarian approach  as reflected in the deliberations of the Economic and Social Council and other related bodies. Permit me to say that such an approach is hardly adequate. There are no hopeful signs to indicate that we have been successful in containing  much less eliminating  this problem. On the contrary  illicit trafficking in drugs and drug abuse have mounted and spread. It is now timely for us to recognize illicit drugs and drug abuse as issues which must be confronted by us with utter seriousness and commitment  individually as Governments or collectively under the aegis of the United Nations.292.	It has been recognized that illicit drugs ravage the social fabric  debilitate the mind and spirit of people and corrode the values of individuals. While that is undeniable  it must be further recognized that drug abuse on a pervasive scale threatens and undermines the stability  resilience and national integrity of countries. In the hands of international syndicates and vested groups  illicit drugs and trafficking in them are sinister weapons that can pose serious security problems in some countries. There is a clear link between drug trafficking and other types of organized crime on an international scale  such as the illegal trafficking in firearms. In this context it is no longer just a question of social foundations being undermined  but of nations themselves  already weakened by various other problems  buckling and going under Malaysia would like the international community to be clearly aware of this new dimension. Until the consequences of drug abuse are seen in this context  our actions will be neither corrective nor adequate: they can at best be only rehabilitative.293.	Malaysia is prepared to contribute to initiatives in the international context to bring about effective actions towards reducing  if not eliminating the problems of drug abuse. We appeal to all countries not only to exercise vigilance but to co-operate closely to rid us of this problem in the same manner as we set limits to nuclear weapons and outlaw poison gas and germ warfare. We should like also to underline the international responsibilities of countries on this matter. We urge the United Nations to re-examine the magnitude of this problem  including that of drug abuse having a bearing on the security of nations  so that an effective framework of action  which can be endorsed by all countries as part of their international obligation  can be instituted urgently. We are calling here not only for common awareness but also for common strategy and purpose.294.	We are  without exaggeration  being buffeted by problems and issues on all fronts. Each aspect borders on the other and they are mutually reinforcing. Every issue is fundamental. This is the time to come to terms with our pledges to secure a better world that will endure  that will not throw us back to the dark ages of conflict and mutual destruction."
"98",5044,"NER",35,1980,"ï»¿Our brother  Mr. Salim of the United Republic of Tanzania  to whom I am happy today to pay a tribute  conducted  step by step  with the competence  tact and good humour with which we are familiar  the work of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly  the sixth and seventh emergency special sessions  devoted respectively to the situation in Afghanistan and the question of Palestine  and  finally  the eleventh special session  on international economic co-operation for development. He hands over to Mr. von Wechmar the task  at once enviable and redoubtable  of presiding over the work of the General Assembly. For more than one reason my delegation is happy to see Mr. von Wechmar assume the presidency of the current session because he is  first  the representative of a friendly country  the Federal Republic of Germany  with which my country maintains close and mutually advantageous co-operation. But he is also a talented diplomat  profoundly acquainted with international problems and full of wisdom and experience  all of which are reasons for believing in the success- full development of our work. He may be assured of the- active co-operation of my delegation.226.	On 24 October the international community will celebrate the thirty-fifth anniversary of the entry into force of the Charter of the United Nations  by the adoption of which  in the wake of one of the greatest scourges ever known to mankind  our Governments aroused in the hearts of millions of men and women a ray of hope for a better life  a world of peace and security  justice and equality and economic and social progress for all peoples and countries. What remains of that hope? Very little  unfortunately  because things are not going well.227.	If we take an objective look at the present state of the world at the dawn of the decade of the 1980s  we are obliged to note some bitter facts: that serious hotbeds of tension are developing  which scarcely give cause for optimism  and that a serious structural crisis is shaking the world's economy.228.	At a time when our Organization is getting ready to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  it is with bitterness that my Government notes that in Namibia and in South Africa the situation remains dangerously blocked as a result of the delaying tactics of the racist Government of Pretoria. Thus  at the cynical will of the advocates of apartheid  African patriots are still subject to the humiliating yoke of colonialism and racial discrimination.229.	The international community has always regarded this state of affairs as prejudicial to international peace and security. It has recognized in apartheid a crime against humanity and has expressed unreservedly its moral  material and political support for the oppressed peoples of Namibia and South Africa. Countless resolutions  programmes of action and restraining measures have been adopted in order to eradicate colonialism  racism and apartheid from that part of Africa. But despite all efforts  South Africa  knowing it has the support of certain Western Powers  continues insolently and contemptuously to trample underfoot the most elementary principles of law and morality. My Government will never cease to proclaim the profound aversion and disgust it feels regarding racism and apartheid  to decry the collaboration which South Africa enjoys and to support unfailingly the liberation struggle carried on by the peoples of Namibia and South Africa to recover their dignity  to win their freedom and to participate democratically in the affairs of their country.230.	I am happy in this connection to avail myself of this opportunity at this session to reiterate to the friendly delegation of Zimbabwe the warm congratulations of my Government on its recent admission to this Organization. This is a just tribute paid to the brave people of Zimbabwe  which fought for so many long years for the triumph of freedom and justice.231.	The situation in the Middle East constitutes for my Government another source of concern and disquiet because it is potentially explosive and dangerous for international peace and security. Situated squarely at the crossroads between North Africa and Africa south of the Sahara  having had  since time immemorial  fruitful relations with Arab nations with which it shared a common Islamic culture and civilization and inspired  in all its international actions  by the principles of non-alignment  Niger cannot remain indifferent at the continued occupation of Arab territories by the State of Israel  the latter's repeated aggression against Lebanon and the tragedy of the Palestinian people.232.	It will be readily understood that my Government proclaims its rejection of any acquisition of territory by force  its condemnation of the desecration by Israel of the Holy Places in Jerusalem and the transfer to that city of the capital of the Zionist entity  as well as its full support for all the resolutions adopted in various international bodies calling on Israel to withdraw unconditionally from all Arab territories occupied since 1967.233. In this same context  my Government denounces the repression  the harassment and the terror to which Israel has resorted against the Arab populations in the occupied territories  condemns its continued aggression against Lebanon and proclaims its unreserved support of the just cause of the Palestinian people in its struggle to regain its inalienable and imprescriptible rights. In this connection  it must be clearly understood that  in our view  there can be no just  comprehensive and durable solution of the Middle East crisis without the participation on a footing of equality of the PLO  the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  in all efforts  deliberations and conferences dealing with the question of Palestine and the situation in the Middle East.234. While southern Africa and the Middle East call for and deserve greater attention by our Organization  it is equally true that many other hotbeds of tension continue to shake the world. The proliferation of such bloody  often fratricidal  confrontations constitutes a serious threat to the already frail balance that governs the survival of mankind.235.	How long will that balance hold?236.	Niger and its people  like the whole of the Islamic community and other peace-loving and security-loving peoples  deplore the conflict between two neighbourly sister countries with which my country shares the sacred values of Islamâthat religion of peace  tolerance  brotherhood and love. I should like to reiterate  on behalf of my Government  the appeal addressed on 24 September last by President Seyni Kountche for an immediate cease-fire and the establishment of an appropriate framework for a peaceful settlement of the dispute between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Republic of Iraq.237.	As we continue our analysis of the present world situation  we cannot fail to be struck with amazement and indignation at  and to express our total reprobation of  the all too frequent recourse to certain actions that are prejudicial to detente  peace and international security. Time after time  we have witnessed these past years the brutal incursion by foreign forces into sovereign and independent States Members of the United Nations and of the non-aligned movement.238.	Those brutal incursions by foreign forces into the territories of the Afghan Republic and Kampuchea are  in our eyes  inadmissible and intolerable because they run counter to all the rules of international law. Niger firmly believes in the sacred and inviolable nature of sovereignty and independence of all States and in the right of each people to endow itself with the political  economic and social regime of its choice. Niger  together with nations that love peace  liberty and equality  will continue to strive for the withdrawal of all foreign occupation forces and to oppose  as in the past  the recurrence of such actions.239.	I mentioned earlier the world economic crisis among the situations which diminish the hope born of the adoption of the Charter of the United Nations  and which do not give us cause for optimism when we consider the present world situation objectively.240.	The continued deterioration of the world economy  accelerated by the steady worsening of the terms of trade  the ever-widening scientific  economic and technological gulf between developed and developing countries  the disarray in the international monetary system  and the serious food problems confronting most of mankind will lead our countries and peoples  if we are not careful  towards a disaster whose consequences we have barely begun to assess.241.	Much has been written and said about this sorry state of affairs and its distressing prospects.242.	In particular  emphasis has been placed on the despair and poverty in which the greater part of mankind lives  the ever-increasing indebtedness and impoverishment of the third world countries  the implacable encroachment of the desert and the famine which besets or threatens entire populations in many regions of the world.243.	It has also been emphasized that the present international economic order is cynical and unjust  that it is the carrier of potentially dangerous germs  even for the seemingly uncaring empire of the rich.244.	We paradoxically note that all efforts made to remedy this serious situation have thus far been doomed to failure.245.	The First United Nations Development Decade ended without achieving its objectives. The launching  in the early 1970s  of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade suffered the same fate. The negotiations entered into following the sixth special session in 1974  and designed to provide new bases for economic relations between the States of the North and those of the South  did not lead  as was hoped for  to the gradual process of the establishment of the new international economic order. The fine plans of action so arduously and patiently elaborated at Lima  Buenos Aires  Vienna and New Delhi have not begun to be applied. A few days ago  the eleventh special session  held to reactivate the North-South dialogue  ended its work in this same hall without there being agreement  after countless reports  on even the procedure to be followed during these global negotiations.246.	These repeated failures of the efforts made so far to establish the new international economic order may be explained by the delaying tactics and hesitation of the industrialized countries which  compared to the nations of the third world  do not show the same awareness of the grave dangers threatening the world or the same political will to face up to them.247.	The head of State of Niger  Colonel Seyni Kountche  stressed that state of affairs on 15 April last when he declared:""The hopes for a solution at the world level will be disappointed so long as the industrialized States show the i same inability to learn objectively the lessons to be drawn from the evolution of power relations in the world since 1973. Paralysed by an inward-thinking public desirous of keeping what they have acquired in their consumer society  subjected simultaneously to the contradictory influences of antagonistic pressure groups  those countries are unable to contribute positively to the multilateral negotiations aimed at ensuring the stabilization of currencies  the regularization of raw materials markets and the establishment of trade on a basis of equality and mutual benefit.""248.	Among those objectives  stabilization of prices of raw materials is for my Government a matter of special concern because the drop in the price of some of our products is distressing proof of the narrowness of vision and inability of the wealthy to give willing support to our attempts to move towards economic and social development249.	Niger nevertheless will continue  despite the disappointment and discouragement brought about by the stale-mate in the world  to strive  together with other nations in the third world  for the establishment of a new international economic order. We still nurture the hope that despite the many obstacles and the lack of understanding we have noticed in the past negotiations  wisdom will finally prevail over the selfishness of groups  in the interest of mankind as a whole.250.	My country firmly believes in North-South co-operation  despite the present difficulties; but the nations of the third world must understand that the North-South dialogue cannot in itself bring a solution to the many problems which delay and complicate their development efforts. As stated by the head of State of Niger at the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held in Cuba from 3 to 9 September 1979:""The trap in which we are in danger of remaining for a long time consists in believing that the future of the nations of the third world is in the hands of others  and that horizontal co-operation is a remote domain  only accessible in the future. We must see things as they are  but historical reality tells us unceasingly that our movement has no future if it does not take root and delays indefinitely the strengthening of economic solidarity amongst its members.""That is why my country is assiduously taking care of the close links of co-operation it has established with fraternal and neighbourly countries  in the framework of bodies such as the Economic Community of West African States  the Niger River Commission  the Conseil de l'entente and the Conference of Saharan States  to quote but a few.251.	That is why Niger is also gratified at the highly positive results of the first Conference devoted to economic problems convened by the Heads of State and Government of the OAU on 28 and 29 April this year at Lagos. The Lagos Plan of Action represents in our view an unequivocal expression of the political will of our Governments to undertake  for the benefit of the peoples of the continent  concerted action for the endogenous and self-sustained development of our economies which will lead to the creation of an African common market and an integrated African economic community: the African peoples will not fail to keep this rendezvous with history.252.	Having benefited from the lessons and fruitful contributions of international co-operation  which it has duly appreciated during its trying years of drought  Niger has learnt first to rely on itself and its own strength. Inspired by this basic principle  the Supreme Military Council which governs the destiny of my country has undertaken  since it took office in April 1974  a vast programme of national reconstruction.253.	First of all  we had to take care of the most urgent needs  in other words  to rescue a whole people  threatened in its existence and dignity  from famine and the epidemics that accompany it; to save the capital represented by our livestock  which was being decimated by the implacable drought that afflicted the Sahelian countries.254.	Then we acted to reintroduce order into the affairs of State and to organize  on a healthier and more sound basis  the economic and social development of the nation.255.	The launching of a triennial programme  and then of a five-year development plan  enabled us to record significant results and encouraging successes on the road to the liberation of our economy from natural factors  alimentary self-sufficiency and economic independence.256.	Thus  thanks to the determination of our people  under the guidance of the Supreme Military Council  we have undertaken  very often successfully  to mitigate considerably the effects of the drought and relieve our people of the agonizing spectre of famine; to build up our livestock; to extend our arable land through a sustained policy of agricultural irrigation; to improve our health and educational infrastructure; to increase the purchasing power of our workers and peasants; to increase our budget and our national investment funds substantially; and to endow our country with the appropriate infrastructure for communications and telecommunications.257.	The results we have achieved  far from having gone to our head  have comforted us in our determination to press on.258.	It is in this context that the Supreme Military Council and the Government seek to establish in Niger  through an original formula  a society of development  that is  to use the words of President Kountche  ""a morally healthy and balanced society  fundamentally united  which seeks the same ideal of justice and has the same will for progress"". A national commission has been created for the establishment of that society of development.259.	That commission  which includes all social and professional strata of the nation  will have the task of studying and defining an adequate framework for a policy of accelerated development which will be coherent and harmonious for our country  and the end product of which will be the man of Niger himself. This policy of development will be the fruit of national consensus  obtained through new institutions such as to ensure the inclusion of all strata of our society  their consultation by the public authorities and their active and responsible participation in the actions to be planned and taken.260.	We have undertaken the organization of the rural sector throughout our vast country  as well as the organization of the youth of Niger and of all professionals.261.	We have undertaken to establish in our villages  districts and countries  development cells which will expand until they cover the whole of the national territory at its different community levels.262.	These organizations of peasants  of young people  of professional organizations and development cells will be the crucible for reflection and the guiding power of our developing future society  which we are building up in unity  with determination  and removed from ideological considerations. In this task  as was so rightly said by President Kountche  ""our instrument of work will be  above all  good sense and the philosophy of the land"".263.	This is the exciting experience of Niger at present. It is thus that it hopes to conduct its development  and it hopes to do so in peace and security  which is why it will unfailingly continue to support the work of the United Nations and its noble ideals.264.	As I come to the end of my statement  I wish to pay solemn tribute to the daily action of the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  who has placed his rare intellectual and moral qualities at the exalting service of this historic task of justice  freedom and progress of peoples  a task of harmony and assistance between nations. May he rest assured of the continued support of my Government.265.	May the work of this Assembly enriched by the experience and contribution of the Republic of Zimbabwe and of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  lead to the progress of the cause of peace and international security."
"99",5089,"NGA",35,1980,"ï»¿Mr. President  the General Assembly is meeting for its thirty-fifth session as storm clouds which threaten the future of mankind gather over the international horizon. It gives me great confidence and hope that the task of presiding over the affairs of the General Assembly at this momentous time has been entrusted to someone of your integrity  experience and wisdom. Accept  therefore  my warmest congratulations. Your election is also an acknowledgement of the high respect and admiration which the international community has for your great country  the Federal Republic of Germany  with which my country enjoys most cordial and friendly relations. I am sure that under your wise guidance the Assembly will achieve great success at this session.3.	The past year has been remarkable for the many intractable international crises which the Organization has had to deal with. It is a matter of particular pride to Africa that our predecessor was Ambassador Salim Ahmed Salim from the sister State of the United Republic of Tanzania. Not only did he preside over the thirty-fourth session with a sure and confident hand  Ambassador Salim also had the rare distinction of presiding over three special sessions of the General Assembly. We pay him the highest praise and offer him our felicitations.4.	I should also like to address a special word of praise and admiration to our distinguished Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim. His untiring exertions and imaginative initiatives have become the measure of the successes of the Organization. His reassuring presence was immensely felt at the second extraordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity [OA U\  the first economic summit meeting  which was held last April at Lagos. His frequent visits to Africa have enabled him not only to share moments of history with us but also to endear himself to Africa in a very personal and special way.5.	It is with great pride and satisfaction that  on behalf of the Government and people of Nigeria  I extend the heartiest welcome to the new sister State of Zimbabwe in our ranks. Few events can match the joy  drama and impact of the independence of Zimbabwe. I salute my brother  Prime Minister Robert Mugabe  and all his compatriots for their courage  heroism and magnanimity. Their victory demonstrates clearly that the will of a determined people can never be permanently suppressed. It proves beyond doubt that a determined people fighting for a just cause and dedicated to the recovery of its right will ultimately triumph  no matter how formidable the odds against it. Our brothers and sisters in Zimbabwe have proved to the world the truth of the old adage that ""the limits of tyrants are prescribed by the will of the victims of tyranny"".6.	Nigeria  Africa  and indeed the entire international community  can take justifiable pride in the independence of Zimbabwe. It has coincided with the end of the second decade of the struggle against colonialism and against exploitation. Since 1960  when the General Assembly adopted resolution 1514 (XV) containing the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  it has never relented in its efforts to support the legitimate struggle of the peoples in colonial bondage to regain their freedom and their liberty. That Zimbabwe  whose right to independence was so long denied and contested  is today a nation sovereign and independent is due in no small measure to the impetus generated by that Declaration.7.	I also most warmly congratulate the new State of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines on its attainment of independence and membership of the United Nations. It is our desire to forge closer relations with it as a fellow member of the Commonwealth  and to co-operate with it in building a better  safer and more just world.8.	Universality of membership was part of the dream of the founding fathers of the United Nations for this world body. That dream is now virtually a reality. But that fact should not lure us into complacency. Rather  it should spur us into redoubling our efforts until the right to self- determination of all peoples everywhere in the world is no longer an issue.â9.	It is with a deep sense of history that I stand before the Assembly today. Twenty years ago the late Alhaji Abubakar Tafawa Balewa  the first Prime Minister of Nigeria  addressed this body on the occasion of the admission of Nigeria to membership of this world Organization.  Twenty years in the life of a nation may not represent more than a short step in the long march of history  yet for my country  which  like most third world countries  has not been spared the turmoil  turbulence and tribulations of nation building  20 years have left indelible impressions on our national psyche. During those 20 years  two other heads of State of Nigeria also came to affirm my country's robust commitment to the high purposes and ideals of the United Nations. Today  as the first democratically elected President of my country after more than a decade of military rule  I have come solemnly to reaffirm Nigeria's enduring faith in the aims and principles of the United Nations. I therefore bring to the Assembly  in a very special and authoritative way  the greetings and good wishes of the Government and people of Nigeria.10.	As inter-State relations grow more complex  as under-standing and mutual respect among nations and peoples become more difficult to sustain  as prospects for world peace appear more fragile  people everywhere are increasingly looking to the United Nations for answers. People everywhere want to strengthen the capacity and capability of the Organization to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. They crave to return the United Nations to its central role of being an effective instrument for harmonizing different views  reconciling competing interests and initiating such collective action as would give sustenance to man and his aspirations for peace and plenty in justice and liberty.11.	Half a millennium of colonial rule by European Powers did not succeed in destroying our self-image as Africans. Nor did it quench our thirst to be free  to be respected and to develop our resources for the good of our people. In the past 20 years over 40 African countries have regained their freedom and independence. During that period some of them have fought civil wars not out of irreconcilable differences of ideology or ethnicity; they have fought in order to defend the gains of their independence  to frustrate foreign intervention in their affairs and to maximize their sovereign attributes. Some African States  quite tragically  have fought one another across borders. They have fought not to colonize anyone but in order to defend their perceived patrimony  to safeguard their territorial integrity. Others have fought in order to be independent. Through all the tensions and conflicts of the past 20 years  no independent African country has lost its independence. More are yearning to be free  and they soon will be free and independent. Namibia and South Africa are already waiting in the wings. They decidedly will soon be free. The message is clear: never again will Africa be colonized; never again will Africans tolerate living under racist domination and exploitation.12.	Only last week the current Chairman of the Assembly of the OAU  my dear brother Mr. Siaka Stevens  President of Sierra Leone  addressed the Assembly on the economic and political concerns of Africa 18th meeting]. I wish to take this opportunity to pay him a tribute for his untiring efforts on behalf of our continent. His statement adequately reflected the new emphasis which Africa is placing on its economic development after decades when our overriding preoccupation was to secure the independence of our territories and peoples.13.	Last April I had the honour of welcoming my brother African heads of State and Government to the first extraordinary meeting of the OAU devoted exclusively to consideration of the economic problems of our continent. Determined to attain the goals of economic salvation  we adopted the Lagos Plan of Action for the Implementation of the Monrovia Strategy for the Economic Development of Africa.  We were realistic to acknowledge in that historic document that  just as the liberation struggle was fought and won by us  so also would be our struggle for economic emancipation. But in our interdependent world  all nations are like a team of mountain climbers. We need one another. We must help one another. We therefore welcome constructive co-operation and partnership from the rest of the international community as we embark on the challenging task of addressing the problems of the post-colonial era in our continent.14.	Africa bears the scars of a long history of spoliation and deprivation  of the ravages of the slave trade and foreign aggression  of both political and economic injustices. The current crisis in the world economy is wreaking havoc in Africa. For some areas of the third world the ongoing international negotiations about trade  capital (lows and so on may mean growth through effective participation in key international markets and institutions. For most of Africa those negotiations are about survival itself. The very existence of some of our nations is being critically threatened by adverse economic forces and natural disasters.15.	It will take years before we in Africa can exercise our right to full equality and effective participation in the current international economic system. In spite of the enormous natural wealth and resources of Africa  our continent remains the least developed and our people the most deprived. These degrading disabilities make a mockery of our political independence. We are therefore resolved to make progress. We must therefore refuse to subsidize the economies of the rich by continuing to sell our raw materials and labour to them cheaply in return for their exorbitantly priced manufactured goods.16.	I believe that the time has come for the international community to address itself to the serious issue of reparation and restitution for Africa. It is pertinent to observe that there is hardly any country outside the continent which has not in one way or another benefited from the exploitation of the human and natural resources of Africa. In the wake of the Assembly's important deliberations concerning the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade and the global negotiations  I call upon the Assembly to launch a decade of reparation and restitution for Africa as a master plan for the economic recovery of Africa. I make this call with a serious sense of responsibility. Restructuring the world economic system to conform with the dictates of the new international economic order will help  but that will be in the long-term. Massive  special  immediate and effective measures are required to deal with the exceptional situation in Africa. I have seen too much of Africa's misery and degradation not to be moved to action and to demand the proclamation of a special decade for the economic regeneration of Africa.17.	The problems of no other continent define the international agenda better than those of Africa. I intend therefore to dwell further on African concerns  for the destiny of Nigeria is inextricably linked with the fortunes of all the countries of Africa and all the peoples of African descent abroad. As a result we have continued and shall continue to strive vigorously for the restoration of the rights and dignity of the black man everywhere  who for too long has suffered humiliation and discrimination.18.	The situation in Namibia continues to be a source of considerable embarrassment and concern to the Organization. It continues to undermine the will and credibility of the United Nations. Above all it continues to raise serious questions about the sense of honour and good faith of some permanent members of the Security Council  grave questions about their perception of their duty and responsibilities under the Charter; for the power of the veto was not intended to be used solely for the protection of selfish interests. Rather  the veto was meant to be employed to promote and advance the high purposes of the Charter  to sustain and encourage the practice of international law and morality.19.	Nigeria will no longer tolerate the provocations by South Africa or the dilatory tactics of its allies in the Western bloc with regard to self-determination and majority rule for Namibia. We deeply deplore the collusion between South Africa and its Western allies as a result of which the people of that Territory are denied their inalienable rights. Fourteen years have passed since the International Court of Justice handed down the judgement of 18 July 19661 that South Africa had neither the legal nor the moral right to maintain its perverse administration in Namibia. Furthermore  it is now over two years since the Security Council  in its resolution 435 (1978)  endorsed the proposals by the five Western Powers for Namibia's transition to independence. I therefore find it intolerable that the independence of Namibia should continue to be devilled by the intransigence of South Africa.20.	It seems to me that the recent exchange of correspondence between the Secretary-General and the South African Government calls for immediate action. It offers another opportunity  if any were really necessary  for the United Nations to test the true intentions of the South African Government. The United Nations Transition Assistance Group should therefore be deployed without undue delay to carry out its mandate to supervise a free and fair election in Namibia  so that by the next session of the General Assembly Namibia will have taken its rightful place in the world community of nations.21.	Throughout all the 33 years that the apartheid policies of the Government of South Africa have been considered and condemned by the Assembly  it has become clear that the only peaceful avenue left for their elimination is the imposition of sanctions under Chapter VII of the Charter. In calling again for sanctions  particularly an oil embargo to complement the existing arms embargo against South Africa  I want to emphasize that our Charter specifically prescribes sanctions to give effect to the decisions of the Security Council. I sincerely hope that the International Conference on Sanctions against South Africa  which the United Nations  in co-operation with the OAU  plans to hold next year at Paris  will succeed in addressing that important matter as an effective alternative to the use of force by the United Nations to bring about the birth of a new society in South Africa.22.	But sanctions alone will not destroy apartheid and racism in South Africa. They can  however  be used to support the armed struggle. That struggle is now gathering momentum. If South Africa persists in its defiance of the international will for fundamental change in its policies  none of us has the right to deny the struggle of the South African nationalists full supportâcertainly not Nigeria. We shall continue to assist  encourage and support that struggle with all the might and all the resources at our disposal. The people of South Africa will never flinch from that struggle until ultimate victory is won. The termination of apartheid and racism in South Africa is the challenge of our decade and the attainment of that goal will constitute man's last major victory over the evil forces of colonialism.23.	Global interdependence has too often lately been defined in narrow economic terms. Given its full dimensions of peace and security  it truly permeates and dominates every aspect of international life today. In no area is that concept more ominously felt than the Middle East  a region which lies so close to Africa and has such supreme symbolism for my country.24.	The Middle East situation is of the gravest concern to Nigeria. At the international level  we have spared no effort in the councils of the OAU  the United Nations or the non-aligned countries to seek a viable solution in conformity with the highest imperatives of peace and justice. We do not believe that peace and justice are incompatible.25.	If all the States in the region are to enjoy the right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force  the inalienable rights of the Palestinians cannot and must not be overlooked. To an African  the rights of self-determination  statehood and independence are sacred. To a continent which can easily fall prey to military might  the occupation of territory by force is totally unacceptable. To a people who believe in the United Nations  scornful disrespect for the decisions of the Security Council cannot be justified.26.	In my view  Israel's persistent refusal to recognize the fact that it cannot continue to enjoy legitimacy and rights based on the Organization's original Partition Plan for Palestine [resolution 181 (II)] and at the same time deny to the Palestinians the corresponding legitimacy and rights of nationhood based on the same Plan is the greatest obstacle to any lasting peace in the Middle East. The Palestinian Arabs must and should be enabled to have their own independent sovereign State. Nigeria firmly supports the legitimate right of the Palestinians to their homeland. Israel cannot expect normalization of relations with Nigeria  indeed with Africa  while it continues  in defiance of world public opinion  to occupy the Arab territories which it captured in 1967. Furthermore  its unilateral expropriation of Arab lands and implantation of Israeli settlements in the occupied territories makes any meaningful discussion of normalization of relations at this time even more difficult. Its recent action purporting to alter the present international status of Jerusalem came as an affront to the conscience of my people  to whom Jerusalem has a special meaning and significance. We therefore cannot and will never accept these measures.27.	In the face of the numerous challenges confronting mankind  it would be superfluous to say how much my Government deeply regrets the current tragic conflict between the non-aligned States of Iran and Iraq. I fervently add my voice to the many appeals for restraint and peace between those two neighbouring countries.28.	Recent events give us no cause for joy. The tensions and crises which developed last year remain virtually unresolved. The armaments race has assumed a new and dangerous momentum  at a time when the second Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons has failed. The North- South dialogue on the economic problems of the world is stalemated  as a consequence of a most regrettable inability to agree even on procedures to begin negotiations. The present stalemate in the climate of negotiations between the developing and the developed countries holds terrifying prospects for all. Perhaps  more than is realized  the world is poised delicately on the brinkâthat critical marginâ between survival and disaster.29.	The dangers may be grave  but we cannot afford to despair. Our needs and times call for statesmanship imbued with courage and vision: vision to determine where to begin and courage to do what has to be done. The present uncertain international situation challenges all those entrusted with the responsibility of safeguarding the destiny of mankind to pause and think. Times have changed. Conditions have changed. The concepts and structures which precipitated some of the current international crises cannot remain unchanged. Any organic institution without the means to adjust to change is without the means for its survival.30.	We have the men and the means to meet the challenge of the 1980s and beyond. The sum of over $500 billion  which the developed countries have spent on military research and development since 1960  far exceeds what two thirds of mankind require to banish poverty and degradation. There must be disarmament  particularly nuclear disarmament  to save mankind from untoward anxiety and the holocaust. There must be disarmament to release resources for development. The justification for the retention of nuclear weapons has always  to my mind  been a negative one. Weapons susceptible of causing accidental warfare and capable of destroying all mankind can never act as deterrents to war.31.	The member States of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries [OPEC]  in spite of the unwarranted calumnies often heaped on them  have amply demonstrated what developing countries can do to help themselves and other less fortunate developing countries. They have shown how raw material-producing  developing countries can organize themselves to defend their economic rights. They have shown how to arrest the historical trend whereby the rich countries get increasingly richer at the expense of the poor countries. It is therefore a matter of regret that quite deliberate efforts are sometimes made to mislead the public about the role of energy in the prevailing economic crisis. OPEC prices have risen only in direct proportion to the inflation and price rises generated by the prohibitive costs of imported goods and services as well as the fluctuating rate of exchange of the dollar.32.	The rich  industrialized countries must show a disposition to accept the fact that the present international economic system  based on imperial patterns of thought and relationships  which deny equal opportunity to all mankind  can no longer endure. They must accept the fact that there can be no meaningful and lasting progress on the issues that are of direct and proximate interest to them unless they are prepared to entertain overdue reforms on issues such as money and finance  resource flow  industrialization  trade and protectionism which are so germane to the realization of the aspirations of the developing countries.33.	The rich industrialized countries must shoulder their responsibility to the poor nations of the world  from which they have gained so much in wealth and resources. They must address themselves to the burning issue of how to assist them in an imaginative and compassionate spirit  particularly the least developed countries  which are today overburdened with poverty and unfulfilled aspirations.34.	Mr. President  I began with messages of congratulations to you and congratulations on your outstanding achievements on the international scene. I should like to conclude on a note of hope. As I look back  I am encouraged by what can be achieved if Member States  faithful to the ideals and principles of the Charter  agree to work for solutions to the myriad problems of our time.35.	We have come some way but have a long way to go. We have made some progress but the end of the journey is still far. But reach it we must. Since the beginning of human history the world has been full of conflicts  disputes and wars. This is the tragedy of human existence. The big question is can man ever live with his neighbour in perfect harmony? Can areas of conflict be reduced? In short: can wars be avoided? Some may answer yes; others may say no. Whatever our answer may be  one thing cannot be disputed: that we stand to gain in a world of peace and to lose in a world of war. We must therefore commit ourselves to ensuring peace in the world.36.	Our greatest hope for realizing peace is the United Nations. Each day the problems of the world multiply in number and in complexity. If the United Nations is to keep abreast of them  and if it is to reflect the vast increase in the number and strength of its membership  then it has to undergo some form of organizational change.37.	I do not refer only to its method of work and operation being changed to ensure greater efficiency. Some institutional or structural reform should be considered to democratize its decision-making process. In particular we call attention to the proposal for the expansion of the membership of the Security Council  which Nigeria strongly supports.38.	Each and every one of us must be ready to take his turn and to play his part in the worthwhile endeavour of ensuring the survival of justice and peace. As I have observed  peace cannot be achieved by mere resolutions or declarations. It can only be achieved through commitment. Delaying tactics will not help. We are not asking any nation to abandon its national interests. We are asking all nations to be reasonable in the pursuit of those interests.39.	The world is perched on the threshold of a new and significant decade  a decade of renewal as well as change  a decade of challenge as well as hope  a decade of opportunity as well as danger. What precisely it will be depends on what we make it. With the required good will  we can make it a decade of positive achievement for mankind."
"100",5135,"NIC",35,1980,"ï»¿I should like at the outset to welcome Mr. von Wechmar and to express our most sincere congratulations on his election to the presidency of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. We should also like to express our appreciation for the excellent work done by the outgoing President  Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim of the United Republic of Tanzania  during the last regular session  the two emergency special sessions and the recently concluded special session. We welcome with great pleasure the heroic people of Zimbabwe to membership of the United Nations. It was an honour for us to be present at its proclamation of independence. We also bid a very warm welcome to the delegation of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines as it joins our Organization.110.	As Mr. von Wechmar put it so well  ""this Assembly convenes at a time when the world has entered a difficult decade"". It is difficult primarily because of the lack of political will and the incredible lack of vision  which seems to be symptomatic of a state of moral bankruptcy preventing the developed countries from appreciating the justice of the demands of the overwhelming majority of the people of the world. That majority is eager to uphold not only the right to live with a minimum of decency and dignity but also the fact that the right to such a life requires a new international economic order  a transfer of capital such as to make possible a significant increase in the industrialization of third world countries. They demand above all the right to fight for their liberation and to choose or build the development systems most in keeping with the just aspirations of peoples. We consider that the decisions which will be taken in the first years of this decade will be of unprecedented importance for mankind  for we must not forget the lessons of history with regard to the risks entailed when justice does not prevail through the persuasive capacity of reason. The obvious failure of the recently concluded special session of the General Assembly shows the lack of political will and vision  which is the most serious threat to world peace.111.	Aware of this complex situation and eager to promote peace  Nicaragua believes that lasting peace can be achieved only through the eradication of exploitative regimes  together with imperialism  colonialism  neo-colonialism  apartheid  Zionism and all the other ills contrived by capitalism to justify the exploitation of man by man. That is why  directly after the overthrow of the genocidal Somoza Debayle  we joined the non-aligned movement  whose principles and objectives Nicaragua will uphold within this Organization.112.	The National Directorate of the Sandinist Front for National Liberation  which was in the forefront of our revolutionary process  and the Government of National Reconstruction are aware that the best way for us to stand together with those who want a genuine peace is to continue the fight to achieve or consolidate justice in our own country  Nicaragua.113.	The world learned of the Nicaraguan people's heroism  determination to be free and patriotism  which  under the leadership of the glorious Sandinist Front for National Liberation  put an end to the 70 years of agony during which the enemies of freedom and justice  the allies of imperialism  tried to crush the indomitable spirit of the Nicaraguan people. But  as our poet  Ruben Dario  said  ""Nicaragua is made of vigour and glory  Nicaragua is made for freedom"". So it was that  shortly after the infamous Knox note whereby the United States initiated one of the darkest chapters in the history of interventionism  Benjamin Zeledon emerged on the scene in Nicaragua. He was the hero of the anti- imperialist resistance of 1912 and a precursor of the Sandinist struggle.114.	The achievements of the General of free men  Augusto Cesar Sandino  half a century ago showed once again that moral superiority and patriotism are more important and can achieve more than the mere power of money and weapons in the service of plunder or domination. That great man  whose spirit represents the best of our people  lives in the hearts of all true Nicaraguans  as was amply demonstrated in the heroic insurrection that defeated the Somoza dictatorship and continues to live in our present struggle to rebuild our plundered  bombed but finally liberated Nicaragua.115.	We had not yet recovered from the earthquake that destroyed the capital in December 1972 when the Somoza oppression became even stronger  intensifying the suffering of the people who were fighting for liberation.116.	The economic disaster inherited by the Government of National Reconstruction has no precedent in the history of Latin America. To the tremendous material damage  amounting to $500 million  done to the physical and social infrastructure and the commercial  industrial  agricultural and livestock sectors  there should be added the state of complete internal and external financial insolvency.117.	The external debt was about $ 1 650 million  much of which had been contracted with private international banks  with repayment periods and interest rates that were incompatible with development policy and especially incompatible with the payment possibilities of a destroyed country like Nicaragua. Thus in 1979  even with all our export earnings  we should not have been able to repay the capital and interest we owed.118.	Our gross international reserves were barely sufficient to pay for two days of imports; the public finances had been totally destroyed and were in a state of insolvency; stocks had been exhausted or plundered; the distribution networks had been destroyed; and at the time of the triumph of our people  half of them required assistance in the form of food in order to survive. What is even worse  considering its long-term consequences  the agricultural cycle had been seriously interrupted.119.	The gross domestic product for 1979 decreased by 25.1 per cent  and together with a negative growth rate of 6.9 per cent in 1978  brought us to the unusual position in which the gross domestic product per capita had dropped to its level no less than 17 years earlier  in 1962.120.	What is more  45 000 people were killed  between 80 000 and 100 000 were wounded  and 40 000 children were orphaned. All this bears striking testimony to the suffering of our people.121.	The material and economic damage showed us what tremendous effort we would have to make. The plight of the people gave us the will to make that effort. Our only asset was the political legitimacy  national and international  of the Revolutionary Government.122.	That legitimacy made it possible to unite the whole population behind the national reconstruction effort and  with the conscious support of an organized people  to carry out such important measures as the nationalization of banks and foreign trade  the repossession of the mines and natural resources  agrarian reform and administrative and institutional changes  which are powerful instruments for promoting national development.123.	Our international political legitimacy was the result of the firm exercise of the independence won by our people. The broad sympathy and solidarity awakened by our struggle also made possible a suitable renegotiation of our external debt with private international banks.124.	The efforts which have been made so far have focused on the Programme of Economic Reactivation that was established by the revolutionary Government in January 1980. This programme designates the working people  the patriotic elements of private enterprise  the Government of National Reconstruction and the international community as the historical elements of the national reconstruction. The mobilization of these elements has made it possible for us to overcome the serious problems resulting from the scarcity of basic commodities  to harvest the limited 1979-1980 crops  to root out speculation which tended to institutionalize inflation  to raise the employment level and to carry out the literacy campaign  taking people out of a state of ignorance  and to organize the ""first agricultural year of the Revolution""  a matter of great importance in a country as essentially devoted to agriculture as Nicaragua.125.	While economic stabilization is of obvious importance for any country in a position similar to that of Nicaragua  it also should not be forgotten that what our people earned through the sacrifice of tens of thousands of its best sons was the right to carry out a genuine revolution  one which involved the eradication of crime and exploitation as a system and the creation of a new order guaranteeing respect for the inalienable rights of the human person  the rule of law and the satisfaction of basic necessities such as education  health and housing. Of course  this whole new order cannot be truly revolutionary unless the people are able gradually to take part in the entire process. It is not enough to abolish the totalitarianism which characterized the former regime; one must fight against attempts to create a democracy that is merely a matter of form  that is  one which defends only the interests of the privileged. Popular democracy is the only way of guaranteeing the right of our people to effective participation in the revolutionary process. Therefore we vigorously reject the attempts of those who  adopting a sanctimonious attitude  are trying to impose on us certain specific forms of democracy against the interests of our majority. The allies of the Somoza regime  the interventionists and those who try to impose presidents on us have little moral authority to speak of democracy.126.	This is not the time to go into detail about the many achievements of our revolution in the first 14 months; but we would mention a few things to demonstrate what can be achieved when there is a will to move forward and overcome problems that at first appear to be insuperable.127.	In the area of human rights  we wish to say that the Junta of the Government of National Reconstruction has from the start expressed its concern to ensure full respect for the promotion of human rights. One of the first acts of the Government was the promulgation on 21 August 1979 of the Statute on the Rights and Guarantees of Nicaraguans  article 5 of which provided for the abolition of the death penalty  and on 20 July 1979 the Basic Statute of the Republic  which guarantees  in article 6  full respect for human rights. A few weeks after the revolutionary triumph  the Inter-American Convention on Human Rights was ratified. We have also ratified the international Covenant on Civil and Political Rights with its Optional Protocol  and the International Covenant on Economic  Social and Cultural Rights.128.	Also  as an official policy  the Junta of the Government of National Reconstruction has opened its doors to all international bodies which wish to see for themselves whether human rights are being fully respected. We have received two visits from Amnesty International and one from the International Commission of Jurists  which published a report that said  inter alia:""It is obvious that the Government is concerned to prevent the torture and ill-treatment of detainees. A climate of freedom and guarantees exists in the country. The Government has demonstrated that it is favourably disposed to dialogue and prepared to consider carefully those suggestions which come from institutions and organizations which protect human rights.""129.	At the present time  at the special invitation of the Governmental Junta  the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in our country  looking into the question of respect for human rights.130.	At the judicial level  it is important to say that when the people's Sandinist revolution took control of our country  its first act was to abolish the Political Constitution  which supported the Somoza regime and all its structures  and to deprive of their powers all the former magistrates and judges who  for the most part  had already fled the country because of their complicity in all kinds of violations of the law.131.	As a result  in the first days of the revolution  the country had no organized tribunals  police or other authorities  and everything had to be created.132.	However  notwithstanding the ravages of the war and the precarious economic situation  just 14 months after our triumph the judicial power is functioning fully throughout the entire country; the military power of the revolution has been replaced by the legal power and the rule of law is now on a sound basis.133.	In order to improve the standard of living of the Nicaraguan people and to eliminate the extreme poverty of the groups and sectors on the fringes of society  we have created a Ministry of Social Welfare  which  despite all its limitations  is developing a series of programmes to help the most deprived who  under the dictatorship  have traditionally been on the fringes of society  namely  women  children and the great working masses.134.	On 19 July 1979  after 45 years of dictatorship  the general picture of housing in Nicaragua was truly gloomy. Substandard housing and slums made up 60 per cent  or 300 000 of the living units in the country.135.	In the first year we have completed or initiated 10 times the number of units built in a single year during the dictatorship; but the challenge of the future is immense. To make up for lost time and meet the requirements of the growing population it will be necessary to build 30 000 housing units a year between 1980 and the year 2000. In other words  every year we shall have to build more than the dictatorship built in half a century.136.	After the triumph of the people's Sandinist revolution  a number of fundamental changes were made in the educational system in order to put education at the service of the masses. The elitist  vertical  fragmentary education known in the past was abolished  as were the other flaws in the educational system that were the legacy of Somoza.137.	A national literacy campaign involved the mobilization of more than 100 000 persons promoting literacy in all corners of the country. The result of their efforts has been to reduce the illiteracy rate from 54 per cent to 12.9 per cent of the population. All this has taken place in scarcely a year since Somoza's defeat. A campaign has been started among the English-speaking  Miskito and Sumo-speaking people on the Atlantic coast  and it is hoped that by June of next year the illiteracy rate will be reduced to 8 per cent.138.	I will conclude this part of my statement with a few observations regarding the Council of State of the Republic of Nicaragua.139.	The Council of State is a new institution  an innovation for which the revolution is responsible and an instrument intended to be a living expression of the democracy of our people. It brings together 29 people's organizations  trade unions  guilds  and political and social organizations  and there are 47 representatives of these organizations.140.	For the first time in the history of our country  workers  peasants  women  young people  people from the towns and the country  discuss without intermediaries all the problems that concern them. They have decision-making authority with regard to those problems and can translate into laws the solutions which are viewed as appropriate by our workers and peasants.141.	The Council of State is made up of democratically elected representatives; it is an experiment in democracy in the making; it is of benefit to our people as they seek structures that will make it possible for them to build a genuine people's democracy.142.	In the area of international relations  Nicaragua has tried to strengthen its bonds of friendship and co-operation with old friends and our relations are indeed very cordial with many countries  including Mexico  Cuba  Panama  Costa Rica  Venezuela  Ecuador  Jamaica  Peru  Grenada  the Federal Republic of Germany  Spain  the Netherlands and Sweden.143.	We have also established new and very good relations with the Soviet Union  the German Democratic Republic  Poland  Bulgaria and practically all the socialist countries of Europe. We have made overtures to Africa  a fraternal continent with whose people ours have much in common  including common aspirations. We have established diplomatic relations with Mozambique  Angola  Zimbabwe  Zambia  the United Republic of Tanzania and a number of other African countries with which we wish to have strong bonds of friendship and co-operation. We have achieved those with our good friends in Algeria  our dear friends in the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic and the heroic POLISARIO4 Front  whose cause we support.144.	We wish to strengthen our bonds with many other Arab countries  too  and have already established diplomatic relations with some of them. India is a country with which we have diplomatic relations and we should like to bring them to a level of great cordiality and co-operation. We would also like to strengthen our ties with other countries in Asia  where we have spiritual bonds with the heroic people and Government of Viet Nam  a living example of dignity  patriotism and valour.145.	As we have already said on many occasions  we wish to maintain the best possible relations with the United States  and we are willing to continue to make whatever effort is necessary to heal the wounds which still exist among our people as a result of the policies of intervention and of complicity with tyranny which  until only a short time ago  were dominant. We appreciate the important efforts made by President Carter to bring about changes in the traditional policies of the United States towards our people. Regrettably  as the entire world is probably now aware  there are still powerful interests within and outside The United States Government that are eager to slander and damage the only popular  democratic and nationalist Government that Nicaragua has ever had over the past 70 years. There are two trends in the United States todayâone realistic and the other interventionistâand the nature of our future relations with the United States will depend on which trend emerges triumphant. We wish to be friends  but we will never sell out  nor will we ever flag in our sacred task of building a new free and sovereign Nicaragua.146.	Although we have nothing but the most cordial feelings for the sister people of Colombia  the obligation to defend our territorial integrity has obliged us to issue a declaration regarding the invalidity of the Barcenas Meneses-Esguerra Treaty   which was signed and ratified during the United States occupation of Nicaragua andâthis is importantâunder United States pressure. Although we realize that the present Colombian Government cannot be blamed for the fact that the 1928 Government took advantage of the United States occupation of Nicaragua to gain control over part of our territory  once we achieved independence and sovereignty with the overthrow of the Somoza dictatorship  we could not fail to declare null and void a Treaty which had never expressed the sovereign will of our people  and which  even from the legal standpoint  is invalid  since it is at variance with the provisions of the Constitution in force in Nicaragua at that time. It is a matter not only of the San Andres and Providencia Islands and the keys  but of more than 80 000 square kilometres of Nicaraguan territory on our Atlantic continental shelf. We shall continue to do everything we can to see to it that this conflict is settled within a framework of fraternity and respect  and we maintain that dialogue is the best course of action. In our view  it is also important to stress that this is not a border conflict  since Colombia and Nicaragua have never been neighbours in the geographic sense.147.	If I have dwelt on the progress of the revolutionary process in Nicaragua  it is because I feel the international community has the right to know the truth concerning a process about which the media speak so much  but often with the sole intent of distorting the facts. We should not be surprised that there are many who would like to see the Nicaraguan revolution fail. However  the fact is that  due fundamentally to our people's fighting spirit and will to win  and due also to the solidarity of the international community  the Sandinist revolution is gaining ground increasingly  to the point that we have no hesitation in declaring that it is now an irreversible process. It does have problems to one extent or another  but what is important is that there is now no turning back.148.	We do not regard our revolution as something separate and apart from the world-wide revolutionary process; quite the contrary  it is an integral part of the fight of peoples for their liberation. That is why we cannot fail to identify with and to stand by all those still involved in this same process.149.	Yesterday it was the people of Nicaragua. Today the heroic people of Zimbabwe is another link in the long  powerful chain of peoples that have waged great struggles for national liberation. And  just as the example of the Nicaraguan victory serves to advance the cause of liberation in Latin America  so does Zimbabwe's victory represent an enormous stride in the struggle for liberation in southern Africa  as did the victories of Mozambique and Angola before it. With Zimbabwe's victory  that struggle has reached a decisive stage  and we are convinced that  sooner rather than later  the people of Namibia  represented by its sole vanguard  the South West Africa People's Organisation  will join us in this hall.150.	But it is the mortally wounded beast that is the most dangerous. The cornered racist regime of Pretoria is committing ever more criminal acts of aggression against the front-line States. At the same time  it is trying to impose its system of exploitation and repression by means of so-called ""internal settlements""  which violate the popular will of Namibia. More valid than ever now is the statement issued at the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held from 3 to 9 September 1979 at Havana  that ""freedom  peace  security and progress cannot be achieved in southern Africa unless the apartheid system of institutionalized racial discrimination  exploitation and oppression is crushed"".  That task devolves fundamentally upon the South African people  but we believe that the role of the international community must not take the form of mere resolutions unimplemented by concerted action of the kind envisaged in Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations.151.	No less than racism and South African expansionism  Zionism and Israeli expansionism have been repressing the peoples of the area which are defending their inalienable right to self-determination. The Government of Nicaragua  which recently formalized diplomatic relations with the people of Palestine and its sole legitimate representative  the PLO  considers it a primary duty of the United Nations to help bring about peace and stability in the Middle East  which  of course  involves defence of the inalienable rights of the Palestinians  including the right to establish a State of their own. Defence of the Palestinian struggle also implies rejection of any partial approach or agreement aimed at settling the future of the occupied territories and of the Palestinian people without full participation of the PLO as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.152.	We need decisive  imperative measures that will lead to a settlement of the question of Palestine and the Middle East problem. We are all well aware that the Middle East conflict may have a decisive bearing on international peace and security  and since the Palestine question is the crux of the problem in the region  we can only conclude that it is Israeli intransigence and that of Israel's supporters that keeps the world on the brink of disaster.153.	In the course of the past year  the areas of confrontation in the world have apparently widened and become more serious. Nicaragua is well aware of the fact that  as long as there are exploiters and exploited  oppressors and oppressed  there will have to be struggleâoften bloodyâif peoples are to move forward in history. But the possession of nuclear weapons  particularly by a Power which today is toying dangerously with the absurd idea of preventive attacks and reckless concepts of limited nuclear warfareâ which is undermining our efforts to secure non-proliferation and disarmamentâonly serves to increase international tension. The search for military bases and the creation of rapid deployment forces also increase international tension.154.	Failure to ratify the SALT II treaty  manoeuvres by naval forces  the supply of weapons to reactionary Governments and military intervention by major Powers against countries in the Middle East and Indo-China further increase international tension and endanger world peace. In this context  with regard to the case of Afghanistan  our country would like to reiterate the appeal made at the sixth emergency special session of the General Assembly7 that a dialogue be started  without conditions  between the countries involved in this conflict  between the parties which in one way or another support or oppose the revolutionary plan that motivates the Afghan people  in order to preserve peace and stability in the area.155.	In reiterating our support for the right of the Afghan people to self-determination  we consider that any discussion of this subject in this forum that is not accompanied by efforts to bring the peoples of the region together  as we have already said  will only serve rhetorical purposes  increase tension and make a settlement of the conflict even more difficult.156.	Nicaragua takes a similar approach to the situation in South-East Asia; there too certain Powers are trying to destabilize the area and aggravate regional conflicts. How else can we explain the fact that the genocidal Pol Pot regime continues to occupy a place in this hall? Why are armed and economic provocations continuing against Viet Nam? Can it be that the necessary conditions for renewed aggression from the north against Viet Nam are being prepared? We vigorously reject the policy of punishment and threat of the use of force  which violates the purposes and principles of the United Nations.157.	Tension in the Indo-Chinese region must be reduced. In this connection we applaud the proposals of the legitimate Government of Kampuchea put forward in July at the meeting of Foreign Ministers at Vientiane  where  together with Laos and Viet Nam  the decision was taken to solve the problems with Thailand by the creation of a demilitarized zone along the border. We believe that this proposal deserves the attention and the support of the General Assembly. We maintain that co-operation and understanding among the States of the area must be fostered and not obstructed.158.	Of course  there is no greater need for understanding than among peoples which have been artificially divided. I refer to Korea and the just demand of the Korean people for peaceful reunification of its homeland  which the people and the Government of Nicaragua fully endorse. We condemn the unbridled military repression of the Korean people in the south.159.	This year we commemorate the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the historic Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. In few other areas has the United Nations been more successful in promoting the ardent desire of peoples for peace  progress and freedom  that is to say  in giving effect to the purposes and principles of the Charter  than it has done in the field of decolonization.160.	However  resolution 1514 (XV) speaks of the eradication of colonialism in all its forms and manifestations. We emphasize those words because there are still attempts in the world to give colonialism a new face  with the aim of impeding the historical process of liberation. There are peoples  such as those of the Sahara  Belize  East Timor and Puerto Rico  which have not yet achieved their inalienable right to self-determination and independence.161.	Furthermore  there are countries which seek to dilute the principle of the complete transfer of powers to colonial peoples as a prerequisite for decolonization  as required by resolution 1514 (XV). Thus  in the case of East Timor  there are a number of resolutions calling for the withdrawal of Indonesia from the Territory and self-determination and independence for its inhabitants. Similarly  the General Assembly has recognized the legitimacy of the struggle of the Sahraoui people against Moroccan occupation and urged Morocco to undertake direct negotiations with the POLISARIO Front  the indisputable representative of the Sahraoui people. Both Indonesia and Morocco have turned a deaf ear to the appeals of the international community and have at the same time responded with new military aggression. In both cases the occupying Powers are counting on weapons being supplied by the imperialists and their allies.162.	Nicaragua and the Latin American peoples are seriously concerned about the colonial status of Puerto Rico because Puerto Rico is the only Hispano-American nation which has not yet achieved independence. We reaffirm that Puerto Rico cannot continue to be an exception to the process of decolonization. That has also been stated by the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  in its resolution of 20 August 1980 calling on the Government of the United States to present as soon as possible a plan for the decolonization of Puerto Rico and declaring unacceptable any measure aimed at changing the political status of that sister island without the explicit consent and participation of the people of that nation.163.	That resolution calls attention to the military activities of the United States in the town of Vieques  which not only violate Puerto Rican rights but also constitute provocations against the peoples of the area  and tend to worsen the tense political situation in the Caribbean and Central America.164.	The Bolivian people has constantly sought to recover its legitimate right to sovereign access to the sea. The fact that that country is land-locked is a major factor obstructing its economic and social progress. To that is added the constant unswerving struggle against foreign oppression and the need for a stable pluralistic social democracy. Those positions were reiterated during the elections which last July led to the victory of the People's Party of Democratic Unity. That triumph was suddenly interrupted by a coup dâÃ©tat unprecedented in the history of that country and of Latin America in terms of political crimes  the killing of miners and corruption. It is necessary to point out that  unlike in the past  the political power generated by the economic power deriving from drug trafficking  under the auspices of various military members of the present dictatorship  had a decisive influence in the coup of Garcia Meza. Thus those are crimes committed by people who deserve no political consideration or protection. Hence the regime is absolutely without popular support and remains isolated from the Catholic and Methodist Churches  the democratic parties  trade unions  farmers  students  and the honest sectors of private enterprise.165.	That coup has provoked such widespread repugnance that  three months after the regime took power  it has not been able to consolidate its position within the country and is rejected by the overwhelming majority of the international community. Nicaragua hopes that the isolation of those unworthy representatives of the military will continue and that the heroic people of Bolivia will be able to exercise their right to self-determination and be governed by those who were democratically elected on 29 June of this year.166.	Nicaragua fully supports the two political demands of the Bolivian people: for an outlet to the sea and for democracy.167.	We support the people of Belize and the Government of Belize who are about to realize their aspirations to be an independent country. We support the just demands of the sister republic of Cuba regarding the withdrawal of American troops and the reincorporation of the territory of Guantanamo into the country.168.	With the liberation of Nicaragua  the situation in Central America has been changed in an irrevocable manner. Neither destabilization campaigns nor military manoeuvres  nor the most brutal military repression will stifle the desire for freedom of the peoples of El Salvador and Guatemala. We warn the world that outside intervention in El Salvador would involve a spreading of the conflict- to the entire central American area. Nicaragua does not intervene in the internal affairs of its neighbours  and we reject the ill-intentioned accusations which are levelled at us in this respect with the sole aim of disguising or justifying the intervention of those who have been intervening since the last century  as the history of Nicaragua shows. We reject any intention to set up what was erroneously named inter-. American peace forces  because they are merely new forms of intervention and new weapons for use against peoples.169.	The Nicaraguan revolution stands with the peoples fighting for their liberation  and we wish to issue an appeal to the international community to increase its efforts to win respect for the principle of non-intervention and self- determination of peoples as an indispensable condition for the peace which the peoples of the world desire."
"101",5181,"NLD",35,1980,"ï»¿Mr. President  it is a particular pleasure for me to congratulate you on your election to the high office of President of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. You have  during the past few years  given ample proof of your knowledge of United Nations matters  of your wisdom and tact  and of your organizational abilities. We look forward to working with you in the days ahead.2.	We want  too  to extend our cordial congratulations to the President of the previous session of the General Assembly and to compliment him on the most efficient and exemplary way in which he guided our work.3.	We also wish to address very special congratulations to the delegation of Zimbabwe. Likewise  we welcome most warmly to our midst the delegation of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. We wish these sovereign and independent States a bright and peaceful future  and we declare our solidarity with them in their brave endeavours to that end.4.	The general debate in the Assembly presents us each year with a good opportunity to evaluate the events of the year behind us and to draw conclusions in respect of the future. And each year we try to formulate recommendations that appear to us most suited to the mood of the particular period. Developments in the international political situation since we met last year have been deeply disturbing  as they have tended to undermine rather than enhance the rule of law that should govern the relations not only among nations but also among individuals 5.	In our endeavours to create a better international climate and to further understanding among nations  we should never forget that nations consist of human beings and that human beings first and foremost bear the brunt of the clashes  strife and discord among nations. Conversely  there will be no real basis for a stable peace and security as long as fundamental rights and freedoms of men  women and children are totally disregarded. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 says: ""recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom  justice and peace in the world"" .6.	The attainment of respect for the individual and his rights all over the world is and will remain one of the principal tasks of our Organization. That means tolerance  justice and the right to live together in this world.7.	The Kingdom of the Netherlands throughout the ages has tried to build a society based on tolerance. As a result  our foreign policy is very much oriented towards the protection of the individual and his rights. That outlook has also inspired our development policy  which lays particular stress on the need of the poorest members of the international community.8.	The events that have occurred since the autumn of 1979 have affected many human lives. I feel that it is essential to find adequate solutions for the needs of the many individuals affected by war  famine  disease and discrimination. In my address I should  therefore  like to focus on the effect of international controversies on the individual  and on the widespread lack of justice. I intend to discuss some of the major themes that are of concern to the community of nations and that affect the lives and destinies of millions of people.9.	My friend and colleague  Mr. Thorn  the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Luxembourg  expressed the views of the nine countries of the European Community on some major international problems before the General Assembly . He also dwelt on the issues I have just mentioned.10.	A clear violation of the rules of international relations and of the self-determination and sovereignty of a people is the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. This action by a permanent member of the Security Council was condemned by the great majority of the members of this Assembly when it met in special session in January of this year.11.	The Soviet intervention in Afghanistan has been a cause of deep concern to my Government  and we have expressed this concern on more than one occasion. The Governments of the European Community have also appealed to the Soviet Union to withdraw its troops unconditionally. On these occasions it was stressed that detente is indivisible  that developments in one region have repercussions in other regions of the world. The Community  inâApril' and June  of this year  proposed as a solution an agreement between the big Powers and the countries bordering on Afghanistan to respect that country's sovereignty and territorial integrity and to desist from interfering in its affairs  from stationing troops and from any form of military association with Afghanistan. Any initiative in that direction would be supported by the Community. That is still the position  and we hope that such a solution will be pursued for the sake of the Afghan people and for the sake of world peace.12.	The effect of the intervention has been a human tragedy for the Afghan people in terms of casualties and of hundreds of thousands of refugees in neighbouring countries. In view of the human suffering and of the threat to peace  the Netherlands Government reiterates its support of measures to restore Afghanistan's traditional status as an independent and nonaligned country  to enable its people to determine its own future in freedom.13.	In southeast Asia  the conflict in and around Kampuchea remains unresolved. Here again a human drama continues to unfold with complete disregard for elementary human rights and the freedom of the individual. Here again  the stability of the area and world peace and security are threatened. The Netherlands Government will continue to support the efforts to help the victims of this conflict. It is even more important to address ourselves to the causes of this conflict. The Netherlands therefore supports wholeheartedly the initiative of the countries members of the Association of southeast Asian Nations [ASEAN] to convene an international conference on Kampuchea. The political problem caused by Viet Nam's role in Kampuchea should be faced and solved in such a way as to allow the Kampuchean people to decide their future for themselves without outside interference  and thereby to restore peace and stability in the region.14.	We have witnessed another violation of the rule of law in international relations in the region in the taking hostage of the personnel of the American Embassy in Teheran  an action that is a threat to peace as well as a violation of human rights. The Security Council has said as much on several occasions. I listened with great attention to what United States Secretary of State Muskie had to say on this subject [4th meeting]  and I cannot but agree with him that this tragic impasse should be resolved quickly. Once again  we solemnly appeal to the Islamic Republic of Iran to release the hostages and thus put an end to their suffering.15.	For my country  the recent outbreak of hostilities between Iran and Iraq is a reason for grave concern. From this rostrum I make an urgent appeal to both parties to observe the utmost restraint and to resolve their dispute by peaceful means.16.	The ending of the war in Southern Rhodesia and the emergence of the sovereign State of Zimbabwe have removed a major source of tension in southern Africa. It is evident  however  that other sources of tension in southern Africa remain  notably the issue of apartheid and the question of Namibia. The developments in Zimbabwe have given hope to many throughout southern Africa. Positive changes which occur in the neighbourhood of South Africa and which satisfy aspirations for human dignity and stability cannot fail to make themselves felt in South Africa itself. They will thus promote increasingly effective pressure from within.17.	The Government of the Netherlands  conscious of the impact of economic and social development in a number of countries in southern Africa on political progress in Namibia and South Africa  has decided to set up a special aid programme for southern Africa. In this way we wish to make a contribution to the important political initiative of the nine States of southern Africa  members of the Organization of African Unity  aimed at achieving economic independence from South Africa and cooperation among themselves. We will avail ourselves of this General Assembly session to give an impulse towards this goal. We urge many countries to do the same  and we think that the Assembly should address itself to this issue.18.	Effective outside pressure on South Africa should be stepped up as much as possible. A policy of discrimination can never be made acceptable to those who are being discriminated against or to the international community as a whole. We make an urgent plea to the South African Government to face the inescapable truth that the apartheid policy will come to an end. In its own efforts to attain this goal  the Netherlands Government is in the process of sounding out friendly countries on any possible concerted efforts  including economic measures  to bring about a change in South Africa which will bring to this part of the world the dignity that mankind deserves.19.	My Government will continue to support the Secretary General  the group of five Western States and the frontline States in their efforts to implement settlement proposal for Namibia approved by the Security Council in its resolution 435 (1978). Outstanding issues have been clarified and we are confident that the greatest possible impartiality in implementing that resolution can now be achieved. Therefore South Africa should  without any further delay  be prepared to start implementation of the settlement plan in coordination with the United Nations.20.	Concerning the Middle East  Mr. Thorn  speaking on behalf of the European Community  has already elaborated on this issue. I  too  wish to stress that a just  lasting and comprehensive peace settlement can only be based on the rule of law and respect for the individual. The nine countries of the European Community expressed this in their meeting at Venice  notably emphasizing two principles. These two principlesâthe right to existence and to security of all States in the region  including Israel  and justice for all peoples  which implies recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian peopleâshould now be put into practice.21.	At this stage I do not wish to prejudge the results of the current process of consultations and deliberations. What I can say  however  is that the Netherlands adopts a positive approach to any activity which will lead to a just  lasting and comprehensive peace settlement.22.	I now come to the situation in Lebanon. The Netherlands Government takes a particular interest in what happens in that strife torn country. We attach great importance to the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon  including the reestablishment of the sovereignty of the Lebanese Government over its entire territory. I have mentioned the territorial integrity of Lebanon since it constitutes a prerequisite for stability in the Middle East.23.	A battalion of Dutch soldiers in the service of the United Nations is involved in the peacekeeping activities of UNIFIL in southern Lebanon. We deeply regret all sorts of obstacles preventing UNIFIL from carrying out the task entrusted to it by the Security Council. From this rostrum I call upon all parties concerned to enable the UNIFIL contingent to fulfil in safety its difficult and important mandate.24.	It is true that in certain countries the human rights situation has improved  but from other corners of the world we hear of serious situations and new waves of repression. Bolivia is a case in point. The process leading to a return to democracy has been interrupted in that country and repressive measures  often of a violent nature  are being taken. That development is the more regrettable because of the growing cooperation between the countries belonging to the Andean Pact and the European Community. At this stage I want to reiterate our wish to intensify relations between the European Community and the democracies in Latin America.25.	For many years my Government has  together with others  strongly advocated a return to democracy and respect for human rights in Chile. However  we cannot consider the recent referendum on the new Constitution in Chile as a step forward. In our view  that Constitution is not likely to guarantee a speedy return to Chile's traditional democratic form of government.26.	The Kingdom of the Netherlands  part of which is situated in the Caribbean  is understandably concerned about the recent controversies in that region and in Central America. We think that a climate of stability and cooperation is of the utmost importance if true progress and development are to be achieved.27.	The international situation has worsened rather than improved in the past year. The conflicts I have mentioned all lead to greater suffering. They also lead to greater demands on resources which could be used for development and for the improvement of the deteriorated economic situation. They certainly lead to less security and peace for mankind.28.	My Government's policy remains directed at the attainment of peace and security and the lessening of international tensions. This presupposes the creation of a climate of trust in which the ground rules underlying the relations between nations and individuals are respected.29.	East West relations are under stress as a result of developments in Southwest and southeast Asia. They are also affected by the continued Soviet military build-up.30.	We hope that the second review session of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe  to be held at Madrid in November of this year  will contribute to the lessening of East West tensions. The Helsinki Final Act is a code of conduct  a set of ground rules for multilateral and bilateral relations between States  as well as between States and private citizens.31.	At Madrid  a frank and business-like discussion should take place on the full implementation of the provisions of the Final Act. In such conditions  we believe it will be necessary to discuss negative developments  such as those in the human rights sphere. Only in that spirit can the aim of the Conference be fulfilled.32.	Confidence-building and other measures should be agreed upon in the interests of peace  security and stability in the world. My Government will endeavour to arrive at meaningful confidence-building measures for the whole of Europe which should go beyond mere declarations of intent. The growing tensions in the world compel us to pay special attention to effective measures aimed at disarmament and arms control and the curtailing of arms traffic.33.	Disarmament matters are discussed in various forums. However  inspiration is often lacking in those deliberations. Nuclear arms issues are taking a prominent place in those discussions. A comprehensive test ban treaty would be desirable in itself and would provide us with an important psychological stimulus for nuclear disarmament. It would also strengthen the non-proliferation regime.34.	A growth in the number of nuclear Powers would inescapably lead to nuclear chaos. We therefore regret that the non-proliferation discussion has developed overtones of a North South controversy  whereas it concerns the security and survival of all of us. The Second Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons has unfortunately failed to reach a consensus.35.	We should not close our eyes to the possible serious repercussions of that setback. Broad political support remains the basis for a viable non-proliferation regime. A worldwide meeting of minds on that vital issue is essential. In that context  we have noted with appreciation the intention of the United States Government to move forward as speedily as possible after the presidential elections towards the ratification of the SALT II Treaty. 36.	The excruciating problem of nuclear armament and nuclear disarmament tends to overshadow all other problems. However  let us not forget that armed conflicts in various parts of the world are being waged at this very moment with conventional weapons that maim and kill  albeit on a smaller scale. I hope the decisions to be taken by the Disarmament Commission on that problem will lead to at least the start of serious discussion within the United Nations of conventional disarmament measures.37.	Just to underline the great importance the Netherlands attaches to disarmament and arms control  I should like to mention in passing that this week has been proclaimed ""Peace Week"" in my country.38.	The conclusions of the eleventh special session of the General Assembly are still fresh in our minds. There will be other occasions when we can explain in detail our Government's views on the present stage of the North South dialogue. I therefore wish to limit myself to a few remarks on the follow-up of that session.39.	It is our sincere desire that the Assembly should adopt the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade with a view to its implementation as from the beginning of next year. Let me echo the feelings of grave concern that you  Mr. President  expressed in your opening statement  that so many countries have not reached the 0.7 per cent aid target. That target should indeed  in our view  be reached in the first half of this decade.40.	My Government shares the widespread disappointment that no final agreement could be reached on a procedural framework for the new round of global negotiations. I strongly appeal to those Governments which  at the closure of the eleventh special session  were not able to join in the consensus  to make every effort to overcome the present difficulties during this session.41.	On the subject of furthering the advancement of human rights  I want to underline the importance of attaining equality between women and men. The idea of convening a World Conference at Copenhagen this summer  midway through the United Nations Decade for Women  was a good initiative. It was therefore regrettable that the work of the Conference was thwarted by extraneous political questions which had very little bearing on the subject under discussion. Unfortunately  I feel compelled to express my regrets that such events have affected other discussions in the United Nations as well.42.	The Netherlands delegation was unable to support the Programme of Action adopted at Copenhagen as such. Nevertheless  the Kingdom of the Netherlands stands ready to continue  within the United Nations and in the framework of the Decade  to work for the advancement of the position of women. Fortunately  there have been important achievements during the Decade  such as the conclusion of a Convention on the Elimination of AH Forms of Discrimination Against Women  the operation of the Voluntary Fund for the United Nations Decade for Women  the World Plan of Action adopted at Mexico City in July 1975 and the great number of positive clauses in the Programme of Action adopted at Copenhagen. These achievements have prompted my Government to continue to work for the further broadening and deepening of United Nations policy for women's equality  in particular in the field of multilateral development cooperation.43.	My country attaches great importance to the legislative process with regard to the promotion of human rights within this Organization. I would appeal to all who participate in that process to speed up the work on a declaration on the elimination of religious intolerance  on a convention on the prohibition of torture and on a declaration on the rights of individuals who are not citizens of the country in which they live. The question of this last declaration is on the Assembly's agenda under item 12. It is our wish that at some time in the future the implementation of all human rights instruments will be monitored by a United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights  an institution we will continue to promote.44.	In his report on the work of the Organization  the Secretary General has once again presented to us with clarity and precision a concise picture of the political and economic situation of the world of today. The picture is not bright. I wish to pay special attention to the plight of millions of people suffering from disease and starvation who are forced to leave their homesteads  and I shall quote from the Secretary Generalâs report where it says:""Political and military conflicts and upheavals invariably engender human suffering which  on occasion  reaches disaster proportions. . . . Problems of refugees and displaced persons as well as demands for relief and rehabilitation on a massive scale exist in Africa and Asia. .. . Considerable strain is imposed on the fragile economies of countries that receive large numbers of refugees  and they naturally expect the international community to share the burden they carry.""In addition  international assistance is required to deal with the ravages of drought and famine which have spread from the Sahelian countries to many other countries in Africa  leaving in their wake starvation and social disruption."" 45.	The international community has a responsibility to see to it that these calamities are avoided. We were encouraged by the Secretary Generalâs positive reaction to the initiative taken in the Economic and Social Council last summer for a review of the emergency operations of the United Nations system.46.	A number of years ago  my country made a proposal to raise the capacity of the United Nations system for coping with manmade disaster situations."" It is my Government's sincere wish that when the Secretary General presents his review we once more seriously consider how to cope with them. The only road that can lead to success in this respect is a close  continuous and institutionalized cooperation between nations and the United Nations system  as well as within the United Nations systems itself  to provide on the shortest possible notice the assistance required for any given specific calamity.47.	The founder Members of the United Nations built a structure that  we believe  has kept its basic validity to this day. It has built-in checks and balances between the various groups of Members. Its size and composition make it an instrument for deep discussions and well considered decisions. In the present circumstances  any proposals for drastic change may upset the present checks and balances and make the instrument at our disposal less  rather than more  effective. Of course  the present machinery should  in certain instances  be improved. The strengthening of the Organization for coping with the calamities which I just mentioned is a case in point. I would also like to see more support given to the peacekeeping activities of the Organization. We believe that more use could be made of valuable instruments that are already at our disposal. For instance  more frequent recourse to one of the main organs of the Organization  the International Court of Justice  and  even more important  abidance by its decisions would be conducive to the settlement of conflicts between nations.48.	In a world in which political and economic tensions seem to grow rather than to diminish  the demand for a more peaceful world with a chance for every citizen of every country to lead a decent life becomes more imperative. In this ever more interlocking and interdependent world  we must come to grips with the economic and social problems and provide peace and security for each and every one."
"102",5227,"NOR",35,1980,"ï»¿Mr. President  it gives me great pleasure to see such a distinguished representative of the Federal Republic of Germany presiding over this important session of the General Assembly. Your eminent qualifications for discharging the duties of your high office are well known to us all and in particular to countries which  like my own  maintain the closest relations with your country. I also wish to place on record the deep appreciation of my Government of the way in which your predecessor Mr. Salim of the United Republic of Tanzania presided over the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly last year and the special sessions this year.20.	The General Assembly is meeting in a situation of international tension and uncertainty. This session provides the appropriate occasion to discuss ways and means to reduce the dangers we see and to advance our objective of making the United Nations a better instrument for peace keeping and peace making.21.	I should like to start by referring to two international conferences concluded this monthâthe eleventh special session  on development  and the second Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. My purpose is not to evaluate the outcome of these conferences but to raise a question borrowed from a Norwegian poet: ""Humanity  why is thy progress so slow?"".22.	The eleventh special session was the latest in a long series of global conferences to bring about the new international economic order. We have to ask ourselves whether the results of these conferences are in proportion to the number of meetings  the thousands of representatives  the documents and the many words. The answer is ""No"". The gap between rich and poor countries continues to increase.23.	We have witnessed a similar development in the field of disarmament  which has been on the international agenda for decades. Have these efforts made the world secure? The answer again is ""No"". The arms race has intensified.24.	Our experiences in trying to solve these vital problems through negotiations have so far not been encouraging. More often than not  impasse or deadlock has been the rule in the conference rooms. What is now at stake is the credibility of multilateral diplomacy in general and the United Nations institutions in particular. If the peoples of the world were to lose faith and confidence in the United Nations  the consequences for us all would indeed be serious. Faced with this basic challenge  our preoccupation with other divisive and conflictive aspects of international relations  however important they be  seems out of tune with the real needs of our time.25.	The lack of progress is rightly attributed to lack of political will. Our first task  therefore  must be to forge the necessary political will. Such political will must  however  be based upon a political vision which can move us beyond the realm of traditional nation to nation interests or disputes  because the major issues confronting us today go beyond the traditional relationships between individual countries. Nuclear war  hunger and poverty  energy and environment  development  population and resources are not only shared problems; the way in which they are solved or not solved will be decisive for all of us and for the future of mankind. This basic recognition should force us  the States Members of the United Nations  to approach these problems together  to meet these challenges as a community.26.	Adequate instruments and tools are also needed for handling these complex issues. This last point may seem to be of a technical nature  but it is nevertheless important. We need to re-examine our negotiating procedures and mechanisms.27.	Next  I should like to elaborate further on this point in the light of the experience we have gained during the many world conferences on development.28.	Those conferences have produced important declarations of principles and programmes of action. They have been useful and necessary  drawing the world's attention to the injustice and lack of rationality of the present economic system  the ever-increasing gap between the rich and the poor and also the growing interdependence among all our countries. But we must admit that  so far  practical results have been few and modest. Impatience and frustration are the most visible results. And  consequently  the role of such mammoth conferences has been questioned  and this point needs to be discussed.29.	The United Nations system is built upon the principle of universality. .This principle is a political reality and has to be observed. This political reality leaves us  however  with conferences of such magnitude that practical and procedural problems arise. One of the ways to meet this problem is for us as individual countries to accept some kind of representative system  not as a substitute for global conferences but as a supplement to facilitate the negotiating process.30.	Actually  what we have witnessed over the past few years within the United Nations system is the emergence of representative and broadly based groups. This is  in my view  a positive development that should be further encouraged and that has rationalized the process of consultation and made it more effective.31.	But this system also needs to be reformedâand that is my second point. By the time the various groups have reached internal agreement  positions are hardening and further bargaining becomes more difficult. Flexibility becomes the victim of internal consensus. Greater interplay between the various groups is therefore necessary before final positions are taken. This interplay is important also during the preparatory stage. The experience gained during the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea should not be lost on us. Substantive progress on main issues was made possible through extensive inter-sessional contacts between groups and delegations at a high level.32.	Thirdly  we should make better use of the means at our disposal. I am thinking  inter alia  of the input by the international secretariats. Given the necessary resources and a clearly defined mandate  they could  within their fields of competence  use their expertise even to the extent of providing us with policy options on which representatives of Governments could act. Increased use of independent expertise  including bodies of ""wise persons""  could provide new insight into complex problems and facilitate matters for the decision makers.33.	Fourthly  we should seek to avoid bringing alien problems of a political nature into negotiations on technical and clearly defined subjects. The increasing politicization of world conferences complicates negotiations on the subject matters. International conflicts should be treated by the United Nations bodies responsible for such issues under the Charter  namely  the Security Council and the General Assembly.34.	Furthermore  I think that we have gained sufficient experience over the last decades to conclude that agreements we want to see implemented must be based on consensus. But a true consensus requires a genuine spirit of give and take. Once again we can learn from the experience and methods of the Conference on the Law of the Sea  where a ""package approach"" was followed. Such an approach is particularly appropriate to such diverse and complex problems as those of development.35.	Finally  I should like to comment upon the idea of limited summit meetings  as proposed by the Brandt Commission.  In my opinion  this is a good idea  provided the timing and composition of such meetings are right. Informal meetings among representative world leaders  without public speeches or statements  might generate the necessary political will and provide the impetus needed to move negotiations in other forums towards agreement.36.	Also  we the Foreign Ministers might play a more active role in generating political will. I refer to the present practice whereby we attend the opening phase of conferences and make general statements  while we are usually absent at those crucial concluding stages when the question of success or failure is being decided.37.	Those are a few thoughts based on experience from the many conferences on development.38.	Lack of progress in the field of disarmament also calls for reflection. Time and again we have heard from this rostrum how intolerable it is that billions of dollars are being spent on arms in a world where hundreds of millions of people are living in poverty and misery. Warnings have been issued here and elsewhere that existing arsenals of modern weaponry can destroy all life on earth.39.	I am not going to add anything to those or any other doomsday predictions. But they express the fear in which our peoples are constantly living; they express the resignation people feel in the face of the continued arms race; and they express the fact that the nuclear arms race in all its dimensions constitutes the greatest dangerâand to all of us.40.	Negotiations on disarmament also face some additional complicating factors. Basic facts and figures are enveloped in secrecy. Suspicion and distrust prevail. Technological development outpaces negotiations by years. And  above all  this is a field of direct and vital importance to the superpowers. We  the smaller countries  cannot bring about disarmament against the will of the major Powers. But all nationsâsmall or bigâhave a stake in identifying and furthering the common interest in arms control and disarmament.41.	In the present international circumstances  my Government considers it more crucial than ever to renew our resolve and our efforts to carry forward the negotiations on disarmament and arms control measures.42.	In the relationship between the superpowers  the process of negotiations on the limitation of strategic arms is of central importance.43.	My Government urges rapid ratification of the SALT II Treaty   not because we consider it a perfect instrument but  rather  because it provides for a better regime than would prevail in its absence. It increases predictability and provides a foundation for real progress in the next phase involving substantial reductions in the level of nuclear arms.44.	Furthermore  I should like to point to the possibility of negotiations on continental nuclear missiles in Europe. We are encouraged by the signs that the two superpowers are moving towards the negotiating table. Another round of competitive deployment of nuclear arms on the continent of Europe must be prevented. We must reach agreement on such extensive reductions in deployed systems that plans for new deployment can be abandoned altogether. Should these negotiations succeed  we would have reached a turning point.45.	In the effort to attain a more secure world  the regional approach might also be a constructive one. Europe  for instance  is divided between East and West  and much of the world's armament is concentrated in this region. This autumn 35 countries are meeting at Madrid in a review session of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe  adopted at Helsinki. In the view of my Government  increased cooperation  openness and confidence building in Europe will add a measure of stability to the entire international community. All States will benefit from such stability. It is of particular importance to amplify and expand the system of confidence-building measures so as to shorten the shadows cast over the political landscape in Europe by military activity.46.	Furthermore  Norway supports the convening of a conference on disarmament in Europe to consider in its first phase more binding confidence-building measures applicable to the whole continent of Europe. We consider such efforts complementary to the Vienna Talks on Mutual Reduction of Forces and Associated Measures in Central Europe. The time is now long overdue to get those negotiations off the ground. It should be possible to conclude a first phase agreement at Vienna now  if there is the political will to remove the remaining obstacles. Progress in this area would create a good basis for the next special session of the General Assembly on disarmament in 1982  a session which should reinforce the United Nations as the focal point in the field of disarmament.47.	Norway has during the past two years been a member of the Security Council; hence I should like to make a few observations on the work of the Council.48.	The role of the Security Council as the central and highest international body to solve conflicts is a key element in the Treaty between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms  signed at Vienna on 18 June 1979. In the whole United Nations system  it is a source of strength for the United Nations that the Security Council can be brought into play whenever situations arise which threaten international peace and security.49.	In the maintenance of international peace and security  a division of functions has developed between the United Nations and regional organizations. We see merit in such a development  as some conflicts are best suited to mediation or other attempts at peaceful settlement on the regional level. Regional mechanisms  however  must not be used to block the right of a Member State  in accordance with the United Nations Charter  to bring a conflict before the Security Council.50.	With the growing frequency of meetings of the Security Council  we have seen an increase in the number of resolutions and also in the number of countries participating in the debates. To the extent that this trend reflects a general desire to use the Security Council for the solution of urgent problems  it is a positive development.51.	However  this development also carries with it certain problems. The Security Council  with a membership representing a delicate political and geographical balance  is the highest organ of the international community. A resolution adopted by the Council is much more than a mere expression of opinion: it is a formal decision which must be taken seriously by all the parties affected. If we adopt too many resolutions on more or less related subjects  we run the risk of undermining the authority of the Council and its decisions.52.	Similarly  it is by no means certain that the Council's ability to exercise its functions will be strengthened if the Council becomes a forum for broad general debates. This is a function which  in our opinion  is best taken care of by the General Assembly.53.	One result of this development is that the impact of the resolutions of the Security Council may be reduced and that those countries exposed to criticism can afford to ignore their content. Such a development is not in the best interest of the peacekeeping role of the United Nations.54.	In the last part of my intervention I shall state the position of my Government on some of the principal issues on our agenda.55.	Norway has acted on the assumption that the eleventh special session of the General Assembly should be a milestone in the North South negotiations. Unfortunately  it ended up in a deadlock on the procedure for the forthcoming round of global negotiations.56.	We still think that the proposed round of global negotiations would be the best procedure for tackling long-term structural problems. We therefore hope that at this session there will be agreement on the procedure and the agenda for the global round  making it possible to start negotiations as scheduled on 12 January next year.57.	In spite of its shortcomings  at the special session some notable results were achieved. At the session there was agreement on a text on a new International Development Strategy for the 1980s. Especially important is the target set for official development assistance (ODA). Norway  for its part  has already reached an assistance level of 1 per cent of its gross national product.58.	On the situation in Afghanistan  we will continue to be guided by the basic principles of the Charter. A political solution  including total withdrawal of foreign troops  is urgently required in order to secure the rights of the Afghan people to choose their own government and to decide their own future. This is also a prerequisite for solving the increasing refugee problem in neighbouring countries.59.	These principles must also be the basis for a political solution to the situation in Kampuchea. The efforts by the international community to bring relief to the refugees on the Thai border and to the population inside Kampuchea must not make us forget that only a political solution can bring peace and stability to the Khmer people.60.	Norway has from the outset given its support to the Camp David accords as an important first step towards a comprehensive peace settlement in the Middle East. But we clearly see that such a settlement presupposes a broader participation in the negotiations than is the case today. A major problem in that conflict-ridden area is the failure of the parties to recognize each other's existence and each other's right to exist. Genuine peace in the region will depend on the acceptance by all parties of Israel's right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries and the recognition of the national rights of the Palestinian people and its right to self-determination.61.	The Palestinians' right to self-determination can only be realized through the participation of their representatives in negotiations aiming at resolving the Palestinian problem in all its aspects  a prerequisite for a lasting solution to the Middle East conflict.62.	Constraints and mutual concessions are imperative in order to reach the overall objective of a just  lasting and comprehensive solution acceptable to all the parties involved.63.	Guided by these considerations  Norway will continue to give full support to all efforts seeking genuine peace in the Middle East.64.	I must express deep concern regarding UNIFIL and the situation in southern Lebanon. As a troop contributor to UNIFIL  my Government feels heavily the responsibilities we have assumed at the request of the United Nations. United Nations forces can only carry out their task with the cooperation of the contending parties. In Lebanon this is not the situation. It is now high time that all armed forces other than UNIFIL were withdrawn from the UNIFIL area of operations all the way down to the Israeli border. That would involve  specifically  abandonment of the so-called enclave by the de facto forces.65.	Norway is ready to support Zimbabwe in its pressing tasks of national reconstruction. The presence of the representatives of that country is a matter of pride and satisfaction to the world Organization. The international solidarity extended to the people of Zimbabwe during the war years must now be transformed into concrete expressions of support to secure the peace.66.	As we did in Zimbabwe  Norway also supports the effort to find a peaceful and negotiated settlement in Namibia. Once again  I wish to express the full support of my Government to the secretary General for his objective and impartial efforts in pursuance of a peaceful settlement under United Nations supervision and control. South Africa must now allow the secretary General to set the United Nations plan for Namibia in motion.67.	The Norwegian Government views South Africa's apartheid policy as the key problem facing the region. We agree with those who say that this policy cannot be reformed. It must be abolished. Increased international pressure must be brought to bear on South Africa to abolish apartheid. Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners must be released. Arrests of trade union organizers must cease. Attempts to silence South Africa's church leaders must be brought to an end.68.	Norway is ready to consider new measures in a policy of disengagement from South Africa. We are already working together with the other Nordic countries in this respect. We stand ready to broaden this cooperation to include others. Norway will also continue and expand its support to the countries of the area in their endeavours to reduce their economic dependence on South Africa.69.	Once more I have to express the deep concern of my Government at the fact that the hostages are still being held in Iran  and again we appeal to the authorities of Iran to free the hostages. Our relations with Iran and the normal development of contacts and cooperation will continue to suffer as long as the basic concepts of international law among States are set aside.70.	The plight of the increasing number of refugees and displaced persons continues to place a heavy responsibility on all of us. We have noted with satisfaction that the secretary General now intends to follow up the proposal of the Nordic countries to study the question of better organization and coordination of humanitarian assistance in emergencies. We appreciate the outstanding efforts of the United Nations and of voluntary organizations to provide relief and rehabilitation to these unfortunate people. We also highly value the understanding and assistance given by countries of first asylum by providing temporary shelter for the refugees  pending their repatriation or settlement in countries of final destination.71.	Norway supports all efforts to strengthen the international protection of human rights. My Government feels that the establishment of a United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights would be an important step forward. We attach great importance to the need for finalization of the work on the draft convention against torture  the work on a convention on the rights of migrant workers  the international efforts to abolish capital punishment and the ongoing United Nations study on the situation and rights of indigenous peoples.72.	The outcome of the World Conference of the United Nations Decade for Women: Equality  Development and Peace  held at Copenhagen from 14 to 30 July 1980  fell short of our expectations. It is therefore important that this General Assembly confirm its commitment to further the cause of women's legitimate demands for equal status and equal opportunity. Norway considers it vital not to lose momentum and to ensure the following up and carrying forward of those elements from the Copenhagen Conference on which we are all agreed. We attach great importance to the work being done by the Commission on the Status of Women and to the activities of UNITAR for improving the position of women. The idea of having a special coordinator for women's questions in the field of United Nations operations should be further discussed. We hope that the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women will enter into force at the earliest possible date.73.	Finally  the Secretary General  in his report on the work of the Organization  underlines the absolute need to preserve a code of international behaviour between nations. This concern has also prompted the Nordic countries to suggest that a new item be included in the agenda of this General Assembly on effective measures to enhance the protection  security and safety of diplomatic and consular missions and representatives. I fully share the hope expressed by the secretary General that the Assembly will take advantage of this proposal to enhance the respect for the international laws and norms which international society has so painstakingly built up over the years."
"103",5272,"NPL",35,1980,"ï»¿It is my privilege to convey to the President  Mr. von Wechmar  and through him to the representatives  the greetings of my august sovereign  His Majesty King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev  and his best wishes for the success of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. I should like to extend to him my warm felicitations and those of the delegation of Nepal on his election as President of the current session of the General Assembly. We are confident that with his skill  wisdom and experience  he will guide the work of this session to a fruitful and successful conclusion. I wish to assure him of the full cooperation of my delegation in his efforts to that end.246.	I wish also to take this opportunity to express our appreciation to Ambassador Salim of the United Republic of Tanzania for the firmness and impartiality with which he conducted the business of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly.247.	Our principal compliments are due to the Secretary General for his devotion to the ideals of the United Nations and the exemplary manner in which he has been discharging the heavy responsibilities pertaining to his high office.248.	We welcome Saint Vincent and the Grenadines as the newest Member of the United Nations. Its admission is a further step towards the universality of membership of this world Organization.249.	The decade of the 1980s has opened on a note of uncertainty  tension and conflicts on all fronts in international affairs. The most important contributing factor to this sad state of affairs has been the recent armed interventions. The process of detente has been seriously jeopardized  and there are increased military build-ups and renewed escalation of an already vicious arms race. Sharp divisions among the big Powers  armed conflicts in several areas and frustrations in our common search for a new international economic order continue to characterize current international relations.250.	Southern Africa continues to be one of the focal points of conflict in the relations between nations. In spite of the well-deserved achievement of independence by the people of Zimbabwe  the authorities of South Africa have refused to see the writing on the wall and to recognize the legitimate rights of the oppressed people  led by their national liberation movements  to human dignity  equality  self-determination and majority rule. My delegation remains steadfast in its support for the struggle against apartheid in South Africa. We deplore the refusal of the South African authorities to cooperate with the United Nations in implementing the plan for free and fair elections in Namibia. We fully support the struggle of the people of Namibia for national liberation  under the leadership of SWAPO.251.	The situation in the Middle East not only continues to be tense but has  in fact  deteriorated in the past several months. In keeping with our well-known position on this question  we support the right of every State in the area  including Israel  to live in peace and security within well-defined boundaries. However  a just and lasting settlement cannot be achieved unless the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people  their right to participate as equals in any peace negotiation and their right to a separate State of their own are recognized. The first prerequisite of a settlement is  of course  the unconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces from the territories occupied since 1967. Nepal regrets the continuing and escalating policy of Israel to change the political  legal and demographic character of the occupied territories. Such actions militate against the norms of international law and the repeated calls of the United Nations. They not only have complicated the already difficult situation but have also had a negative impact on prospects for a peaceful solution of the Middle East problem.252.	The frequent armed attempts by Israel to undermine the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Lebanon continue to cause grave anxiety to all. As a contributor to UNIFIL  we once again urge Member States to cooperate with UNIFIL in restoring full Lebanese authority in the troubled areas. My delegation joins the Secretary General in his appeal to those Governments which have not paid their assessed contributions to the UNIFIL account to reconsider their position. There should be no question that the financing of a duly authorized United Nations peacekeeping operation is the collective responsibility of all States Members of the United Nations.253.	We have noted with concern the sudden painful deterioration of the relations between two neighbouring countries  Iran and Iraq. We sincerely appeal to both of them to exercise maximum restraint and seek a peaceful solution of their problem. Escalation of violence between the two countries is bound to have a wider detrimental impact in the region.254.	On the question of Cyprus  a country torn apart as a result of extraterritorial interests of outside Powers  my delegation continues to favour the resumption of intercommunal negotiation under the auspices of the Secretary General. We would support any political settlement based on strict respect for the independence  territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Republic of Cyprus.255.	With regard to the Korean question  my delegation continues to hold the view that the aspirations of the people of Korea to national reunification should be fulfilled peacefully by their own efforts  without any outside interference.256.	The arms race has escalated with renewed vigour  and this has been a matter of universal concern. The twentieth century has already witnessed two world wars and several other wars in between and after. The most intensive search for peace took place during this period  and the United Nations is the culmination of those efforts.257.	The advances in science and technology have resulted in the unprecedented accumulation of most lethal and destructive arms in national arsenals. It is ironical that the period that gave birth to the notion of general and complete disarmament also has been a period of the most vicious armament race in history. We have forgotten the twin lessons of history: one  that no nation ever enjoyed security in armament and  two  that arms accumulated have always been used at one point in time or another. The big Powers must take a major share of the blame for the arms race in the world. They cannot escape responsibility for the lack of progress in the deliberating and negotiating forums of the United Nations. This stalemate has belied the hopes raised at the tenth special session of the Assembly  devoted to disarmament. The big Powers have also failed to honour the solemn commitments contained in the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere  in Outer Space and Under Water and the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons towards a comprehensive test ban and a meaningful reduction of armaments. The freezing of the ongoing negotiations on strategic arms limitation not only is a clear indication of the failure of these Powers to live up to their undertakings but also has cast a dark shadow on the prospects for international peace and security. The amount of resources spent on the development and production of arms staggers our imagination. A fraction of those resources if utilized for peaceful and developmental purposes would go a long way in improving the world economic situation.258.	Nepal is a party to both the partial test ban Treaty and the Non-proliferation Treaty. It has always supported the establishment of nuclear weapon free zones and zones of peace in many parts of the world. We are of the view  however  that the non-proliferation regime cannot long be sustained if it attempts to impose a discriminatory condition between nations in regard to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and if  at the same time  the big Powers fail to fulfil their corresponding obligations under that Treaty. The relentless vertical proliferation of nuclear weapons is bound to have a disastrous effect on horizontal proliferation. It will be a sad development indeed if  as a result of default by the big Powers  more and more threshold countries are encouraged to opt for nuclear weaponry.259.	The world continues to be faced with an equally grim scenario on the front of economic growth and stability. The economic condition of more than half of mankind has remained static; in fact it has considerably worsened. At the eleventh special session  there was general agreement on the grim reality of the international economic situation. However  negotiations on the new global round as well as on the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade once again brought home the fact that the long-term global outlook continues to be the victim of short-term domestic policies being pursued in developed countries. The nature and persistence of the present economic reality have reached a stage where the stagnation in the economic sector will entail wider and serious political repercussions. The Secretary General has rightly observed in his report on the work of the Organization: ""Peace is as much at stake in the discussions on economic questions as prosperity and a decent standard of living for all humanity"" 260.	We deeply regret the failure to reach a consensus on procedure and a timeframe for the global round of negotiations. We earnestly hope that the developed countries will have the required political will to face the reality boldly and squarely and that the impasse faced at the eleventh special session will be overcome during this session  so that the global round of negotiations can be launched at the beginning of next year. We are confident that such negotiations will be instrumental in restructuring international economic relations.261.	The Second United Nations Development Decade failed to bridge the ever widening gap between the developed and the developing countries. Against this backdrop  the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade has been drawn up. The present text is considerably weaker than we had hoped for. Yet we welcome the consensus on goals and objectives and on policy measures contained in this text as a framework for future negotiations. We view the section on the least developed countries in the Strategy as one of the positive features. The new Strategy calls for concerted and concrete action at the domestic and at the international level. Unless the developed countries boldly live up to the commitment they have made  the objectives enshrined in the new Strategy will remain unfulfilled.262.	The oil economy is now increasingly affecting the life of the peoples in developing and developed countries alike. We reaffirm the need for paying special attention to the growing requirements of the energy importing developing countries. In this context  we earnestly hope that the oil exporting countries will cooperate  substantially and in concrete terms  with the other developing countries  in particular the least developed among them. My delegation has always attached considerable significance to economic and technical cooperation among developing countries. In our considered view  the enormous potential latent in the developing world could be utilized for mutual benefit.263.	High rates of inflation  the adverse effect of fluctuation in the prices of primary commodities on the export earning of developing countries and the instability of the international monetary system have badly shaken the already precarious economic situation of most developing countries. These have been reinforced by growing unemployment and a food deficit caused by  among other things  natural calamities. While there is no immediate hope of respite from these problems  which are themselves of colossal magnitude  the prices of vital imports like oil and construction and development materials continue to rise sharply. The net flow of resources to the developing countries has further declined as a consequence of the failure of the major developed countries to fulfil their commitments to official development assistance in terms of 0.7 percent of the gross national product.264.	The difficult situation facing the developing countries in general has further aggravated the problem of the least developed and landlocked countries. Most of the developing landlocked countries are also among the least developed  and their problems are of a basic structural nature. Therefore they should be given special attention  as a matter of priority  in any international assistance programme. Urgent additional measures should be undertaken to overcome the structural constraints impeding their growth. We appeal for the urgent implementation of the Immediate Action Programme for the Least Developed Countries adopted at the fifth session of UNCTAD.  In resolution S11/4  adopted unanimously at the eleventh special session  the General Assembly has also called for that step. The resources of the United Nations Special Fund for Landlocked Developing Countries continue to be woefully meagre and utterly inadequate to meet the requirements of the developing landlocked countries. We appeal for more generous contributions to that Fund. We are hopeful that the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries  to be convened next year  will agree on positive and substantial measures to help those countries.265.	At its recently concluded ninth session the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea has made some progress  although we feel that the negotiations have been painfully slow-moving. Agreement has been possible on several key elements of a new regime on the sea. Nepal continues to believe that the new regime will be meaningful only if it is universally recognized that the entire resources of the seas belong to humanity as a whole and constitute a common heritage of mankind. That is the principal idea behind our proposal for the establishment of a common heritage fund. Recognition of the right of free access to and from the sea for landlocked countries will have to form an essential part of the new regime.266.	I should like to refer now to the events in the regions adjoining my own. I allude to the events of far-reaching consequence in Kampuchea and Afghanistan  events which I consider to be the most serious developments in the contemporary world. Those developments at present constitute a serious threat to the peace and security of the world  not to mention the peace and security of the neighbouring areas.267.	As we all know  this grave situation has arisen as a result of armed intervention in those two nonaligned countries. Non-interference in the internal affairs of another country is the most fundamental principle in relations between States. Observance of this principle alone implies respect for the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of another State and the right of its people to self-determination. Once that principle is violated  the basic norm of behaviour among States is broken  the sovereignty of another State and the inalienable right of its people are contemptuously disregarded; the trust which is reposed in a State as a responsible member of the international community is also lost. Therefore Nepal has always held that of all the principles which govern interstate relationships and which are enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations  the principle of non-interference in the domestic matters of another State is the one which must not be violated in any situation or under any pretext.268.	The nature of a particular Government or its actions and policies  the conditions prevailing in another country  the suspected designs of foreign Powers in that countryâ none of those factors gives any State the right to interfere in the affairs of another. I must submit that even the plea of self-defence and security does not justify armed intervention  much less continued occupation by armed forces of other States. There are ways provided in the Charter and under international law for States to seek redress of grievances.269.	The United Nations would be failing in its duty if it did not continue to press for political settlements in both Kampuchea and Afghanistan on the basis of resolutions adopted by the Organization. There should be no giving in to the concept of fait accompli. In such situations nothing will be accomplished if it is not acceptable to the people of the countries concerned. The first prerequisite in any political settlements in Kampuchea and Afghanistan is  I need not stress  the total  immediate and unconditional withdrawal of foreign forces. That should be the only basis for any solution.270.	As a nonaligned country  Nepal has full faith in the purposes and principles of the Charter and the moral efficacy of the world Organization. For us  the principles and purposes of the Charter are represented in the principle of non-interference and the ideals of peaceful coexistence among countries with various political  economic and social systems  peaceful resolution of conflicts between nations and meaningful cooperation among States. These principles and ideals are  for us  both moral and practical.271.	By the scrupulous application of those ideals we have endeavoured to establish friendly and cooperative relations with our neighbours and friends. This is our contribution to the climate of peace and good will in the region and the world at large. It is in this context that we have welcomed the idea of the President of Bangladesh for regional cooperation. The region is rich in vast manpower and inexhaustible natural resources. Nepal is prepared to join in any prudent and wise exploitation and development of these resources in the firm belief that it will serve the interests not only of Nepal but also of the whole region.272.	Good neighbourliness in the region and good relations among the countries of the region should be reflected in concrete cooperation and full understanding of each other's views  problems and aspirations. That was the reason for the recent visit of His Majesty King Birendra to the neighbouring countries and other countries of the region. His Majesty's visit has been followed by other visits which we have undertaken at the official level.273.	We have pursued a policy of always seeking and respecting the views of other countries so that a coordinated approach is developed in regard to bilateral  regional and global issues. This is our way of promoting better understanding  mutual cooperation and collective self-reliance  the traditional ideals motivating the policies of all our neighbours and friends.274.	The ultimate expression of Nepal's domestic and foreign policy objective is reflected in our proposal that Nepal be declared a zone of peace. This proposal is consistent with Nepal's traditional quest for peace and development and consistent also with the principles of the United Nations and the ideals of nonalignment. This is our way of consolidating relations and promoting cooperation with all our neighbours and friends."
"104",5336,"NZL",35,1980,"ï»¿Sir  may I congratulate you on your election to the presidency. I know that  like your predecessor  Ambassador Salim of the United Republic of Tanzania  you will carry out your responsibilities with firmness  courtesy and skill.74.	As a Commonwealth member  New Zealand welcomes to the Assembly the delegations of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Zimbabwe. They bring  from different parts of the world  special perspectives which will help us all in considering the serious problems which face us.75.	In welcoming these two new Members  we should not forget that other peoples are also moving rapidly towards independence. In our part of the world Vanuatu  in the most difficult circumstances  came to full nationhood. As a neighbour we were delighted to welcome the new Republic into the fellowship of the South Pacific Forum. We have watched with great sympathy the moves to greater autonomy by the island groups that make up the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. New Zealand's immediate partners  the people of Tokelau  are assuming increasing responsibility for the government of their tiny country.76.	The South Pacific is coming to the end of a long period of constitutional change. Twenty years ago  when the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples was adopted   New Zealand and Australia were the only independent countries in our region. Now there are some 13 independent or fully self-governing States. Some are represented here. In the course of time more will come  and the voice of the Pacific will be heard more insistently.77.	As the United Nations has grown  its ways of doing business  as well as the scope of its activities  have changed. To some it seems a less effective  less purposeful Organization than it was. I know that this body is itself a reflection of the world around usâand that has been troubled enough. And yet it is difficult not to be pessimistic when we assess what has been achieved over the past year.78.	Only last month the General Assembly met in special session to discuss development and economic issues. The session was convened against a background of mounting concern about the world economy. Every speaker at that session talked of the gravity of the present situation. Every speaker called for rapid change. Every speaker supported the launching of a new round of global economic negotiations.79.	This was not mere rhetoric. During the past month I have spoken to many political leaders  especially from Asian and Pacific countries. It was crystal clear that all of us shared an overriding preoccupation with economic issues. Time and again I heard the same themes: terms of trade have deteriorated rapidly; inflation  most of it imported  is far too high; deficits are expanding at an unprecedented rate. The conventional answerâretrenchmentâexacts a high economic price in terms of contraction of trade and stagnation of production. The political cost  not least in jobs lost and social disruption  is prohibitive. To cover their share of the total oil deficit  countries in our area have had to borrow heavily. For many of them  debt servicing burdens are already crippling. High interest rates and a good deal of nervousness on the part of the private banking system compound the problems of financing economic development in the face of the growing deficit problem.80.	It is not surprising that Governments of developing countriesâand quite a few in the more affluent worldâare apprehensive  for tensions produced by economic forces induce political reactions.81.	Yet at the recent eleventh special session the Assembly failed even to agree on procedures for carrying out the global negotiations  let alone to discuss an agenda. I can well understand the scepticism of those who ask whether the Assembly  or a derivative of it  is the best place in which to discuss complex international economic issues. I tend to agree with them. However  the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea has shown that it is possible to resolve a wide and complicated range of such issues in a forum in which all Member States are represented. If we can draw some encouragement from that example  we should not forget how long the process has taken and how much had to be done outside the main meetings to develop a consensus about legitimate objectives and priorities. Above all  we should remember that the Conference on the Law of the Sea is succeeding because it organized its negotiations on the basis of actual situations and shared interestsânot on the basis of political alignments and regional groupings. I must emphasize that we do not have a decade to make progress on the world's urgent economic problems. We now have less than one year.82.	If we are to make similar progress on global economic issues  we must tackle them with new urgency. We shall have to accept that there is not going to be a revolutionary change of attitude on the part of the wealthy industrialized countriesâwhether of West or East. Progress will come gradually and probably most effectively by using the specialist bodies. A central forum may wellâand shouldâgive drive and coherence to those negotiations. However  let us not expect too much from it. It simply is not realistic to believe that some supranational forum can direct and determine the course of negotiations in bodies like IMF  GATT and FAO. It is for these specialized bodies to take the immediate steps that are so essential. Here again  progress has been much too slow.83.	We could speed up the global negotiations more effectively if we were first to call together a more limited but broadly representative informal summit  as proposed by the Brandt Commission.  It may be that the outlines of a broad consensus on the way forward are more likely to emerge from such a meeting than from a gathering of 150 or more. That was the view of the regional Meeting of Heads of Government of Commonwealth Countries  which I attended last month  at New Delhi. The Meeting of Finance Ministers of Commonwealth Countries in Bermuda was even more convinced of the need for action.84.	What we discuss is at least as important as where we discuss it. It has concerned me that recent discussions in New York have become bogged down in proposals for an agenda which is all-encompassing and unselective. The consensus of the heads of Government and Finance Ministers I have listened to in the past month is that the international oil situation and its flow-on problems  especially in financing  is the major issue to be faced if the longer-term difficulties in the world economy and in the North-South dialogue are to be dealt with adequately.85.	I do not want to be misunderstood by oil producers when I say that the central issue is to solve the problem of international balances of payments  particularly of developing countries. That means we must find an effective means of recycling the surpluses of the oil producers. I do not deny that oil was under-priced in the past. Nor am I suggesting that the large increase in oil prices since 1973 is the sole cause of the world's present economic woes. I am simply saying that this is a major and immediate problem which requires international actionânow.86.	Look at these facts. The forecast is that the combined deficit of developing countries over the next three years will be about $US 160 billion. There are only two possible ways of covering those deficits: one is through grant aid; the second is through borrowing  whether at commercial or concessional rates. Grant aid is not going to cover deficits of that size  even in the unlikely event that official development assistance performance improves dramatically. Whether the private banking system can cope is equally open to question. The previous round of recycling subjected it to considerable stress. In my view  greater involvement by international financial institutions and greater flexibility in their approach are now a necessity if global payments imbalances are not to widen  with grave economic consequences for us all.87.	Institutions  no less than Governments  have to adapt to new circumstances. If they show no capacity to adjust  the pressures to set up new bodies to replace them will become irresistible. That is why at recent meetings New Zealand supported calls for IMF to play a much more positive and dynamic role in the recycling process in support of the private banking system. I am convinced that IMF has the skills and expertise which will enable it to respond to the needs of the world today.88.	I believe that the decisions taken at the annual World Bank and IMF meetings last week in Washington bring those institutions closer to grappling with the recycling problem. New Zealand has continued to advocate the concept of symmetrical surveillance  so that the capacity of surplus countries and the needs of deficit countries can be matched. The adjustment burden is a problem for the international community operating through its public as well as its private institutions. The surplus nations must realize the serious difficulties which confront the oil-importing nations of the developing world. They mustâand  I believe  will- acknowledge that their economic power can be used through increased commitments and guarantees for IMF in order to avert a series of national bankruptcies.89.	The international community has the power and ingenuity to act quickly on critical economic issues. It must do so. If we are to bring new urgency and purpose to the economic negotiations of the Organization  then we have to ask ourselves whether a more functional negotiating format is called for. Does the group approach to negotiations still serve us well? On the evidence of those major United Nations economic conferences held during the past two years  I would have to say that I doubt it. The Brandt Commission reached a similar conclusion. Its report says:""The process of reconciling differences within each group has often led to extreme positions driving out moderate ones: maximum demands elicit minimum offers."" 90.	But that is only one of the weaknesses of our present system. Another is that the specific interests of individual countries  or groups of countries  are often subordinated to the cause of group solidarity.91.	The small island communities in the South Pacific are a case in point. Their economies are small and their resources limited. Dependent on a narrow range of exploitable commodities  highly sensitive to price fluctuations  handicapped by high transport costs and uncertain services to their main export markets  they are especially vulnerable to external influences which they cannot control. The fragility of their economies is increased by their isolation from each other and from neighbouring regions. No other factor so persistently hampers Pacific countries in the struggle to develop their resources and provide better lives for their people.92.	Clearly  the island States of the Pacific have special needs  and the international community must be responsive to those needs. It is not just that they require development assistance  though that is essential. It is also a question of providing the mechanism by which small countries can express their concerns and get them dealt with effectively.93.	It is not enough in the long run to label developing island countries as a separate category meriting special treatment. I believe that what those countries want  and what other countries in the so-called special categories want  too  is to take their place in the mainstream of international life. They do not want to be set apart for ever as societies which do not fit into some preconceived pattern. Regrettably  the international community seems to have settled for this option in drawing up an international development strategy for the 1980s.94.	We in New Zealand have also suffered from the rigidities imposed by bloc diplomacy. Our specific economic circumstances and interests are obscured when the membership of the Organization is divided by shorthand expressions like ""North"" and ""South""  or labelled by groups.95.	For years the world community has ignored the questions of food production and market access which are central to New Zealand's economic well-being. The group system of negotiation has effectively blocked our efforts to have these issues given greater priority. Now  it seems  they are beginning to receive due attention. There is a new awareness that it is all too easy to undermine the confidence of rural communities. No one knows this better than the developing countries which  during the past decade  have changed from being exporters to importers of food. More and more countries are coming to see that the double standards governing the international food trade have got to go. Unless that happens it will be an uphill battle to restore and sustain the confidence of farmers  and they are the people we look to if we are to feed the hungry of this world.96.	In the struggle to overcome agricultural protectionism in the industrialized world  New Zealand's interests are essentially the same as those of the developing countries. With them  and with many others  we also have an interest in bringing about a more liberal trading system in all sectors. In the global negotiations  in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development  in UNCTAD  in GATT we shall work to that end with all who want a fairer trading system. If we achieve that  we may then see that expansion of world economic growth rates which is an essential ingredient of political stability and security.97.	In your opening address  Mr. President  you reminded us that the vision of the men who established the Organization was one of a world at peace. You rightly said that that could be achieved only if the United Nations was determined to apply those principles for which it stands: to promote the self-determination of all peoples; to protect the sovereign equality of nations  especially the weak and the small; to promote human rights and freedom 98.	It is chastening to think how far we have to go before we can say we have reached those goals which  by our membership  we have all set ourselves. That is all too clear from the political as well as the economic tensions that rock the world today. The principles that the Organization was established to defend have been persistently defied.99.	Afghanistan is one crisis area that calls out for a speedy and just solution. Earlier this year New Zealand joined more than 100 Member States in supporting resolution ES-6/2 in which the Assembly deplored the armed intervention in that country. Immediate  unconditional and total withdrawal of all foreign troops was called for. That resolution was ignored. Soviet troops remain in Afghanistan. They are there because the regime they installed cannot survive without them. The people of Afghanistan have  by their resistance  shown their rejection of that regime and the alien forces which continue to prop it up.100.	The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan violated the basic principles of the Charter. It threatened the security of neighbouring States. It increased tension in West Asia and the Indian Ocean region  and it has thrown into disarray the process  of detente to which the Soviet Union has so often pledged its commitment.101.	There is only one sure way to reverse that dangerous situation and that is for the Soviet Union to display that respect for the principles of international behaviour which it champions so earnestly when the actions of others are concerned. It must withdraw its troops. It must allow the Afghan people to decide their own future freely and without interference.102.	That assault on the sovereignty of a small neighbouring State has its parallel in South-East Asia. There a client Government has been imposed on the people of Kampuchea and maintained by force of arms. The situation in Kampuchea has implications for peace  stability and progress in the whole of South-East Asia.103.	At the thirty-fourth session  the Assembly called for the immediate withdrawal of all foreign forces from Kampuchea. That call was disregarded. Those forces are still there and they are involved in fighting along the Thai-Kampuchean border and elsewhere. It is a matter of grave concern to New Zealand that there has been so little improvement in the situation since the Assembly last met in regular session. The longer the fighting goes on  the greater is the risk that the conflict could spread. Until there is a political settlement  there can be no regional stability and no sure end to the hardships of those ordinary people for too long caught up in a conflict in which they want no part.104.	Relief efforts will be needed for a long time to come. It is essential that the relief operation should be able  without hindrance  to distribute supplies to those in greatest need  wherever they are. It is no less important that Kampuchea's agricultural production should be restored. Its economy must be revitalized so that the victims of the conflict can return to their homes and to a normal way of life.105.	I know that the countries of South-East Asia want peace and stability. They want to pursue their economic development free from threats to their security. The Association of South-East Asian Nations [ASEAN] countries  with broad support from the international community  have consistently sought a durable political settlement. The resolution adopted last year set out the principles that must form the basis for a settlement.106.	The Assembly needs to give stronger support to the search for a settlement. New Zealand welcomed the visit of the Secretary-General to Bangkok and Hanoi. Clearly  he can play a major role. We  like others  look to him to help get productive talks under way between Viet Nam and its ASEAN neighbours and to facilitate the holding of an international conference which is needed to reduce tension and achieve a just and lasting settlement.107.	Another area in Asia which is subject to severe strains is the Korean peninsula. New Zealand will continue to support measures aimed at reducing tension in that area. We have been encouraged by the recent series of preliminary meetings between representatives from North and South Korea which have had as their objective the development of north-south contacts. We urge both sides to maintain the momentum of those meetings and to continue in good faith the search for a peaceful and lasting accommodation.108.	The conflict between Iraq and Iran is also a matter of great concern to us. It has caused loss of life and damage in both countries and could  if fighting continues  have serious consequences within the region and beyond. We are anxious that the fighting should be halted so that the differences between the two countries can be resolved peaceably and soon. We support the appeal made by the Security Council to that end in its resolution 479 (1980) and welcome the efforts being made by others to bring about a peaceful settlement.109.	It is no less urgent that a settlement should be negotiated in the Middle East. That dispute is a continuing threat to world peace and security. The peace treaty between Egypt and Israel  was a conspicuous step forward  but it was only a beginning. The hopes that it would lead to a comprehensive and durable peace based on the principles embodied in Security Council resolution 242 (1967) have not been realized. They will not be until Israel acknowledges the rights and aspirations of the Palestinian people. Those include the right to self-determination and the right to establish a separate State  if that is their wish. Equally  the unilateral declaration on Jerusalem and the continued establishment of settlements in occupied territories can hardly be construed as anything but obstructions to a negotiated settlement.110.	The continuing detention of people from the American Embassy in Teheran is another grave cause of tension. New Zealand's position is clear. We deplore Iran's refusal to release the hostages. A speedy and honourable solution must be foundâfirst for the sake of the people concerned  but also if we are to respect the principles of international law. We are certainly willing to join others in efforts to get a peaceful solution.111.	A year ago New Zealand welcomed two major advances in the search for a peaceful settlement of the conflicts in southern Africa: the London conference on Zimbabwe and the resumption of negotiations on Namibia.112.	Zimbabwe's presence here today is testimony to the determination of its people and of all those who have worked so hard for a just and equitable settlement. It is a particular pleasure to me that the Commonwealth was able to play a formative part in the peaceful transfer of power in that country.113.	A similar transfer of power must also be the objective in Namibia. There is no good reason why the few issues that remain outstanding should not be settled quickly. It has long been time for the South African authorities to end their illegal occupation of Namibia. They must  if they want a peaceful settlement  co-operate with the Security Council in bringing independence to the people of Namibia. Just as in 1980 we welcomed the independence of Zimbabwe so in 1981	we should welcome that of Namibia.114.	If there is to be lasting stability  however  the South African Government must move ahead with the dismantling of the apartheid system in South Africa itself. If there are signs that the present rulers of South Africa are beginning to understand the need for change  there is less evidence of serious commitment to this course. They must now demonstrate clearly and unequivocally by their actions and policies that institutionalized racism and the injustices and suffering that apartheid has inflicted on generations of Africans are being brought to an end. There is no other way to a peaceful future. The alternative  a vicious and bloody conflict  must be avoided. It can be  but only if the South African Government will promptly set about overturning the detestable system of apartheid.115.	Increased tension in many parts of the world and  above all  the invasion of Afghanistan have had grave consequences for relations between the great Powers. Detente is in jeopardy.116.	Nowhere has that been more clear than in negotiations on arms control and disarmament. Here the central need is for confidence that obligations assumed will be fully met  so it is no surprise that there has been no real forward movement. The SALT II Treaty remains un-ratified. The Vienna Talks on Mutual Reduction of Forces  Armaments and Associated Measures in Central Europe are stalemated. The sessions of the Committee on Disarmament have  by and large  been unproductive. The second Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ended without agreement on a final declaration. Many countries  my own among them  rightly criticized the two super-Powers for lack of progress in their negotiations on arms control and disarmament.117.	There is nothing in the relationship of those superpowers to suggest that we can expect quick progress on those arms control and disarmament issues which are essentially bilateral in nature. But that should not mean that movement must be held back in other areas. A fresh impetus is needed to get negotiations under way again.118.	One such issue is a comprehensive test-ban treaty. No disarmament measure is more urgent. No one disputes the need for a treaty. The report presented to the Committee on Disarmament at the end of the latest round of bilateral talks showed that the negotiating States had made limited progress on many elements of critical importance. In our view  it is essential that a draft comprehensive test-ban treaty should be ready for consideration at the second special session on disarmament  in 1982. We believe  too  that a working group of the Committee on Disarmament should be established next year to begin negotiations on a treaty. One of its first tasks should be to devise a framework within which an international seismic detection system could operate to monitor adherence to the treaty.119.	Many of these issues will continue to haunt the inter-national community throughout the i980s. There are others. What progress will we make in dealing humanely with the mass movement of displaced persons across borders? Will we be able to say  when it ends  that the Decade for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination has achieved its goals? The United Nations Decade for Women is already at mid-course. Will we be able to say in five yearsâ time that the lot of half the world's population has been greatly improved  when we know from the evidence given to the World Conference at Copenhagen in July  that the impact of the first five years has been so limited?120.	The same questionâwhether achievement will match objectivesâcan be asked of many items on the Assembly's agenda. The answers  I believe  depend in large degree on whether we are willing to use the Organization sensibly  to seek genuine agreement to negotiate rather than declaim. Above all  it depends on whether we are able to break away from old rigidities and preconceptions and seek new ways of working together  ways which are imaginative and realist? That is the way for the world body  and for all of us  to face the challenges of this decade."
"105",5381,"OMN",35,1980,"ï»¿Mr. President  I should like to join other speakers in congratulating you on your election to the presidency of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. I am convinced that with your wisdom and experience you will successfully carry out the tasks which fall to you and lead the deliberations of this session to a favourable conclusion.48.	I also wish to express my admiration for the manner in which your predecessor  Mr. Salim  conducted the proceedings of the thirty fourth session and of the special and emergency sessions which have taken place during the past year.49.	May I also welcome Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to membership in the United Nations.50.	I should like to extend the thanks of the Government of the Sultanate of Oman to the Secretary-General for the very effective and sincere efforts he has made in the past year in accordance with the mandate conferred upon him and to wish him every success in his work in the service of the United Nations.51.	This year the General Assembly is meeting in particularly tense and unstable international circumstances  and that makes this a very important session  a session which has an even greater obligation to solve the problems of the world and lessen the dangers facing it  as well as the obligation to help this Organization to discharge its function of seeking solutions conducive to the safeguarding of peace with justice and establishing the basis for economic and social development.52.	The question of the Middle East is one of the most important conflicts confronting us because it is a danger and threat to international peace and security. It is also a problem that urgently requires a just  global and lasting solution  as has been demonstrated by the concern shown by the international community  and its growing support for the Arab position.53.	The position of the Sultanate of Oman on any peaceful attempt to produce a global  just and lasting settlement to this question is based on the principles which have been recognized by the international community. They are Israel's withdrawal from all the Arab territories occupied since 1967  the right of the Palestinian people to self- determination  and the return of Arab Jerusalem to Arab sovereignty.54.	The international community has recognized the fact that the achievement of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East will be possible only if those principles are respected and that  in turn  requires that Israel discharge its obligation to respect international legality and the Charter of the United Nations  and cease to display contempt for the resolutions of the Organization.55.	Recently the Knesset decided to annex Jerusalem and consider it as Israel's capital. That is just one more example of Israel's scorn and constitutes a flagrant provocation of the United Nations. It is also a challenge to Arab and Moslem feelings. This decision has in fact had the effect of increasing tension in the Middle East and has made it even more difficult to bring about peace. Israel is well aware of the fact that there can be no lasting peace without the restoration of the Holy City of Jerusalem to Arab sovereignty. I should like to remind the Assembly that my country supports the Islamic position on Jerusalem.56.	Recently we witnessed a dangerous phenomenon in the international arena: the intervention of a major Power in the internal affairs of a small country  to the point of using armed force  invading small countries and overthrowing their lawful regimes. One of the most glaring examples of this can be seen in what happened in Afghanistan towards the end of last year.57.	Following Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan  Oman joined 51 other States in calling for an emergency meeting of the Security Council to deal with that intervention. As we all know  the veto used by the Soviet Union prevented the adoption of the draft resolution submitted by the non-aligned countries to the Security Council  and made it impossible for the Security Council to discharge its primary responsibility of safeguarding international peace and security; that  in turn  led to the sixth emergency special session in January this year. At that session a resolution was adopted by an overwhelming majority calling for the immediate  unconditional and total withdrawal of the foreign forces from Afghanistan in order to enable its people to determine their own form of government and choose their economic  political and social systems free from outside intervention  subversion  coercion or constraint of any kind whatsoever. The resolution went on to urge the bringing about of conditions necessary for the voluntary return of the Afghan refugees to their homes. Unfortunately  that resolution has not been implemented any more than have other resolutions adopted in other forums on this subject  one of the most striking of which was the one adopted at the Eleventh Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers  held at Islamabad from 17 to 22 May last 58.	The continuation of the occupation of Afghanistan by Soviet troops is a threat to international and regional peace and security  and represents a danger to our region. That prompted us earlier in this session to join other States in requesting the inclusion in our agenda of an item dealing with the situation in Afghanistan.59.	The scope of the events in Afghanistan goes beyond the borders of that country and represents a threat to neighbouring countries. The international community must put an end to this dangerous phenomenon  so that other small States will not be victims of military intervention by a major Power aimed at overthrowing the regimes in authority and at controlling their destiny.60.	Here we should also like to mention the dangerous situation in Kampuchea and the continued presence there of Vietnamese forces. We must join those who have called for the withdrawal of Vietnamese forces from Kampuchean territory in order to allow the people there to determine their own future and government in complete freedom  without any  foreign pressure or presence.61.	My country has already welcomed the independence of Zimbabwe and its admission to the United Nations at the eleventh special session of the General Assembly. But I should like to take this opportunity to express our conviction that Zimbabwe's accession to independence and sovereignty gives us cause for optimism at this session. We must also express our satisfaction at the efforts and political sagacity of the leaders of Zimbabwe which led to a peaceful and just solution of the problem. We hope that a just and speedy settlement will be found for the other outstanding problems on the African continent  allowing the peoples of the continent to achieve freedom  dignity and equality while eliminating all forms of racial discrimination which run counter to our convictions.62.	Because of its geographical position and historical ties with African countries and peoples  Oman must express its concern at the foreign intervention in the Horn of Africa and urge that it be ended.63.	When the Final Document of the tenth special session of the General Assembly set forth the disarmament strategy  we expressed our hope that its adoption would lead to objective measures to slow down the arms race. Regrettably  however  directly after that session  there was further escalation in the arms race and the amounts being spent on the development  quantitatively and qualitatively  of arms  especially nuclear weapons have attained astronomical levels. We agree with the Secretary-General when he says  in his report on the work of the Organization  that ""present trends cast ominous shadows over disarmament efforts  both within and outside the framework of the United Nations""64.	Here we can only repeat what we have already said on many occasions  namely  that we cannot deal with arms questions in a vacuum; there is a close connection between arms limitation on the one hand and the sense of security  calm and international legality on the other. We hope to come up  at the start of the second Disarmament Decade  with positive measures for submission to the second special session of the General Assembly on disarmament  to be held in 1982.65.	Oman has always supported attempts to strengthen the security and integrity of certain geographical areas  and of course our support and our interest are particularly great in connection with the Indian Ocean  of which we are a coastal State  and with the problem of creating a zone of peace there. My delegation takes part in the work of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean and in preparations for the forthcoming conference in order to ensure its success and to enable the countries in the area to enjoy peace and security and not to fall prey to any attempt to bring them within the spheres of influence of others. We want the area to be one of construction and well-being and not one where disturbances will occur and where  in certain spots  terrorists and saboteurs are active.66.	In the south-western part of our country  unfortunately  the Government of Democratic Yemen has made terrorism  sabotage and aggression against neighbours a technique which it wishes to use in its foreign relations. That has given rise to a number of complaints  which have been presented to this Organization. Democratic Yemen has concluded a political and military agreement with the Soviet Union which has made it a military base far exceeding the defence needs of an economically weak country with limited income.67.	We all know that the United Kingdom  which colonized that country  had a very large military and naval base in Aden  and that it was the largest base east of the Suez. The base is bigger today  and has now become the most powerful base in the Indian Ocean and is being used by the Soviet Union. We note furthermore that the United States  for its part  has increased its naval forces in the Indian Ocean. However that may be  the Soviet Union today has a military strike force in the Indian Ocean and in adjacent areas through its bases in Afghanistan  in the Horn of Africa and in Aden. Moreover  it has its bases in areas bordering on ours. All this represents a grave direct threat to the independence and stability of the States of the region.68.	The important thing here is to reaffirm what the non- aligned States have always requested: the removal of all foreign bases from the Indian Ocean and that region  in order to make it immune from conflicts of interest and spheres of influence.69.	The major Powers must adopt peaceful policies consistent with their obligations under the Charter of the United Nations. Given those continuing threats  the Sultanate of Oman has no choice but to take whatever legal action it can to guarantee its territorial integrity in observance of the Charter and the principles of non-alignment  especially the principle of non-interference in internal affairs. Oman reaffirms its fundamental position  which is that we are opposed to all military alliances regardless of their form  and that we call for the elimination of all foreign military bases in the Indian Ocean.70.	Together with its interest in creating a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean  Oman continues to discharge its duty as a State on the Strait of Hormuz  a vital artery linking the Gulf to the Indian Ocean. Along it is shipped much of the oil sent to consumer countries by the producers. The Sultanate of Oman has presented certain proposals to IMCO on the regulation of maritime traffic in the territorial waters of the Strait. It wishes to safeguard passage through these territorial waters in order to preserve its own interests primarily  but also those of its sister States. It is opposed to any action likely to hamper shipping and to lead to foreign intervention in our area.71.	The problem of refugees is causing us concern at the international level  but particularly in Africa and Asia. Although we are participating in the humanitarian efforts of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to allay the suffering of millions  we hope that studies will be made to find the reasons for the existence of this grave humanitarian problem. Humanitarian aid is not enough; the problem must be tackled at its source.72.	Today we can only say that we welcome and are indeed very pleased with the proposal which has been made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Federal Republic of Germany [8th meeting] to include an additional item on our agenda  entitled ""International co-operation to avert flows of refugees"". We trust that the discussion will lead to realistic political solutions to the problem. The first solution must be to put an end to persecution and to obstacles preventing the return of refugees to their homes. There can be no solution to the problem if political and humanitarian considerations are separated. The political considerations involved in the problem of refugees must be faced with courage and determination.73.	We all share feelings of frustration and disappointment because of the failure of the eleventh special session  which dealt with the international economic order. That failure was due to the fact that agreement could not be reached regarding the global negotiations  despite all our efforts. Nor were we able to reach a consensus consistent with General Assembly resolution 34/138 on establishing a new international economic order based on principles of equality and mutual benefit. In fact  we just succeeded in adopting limited measures which lead only to temporary solutions of the economic difficulties that we must overcome.74.	My delegation agrees with the position of the Group of 77 regarding negotiating procedure and the agenda. What we find encouraging is that the text for the new International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade was supported by a large majority  and we are convinced that it will be a vital part of the efforts to establish a new international economic order. The new Development Strategy will be the framework for development in the decade to come. Its implementation depends  in the first place  on the new negotiation frame-work  which requires an atmosphere of complete confidence in place of the distrust that prevailed during the eleventh special session. We say this in all sincerity and without casting aspersions on any of our partners. We hope that at the present session agreement will be possible on the agenda for the negotiations and the measures likely to make them a success.75.	Our interest in the world-wide attempts to solve development problems goes hand in hand with our interest in developing Oman. We see economic development as a complex task which requires genuine and fruitful co-operation between developing and developed countries. Without such positive co-operation between the two groups it will be difficult to make tangible progress in this field. We believe that the efforts of the developing countries in the field of economic development will benefit not them alone but the international community as a whole. For our part  we are trying by every means to bring about our country's economic development in a balanced manner so that it shall be of benefit to all our citizens. We are convinced that the guiding purpose of any development effort is to raise the economic and social living standards of every citizen  within a framework of economic freedom  making it possible for all members of society to participate effectively in the building of the future. We affirm that we sincerely wish to participate  together with the international community  in the establishment of a world of freedom  prosperity and dignity.76.	Oman will soon be celebrating its tenth anniversary  which is the anniversary of the national reawakening that has been presided over by Sultan Qabus ibn Sa'id since he took up the reins of power. These 10 years are very important in the history of Oman because we have been able to achieve at the national level  under a wise and enlightened leadership  a balanced development covering education  health  social services in every corner of the country  the construction of ports  roads and communications facilities  and the strengthening of the means of ensuring security and national defence. His Majesty's Government is convinced that economic and social development must have a deliberate methodology in order that its fruits be in harmony with Oman's environment and its Arab and Islamic base. The five-year plan that we began in 1975 is drawing to its close. We have made a success of it and we shall shortly be beginning a second one.77.	My delegation would like to welcome here the results obtained during the ninth session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. Those results constitute a victory for the United Nations and demonstrate the effort that it is making to make positive achievements within the framework of constructive negotiations and in spite of all the obstacles encountered.78.	My country has accepted the compromises reached  after numerous difficulties  concerning the taking of decisions in the Conferenceâwhich is the executive organ of the international authorityâwhich was accompanied by demonstrations of goodwill  not to speak of confidence and effective co-operation between all the members of the Conference  thus preventing a paralysis of its work.79.	Since we are discussing a convention that seeks to codify the rules of international law governing the rights and duties of States with regard to the law of the sea  I should like to say that we should give thought also to the rights and responsibilities of countries that border on straits  with a view to ensuring that their security and independence shall be protected and that their coasts shall not be polluted  deliberately or by accident  all this to be covered by clear wording on the subject when texts on navigation in straits are being drafted and adopted at the next and last session of the Conference.80.	My delegation hopes also that we shall reach agreement on other outstanding items such as  for example  the delimitation of maritime frontiers between States that border one another or that face one another across water  and that the median line will be adopted as the means of delimitation.81.	My delegation agrees with other coastal States on the subject of the regulation of the passage of warships through our territorial zone  including the right to be advised in advance of such movement and to authorize it. We sincerely hope that 1981 will see the signature of a convention that will establish the basis for accord and peace at sea  which will strengthen international peace and security.82.	In conclusion I would express the hope that detente and co-operation will govern tomorrow's world  notwithstanding differences of political and economic regimes  on the basis of respect for the sovereignty of States  non-interference in their internal affairs and fruitful co-operation among all States  thus ensuring the realization of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations."
"106",5427,"PAK",35,1980,"ï»¿Today the world of Islam is on the threshold of the fifteenth century of its glorious and eventful history. Another 40 days will usher in the beginning of a new Islamic century. Muslims all over the world will be celebrating the fourteen hundredth anniversary of a unique event  which was chosen by the Second Caliph of Islam  Hazrat Umar Ibn al-Khattabâmay God be pleased with himâas the beginning of the Islamic Hegira calendar. The Hegira calendar commemorates neither the Prophet's birthday nor the time when the message of God was first revealed to him. It commemorates an event which was to become a turning point in the evolution of Islam. That event was the Hegira  or the great departure of Prophet Mohammedâpeace be upon himâwith a small group of devoted followers from his place of birth  Mecca  for the city over 400 kilometres away  the city of Medina. The departure for Medina was chosen as the starting point of the Islamic calendar because it marked the founding of the Islamic polity.3.	While in Mecca Islam emerged as a moral force; it was Medina which had the honour of being the cradle of the first Islamic State under the guidance of the Prophet himself. That State was founded on the basis of the universally applicable moral principles revealed in the Koran. This first Islamic policy symbolized the happy blending of the citizens of Medinaâcalled Ansars  or the Helpersâand the Muhajireen  or the Refugees  from Mecca. A union of great importance had thus emerged. Together  the two communities formed the nucleus of the Islamic Ummah  or the great brotherhood of Islam. The idea embodied in this concept served as a beacon for humanity at large.4.	Leaving his place of birth  the home of his ancestors  the kith and kin to whom he was deeply attached  was undoubtedly a great ordeal for the Prophet. With his reputation for unimpeachable integrityâhe was called by everyone alike ""Al-Amin""  The Trustworthy. His gentle disposition and nobility of character endeared him to one and all. He could have stayed on in Mecca as a highly respectable member of the leading Hashemite clan to which he belonged  if only he would stop preaching what God commanded him to preach. His refusal to do so turned the hostility of the people of Mecca into unbridled fury.5.	Thus the founding of the first Islamic State in Medina represented  on the one hand  the rejection of the suffocating environment of bigotry  intolerance  tyranny  oppression and moral turpitude and  on the other hand  the determination of the new-born Islamic community to promote understanding  tolerance  brotherhood and freedom as imperatives of State policy. From then on the world was to witness  emanating in succession from Medina  developments of monumental significance in the history of mankind.6.	It is a great honour for me and my country that I have been given this opportunity to address the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly  on behalf of the 900 million fellow Muslims in commemoration of such an epoch making event in human history. I do so with deep humility in response to the mandate conferred upon me by the Eleventh Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers   which Pakistan was privileged to host.7.	I am grateful to you  Mr. President  for your kind words of welcome and I take this opportunity to convey to you my personal congratulations and those of the Government and the people of Pakistan on your election as President of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly.8.	To the Secretary General I wish to express our profound admiration for the qualities and experience which he possesses in such abundant measure. During his two terms of office  he has been called upon to deal with some of the most difficult problems which the world Organization has had to face. He has done so with great distinction  and we wish him continued success in the future.9.	Speaking as a humble believer  I am particularly conscious of the Islamic injunction to rise above race  colour and creed and to perceive fellow human beings in terms of universal brotherhood. Islam  by its very definition  is a religion of peace and submission to the divine will. It demands of its followers that they strive  individually as well as collectively  for the creation of a human society based on justice and equality.10.	It is most appropriate for me on such an occasion and before such a distinguished audience representing the entire world community to speak of the Islamic virtues of tolerance and compassion which brought about a synthesis of civilizations and a balanced intermingling of peoples of diverse faiths and beliefs. Islam rejects narrow nationalism  parochialism and racial elitism. The intercommunal peace and harmony prevailing during the period of more than 1 000 years of Islamic ascendancy stands in sharp contrast to the present day racial arrogance  discrimination and persecution which are practised in certain parts of the globe today.11.	The true foundation of the peace and tranquillity which characterized the prime period of Islamic ascendancy lies in the great Islamic virtues symbolized  in particular  by the concept of universal brotherhood  tolerance and respect for the sanctity of life. The Holy Koran says: ""He who slays one human being  it is as if he had slain all mankind; he who saves one human being  it is as if he had saved all mankind."" Islam specifically forbids wars of aggression and permits recourse to arms only in self-defence. The Holy Koran says: ""Fight in the way of Allah those who fight you; but you do not begin the hostilities; for Allah does not love aggression."" The Islamic concept of jihad epitomizes the precepts so explicitly enunciated in those verses from the Holy Koran. There is  indeed  an element of struggle in jihadâa continuous struggle  a constant striving  to lead life in its totality in the light of the message of the Holy Koran and in the tradition of the Prophet of Islam.12.	The Islamic message of universal brotherhood  peace and equity is of eternal value and is more than ever relevant to the conditions prevailing in today's world. Ever since the birth of this world man has had his share of conflicts and difficulties. The confrontation of civilizations and faiths in the past did not lead to the annihilation of the human race because  mercifully  the means of mass destruction were limited. Today we have stepped into an age wherein humanity has at its disposal the means of destroying itself several times over. The world can no longer afford the luxury of confrontation and wars. Mankind needs peace. Let us all try to achieve peace within and peace without.13.	There is yet another form of confrontation  besides the nuclear arms race  that threatens human survival. It is the confrontation between man's selfishness and nature. His insatiable pursuit of material comforts has led him to reckless destruction of the natural environment. The ecological crisis faced by our planet today  particularly by the highly industrialized nations  has reached such alarming proportions that the questions must be asked: Has not man burnt his fingers in the fire which he himself kindled? Has he not lost his sense of proportion in his earthly scheme of priorities? Does he not understand that this world is not his personal property but a trust from the Almighty who created it?14.	As the Holy Koran says:""In the alternation of day and night  in the rains from heaven that come to quicken the parched earth  in the shifting winds  and in the clouds pressed into service between heaven and earth  there are signs enough of Allah's rule for people who have understanding.""It is this understanding that can help the present-day world to regain the equilibrium it seems to have lost.15.	The followers of Islam believe that their faith represents that ultimate perfection of the divine message which has flowed to mankind through a succession of Prophets. Muslims are enjoined to accept the missions of all the Prophets who preceded Prophet Mohammedâpeace be upon him. In the Holy Koran it is stated: ""Those who believe""âwhat Mohammed revealedâ""and those who are Jews  Christians  Sabeans or whoever believes in Allah and the Day of Judgement  they shall have their reward."" The Prophet of Islam himself said: ""I believe in the one Allah  in His revealed Books  in His message bearing Prophets  in the Hereafter."" It is noteworthy that the Prophet spoke of ""the revealed Books""  and not merely of the Book. Similarly  he spoke of God's ""message bearing Prophets""  and not merely of one Prophet  that would be himself. We Muslims are bound by our faith to believe in all the Prophets and the revealed Books from Adam to Prophet Mohammedâpeace be upon himâwho is the last of the Prophets.16.	The great Islamic community today straddles a broad geographical belt from Indonesia in the East to Senegal in the West. Living in different climes and under different customs and political systems  speaking different languages and dialects  Muslims all over the world retain an abiding sense of Islamic affinity. It is this unity in diversity which is the hallmark of the Muslim Ummah  or the Commonwealth of Muslim Nations. The Islamic Conference  of which I have the honour to be the current Chairman  constitutes a concrete manifestation of the urge of the Muslim Ummah to re-establish its historic role as a factor for peace and progress and to reassert the overriding unity of the Muslim peoples scattered over the globe.17.	As we stand at the threshold of the fifteenth century of Hegira  we can look with pride to the fact that the Islamic countries have regained their political independence and are working closely to obtain their rightful place in the world. Their desire for unity is manifested in the 42 member Islamic Conference  which has come to acquire an eminent place among international organizations and whose decisions are assuming ever-increasing importance in the international community.18.	The spread of Islam led to a creative encounter between the first Islamic people of Arabia and the major cultures of Persia  Greece  Egypt and India  resulting in an unprecedented flowering of the human genius. This great epoch of creative activity that began in the second century Hegira lasted several hundred years. Both in the heartland of Islam  represented by the great traditions of the Caliphs  and in the no less glorious Islamic cultures  which developed in far off places such as Spain  India  Central Asia  Asia Minor  Africa and Southeast Asia  the triumphant spirit of man  emancipated and enriched by Islam  manifested itself in remarkable advances in the arts and sciences. This was the era in which were laid the foundations of modern learning and knowledge.â19.	It gives me pleasure to recall that human progress is heavily indebted to the early Muslim scholars  philosophers  scientists and physicians  who made outstanding original contributions in their respective fields and disciplines  rescued the best in the ancient Greco-Roman civilization  and passed this treasure on to the West. Who can forget the immortals like Averroes  Ibn Sina  Ibn Haitham  Ibn Khal dun  Alberuni and the great Omar Khayyam?20.	These are but a few of the galaxy of illustrious Muslims who extended the frontiers of knowledge and enriched human experience. It was their enlightened approach to the acquisition and dissemination of knowledge that made this progress possible. They sought and acquired knowledge from whatever source it was availableâfrom the Greeks and Romans  the Chinese  the Persians  the Hindus  the Buddhists and the rest. The Prophet had urged them to do so. Permit me to read here four out of many quotations from the teachings of the Prophet:""Seek knowledge from the cradle to the grave.""""Whoever seeks knowledge and finds it will get two rewards: one for seeking  and the other for finding. If he does not find it  he still has one reward.""""The ink of the scholar is holier than the blood of the martyr.""""It is better to impart knowledge one hour than to pray all night.""The emphasis in these quotations is not only on seeking knowledge  but also on sharing it with others for the progress of mankind as a whole. There is a lesson in this for the present-day world where access to vitally useful knowledge  indispensable for human progress and prosperity  is allowed on a selective basis  and is  indeed  being denied by the privileged few to the less fortunate many who need it most.21.	The Islamic world was instrumental not only in generating the first intellectual stirrings which prepared the ground for the European Renaissance  but also in acting as a bulwark for the defence of Western civilization against the Mongol hordes that descended like an elemental force of nature. But for the Islamic world  which bore the brunt of the Mongol onslaught  Europe would have been overwhelmed in the seventh century Hegira that is  the thirteenth century A.D. It is indeed a tragic irony of fate that those very people who were thus saved by the Muslims turned around to occupy and pillage Muslim lands and convert them into their prize colonies.22.	While that unhappy period in Islamic history is undoubtedly behind us  its evil consequences remain to be eradicated. Political independence regained by Muslim countries has not loosened the tenacious grip of economic exploitation  which goes hand in hand with colonialism. Continued dependence on the industrially developed world has aggravated their plight. Their crucial strategic location has generated intolerable pressures from powers seeking hegemony and coveting their vital natural resources.23.	The feeling of insecurity across much of the globe today is attributable to the continuing tendency to use force and pressure for the control and exploitation of scarce resources. The distress caused by that phenomenon is writ large on the faces of both the exploited and the exploiter. Where will this lead us? The Holy Koran warns mankind against it thus: ""To him who is covetous and bent on riches... to him will the path of distress be made easy"".24.	While on the subject of conflict generated by avarice and greed  I should like to present  before this Assembly  how we Muslims perceive some of the critical areas of tension on the world map.25.	The tragic conflict between the two Islamic States of Iran and Iraq is a source of deep concern to the world community. It causes profound anguish to the world of Islam in particular. That violent conflict between two brotherly Islamic States is attributable to the unstable conditions created in a strategic area by a colonial legacy. We fervently hope that peace between those two neighbouring countries will return soon  Allah willing. It is the duty of the international community and in particular that of the Islamic and nonaligned worlds to make a positive contribution towards the resolution of the differences between Iran and Iraq. An essential condition for the return of peace between them would be the observance of strict neutrality and non-interference in their internal affairs by outside Powers.26.	As the Assembly is aware  I have come to New York directly from the capitals of Iran and Iraq  where I was warmly received in a spirit of Islamic fraternity by President Bani Sadr and President Saddam Hussein. My mission was undertaken at the behest of the Islamic Conference. Its purpose was essentially one of fact-finding and good will. I was able to ascertain the views of my two brothers in a series of meetings in an atmosphere of mutual trust and confidence. I have faithfully conveyed to each brother the views and position of the other in regard to a cessation of hostilities. It is my earnest hope and prayer that efforts will continue to end the tragic conflict between Iran and Iraq and that a peaceful solution will be found to their differences on the basis of justice and respect for each other's rights and in the spirit of Islamic solidarity and brotherhood.27.	By far the most destabilizing factor in the Middle East is Israel. Who can deny the justice of the cause of the Palestinian people  who have been mercilessly uprooted from their sacred land after being in continuous possession of it for the best part of 1 400 years  and who have been suffering untold oppression  tyranny and terrorism practised against them by the Zionist entity?28.	The threat posed to world peace by the Palestinian problem is all too evident. The situation can explode at any moment. The resulting conflagration could envelop the world in a disaster the magnitude of which has not been seen before. Injustice and oppression rouse strong sentiments; those sentiments cannot be suppressed by arrogant reliance on force and coercion  nor smothered by unremitting persecution. Israel  which is so ready to invoke the past  should not forget the oft-repeated lesson of history that its policy of annexation and domination is doomed to failure. History has the habit of unceremoniously repeating itself.29.	Notwithstanding protestations of the desire to bring about a peaceful solution of the Palestinian problem  in the context of the Middle East situation the stark reality is that Israel continues to defy the will of the world community  expressed through this very forum and the Security Council on numerous occasions. It continues to occupy Arab and Palestinian land by force. It cynically disregards the near unanimous world edict on Jerusalem by passing a law to change the status of Jerusalem. In its resolution 478 (1980) the Security Council reacted by calling upon all countries having their diplomatic missions in Jerusalem to shift them. The response was unanimous and prompt.30.	I take this opportunity to offer profound thanks to all the 13 countries  namely  Bolivia  Chile  Colombia  Costa Rica  the Dominican Republic  Ecuador  El Salvador  Guatemala  Haiti  the Netherlands  Panama  Uruguay and Venezuela  which have removed their diplomatic missions from Jerusalem to show their displeasure at Israel's defiance of international law and public opinion. We salute them for their principled decision. Is it not time for further action by the world community so that the conditions stipulated generally by world opinion  and especially by the Islamic Conference on the Palestinian problem  are met  and peace returns to the Middle East? Let there be no illusion that wounds inflicted on the Palestinians can be healed by the passage of time. Now is the time to act  before it is too late.31.	The United States claims that it has vital economic and strategic interests in the Middle East and North Africa  which is not only the homeland of the Arab people  but constitutes the strategic frontiers of Europe. Yet it pursues a policy which brings it into hostile confrontation with the Arab world and extends open-ended support to Israel which encourages that country to pursue aggressive policies in defiance of world opinion. The United States bears a heavy responsibility in this respect  since reliance on the might of this superpower enables Israel to flout the verdict of the international community and to usurp the legitimate rights of the people of Palestine.32.	The Muslim world wholeheartedly supports the just struggle of the people of Palestine under the leadership of their legitimate and sole representative  the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]  for the liberation of their sacred territory from Zionist rule and occupation. It considers that the issue of Palestine is at the core of the Middle East question. Successive Islamic Conferences have demanded  first  the complete withdrawal of all Israeli forces from the occupied Arab territories  including Jerusalem; secondly  the exercise by the people of Palestine of their inalienable national rights  including the right to establish a sovereign State of their own in their homeland under the leadership of the PLO and  thirdly  the dismantling of all the so-called settlements in occupied Arab territories.33.	Until these just demands are met in full  the prospect of a genuine and lasting peace in the Middle East will elude us  and the world will continue to be haunted by the spectre of a wider conflict in which the interests of those who protect Israel will suffer most.34.	The world of Islam is profoundly concerned with the tragedy that has overtaken Afghanistan. This small  independent  nonaligned Muslim country has been subjected to military intervention on a massive scale  in violation of the national rights of the Afghan people and the sacrosanct principle of nonalignment and of the Charter of the United Nations. True to their centuries old national tradition and unconquerable spirit of independence  the people of Afghanistan have responded to the challenge with fearless resistance through the length and breadth of their country. Their struggle is as sacrosanct and worthy of respect and support as the heroic struggles of the Algerian people  the people of Zimbabweâand indeed  of all the oppressed and exploited people of the world at one time or anotherâ against foreign domination.35.	The deeply felt resentment of the international community and of the Muslim world in particular against this act of armed intervention has been clearly expressed in the demand for the immediate  unconditional and total withdrawal of Soviet military forces from Afghanistan. The Eleventh Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers  which met at Islamabad in May last  set in motion a process of resolving the Afghan crisis through peaceful negotiations. It adopted a resolution establishing a committee comprised of the Foreign Ministers of Iran and Pakistan and the Secretary General of the Organization of the Islamic Conference  with a view to holding consultations with all the parties to bring about a solution based on the following principles: first  the immediate  unconditional and total withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan; secondly  the restoration of the independence and nonaligned status of Afghanistan; thirdly  respect for the right of the Afghan people to determine their own destiny and to choose their own form of government in accordance with their own wishes  free from external interference; and fourthly  the creation of conditions which would permit the Afghan refugees to return to their homes in safety and honour.36.	It is a matter of deep regret that this valuable initiative of the Islamic Conference has now been stalled by the overall negative attitude of the Kabul regime. I am confident that the Assembly will address itself to the urgent task of promoting a political solution of the crisis in Afghanistan  in accordance with these principles.37.	In the meantime  more than a million Afghan refugees have crossed the 1400mile border into Pakistan  while others have taken shelter in Iran. Entire communities of men  women and children  uprooted from their hearths and' homes by the violence of the conflict  have continued to pour into Pakistan. My country is providing them with shelter in a humanitarian spirit and in conformity with the tradition of Islamic brotherhood. It is a task of awesome magnitude  in view of Pakistan's limited resources. However  we are grateful for the assistance received for this purpose from brotherly Moslem countries and other friendly nations  the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  and various international agencies and humanitarian organization including the Red Crescent and the International Red Cross.38.	People do not leave the comforts of their hearths and homes to face the privations of life in exile without compelling reasons. The Afghan refugees on our soil have had to leave their country because life was made unbearable for them. The orchestrated propaganda campaign accusing Pakistan of interference in Afghanistan's internal affairs cannot mislead the world. It cannot conceal the truth that the insurgency in Afghanistan is a manifestation of the patriotic upsurge of a proud people who have never yielded to foreign domination. I wish to restate Pakistan's commitment to the principle of non-interference in the affairs of other States and categorically reject the allegation that Pakistan is in any way involved in the insurgency in Afghanistan.39.	It is interesting to note that this insurgency is mainly in the interior of Afghanistan  where brave men and women  brave boys and girls and brave peasants and workers are fighting to free themselves from the forcible occupation of their territory by foreign troops. What is surprising is the attitude of the big Powers; one has accused the other of an effort to strangulate it. Surely the presence of troops of one country on an island of the Indian Ocean cannot be accepted as an excuse for another country to send troops into a third independent nation.40.	A situation similar to that in Afghanistan exists today in Kampuchea. Here again  a regime has been imposed on that country by the foreign occupation forces  leading to a mass exodus of the Kampuchean people  who have endured great suffering and privation. In both cases principles of international law and peaceful coexistence have been violated.41.	The world of Islam does not believe that international security can be genuine as long as it is predicated on an unstable balance of terror and a continuous escalation of the arms race. We have welcomed measures in the past aimed at relaxing tensions between the two superpowers and we wholeheartedly support their efforts to limit and control strategic nuclear weapons. The Muslim countries favour genuine detente  but not detente based on a division of the world into spheres of influence by the two superpowers  because such an arrangement would be at the expense of the Islamic and nonaligned world. We cannot subscribe to a detente which is designed to keep certain areas of the globe tension free while exposing others to subversion and aggression in any shape or form. We want peace. We want peace with dignity. We want peace with respect. We want peace with honour. We firmly believe that peace is indivisible and must encompass all parts of the globe. It cannot be selective in its scope or application.42.	The world of Islam has invariably been at the forefront in espousing the right of peoples to self-determination and independence as a matter of principle. The attainment of independence by nearly 100 countries since the Second World War is a matter of profound satisfaction to all of us. The success of the valiant struggle waged by the African people is a glorious chapter in the annals of freedom. We pay a tribute to the indomitable spirit of the great liberation movements and  particularly  to the memory of those martyrs whose supreme sacrifice has made this historic achievement possible.43.	The presence among us today of Zimbabwe as a full-fledged Member of the United Nations symbolizes the heroic achievements of the continent of Africa and offers fresh hope to the people of Namibia and South Africa  where the tentacles of colonialism and racist minority rule maintain an iron hold today. Our prayers and whatever moral and material support is required of us will always be with the freedom fighters of southern Africa. Their problems are our problems; their difficulties are our difficulties; and their struggle is our struggle. The clock is in their favour. They will succeed  because their cause is just.44.	The tide of independence cannot be reversed  any more than one can successfully bid yesterday return. Indeed  all efforts to keep people under subjugation or to turn countries into coloniesâsuch is the verdict of modern historyâare foredoomed to failure.45.	The policies of racial discrimination  apartheid and minority rule being followed by South Africa are repugnant to the letter and spirit of Islam and international morality. We are convinced that nemesis will overtake whosoever practises racism and apartheid or discriminates between one human being and another on the grounds of colour.46.	The Pretoria regime must be made to end its illegal occupation of Namibia and its repressive policies and acts of violence in that Territory and in South Africa. The Namibian people must be allowed to decide their own future destiny through impartial elections under United Nations auspices. However great the difficulties may appear  we are confident of the ultimate triumph of the people of Namibia under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO].47.	There is another form of discrimination  which is a matter of deep concern today to the world of Islam. The Muslim minorities in various countries around the globe number nearly 300 million. They are frequently discriminated against and subjected to untold miseries because of religious prejudice. Their lives and properties are not always safe. In some countries they are being systematically reduced to the status of serfs; in others they are being forcibly expelled from their ancestral homes and driven to inhospitable regions. The very custodians of law and order have become for them instruments of acts of oppression and extermination.48.	This is a challenge to the world conscience and must be met firmly and fairly. It is a challenge to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  which proclaims that everyone has the right to freedom of conscience and religion. How can the conscience of the world close its eyes to the fate of millions of human beings who are undergoing acute suffering merely because they profess a particular faith? True to the injunctions of Islam  our hearts go out not only to the Muslim minorities who are subjected to discrimination and oppression but to all minority communities  regardless of their creed  colour or caste  who are made to suffer a similar fate.49.	To express humanitarian concern over the plight of these minorities does not constitute interference in the internal affairs of any State. The world community must not lose its capacity for moral anger  which in many cases is perhaps the only instrument it has today to exert pressure on the oppressor. The future of mankind will be bleak indeed  if we allow our sensitivities to human suffering to be dulled or our conscience to be stifled at the sight of poverty and hunger. The Holy Prophet said:""He is not a perfect Moslem who eats his fill and lets his neighbour go hungry ....""He who helps his fellow men in the hour of need  him will Allah help on the Day of Judgement.""That is as much true of individuals as of nations.50.	We  the peoples of the Islamic world  along with our brethren of the third world  have suffered together the trauma of colonial domination; we have struggled  side by side  to attain our freedom; we have gone through the same pangs of rebirth after independence; we have inherited similar problems; we are facing similar challenges; and we share the same disappointment in the non-realization of the rising hopes and expectations of our peoples.51.	The basis of the existing economic relationship between the developed and the developing countries is the principleâor shall we say the lack of principle in this caseâ of justice and fair play. The developing nations supply the raw materials  but the developed nations demand unjustly high prices for the industrial goods that they provide. We  of the third world  are at the mercy of the international market  which is manipulated by a handful of industrialized countries. It is in the interest of the developed countries to realize that the advantages of such basically unsound tactics are only short-lived. We have entered an era of interdependence  and no single country can ensure its prosperity by adopting measures which frustrate the legitimate aspirations of other countries and other peoples. Exploitative and discriminatory practices against the developing countries are the root cause of economic and political instability  which poses a great danger to world peace and security. The time has surely comeâif it is not late alreadyâto establish a new economic order which would be durable because it would be fair.52.	The Group of 77  representing the third world  has been pressing its demand since 1964 for an international economic order that would ensure optimum growth of the world economy for the benefit of all countries and ail peoples. The North-South dialogue has dragged on  as a futile exercise  for nearly a decade now. In the meantime  the problems of poverty and deprivation of more than half the world have become further aggravated  posing ever greater dangers to world stability.53.	Meanwhile  the Islamic world has made a start with concerted measures to pool its resources and has established financial and banking institutions of its own for the purpose. In the fullness of time these institutions should  Allah willing  enable the Muslims to achieve a substantial measure of economic self-reliance. In the true Islamic tradition  the oil producing Muslim countries have shown a helpful attitude for alleviating the hardships not only of fellow Muslim States but also fellow members of the third world. At the same time the Muslim countries will continue to exert themselves to the utmost for the achievement of the objectives of the Group of 77. Their voice will also be clearly heard in the North South dialogue urging affluent nations to raise their official development assistance to the third world at least to the agreed level of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product. Can magnanimity be at such a low premium?54.	While so little is being contributed towards the elimination of the problems of poverty and backwardness on which the future stability of the world depends  the commitment of vast resources to the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction continues to increase. A further tragedy is that large-scale transfers of arms and lethal weapons are taking place to countries which are already expending so much of their precious resources on armaments at the expense of the welfare of their masses. World security is as much threatened by the reckless diversion of resources towards the arms race as by the neglect of the fundamental needs of the underprivileged peoples of the world. Indeed  the two are inextricably linked. Consequently  the question of disarmament is vitally relevant  not only to the reduction of international tensions  but also to the better utilization of resources for human development and progress. The goal of disarmament deserves the urgent attention of the world community  and needs to be pursued both at the global and regional levels.55.	The United Nations remains the embodiment of our hopes and aspirations for a world order based on peace and justice. It is committed to the achievement of that objective by virtue of the ideals enshrined in the Charter. The Organization has been a force for international peace and progress during its 35 years of existence. We do not feel discouraged by its occasional inability to translate its promises into tangible results. We are conscious of the circumstances which have prevented it from enforcing its decisions in respect of the right of the people of Palestine to establish a sovereign State of their own in their homeland  or redeeming its promise to the people of the State of Jammu and Kashmir to enable them to decide their future in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.56.	Since the reference to the State of Jammu and Kashmir touches upon Pakistan's relationship with India  I should like to say that  in conformity with our established policy  we have continued our efforts for further normalization of relations with India on the basis of the principles of the Simla Agreement of 1972.  Substantial progress has been made over the years in the promotion of communications  travel and trade between the two countries. This process  however  can and will be further accelerated with a peaceful settlement of the question of Jammu and Kashmir. Pakistan's position on this matter is founded on universally recognized principles.57.	The Islamic world holds the United Nations in great esteem and will strive to further its fundamental objectives. The message of Islamâthe message of peace  the equality of man  the rule of law and supremacy of justiceâis also fundamental to the United Nations. As devotees of the religion that brought this message to the world  and as signatories to the Charter in which it is enshrined  the Muslim countries are thus doubly committed to the ideals of the United Nations.58.	The Prophet of Islam said: ""Even he who makes progress daily is still far off from the ideal"". Therefore  we do not despair if the ideals of the United Nations are still nowhere near achievement; if aggression and adventurism still disfigure the international scene; if the security and sovereignty of the weak are still being threatened by the strong; if might is still paraded as right. But we live in hope and would continue to strive to come closer to the ideal with the passing of every day.59.	It is with this belief and determination that the Islamic world is poised to enter the fifteenth century Hegiraâ inspired by its great past; aware of its present problems and opportunities; conscious of its spiritual  cultural and political rebirth and its growing strength; and confident of its future. Its chief source of strength today is its urge for unity of thought and action. Its member Statesâover 40 in numberâare generally in agreement on the need for a united and collective response to issues affecting them and the world at large. This has led to the emergence of the concept of strengthening their security by pooling their natural resources  their abundant manpower and their available skills. The close collaboration so achieved will undoubtedly promote self-reliance and reduce dependence on the uncertainâand often uncomfortableâexternal factors. This concept of security of the Islamic countries does not involve alignment with any of the power groups; nor does it envisage multilateral defence pacts. It aims essentially at advancing the individual and collective capability of the Islamic countries to achieve the goals set by consensus  in the larger interest of the Muslim Ummah.60.	In the world today there is enough reason for mankind to see the future darkly and to lose its bearings in the pervading atmosphere of gloom. People feel embattled and forlorn and see perils and pitfalls all around them. There is social injustice within communities  and economic inequality among nations. All this  I venture to suggest  is a result of unbridled materialism  the eclipse of spiritual values and a loss of faith.61.	Our redemption lies in a renewal of faith; a revival of the belief in the Creator and His creation. I speak only as a Muslim  acutely conscious that arrogance of belief is forbidden to the Muslims; for Islam reproaches its followers for any conceit about their faith. So  in all humility  I state that we perceive the role of Islam as that of helping to overcome the problems besetting the present-day world. It can assist in building an enduring structure tor international amity  based on universal brotherhood and on respect for the principles of peaceful coexistence. Islam is not a religion in the conventional sense but a many splendoured mansionâ it is a unique and comprehensive system of law; it is a distinctive culture  a fascinating civilization; it is a supreme metaphysical doctrine for the relief and redemption of man. Fourteen hundred years of its record of service is there for all of us to see.62.	The credentials of the Muslims to be able to play a role in helping to promote peace and harmony among nations are provided in the statement of human rights and duties by the Prophet in his last sermon on Mount Arafat  which is as fresh and relevant today as it was 1 400 years ago. On that occasion the Prophet said:""Hearken to my words  O men ....""The Arab is not superior to non-Arab; the non-Arab is not superior to Arab. You are all sons of Adam  and Adam was made up of dust. . . .""The vengeance of blood practised in the days of Ignorance is prohibited  and blood feuds are abolished.""Verily  you should consider each other's blood  property  and reputation  inviolable unto the Day of Judgement.""Remember Allah [in your dealings with] women. You have rights over themâthey have rights over you. . . .""Verily  a man is responsible only for his own acts. A son is not responsible for the crimes of his father  nor a father responsible for the crimes of his sons. He who has a pledge  let him return it to him who entrusted him with it: all usury is abolished  but you have your capital; wrong not  and you shall not be wronged.""You are one brotherhood; nothing which belongs to another is lawful unto his brother  unless freely given out of good will. Guard yourselves from committing injustice.""You will surely meet your Lord  and He will ask you about your deeds.""63.	If this be the message  then should not the present resurgence of Islam and the reawakening among the Muslims of the world be a welcome phenomenon? It should be welcomed as a revitalizing force that could bring peace to a weary world and hope to a distraught humanity. It is not a religion that forces itself on others. The Holy Koran explicitly reminds us: ""There is no compulsion in religion"".64.	Thus  without obstructing  and in its own imperceptible ways  Islam can act as a catalyst in rousing the conscience of the international community. The religion of Islam is primarily concerned with the guidance it furnishes to its votaries on how best to live this life. The prayer of the believer is: ""Our Lord  enable us to live this life in a handsome way and also grant us a handsome life in the Hereafter"". Amen.65.	This life is a preparation for the life to come; it has to be lived fully  earnestly and resolutely. It has to be lived for God  spent in His holy name  in obedience to His law.66.	The world of Islam is confident that the era of stark materialism  which bred imperialism  colonialism and injustice in all its forms  is finally over  and cannot be brought back. As they enter the fifteenth century Hegira  the Islamic peoples  who have rediscovered their pride in their religion  their great culture and their unique social and economic institutions  are confident that the advent of this century will mark the beginning of a new epoch when their high ideals of peace  justice  the equality of man  and their unique understanding of the universe  will once again enable them to make a worthy contribution to the betterment of mankind.67.	Before concluding I should like to express a fervent hope and prayer on behalf of the Muslims of the world that the 154 nations gathered here make a solemn commitment: that the fifteenth century Hegira and the twenty-first century A.D. will usher in an era in which relations between States will be governed by higher moral principles  and not by power politics; that we shall create a human society founded on the principle of universal brotherhood; that all forms of intolerance and discrimination based on considerations of race  colour  creed or sex shall be ended; that the remaining strongholds of oppression and injustice on earth shall be demolished; that the strong nations shall not oppress the weak  nor the rich dominate the poor; that scientific knowledge and the natural resources of the earth shall be shared equitably for the common welfare and good of the human race  instead of being squandered on armaments and other preparations for war; that the environment of our planet shall be protected from abuse to safeguard for posterity its right to inherit the earth as beautiful and supportive of life as the Creator made it for us; that  above all  peace shall prevail among nations and brotherhood among men  to enable humanity to preserve our precious civilization to which each generation has made its contribution  and to achieve the quality of life based on political  economic and social justice to which we all aspire  but which has so far exceeded our grasp.68.	I once again thank you  Mr. President  for the privilege of addressing this august Assembly.69.	Peace be on you  and Allah's mercy and His blessings."
"107",5471,"PAN",35,1980,"ï»¿Panama  a country which has excellent relations with the Federal Republic of Germany  has sincerely welcomed the election of Mr. von Wechmar to the presidency of the thirty-fifth session. In congratulating him on such a high distinction we are aware of his enormous responsibility  owing to the serious political and economic problems which will have to be considered by the world Organization in circumstances which are not at all auspicious and which characterize the sombre international situation obtaining in the world today. We trust  however  that his experience and wisdom will guide our work  and to that end he will have the full cooperation of the delegation of Panama.204.	The interests of the countries of the third world were particularly well defended during the term of presidency of the General Assembly of the outstanding African statesman  Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim of the United Republic of Tanzania  to whom the delegation of Panama pays a tribute and expresses its recognition of the excellent work done by him during the period just ended. Mr. Salim presided over four sessions of extreme importance  during which he showed his high sense of equity and his qualifications as a skilled negotiator and parliamentarian. I am referring to the thirty-fourth regular session  to the sixth emergency special session on the question of Afghanistan  to the seventh emergency special session on the question of Palestine and to the eleventh special session of the General Assembly devoted to international economic cooperation  in all of which Panama had the privilege of cooperating closely as a Vice President of each of those sessions and as a member of the Credentials Committee. Panama also served as Vice Chairman of the Ad Hoc Committee of the Eleventh Special Session and chairman of the contact group which negotiated the adoption by consensus of resolutions S 11/3 and S 11/4 relating to the least developed countries. It is due to these circumstances that my country has been able to view closely this period of history during which Mr. Salim played such an important role.205.	Although the delegation of Panama at the eleventh special session conveyed a brotherly welcome to the Prime Minister of the Republic of Zimbabwe  Robert Mugabe  on the occasion of Zimbabwe's admission to the United Nations  I wish to reiterate my country's pleasure at that historic event  since the independence of Zimbabwe is a mortal blow to colonialism in southern Africa and because it strengthens the ideal of universality of the United Nations.206.	We welcome with a special sense of satisfaction the admission to the United Nations at this session of the new State of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  with which the Organization reaches a total of 154 Member States and the group of Latin American States a membership of 30. This is a positive development and  in offering our cooperation to the Government and people of that country  we extend a brotherly welcome and our best wishes for its progress and wellbeing.207.	The activities of the United Nations in the field of international economic and social cooperation deserve general recognition but  in addition  they need to be strengthened and expanded. If only a modest percentage of the enormous amounts spent on weapons and military equipment could be devoted to that end  mankind would benefit greatly.208.	While proclaiming the hope that we shall see this happen someday  we wish to express our appreciation for the projects which are being developed in Panama by UNDP under the wise leadership of Mr. Bradford Morse. We trust that in the future these projects  which in the last five years have meant an investment by the United Nations of approximately $10 million in the development of Panama  may be expanded and multiplied.209.	It is only just that I should mention the excellent assistance being given to Panama by UNFPA  under the dynamic leadership of Mr. Rafael Salas. Among the projects which have been implemented in Panama or which are under way  we might mention the one on dynamic educational planning of the population  which began in 1976; the basic studies on population and planning for development  dating back to 1978; assistance to the national census on population and housing of 1980  which began in 1979; the research on the growth of the Panama City metropolitan area  begun in 1979; and the programme of assistance to the national mother child health programme. The funds provided by UNFPA for those projects amounted to $3 764 122 as of 30 November 1979 and currently exceed $4 million.210.	One of the priorities set by the Panamanian Government as part of the process of establishing the new international economic order is the expansion of its international trade and  in that connexion  maritime transport. Panama has traditionally been a maritime nation  fully capable of controlling and directly exploiting the natural resources stemming from its geographical position  especially since 1 October 1979  the date of entry into force of the new Torrijos-Carter Panama Canal Treaties  aimed at restoring the territorial integrity  sovereignty and jurisdiction of the Panamanian State over all its territory  including the old Panama Canal Zone.211.	The Panamanian Government considers it appropriate to reiterate at this session of the Assembly the appeal made in the Political Declaration issued at the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Nonaligned Countries  held at Havana from 3 to 9 September 1979  that all States of the world should adhere to the Protocol of the Treaty relating to the permanent neutrality of the Panama Canal  with due respect for the sovereignty of Panama and for the universal principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of States. 212.	The historic fact of the signing of the new Panama Canal Treaties in itself does not mean that all of Panama's claims have been satisfied  since compliance with the Treaties is a political  economic  social  administrative and also psychological process  the goal of which is to decolonize the Canal Zone. It entails breaking away from old mental attitudes and situations of privilege  which have no place in our constitutional system.213.	The decolonization process has led my Government to place marked emphasis on the development of its merchant fleet  which currently ranks fifth in the world  to make optimum use of the benefits of its geographic position and interocean communications. To that end  the Administration of President Royo has undertaken a broad maritime development programme with the advice  cooperation  technical counsel and material assistance of IMCO  giving due attention to compliance with existing international conventions in this field.214.	Panama has declared on more than one occasion in international forums that its status as a maritime country is based on the geographical position of the isthmus; the existence of 1 697 kilometres of Atlantic Ocean coastline and 1 160 kilometres of Pacific Ocean coastline; its vast fishing resources and the resources of its seabed; the operation of the interocean Canal; the recovery of the terminal ports of the Canal and the Transisthmian Railroad  as a result of the aforementioned Canal Treaties of 1977; the reversion to Panama  before the end of the century  of the interocean waterway  that is  the Canal itself and its installations; the establishment in Panama of an international financial centre; and the scope of Panamanian maritime legislation. All these factors were elements in Panama's being elected a member of the Council of IMCO at the eleventh session of its General Assembly  held in London last year.215.	My country  which has important maritime interests  wishes to express its deep satisfaction at the considerable progress made at the ninth session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  which opens the way for the possible signing at Caracas next year of a universal convention on this important subject.216.	Directly related to the expansion of our international trade  modernization of our systems of communication  expansion of our maritime transport facilities and the development of the Colon free zoneâwhich is one of the largest in the worldâwe have created conditions of stability  security and progress which have attracted to Panamanian soil one of the most important international banking communities  the fourth in importance in Latin America. Among the 10 most important Latin American banking centres  Panama ranks fourth  after Brazil  Mexico and Argentina.217.	With this background  it is understandable that Panama showed interest in contributing  to the extent possible  to the work done by the eleventh special session of the United Nations General Assembly on international development  and particularly with regard to agenda item 7  relating to the assessment of progress made in the establishment of the new international economic order and appropriate measures for promoting the development of the developing countries and international economic cooperation.218.	In those activities  Panama  as Vice-president of the General Assembly  Vice Chairman of the Ad Hoc Committee and chairman of the contact group  worked in close and harmonious cooperation with the President of the Assembly  Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim  the Secretary General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  the Chairman of the Group of 77  Mr. Brajesh C. Mishra of India  the Director General for Development and International Economic Cooperation  Mr. Kenneth K. S. Dadzie  the Chairman of the Ad Hoc Committee  Mr. Michel Dupuy of Canada  the Chairman of Working Group I on the International Development Strategy  Mr. Niaz A. Naik of Pakistan  the Chairman of Working Group II  Mr. Bogdan Crnobrnja of Yugoslavia  and the Rapporteur of the Ad Hoc Committee  Mr. Ali Hachani of Tunisia. All of them deserve just recognition by the international community for their enormous efforts in achieving consensus on the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade  which is to enter into force on 1 January 1981 and be applied from that date.219.	As chairman of the contact group  Panama  with the cooperation of participating States and groups of participating States  promoted the adoption by consensus of the two draft resolutions which were adopted without a vote. One was entitled ""Suggestions by the Secretary General to overcome the critical economic situation of many developing countries""  and the other ""Measures to meet the critical situation in the least developed countries"".220.	My country wishes to appeal to the three delegations which rejected the text contained in the document submitted by the Chairman of Working Group II  Mr. Bogdan Crnobrnja of Yugoslavia   as a procedural framework for global negotiations  and to urge the Governments of the United States  the United Kingdom and the Federal Republic of Germany to make an effort at this session with a view to reaching agreement on the programme and clearing the way for the global negotiations which are to be based on the new international development strategy.221.	The Panamanian delegation also appeals to those countries on whose political will depends the freeing of the American hostages in Teheran and the ending of the presence of foreign troops on the territory of the nonaligned State of Afghanistan. The solution of these two problems would contribute decisively to improving the international climate and creating an auspicious atmosphere for the global negotiations and the establishment of the new international economic order. This appeal goes also to the States members of the group of nonaligned countries and to the States members of the Group of 77  which are in a position to exert friendly pressure on the States directly involved in those conflict situations in order to achieve their prompt and just solution.222.	The dynamic diplomacy of personal contacts at the highest political level  devised by General Omar Torrijos as head of Government of Panama during the period from 1972 to 1978 concerning Panamanian claims to the Panama Canal  is a political tool which the leader of my country has continued to develop successfully in various areas to promote the political  economic  social and cultural development of Panama.223.	The visits by President Aristides Royo to heads of State and Government  as well as to international organizations in the United States  Europe  Asia and  shortly  Africa  have been of great significance in the Latin American continent. The meetings between President Royo and the leaders of the two great democracies neighbouring our country  President Julio Cesar Turbay Ayala of Colombia and President Rodrigo Carazo Odio of Costa Rica  have contributed to creating a climate of peace and trust in the region.224.	The talks between President Royo and the President of the United Mexican States  Jose Lopez Portillo  and the President of the Republic of Venezuela  Luis Herrera Campins  are characteristic of the new spirit that prevails in the Andean  Central American and Caribbean areas. Mexico and Venezuela  which have traditionally promoted Latin American unity  are now coming together on the specific solution of the serious problem of the net internal consumption of imported oil in Barbados  Costa Rica  El Salvador  Guatemala  Honduras  Jamaica  Nicaragua  Panama and the Dominican Republic  and to that end they have allotted a total volume of up to 160 000 barrels daily  providing besides the necessary official financing.225.	This historic action by the leaders of Venezuela and Mexico is an encouraging example of achievement of an overall solution of the energy problem  as well as eloquent proof that South South cooperation may be realized through constructive acts and not be confined to rhetorical statements.226.	Panama has followed the policy of promoting the process of Latin American integration  embodied in the Panama Convention of 17 October 1975  by which the charter establishing SELA was adopted  with the participation of 26 countries from Central and South America and the Caribbean  from Mexico to Argentina. My country will continue its efforts on behalf of the unity and integration of Latin America and the strengthening of its collective personality within the framework of worldwide relations.227.	The contacts between President Royo and the leaders of the Caribbean countries at the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Nonaligned Countries  held at Havana in September 1979  his meetings with Central American leaders and his meetings with the Presidents of the Andean Group have been motivated not only by the common wish to give form to an authentic Latin American identity that is distinct and autonomous  but also by the collective concern over human rights and fundamental freedoms.228.	The great importance that Panama attaches to the full enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms was expressed in the Charter of Conduct signed on 11 September 1980 in the city of Riobamba  Republic of Ecuador  by the Presidents of Colombia  Ecuador  Venezuela and the Vice-president of Peru  and to which the Presidents of Costa Rica and Panama  as well as the representative of the President of the Spanish Government  pledged adherence at a memorable meeting of truly historic significance.229.	The Riobamba Charter of Conduct reiterates the formal commitment of the signatory States to respect for human  political  economic and social rights as a fundamental norm of the domestic behaviour of States and to their defence as an international obligation binding upon States and  therefore  to the idea that joint action aimed at protecting those rights does not violate the principle of non-interference.230.	The Riobamba Charter of Conduct is a revolutionary doctrine in defence of human rights that is in keeping with the ideals of the founders of the Latin American Republics. This historic document is of unique importance in the American continent in view of the massive violations of human rights which are becoming more and more frequent in the hemisphere. Only six weeks ago  the Permanent Council of the Organization of American States  in resolution 308 (432/80) of 25 July 1980  on solidarity with the Bolivian people  in referring to the right of every State freely to develop its cultural  political and economic life and at the same time to the duty of the State to respect the rights of the human person and the principles of universal morality  specifically stated that this principle specifically embodied in article 16 of the charter of the Organization of American States was violated by the military coup that took place in Bolivia  when the elections recently held in that country  in strict respect for the principle of non-intervention  were set aside.231.	The regional organization has not only deplored the military coup  which unfortunately has suspended indefinitely the process of institutionalizing democracy in the sister Republic of Bolivia  but it has also expressed its ""deepest concern over the loss of human lives and the serious violations of the human rights of the Bolivian people  which have been the direct consequence of the coup dâÃ©tat"".232.	Panama fully concurs in the pronouncement of the regional Organization and maintains its solidarity with the Bolivian people  in the hope that that noble people will find the most appropriate way of maintaining the existence of its democratic institutions and its freedoms without the interference of foreign military groups.233.	My country also reaffirms its firm adherence to the right of asylum  a classic institution in American international law  and wishes to reiterate its request made through regular channels that the Bolivian military regime speedily grants safe conduct to persons who have sought asylum in the Panamanian Embassy and in other diplomatic missions at La Paz so that they may leave the country without risk to their lives or personal security.234.	Panama has also noted with deep concern that there have been persistent violations of human rights and deliberate attacks on the lives and persons of the best intellectual  professional and scientific thinkers  educators and men of letters in various parts of the hemisphere  who are suffering under torture and are the victims of the most savage and cruel treatment.235.	These barbaric acts have been intensified in recent times in the Central American area  despite the condemnation and opposition of countries that are highly respected in the continent. Such a situation is unjustifiable and effective collective action can no longer be postponed. The countries where those violations occur should not receive such military and financial assistance  as they have been receiving  from foreign Governments and from continental and extra continental sources.236.	The growing deterioration of the situation in parts of the Central American isthmus  the constant loss of valuable lives  the gross lack of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the state of collective unrest with the resultant exacerbation of chronic economic and social problems have motivated the Panamanian Government to offerâand I am honoured to repeat that offer hereâits capital city in which to hold a summit meeting of Central American leaders in order that means may be found to restore peace and tranquillity to the region and contribute to the development of a harmonious democratic process aimed at facilitating peaceful coexistence in those sister countries.237.	Faithful to its tradition of loyal support for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all  the Government of Panama has been developing a government programme aimed at satisfying the economic  social and cultural needs of all human beings on Panamanian soil.238.	The Panamanian Government  under the presidency of Mr. Aristides Royo  has continuously endeavoured to strengthen the democratic system of my country. This coming Sunday  28 September  elections will be held throughout the nation to expand the representative base of the legislative body and to include those sectors of our nation that wish to participate in legislative functions without distinction as to race  sex  ideology or religious creed.239.	During the first six months of 1984  when the statutory term of office of the current President will have elapsed  general elections will be held in Panama in order through a direct popular vote to elect a new President  for a six year term beginning on 11 October 1984. Thus will be reaffirmed the existence of democratic institutions in the Panamanian isthmus as a centre of harmony and promoter of the interests and aspirations of Latin America.240.	At the international as at the national level  Panama has followed that tradition and it may be recalled that  after the establishment of the United Nations  it was my country which submitted the first draft Universal Declaration of Human Rights as well as the declaration of rights and duties of States.241.	Panama has also signed and ratified the two International Covenants on Human Rights  namely  the International Covenant on Economic  Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and Optional Protocol thereto as well as the American Convention on Human Rights which established the Inter American Court of Human Rights  the binding jurisdiction of which is recognized by the Panamanian Government.242.	With its historical  moral and legal authority as repository of the ideals of the liberators of America  expressed at the Amphictyonic Congress convened by Bolivar in the city of Panama in 1826  the Government of Panama  while cultivating fraternal relations with each and every people and Government of Latin America  without exception  has also used those relations as an instrument for the defence and promotion of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms  wherever those have been affected in certain countries of our hemisphere.243.	Innumerable steps have been taken by President Royo  as constitutional leader  and by General Torrijos  as head of our armed forces  to obtain freedom  grant asylum and restore violated rights to sister States in which political upheavals or problems of public order have brought about distressing conditions for human beings whose dignity and integrity deserved protection  if only for reasons of simple human solidarity.244.	The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Panama believes that the United Nations system as well as the regional organizations should develop more vigorous and specific action to meet the problems of violations of human rights  not only because such action would be in keeping with the spirit of the Charter but also because to the extent that respect for and exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms increase  so will diminish acts of violence  terrorism and insurgency  acts which are the sole recourse of peoples whose horizons are devoid of hope and who are denied access to a worthy and decent life.245.	In its foreign policy the Republic of Panama advocates the extension of detente to all regions of the world so that the nuclear menace  the arms race and conflicts likely to ignite a global conflagration might be avoided. That is a task to which all countries are committed. The responsibility of Latin American nations in that regard was embodied in the Declaration of Ayacucho of 1974. 246.	In spite of the statements frequently made in favour of disarmament  in order that the savings realized thereby might be devoted to the solution of the acute economic and social problems of certain sectors of Latin American society  it is not at all encouraging to note the enormous sums which the armies of certain Latin American nations invest in weapons and sophisticated military hardware  which far exceed the reasonable requirements for defence and the maintenance of domestic public order in each country.247.	As President Aristides Royo stated in announcing Panama's accession to the Charter of Conduct of Riobamba  the founding fathers of the Latin American Republics would be deeply discouraged were they to see that after one and a half centuries of independence the problems of poverty  disease  malnutrition  ignorance  and social and economic needâproblems which they had attempted to eradicate in liberating our peoplesâwere still rampant in broad sectors of the population of the continent.248.	in bitter contradiction of the ideals of peace  progress  unity and integration of our peoples advocated by the liberators of America  militarist circles  divorced from the needs of the people  sacrifice the wellbeing of those people  motivated by the futile accumulation of stockpiles which are not simply defensive but also offensive  with motives which are not in keeping with the solution of the vital problems pending at the Latin American level.249.	As a nonaligned country  Panama maintains its faithful adherence to the commitment of the movement to fight until a world based on justice and freedom has been attained and an international political and economic order established in which peace  independence  equality and cooperation prevail in the face of all the obstacles and forces which tend to maintain old forms or to impose new forms of inequality and domination  and which have created difficulties in the establishment of the new international economic order.250.	Panama believes in a nonaligned movement born from the emancipating struggle of the peoples of Africa  Asia  Latin America and other regions of the world. Like Panama  those peoples have chosen the path of independent political development and like us they reject polarization into blocs  bloc politics  pacts or military alliances and policies aimed at dividing the world into spheres of influence.251.	In keeping with that nonaligned policy  the Government of Panama reaffirms its adherence to the statements made at the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Nonaligned Countries  held at Havana  concerning rejection of foreign military bases in Latin America. Panama likewise reiterates its support for the right to self-determination of the peoples of Puerto Rico and Belize  for the right of the Republic of Argentina to have the Malvinas Islands restored to its sovereignty  for the return of the Guantanamo base to Cuba  for the demand that the blockade imposed on the Cuban revolution by the United States be ended promptly  for the importance of continuing to lend political and economic support to the Government of National Reconstruction of the Republic of Nicaragua and for urgent action to restore the constitutional democratic process in the Bolivian nation.252.	This is a good opportunity to reiterate the solidarity of the Government of Panama with Spain's centuries old claim for the return of the Rock of Gibraltar  a colonial anachronism for which there can be no justification in modern times.253.	Just as Panama strongly demands universal respect for the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco)  the Panamanian Government believes that this Assembly should promote efforts to implement the Declaration on the Denuclearization of Africa   to realize the idea of the ""Establishment of a nuclear weapon free zone in the region of the Middle East""  to bring about the ""Establishment of a nuclear weapon free zone in South Asia"" and for the prompt implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace  so as to guarantee conditions of peace and security with the attendant elimination of military bases in that important region.254.	Members of the United Nations have agreed to accept and carry out the decisions of the Security Council in accordance with Article 25 of the Charter of the United Nations. The gravity of the present international situation demands  more than ever  strict compliance with that provision  which forms part of the basis of the international legal order. Circumstances and conflicts that prevail in the Middle East  Central Asia  the eastern MediterraneanâCyprus specificallyâin southern Africa and in other areas  would doubtless be resolved if there were due compliance with resolutions of the Security Council.255.	That is the criterion which guided the Government of Panama in proceeding without delay to close its embassy in Jerusalem and transfer it to Tel Aviv  pursuant to Security Council resolution 478 (1980) of 20 August 1980. My country remains convinced that  in order to achieve a just and lasting solution of the crisis in the Middle East  it is essential that there be recognition of  on the one hand  the legal status of the PLO as representative of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination and independence and  on the other  the right of Israel and of all States and peoples of the region to live in peace within secure and recognized borders256.	The Panamanian Government is pleased to note the official statement of Mr. Falilou Kane  Chairman of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People  on 29 August  expressing the deep satisfaction of the Committee at the decision of the Panamanian Government to close its embassy in Jerusalem. In that statement he also indicates that  in the Committee's view  Panama's action ""reflects the positive attitude of the Government of Panama concerning the question of Palestine and its concern over the feelings and the opinion of the vast majority of the international community"".257.	I believe it a duty of conscience to reiterate in this Assembly the confidence which my country  like many other medium sized and small nations  has in the Secretary General  to whom the cause of world peace and harmony owes so much. The fact that this thirty-fifth session is the first session of the 1980s leads us to serious thought. The Secretary Generalâs report on the work of the Organization acquires special importance at this time in history  since its analysis of the international situation is a challenge directed to the exercise of political will by the Member States with decision-making power in the Security Council  in this Assembly and in the other organs of the United Nations system.258.	In the Panamanian Government's view  the ominous picture presented to the international community in the secretary Generalâs report has extremely serious aspects. In his opinion  there is a climate of confusion in which the major objectives proclaimed in the Charter of San Francisco seem to have lost momentum or to have been obscured. In his view  a reliable system aimed at guaranteeing international peace and security has developed little further in practice thanâand these are his wordsâ""haphazard and last-minute resorts to the United Nations"" 259.	It is not  as he says  merely that disarmament may be more distant today than ever before. In our view  instead of disarmament  mankind is faced with a growing arms race whose cost this year will reach $500 billion annually. As a corollary  the world is today more than ever subject to the threat of nuclear destruction.260.	We concur with the Secretary General and the Chairman of the Group of 77 that the new international economic order continues to be little more than an abstraction  while the economic prospects of the vast majority of countries and peoples continue to be affected by the general disorder and malaise. The Secretary General faithfully interprets international reality when he says that fundamental questions of human rights have been put aside or deadlocked for reasons of political and economic expediency.261.	We must accept the fact that development and the observance of international law and of a universally accepted international code of conduct have suffered a series of setbacks.262.	The Assembly cannot remain indifferent to the hostilities between Iran and Iraq  two Islamic nonaligned nations which are involved in a conflict in a region extremely sensitive for the peace of the world. Panama supports the offer to use his good offices made at the outset by the Secretary General in order to obtain a ceasefire and the cessation of military activities on both sides  so that the parties may agree to use the peaceful means embodied in the Charter for a friendly solution of their differences  which so affect the interests of the third world.263.	Panama also wishes to thank the Secretary General for his prompt and vigorous action in convening the Security Council so that  in the exercise of the powers entrusted to it by the Charter  it may adopt all necessary measures with a view to having the parties in conflict put an end to hostilities and restoring peace in the region.264.	The international community  shacked by the explosive situation that has arisen in the Persian Gulf  trusts that the States members of the Security Council will act in keeping with the ideals of the United Nations and that the two superpowers in particular and the countries whose oil supplies may be threatened will exercise restraint and refrain from any action not in compliance with the strictest neutrality and with the agreements for the restoration of peace that may be adopted within the United Nations system.265.	The warning sounded in the secretary Generalâs report calls for profound reflection  if reason is to prevail over folly  if prudence is to triumph over barbarous acts  if restraint is to win out over rashness and if justice and civilized order are to overcome inequality  abuse  discrimination  chaos and anarchy.266.	In essence  more consistent  concerted and vigorous action is required on the part of all Member States to resolve the grave institutional crisis affecting the United Nations today. Delegations participating in this session of the Assembly will agree with the delegation of Panama that the world is today witnessing  in both the economic and the political fields  a real crisis which  in the final analysis  is part and parcel of international relations. It is not a question of an imaginary crisis  or fanciful conjectures  or rhetoric. Facts speak for themselves. Although much more could be said  we can mention three very serious instances of what we term the institutional crisis of the international Organization with regard to the three main bodies of the United Nations.267.	South Africa's obstinacy and its failure to comply with Security Council resolutions relating to the independence of Namibia and the solution of the very serious problems in southern Africa highlight the lack of respect to which the main political organ of the world Organization is subjected.268.	Noncompliance by Iran with the judgment of the International Court of Justice of 24 May 1980 ordering the release of the American hostages kept in Teheran since November last year shows to the world Iran's disregard for the value of the decisions of the supreme legal body of the United Nations system.269.	The refusal of the Soviet Union to withdraw its military occupation forces from the territory of the nonaligned State of Afghanistan presents before the world the former's indifference towards and lack of compliance with the resolutions of the General Assembly decreeing the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of those troops from that country.270.	If large and small States alike do not respect  give effect to or observe the resolutions of the Security Council  the supreme political body of the United Nations  the decisions of the International Court of Justice  the supreme legal body of the United Nations  or the resolutions of the General Assembly  the supreme legislative body of the United Nations  we wonder what future awaits mankind.271.	The international community is aware of the fact that the major political  economic and social changes and the scientific progress that have occurred in the world since the Charter was adopted have increased the importance of the principles of international law concerning friendly relations and cooperation among States and of the heed to apply them more effectively in the conduct of States at all levels.272.	Panama recognizes the importance of maintaining and strengthening international peace  on the basis of freedom  equality  justice and respect for fundamental human rights  and of promoting friendly relations between nations irrespective of differences between their political  economic and social systems or their degrees of development. We believe that the only way open to mankind  if it is to survive  is the strictest observance of those principles and of the Charter of the United Nations as the most exalted means for promoting the rule of law and justice among nations."
"108",5517,"PER",35,1980,"ï»¿117. Mr. President  I should like to express to you the sincere congratulations of the delegation of Peru on your election to preside over our work during the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. Your unanimous election represents a well-deserved tribute to you and to your qualities as an experienced international diplomatic; at the same time  it is a tribute to the people and Government of the Federal Republic of Germany  with which my country  Peru  maintains special bonds of friendship which I am very pleased to confirm today.118.	I also wish to express our appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Salim of the United Republic of Tanzania  who  in exercising his functions  again displayed his qualities as a diplomat and statesman which we all admire.119.	The delegation of Peru is pleased to greet and welcome two new States on their entry into the United Nations: the Republic of Zimbabwe  and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Their admission as Members brings our Organization closer to its aim of universality.120.	On 28 July last  the people of Peru elevated to the office of constitutional President of the Republic  with the highest number of votes ever recorded in the history of our country  the same Head of State whose term of office in government had been unlawfully interrupted 12 years earlier. The signal honour conferred on architect Fernando Beiaunde Terry acquires particular significance because it was the popular masses  both rural and urban  that a revolutionary process claimed to represent  which today contributed with renewed vigour to this overwhelming vote. Moreover  it was the armed forces that deposed President Beiaunde in 1968 and which now  on the basis of the sovereign mandate of the nation  handed over power in an act of unquestionable historical reparation to our Head of State.121.	The experience which Peru lived through during that time became a subject of examination and expectation throughout the world and is a lesson which should not go unnoticed in this universal forum. It proves that the desire to move forward in search of social justice  in countries such as ours  does not come from the imposition of ideological conceptions which claim arbitrarily to interpret collective anxieties and satisfy collective needs. It shows that  however good intentions may be  the will of the people must be ascertained directly. This has proved once again that  without freedom  control and preservation of the national interest are relaxed and the wellbeing of the vast majority becomes a mere dream. The struggle for justice and the quest for egalitarian values must go hand in hand with an affirmation of freedom and must be reconciled with the full enjoyment of human rights.122.	The far-reaching nature of the change of government in my country has been recognized by the international community  which was represented by important Heads of State and special missions. At this time  I should like again to express our appreciation to those countries which  by their presence  expressed their support and best wishes for the prosperity and progress of our people.123.	The exemplary elections  in which my country showed singular maturity  meant not only the triumph of Accion Popular  a political party which represents a renewed state of the collective consciousness of the Peruvian people; they also meant the affirmation of a hope. Hence the solemn commitment of the members of the constitutional Government to preserve freedom  respect human rights and build a genuinely just society.124.	We realize that in a country such as ours  divided socioeconomically into one sector belonging to the economic process and another very large sector outside that process  a sector deprived of access to the legitimate standards of wellbeing and whose income is below the subsistence level  the priority of the State must be directed  as we are now determined to ensure  towards laying down policies representing an equitable distribution of wealth. That means that we must devise an instrument for a development strategy that has profound social significance  one that will give the underprivileged peoples encouragement and support in effectively improving their standards of living.125.	An ancestral Peruvian tradition gives us very important assistance in the achievement of these objectives: I refer to voluntary labour  which President Beiaunde has called popular cooperation.126.	Much of the greatness of Peru is due to popular cooperation. Popular cooperation brought about Machu Picchu  and cathedrals were raised on the walls of Inca temples. Popular cooperation has meant that the peoples of the hillsides have built and continue to build schools  bridges and roads  thus offsetting by their efforts the forgetfulness of Governments. Therefore  and as proof of one of the ideological bases of the new regime  the hereditary civic force that naturally exists in the minds of our people is now being activated to offer communities a mechanism of their own for their development.127.	Popular cooperation  having become an institutionalized priority programme  because of its multiplying effect  constitutes the best response in countries such as ours to the challenge presented by limited financial resources and the magnitude of the demand for an infrastructure to achieve the social and economic integral rehabilitation of our nation.128.	While peoples such as that of Peru tenaciously affirm their democratic ideals  they also affirm their hope to live in a more just world. Peace and development are not and cannot be the privileges of minorities  but are rightsâor  to use an expression dear to the United Nations  they should be the common heritage of mankind.129.	I wished to bring these thoughts to the Assembly to emphasize the deep-rooted will of the new Government of Peru to build an integral democracy as an inspiration and as a way of life.130.	With the initiation of the present administration  the new political Constitution of the Republic has entered into force. It guarantees to all Peruvians enjoyment of all their rights and fundamental freedoms without discrimination for reasons of politics  creed  race or sex.131.	Along with the executive power emanating from the popular will  there has been established legislative power in which all national political tendencies are represented. Next November the country will freely elect local governments  thus fully consolidating the return to democracy in Peru.132.	It is clear that  after a lengthy attempt at authoritarian politics that failed to achieve the targets set because it did not take popular feelings into account  we Peruvians have chosen political development without tutelage. We are regaining our trust that that alternative is essential to sustained and effective economic growth and true democracy.133.	The foreign policy of the Government of President Belaunde Terry will be marked by respect for the legal norms that govern peaceful coexistence among nations. Full observance of the principle of non-intervention  respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity  self-determination and compliance with international treaties are the bases of all international legal order  to which Peru adheres.134.	While our foreign policy will seek to broaden Peru's ties so that interchange at various levels will be more universal and will offer reciprocal benefits  our priority will be to strengthen our links with the countries of the region by actively participating in the raising of Latin America's self-confidence as the best means of achieving its continuous progress.135.	The great importance we attach to the strengthening of our friendly relations with neighbouring countries will be reflected in our foreign policy  and here we are pleased to reiterate the permanent desire of Peru to have fraternal relations and to promote cooperation and joint respect for national sovereignty.136.	We consider integration to be a means of raising the quality of life of our people and affirming our independence. Accordingly  we wish to contribute to the improvement of the Andean Group so that it may comply more effectively with the deadlines and targets set for the progressive integration of participating nations and promote the joint development of Latin America.137.	At the recent meeting of the Heads of State of the Andean countries at Riobamba  Ecuador  it was possible to reaffirm the democratic will of the members of the Group and their firm intention to observe human rights  it being assumed that the principle of non-intervention cannot be separated from that of the self-determination of peoples.138.	In the certainty that integration constitutes the main task of Latin American solidarity  the countries of the Andean Group actively participated in the negotiations to establish the Latin American Integration Associations task that reaffirms the ancient desire of our peoples to become integrated within a vast joint plan in order to achieve the establishment of a common market.139.	We consider that the development of our continent must be focused from a global perspective  covering  in addition to this Andean effort  the basins of the Amazon and the Rio de la Plata and  in a parallel and progressive manner  the marginal jungle road  a continental colonizing plan that may become the backbone or linkage between those schemes.140.	The coming into being of the Latin American Economic System complements the affirmation of our regional personality and opens up new perspectives for the development of our own potential. We are certain that the presence of the Latin American Economic System as an observer at this session of the General Assembly will contribute to the strengthening of the role that Latin America now plays in the concert of nations.141.	Our efforts for the integration of Latin America must lead to the establishment of effective cooperation with all the other regions.142.	We reaffirm our solidarity of interests and aspirations with the peoples of the third world  which are equally committed to the hard task of economic and social development.143.	In his message to the nation on the inauguration of his Government  President Belaunde confirmed Peru's identity as a nonaligned country imbued with its original principles of independent choice in the power struggles of the great Powers. We believe that it is precisely nowâwhen certain aspects of international life that seemed to have been superseded are rising to the surface once againâthat it is the duty of nonalignment to contribute to the irrevocable aspirations to peace  justice and development.144.	At this time my Government wishes to pay a well-deserved tribute to President Tito  who inspired the nonaligned movement  who visited Peru during the previous Government of President Belaunde and whose absence is felt not only by his own people but also by all the countries of the third world which admired his adroit leadership.145.	Peru reiterates its intention to contribute to clarifying and solving international problems  the interrelationship and implications of which at the present time affect the universal community. The gravity of some of these problems arouses the concern of peoples. We realize that many international problems not only have not been solved but have in fact become more serious  while other equally critical ones have arisen. The international scene appears thus burdened with uncertainties and dangers.146.	Pressure against medium sized and small States persists. Various forms of coercion continue to be used as instruments of foreign policy. There are still serious obstacles to the decolonization process because some peoples are not yet able to exercise their right to self-determination  and discriminatory practices against social  religious and ethnic minorities are current in various regions.147.	Statements and promises notwithstanding  the arms race is accelerating in scope  speed and magnitude and is becoming increasingly difficult to endure and to understand. An excessive expenditure of billions of dollars  concentrated in a few countries  permits the continued expansion of the arms industry. This sum of money would be enough for an immediate solution of the most urgent problems of education  health and food which the developing world is suffering today.148.	Weapons are daily becoming more sophisticated  lethal and difficult to control. The threat of a nuclear war has not been dispelled and the deadlines for taking decisions to control these dangers are coming dramatically closer. Along with this  conventional armaments continue to grow impressively  weighing ominously on the economies of the developing countries which  by a notable paradox  contribute to the high cost of the research and development of these weapons.149.	In the Middle East  confrontation has not yet been overcome and concerted action for peace appears to have been postponed. In south-eastern Asia and central Asia  foreign troops continue to subjugate independent States. In Cyprus  in disregard of the decisions of this Assembly  foreign occupation continues. And in Namibia the colonizing Power resists accession by that Territory to independence.150.	We are likewise discouraged by the results of efforts to establish a new economic order in the world consonant with the desire finally to achieve a minimum level of justice compatible with the quality of human life. My country cannot understand how in the third millennium of our era we can continue on the same bases which today characterize the spectre of severe international economic crisis  which appears to be a reflection of the desire to maintain or expand political power or the domination of the few over the many.151.	The interdependence that is often referred to cannot be a type of relationship aimed at sustaining  on the one hand  the prosperity of the few and  on the other hand  the alienation and poverty of impressive majorities. Interdependence is a concept which requires a new type of economic relation  a more balanced one  which vigorously promotes development.152.	We believe that the recent failure of the eleventh special session of the General Assembly  devoted to economic questions  means that we are at a crossroads. Either we continue with this absence of communication and make a reality of the gloomy prospects which some have forecast for the year 2000 or we rid ourselves of prejudices and sterile dogmatism and face the joint task of building a new international economic structure.153.	It must be very clear that when we the developing countries make claims before the industrialized worldâ whatever might be the economic or political affiliation of its membersâit is not because we would threaten the stability of that world. We simply hope that they will realize the need for an equitable and concerted solution of the structural problems which afflict us.154.	It is evident that in the last decades the development of science and technology has reached unexpected levels. But this development should have purely positive implications. Nevertheless  it is noteworthy that in many areas  particularly in agriculture  education and health  scientific and technological achievements are at odds with the possibility of their universal application for the social good.155.	The population explosion and the shortage of food  the undue use and the depletion of non-renewable sources of energy and the break in ecological balances are problems which affect the future of mankind  problems on whose solution depends the very survival of the species.156.	If we bear in mind that we are now seeing a re-evaluation of ideologies which were previously considered to be rigid and inflexible and a review of political practices as part of an effort by all nations increasingly to adapt them to their own realities  we may well wonder whether the time has not conic to seek new and more imaginative premises for an effective solution to the questions put to us by the world of tomorrow.157.	Given this scenario of questions and uncertainties  we cannot fail to recognize certain facts which prove that  despite all the difficulties  the perseverance of the universal concerted will has produced some significant achievements.158.	The eradication of smallpox announced by WHO at the end of 1979 represents the first case in history in which a scourge of mankind  because of scientific and technological progress  has been eliminated from the face of the earth.159.	We have great hopes that the positive results achieved so far by the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea will come to fruition with the signing of a world convention which will establish a new legal order for the use and exploitation of seas and oceans. That convention  conceived as an instrument of justice  will promote cooperation and the development and welfare of all nations.160.	For us Peruvians  it is particularly gratifying to note that the international community has finally accepted the validity of the argument in favour of the 200 mile limit  which has been defended for more than 30 years by Peru and the South Pacific system  with the support of other countries of Latin America and of the third world. Acceptance of this concept and recognition of the seabed as the common heritage of mankind have constituted a contribution by the developing world to an enrichment of international law.161.	The search for new premises and solutions for the problems I have referred to will not be successful within a short time. Therefore we must continue to make use of the present forms of international coordination.162.	The constitutional Government of Peru respects the principles of the United Nations Charter and the United Nations resolutions. Our major efforts are directed towards full compliance with the Charter  and we shall continue to support any initiative to make more democratic and effective the various bodies constituting that great world body.163.	In this Assembly  the Disarmament Commission and the Committee on Disarmament  my country has contributed to dealing with the important subject of disarmament  and it participated in the Declaration of the 1980s as the Second Disarmament Decade.  We appeal to the great Powers to assist in bringing the negotiations to a satisfactory conclusion and thus to initiate within a short space of time an era of peace and cooperation on the basis of shared responsibility.164.	Peru considers that it is necessary to accelerate the nuclear disarmament negotiations among the great Powers and will continue to promote the already advanced efforts to establish the status of Latin America as a zone effectively free of nuclear weapons.165.	In accordance with the principles of international law and within the context of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations  we support the opening of a dialogue on an integral and lasting solution of the problems of the Middle East. Peru supports all efforts undertaken by the international community and this Assembly to bring about a resolution of those conflicts  with respect for the sovereign equality of all the States of that region  a guarantee of a secure life in peace and the recognition of the rights of the Palestinian people.166.	My country opposes policies of racial discrimination and the continuance of colonial and neo-colonial systems. As free men  we cannot accept the continued existence of shameful forms of social domination.167.	The Government of Peru ardently hopes that in Cyprus  central Asia and south-eastern Asia  where there are armed conflicts  these will be resolved by peaceful means and in a spirit of solidarity and mutual respect.168.	At this time  when my country is entering a stage in which the people determines its destiny  we reaffirm our conviction that the achievement of social justice is indissoluably linked to the exercise of political democracy and respect for human rights.169.	Vast  complex and urgent  as in any developing country  are the problems and tasks that my Government must face. We cannot expect to resolve them in a short time  because we are aware of our limitations  but with the people of Peru we are committed to building a future of prosperity and equality  and we know full well that  as has been recognized by the United Nations  the primary responsibility for development lies with us.170.	We are convinced that the objectives we pursue internally must be in harmony with external goals  because we are part of a diversified but interdependent world which requires genuine international cooperation.171.	Accordingly  my Government hopes that at its thirty fifth session the General Assembly will bring about effective progress towards the achievement of the goal  so often proclaimed  of a universal community and a full life  in peace and justice."
"109",5564,"PHL",35,1980,"ï»¿My delegation joins our colleagues in congratulating you  Sir  on your unanimous election as President of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. Your election is a tribute to your sterling personal qualities and an honour to your great country  whose role in the international community has been marked by vision  imagination and dynamism dedicated to the cause of peace in a difficult passage in the history of our time.186.	In its wise choice of Mr. von Wechmar  the United Nations has come full circle. A distinguished citizen of an ""enemy State"" has been elected to guide the deliberations of the Organization at a time when our overriding need is to moderate conflicts and shape the contours of reality in conformity with our desire for peace.187.	There is a trace of irony in this situation. For years my delegation has pleaded for the removal of all references to ""enemy States"" from the Charter of the United Nations. However noble the Charter isâand no one disputes thisâit is not without its flaws  and this is surely one of the most glaring. Today we are doubly happy. In an indirect way we feel vindicated in our quest  and we are certain that our new President will reflect those qualities which have made his nation one of the strongest pillars of the house of peace which we are all trying to build.188.	In this endeavour the outgoing President of the General Assembly  Mr. Salim  has made important contributions which we deeply acknowledge. To him we extend our sincere congratulations.189.	We welcome the admission of Zimbabwe and St. Vincent and the Grenadines to the world Organization and look forward to their constructive contributions.190.	In nature  nothing is more constant than the cycle of the seasons. In human affairs  the tides would seem to follow the same cyclical pattern. The brief springtime of detente is over and we face the bleak prospect of another freezing winter of a cold war far more terrifying in its implications for the future of mankind than any that has preceded it in the post-war world.191.	My delegation speaks before this Assembly without discouragement but with considerable apprehension. We live today in a continuum in which not one but several cold wars intersect  creating a labyrinth from which we are seemingly unable to extricate ourselves. Harsh facts confront us today  yet the irony is that in a hall intended precisely to harmonize diverse interests the atmosphere of uncertainty envelopes all of us  like a thick fog in which we are unable to find our bearings.192.	In the past year  several important questions have continued to be at the forefront of our most serious concerns. The first is the impasse on the issue of arms control  most notably in the limitation of nuclear weapons; in the failure to make progress on the mutual balanced reduction of forces; and in the additional complications on the question for the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. The second is the marked lack of momentum in getting the Third United Nations Development Decade under way. And finally there is our inability to provide solutions to brush fires  with their dangerous potential for igniting wars of worldwide proportions.193.	The history of man's efforts to disarm is a long and troubled one. The same history teaches us that when such efforts fail they inevitably lead to open and tragic conflict. But today's problem is of a different order. Never before have arms been developed in such quantity and with such destructive capability. Regardless of the ingenious and clever scenarios for surviving a nuclear holocaust  no one can dare to assert categorically that civilization itself would survive. No doubt our planet would still be here  but it would be there floating aimlessly in space like a dead star.194.	Fear is a poor counsellor  but it is just as often a natural alarm system. If we fail to heed this fear  then we may beâif we are not already in the midst of itâon the verge of a new and vastly more dangerous arms race on a blind course to global annihilation.195.	We are victim of our own folly. Man's genius  which has led him to attempt the conquest of space  is applied with equal fervour to self-immolation. The ever-increasing sophistication of high technology appears to dictate our policies rather than  as it should be  the other way around. Unless we can reverse this futile trend  we shall be creating our own doom. For this reason we look forward to the projected exchange of views between the superpowers with the prayerful hope that they can begin to chart new courses of action to avert the seemingly irresistible tide towards our common destruction.196.	There is no direct correspondence between arms control and detente; each is supportive of the other. Detente does lead to the development of trust and helps to improve the climate for the peaceful solution of problems. We wish to emphasize  however  that faithful observance of the tacit rules of detente is the first and indispensable requirement for its success. On that basis we would favour the resurrection of the experiment of learning to live together in relative peace.197.	Another requirement  equally indispensable  is that detente should apply on a universal scale. A detente which reduces tensions in one area of the world while creating or exploiting destabilization in other areas  particularly in weaker and more vulnerable countries in the third world  negates the very purposes of detente. Like peace  detente is indivisible.198.	The eleventh special session of the General Assembly  devoted to economic development  ended on a less than hopeful note. We view the results with extreme regret  for this surely is a problem which affects all countries  large and small. What we need is a crash programme of cooperation on some of the most pressing problems of our time. The painful prospect which faces all of us is that  under the best of circumstances  the growth rate of all countries will decrease in the coming decade in varying degrees. Renewed recession is predictable  and inflation continues to resist solution.199.	It requires little thought to remind us that the crushing burden will be borne mainly by the developing countries which  again in varying degrees  will have to cope with two of the great crises of our time  shortages in energy and food. As these crises grow  there remains the possibility that the debt explosion will reach unmanageable proportions  introducing instabilities which are bound to affect the developed countries as well. The spiral of uncertainty will turn relations between the developed and developing countries into mutually reinforcing difficulties; the problems of the South will become part and parcel of the problems of the North  just as today the problems of the North have become the problems of the South. The solutions to the problem  while admittedly not easy  are common tasks which require speedy implementation if we are to avert the dread possibility of disaster  not just for the South but also for the North.200.	After seven years of arduous negotiations  with a significantly successful session at Geneva last summer  the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea is close to the completion of a universal convention establishing a new regime for the seas and their resources  based on the principle of the ""common heritage of mankind"" conceived by the United Nations. The Third Conference successfully hurdled the difficult issue of the exploitation of the seabed  and only a few more related issues remain to be discussed at the next session. We strongly hope that the new convention will be signed next year and thus usher in a new regime of international law. My delegation echoes the thought of secretary General Waldheim when he described the Third Conference as a ""major achievement"" which provides incontrovertible proof that  where the political will exists  issues of a potentially confrontational character can be resolved peacefully and amicably.201.	The results of the 1980 session of the Special Committee on the Charter and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization  held at Manila in February this year  demonstrated a determination among Member States of the United Nations to achieve a better congruence between the United Nations system and the realities of the modern world. The Special Committee's work on the question of the peaceful settlement of disputes was particularly encouraging in its consideration of the draft Manila declaration on the peaceful settlement of international disputes. My delegation expresses the hope that an early agreement on the declaration will be reached  It is not an easy task to develop an equilibrium between continuity and change  and we must appreciate the importance of the Committee's efforts in carrying out its responsibilities. The Special Committee has reached a significant stage of its work and it deserves our encouragement and full support.202.	I turn now to specific issues.203.	On the question of Palestine  my delegation reiterates its support for the right of self-determination of the Palestinian peoples. In the case of Jerusalem  the unilateral act of annexation by Israel is unduly provocative and has rightly earned the censure of the Security Council by its resolution 478 (1980). In the long history of Arab Israeli conflict  the city of holy shrines has always been a bone of impassioned contention. The reasons are not far to seek. It is not a question of territorial aggrandizement; nor is it a narrow legal question. It is a question with heavy moral overtones just as important to more than half of mankind as they are to Israel. The city is encrusted with layer upon layer of sacred lore to which so many in nearly every corner of the world owe their deepest allegiance.204.	If any city is international in character  it is certainly Jerusalem. My delegation supports  just as it has in the past  the internationalization of the city. We call upon Israel  recognizing its deep devotion to its own historical past  to recognize in other peoples the same measure of devotion to their own past  which continues to the living present. We call upon Israel to return to the processes of negotiation and heed the repeated injunctions of the Security Council.205.	On Asia  my delegation wishes to express its deepest concern over the continued conflict in Afghanistan and in Kampuchea. Both arise from the same root cause: they constitute open and flagrant violations of the principle of non-interference and non-intervention in the internal affairs of other countries. In neither case can we condone this act of transgression against one of the most cherished principles of the Charter of the United Nations. Nor can we condone the violation of the right of peoples to determine for themselves the kind of government they want. In both cases  our expressed preference is for political solutions. No other course is acceptable. The longer the conflicts last  the greater the danger of involvement by other Powers  thus enlarging the threat to world peace and stability.206.	In concert with our fellow members in ASEAN  we have consistently held the view that the elements of a political solution to the Kampuchean question are contained in General Assembly resolution 34/22 on the subject  namely  the withdrawal of Vietnamese armed forces and the establishment of a neutral and nonaligned Kampuchea.207.	The urgent need for a political solution in Kampuchea is underlined by the act of aggression perpetrated by Viet Nam against Thailand on the very eve of the thirteenth ASEAN ministerial meeting at Kuala Lumpur on 25 and 26 June. By that single act Viet Nam betrayed the true extent of its ambitions and its total lack of respect for world opinion. We stand by our beleaguered colleague Thailand  and shall continue to give it our full political and moral support.208.	The grave situation in Kampuchea should not be allowed to deteriorate further. For this reason  the Philippines and its ASEAN partners urge the Assembly to consider on an urgent basis the convening of an international conference on the problem of Kampuchea.209.	Today  Viet Nam will once again make an effort to unseat the legitimate Government of Kampuchea from the United Nations and install in its place the alleged Government of Heng Samrin. But the Heng Samrin regime is not at Phnom Penh by divine right  nor is it there by political right. It sits in the Kampuchean capital by the grace of the weapons of its master and protector  without whom it is helpless and with whom it wields not an iota of power of its own. If we accept the Heng Samrin regime  then we reward the fruits of aggression. If we accept the Heng Samrin regime  then we legitimize and indeed invite interference in our own internal affairs. If we accept the Heng Samrin regime  then we tolerate the violation of the principle of self-determination.210.	More than two thirds of the Members of the United Nations are seated here today because we claimed for ourselves the right of self-determination. We owe it more than lip service; we owe it our most profound respect. For it is this sacred principle which gave birth to us as nations and as independent peoples.211.	Last year we rejected the credentials of the Heng Samrin regime. Let us do so again this year. I urge all those to whom the Charter is not a mere scrap of paper but the holy writ of our Organization to reject decisively the pretensions of the usurper of Phnom Penh. Nothing has happened since this time last year  when we rejected their credentials  to make their claim more valid than it is now. The resolution which this Assembly adopted last year to resolve this issue continues to be ignored. Until the parties concerned evince respect for the collective will of the community of nations  we have no choice but to continue to uphold the sovereignty and the sovereign rights of the legitimate regime  which have been violated by external force.212.	Let there be no mistake about our motives. We hold no brief for any particular regime  personality  or ideology in this matter. We are one with those who stand back in revulsion at the horrors perpetrated by the Pol Pot regime. But we also believe that we have no right  under present international law  to prescribe what regime should preside over the affairs of the Kampuchean people. That is for them to decide for themselves  freely and without external interference. They have not had that opportunity  which is their right.213.	Until they have had that opportunity  which is only possible if the United Nations resolution on Kampuchea is strictly implemented  we must stand fast on the principle which is vitally involved in this matter. That is the principle of the inviolability of the sovereignty of States  of their territorial integrity and their right of self-determination.214.	My delegation wishes to close this brief statement with a tribute to the secretary General. The United Nations is our common creation; it is what we want it to be. But the presiding genius who keeps his finger continuously on the pulse of the world situation is the secretary General. It is he who perseveres in mediating between the need to keep the principles of the Charter inviolate and the elements of instability inherent in a changing world.215.	Amidst the crosscurrents of the numerous conflicts which sorely beset the world  the secretary General remains above the battle. Yet it is his unseen hand that unselfishly guides us in defining problems and in this way assists in the search for solutions. He is a realist; he knows that there are no instant solutions. Yet he remains an idealist; he knows that the true foundation for peace is the development of a sense of human community.216.	In the effort to reconcile those two elements  he has kept the United Nations together. Indeed  he has done more. Misunderstood and sometimes reviled by the press  the world Organization has gained in strength and effectiveness under Mr. Waldheim. No one can do more; no one can be expected to do more. In this lies his real achievement."
"110",5624,"PNG",35,1980,"ï»¿I join the previous speakers in extending congratulations to you  Sir  on behalf of my delegation  on your unanimous election to the post of President of this session of the General Assembly. We are confident that  with your excellent record and vast experience  you will be able to provide the leadership  guidance and direction essential to the success of this session.44.	I also extend my delegation's congratulations and appreciation to your predecessor  Ambassador Salim Ahmed Salim of the United Republic of Tanzania  for the efficient manner in which he presided over the proceedings of the previous session.45.	This year two new States have been admitted to the international family of nations  namely  Zimbabwe and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. My delegation is pleased to welcome them into this family. We look forward to developing close and cooperative relations with them. We also welcome them as members of the Commonwealth of nations  of which Papua New Guinea is a member.46.	My Government is pleased to note that the new nation of Zimbabwe has embarked on its own road to destiny. Our experience has been that the early days of independence are as difficult as they are exciting. My delegation is pleased to note that the Government of Zimbabwe has  eagerly and efficiently  addressed itself to the task of providing a strong  progressive and stable Government in its pursuit of a better life for its people.47.	It is commendable and perhaps prophetic that Zimbabwe was born as the fruit of lengthy international negotiations. The accession to independence of Zimbabwe and its admission to the United Nations is a great achievement for the international community. Independence could not have come at a better time than on the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the United Nations Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. It is encouraging to note that  in these troubled times  peaceful negotiation has proved mightier than military action. Those who assisted and contributed to the achievement of Zimbabwe's independence deserve our high praise.48.	Closer to my own country are the two new independent island nations  namely Kiribati and Vanuatu  the latter formerly known as New Hebrides. Their peaceful transition to independence is both an achievement by  and a tribute to  the inhabitants and the administering Powers. We look forward to developing firmer and closer cooperative relations with them.49.	Our support for decolonization has been expressed many times here and elsewhere. We have stressed the right of dependent peoples to choose their own form of government and determine their own destiny. In the last three decades most of us have made that choice and taken up the challenge. It is our hope that in the next decade the remaining dependent Territories will make their choice and join us in this community of nations. Those Territories are not many  but the focus is definitely on them. Concern for such Territories will undoubtedly intensify. The United Nations has played a most fruitful and constructive role in this area. We see its continuing involvement as essential and valuable.50.	I am sure that the remaining colonial Powers are well aware of this. Awareness is one thing; but the crucial issue is to take positive and substantive steps towards decolonization. There are many avenues open. Some of them have been trodden by many of us. Some of us have had to struggle very hard to convince or even force the administering Powers to grant independence  whilst some of us did not have to strive so hard. Thus  the attitudes and policies of the remaining metropolitan Powers will largely influence the course taken by our dependent colleagues.51.	Papua New Guinea is particularly concerned with the remaining dependent peoples of the Pacific area. We note that some metropolitan Powers have taken positive steps to create a suitable climate in which a real choice can be made by South Pacific islanders. They have done so voluntarily. We are proud to call them friends. They have nothing to hide and nothing to lose. They can only gain the goodwill  gratitude and friendship of the peoples they administer. We salute and commend them  for they have a strong commitment to the principles of the United Nations Charter.52.	In the South Pacific the path to independence has been gained without acrimony. We would like to see that trend continue. Unfortunately  in Vanuatu an armed insurrection influenced by foreigners has clouded their excellent record. Nevertheless  the successful resolution of this issue through cooperative effort within the South Pacific community of nations demonstrates our commitment to regional solidarity and decolonization. Our hope is to see the remaining dependent Territories take their true place with us through peaceful means. We therefore call upon all remaining metropolitan Powers in the South Pacific to help to keep this record intact.53.	I shall now turn to disarmament and international security. My Government sees the question of disarmament to be of utmost importance to international peace and security. We strongly believe that lasting peace and security cannot be built on the accumulation of weapons. Genuine and lasting peace can be created only through the effective implementation of the security system outlined in the Charter of the United Nations.54.	General and complete disarmament under effective international control should be the principal objective for ensuring the survival of mankind and eliminating the danger of war  thus ensuring that war is no longer used as an instrument for settling disputes. It is our desire that the peoples of this world have peace and security  so that we can all concentrate our efforts on the development and improvement of the lives of our peoples. I am sure that we all desire peace and security. Unfortunately  greed and selfishness have made this wish only a dream.55.	The Disarmament Decade  introduced by resolution 2602 E (XXIV) of the General Assembly  came to a close at the end of 1979. My Government is disappointed that there was neither real progress made towards a reduction of arms nor any negotiations leading to a treaty on general and complete disarmament. Even the second Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons' ended without any agreement.56.	However  we note with some satisfaction the signing of the SALT II agreement. Disappointingly  the agreement has not been ratified. Nevertheless  we are hopeful that some international agreement such as the comprehensive test ban treaty will be negotiated and agreed to as soon as possible. In this connection  we welcome the General Assembly's decision to declare the 1980s as the Second Disarmament Decade and hope that something concrete will be achieved during this period.57.	My delegation is opposed to all forms of nuclear testing  atmospheric or otherwise. We are equally opposed to the dumping of nuclear wastes everywhere  in particular in the South Pacific region  where nuclear testing takes place. These tests and nuclear waste dumpings are endangering our environment and our lives. Our desire is to preserve our many beautiful islands for our future generations. We therefore once again call upon responsible Governments to cease all forms of nuclear testing and nuclear waste dumping in the Pacific. This is because we do not believe that the tests and low-level nuclear waste dumpings in the Pacific region are harmless. Indeed  the long-term effects could be catastrophic. As a demonstration of faith in their own technology  the nations responsible should carry out their nuclear tests and dumping of nuclear wastes within their immediate boundaries.58.	The thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly is meeting at a time of deteriorating stability in the Middle East. We are concerned about the war between Iraq and Iran. The untold misery brought to the innocent in the conflict must be viewed with grave concern. We are also concerned that  if the situation is not resolved quickly  there is a real possibility that the conflict will escalate  causing the oil supplies to be substantially cut with the danger of bringing about a worldwide economic recession. The third world will suffer greatly because of our great dependency on these oil supplies. We commend the untiring efforts of the Secretary General and the Islamic Conference in trying to have the parties stop the fighting and resolve their disputes by meaningful discussions.59.	My Government is troubled by the continuing failure to find a solution to the longstanding problems that exist between Israel and the Palestinian people. We are mindful of the right of all parties to the dispute to exist within recognized and secure boundaries. We believe that if there is to be peace then there must be respect by each for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the others. Unless positive measures are taken by all concerned  any attempt to restore peace will fail.60.	Moreover  my Government regrets the recent action taken by Israel in enacting legislation to change the character and status of Jerusalem. This is contrary to the spirit of the Camp David accords and the peace process. The legislation is a serious obstruction to achieving a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East.61.	Papua New Guinea is geographically far removed from events in the Middle East  but we do not think for a moment that we can divorce ourselves from the enormous problems that beset this region of the world. The dispute between the United States and Iran cannot be resolved if the Iranian Government continues to hold the American hostages. Obviously such action by Iran does not help to minimize the tension in the area. It aggravates it. Papua New Guinea notes that Iran  as a signatory to the Geneva Convention on diplomatic privileges and immunities  has by its seizure of the hostages flouted international law and the law of humanity. Already elsewhere we have seen a similar series of attacks on diplomatic missions. We fear more future violations by political extremists. Because of our fear and concerns  we will support any call by the United Nations and vigilant Governments to deter further violations of diplomatic missions. We support the previous calls for Iran to effect immediately the unconditional release of the American hostages.62.	Adding to the problems of the Middle East is the question of the invasion of Afghanistan by the Soviet troops. We call once again on the Soviet forces to withdraw without delay so that the people of Afghanistan can be free once again to determine the course of their future. Independence and basic democratic rights cannot be practised in circumstances of insecurity and foreign interference. The principle of territorial integrity must be respected.63.	I turn now to events in IndoChina and the question of IndoChinese refugees. My Government is concerned over the security implications along the Thai-Kampuchean border and the refugee problem. We are aware that the refugee problem is a complex one. There may not be any easy solution  but a solution can be found if all parties show a positive and political willingness to cooperate. Basically there are two refugee problem areas. First  its cause and  secondly  its results. The more crucial of the two is the cause. We should do our utmost to eradicate the cause. Once this is achieved  we believe the whole refugee problem will surely disappear..64.	The other concern is the results  that is  the flow of refugees from their homeland. It is our duty to find a solution. Several international conferences have sought means to end the flow of refugees. The ones my delegation endorses are General Assembly resolution 34/22  the Tokyo Economic Summit of industrial nations  held in June 1979  and the Geneva conference on the special problems of Indo Chinese refugees. We support the efforts made by the Secretary General to bring. Viet Nam and Thailand to the conference table to discuss their differences. We also support the calls for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Kampuchea and for the holding of a free and democratic general election under the supervision of the United Nations. We share the view of other countries that the donors of aid to Viet Nam should focus their efforts on the resettlement and rehabilitation of the IndoChinese refugees.65.	But we cannot treat these two areas as separate problems any more than a physician can treat the symptoms of a contagious disease without being seriously concerned about the eradication of the disease altogether. My country is worried that we may handle the results of the refugee problem too well. We may encourage some nations to use our refugee management programmes as a means for exporting elements of their societies viewed by authoritarian Governments as being  for one reason or another  undesirable. In brief  there is evidence that some Governments will use the United Nations refugee programmes as a means of dumping their unwanted citizens onto the already overburdened United Nations refugee facilities and onto the strained resources of those generous nations that open their borders and their hearts to these disinherited people.66.	We must devote as much of our limited resources to the solution of the cause of the refugee problem as we are applying to the results. We must find the basic causes of this inhumanity of man to man and root them out.67.	In addition to the regional problems to which I have just referred  there are some more general subjects of worldwide significance upon which I should like to touch. These include the subject of human rights.68.	My Government takes pleasure in noting the measures taken by States Members of this body to safeguard human rights. But there are still too many instances where some Governments continue to deny basic rights to their citizens. The denial of basic human rights on any groundsâracial  political  economic or any other arbitrary groundsâgives rise to injustices which my Government finds totally intolerable. My Government appeals to the international community to condemn those Governments which persist in violating basic human rights. We call on the Governments which violate such rights to take prompt and effective action to respect the dignity of their citizens as well as that of those citizens whose countries were taken by force.69.	My Government notes with regret that the racist regime of South Africa continues to suppress and exploit the black peoples of that country. It is obvious that the Government of South Africa considers black people to be inferior  that they should live less comfortably and be denied the wealth and privileges that have been earned more often than not through the sweat and toil of black South Africans.70.	The ghettos of Soweto are an affront to the dignity of man and an indictment of the callous  degrading and inhuman policies of the racist South African regime. I reiterate the fears my delegation expressed last year on the question of apartheid. Persistent failure to deal effectively with this abhorrent offence to mankind is likely to have an horrendous outcome for both the white and black populations of South Africa.71.	My delegation is disappointed that  despite many pleas  the South African Government remains steadfast in its determination that the black man will be prevented from seeking the freedom and fulfilment that is the right of every human being. Further  my delegation is concerned at the contradictory stance many Members of the United Nations have taken on this issue. On the one hand  some nations  both developed and developing  endorse the view that apartheid is barbaric and has no place in the world. Yet these same nations lend considerable support to the Government of South Africa through active trade relations. If the United Nations is seriously opposed to apartheid  it should take positive steps to bring maximum pressure to bear on the Government of South Africa to abolish apartheid. We believe properly enforced trade embargoes would eventually force South Africa to relent and to adopt a more humane attitude towards its black peoples.72.	Papua New Guinea compliments the Secretary General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  and the Council for Namibia on the role they are playing in seeking a solution to the Namibian problem. My Government learnt with contempt and indignation that the Government of South Africa's illegal administration in Namibia had installed a so-called Ministerial Council as the governing body of the territory of Namibia. This action by the racist Government of South Africa is in total defiance of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations. It is a further sign of South Africa's refusal to comply with the Security Council plan for free and fair elections  under United Nations supervision  to bring Namibia to genuine independence.73.	The international community today recognizes the need to move quickly towards a New International Economic Order  even though there exist differing views on major proposals that have been put forward. The Government of Papua New Guinea is deeply concerned at the slow progress being made.74.	The attempt to regulate world trade in primary commodities  the reform of the external framework for the industrialization of developing countries  the reform of the international monetary system and the strengthening of economic cooperation among developing countries are still outstanding issues. There are many reasons why they have not been resolved and I do not propose to go into them. But I should like to say that one of the main reasons has been the opposition from developed countries  with the result that conferences  such as the fifth session of UNCTAD  held at Manila in 1979  have repeatedly failed to achieve agreement on any one of the issues that I have mentioned.75.	If the international community has learned anything in recent years  it has surely been that the economic welfare of each sovereign nation depends on a network of interdependence. My Government is deeply concerned at the failure of the long-awaited world recovery to come about. We believe the current economic problems cannot be blamed on the management of individual national economies. The management of each economy is becoming dependent on the external environment. Recovery and development require enlightened attitudes of mutual appreciation of each other's needs  interests and problems. Without such an appreciation  the prospect that any dialogue between developed and developing countries will lead to constructive changes in the international economic order must be regarded as gloomy indeed.76.	A concrete example of international cooperation for development is the Lome Convention on trade and aid between the European Community and the African  Caribbean and Pacific countries.  The long negotiations on a successor agreement were finalized and signed on 31 October 1979.  It appears that the successor agreement will  in general  be similar to the previous one. However  the Lome II agreement contains a new mechanism which purports to assist mineral exporting countries. The Government of Papua New Guinea welcomes the conclusion of the Lome Convention. But we have reservations about the new mechanism in that it offers assistance only to countries which have suffered a reduction in their capacity to produce certain minerals and export them to the European Market. The assistance itself is restricted to project or programme aid confined to the mineral sector and designed to restore production or export capacity. There is no help for those countries  including my own  which have suffered a loss of Government revenue as a result of low export prices.77.	All developing countries are concerned that  in a harsh world  the poor countries are supposed to be grateful for what they are offered and should not expect to have a say in what the offer contains. Such a situation gives rise to extreme difficulties in the formulation of plans for development  as long as developing countries  to which category my country clearly belongs  are not given a greater say in deciding how they are to be helped. We will continue to face great difficulties in providing for the basic needs of our people. A classic example is the International Cocoa Agreement which was broken in March this year because consumer and producer could not come to an agreement on any acceptable price.78.	Despite the frustrating lack of progress that seems to characterize these negotiations  when they are viewed from the broader perspective of their entire span  it appears that some convergence of views has taken place. There is some evidence of agreement in specific areas and most certainly the negotiations should continue. They represent the greatest challenge and the best hope for a mutually constructive future for the fullest development of our nations.79.	I have highlighted some crucial issues that beset our times. Some of these issues have remained unresolved for some time. We should  nevertheless  be encouraged by the fact that they have not been long with us if we take the history of mankind into account. Most of our problems have arisen only in the last decade or so. A majority of them is brought upon us by ourselves  mostly as a result of our human weakness. The tendency to gain prestige and the desire to accumulate wealth for oneself seem to be the root cause of all our problems.80.	Despite these human frailties  it is worth noting that we do make a commendable attempt at resolving or soothing the effects of these problems. I refer in particular to the part played by the United Nations to bring about just and practicable solutions.81.	The United Nations is a world parliament to which the majority of our people belong. It has a vital role to play; it has done some good work for the world and has failed in some areas. It must not be allowed to become a stumbling block to the advancement of mankind. Let us make it work so as to produce good results for the present and future generations. We can only arrive at our goals if we are sensitive enough  if we are realistic and practical in our approach to the problems around us. Let us make a fresh start in order to build a better world for all mankind."
"111",5670,"POL",35,1980,"ï»¿Please accept our warm congratulations  Mr. President  on your election to the presidency of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. In sharing in the assurances of appreciation of your own merits  achievements and experience that have been addressed to you from this rostrum  I should like  as representative of Poland  to underscore your personal contribution to the preparation of the process of normalization and development of relations between the Polish People's Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. We join in the good wishes already expressed that  under your Presidency  the present session will bring about propitious and beneficial results.50.	We convey our feelings of high esteem and gratitude to Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim  the outgoing President of the General Assembly  who used all his talents  dedication and efficiency in guiding its work.51.	As always  we follow with appreciation the tireless and dedicated activity of the Secretary General of the Organization  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  and the efforts he makes with a view to solving complex international problems.52.	We are pleased to be able to welcome in our midst today the newly admitted State  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. May we also reiterate how much we rejoice at the birth of a newly independent State in Africa  Zimbabwe. Their accession to independence and unanimous admission to the Organization mark further progress in the great historic process of decolonization  of which Poland was and continues to be a consistent proponent. We wish the new States every success in building their respective statehoods and in their socioeconomic development.53.	Each year the interval between the sessions of this august forum brings new phenomena  new issues and new experiences in the life of individual nations and of the entire international community. We are meeting here  among the representatives of 154 States  in order to draw appropriate conclusions from them. These conclusions must first and foremost be consistent with the purposes which we have ourselves enshrined in the Charter of the United Nationsâ the maintenance of peace  the strengthening of international security and the establishment of conditions for the creative development of all nations.54.	The recent past has brought profound experiences to the people of Poland. We assess them in the context of our entire post-war development  in the perspective of the 35 years which have passed since the victory over Nazism  paid for dearly with irreplaceable lives  and since the emergence of the People's Republic of Poland. During that period  through a gigantic effort of our people  we have rebuilt our country from the ravages of war  entered the road towards the all-embracing progress of our homeland  ensured full employment for all our citizens and created universal and free access to education at all levels  to culture and to health care.55.	In the complex process of our socioeconomic development  we have not escaped difficulties  whether objective or subjective. We tackle and solve them with all openness and consideration  within the framework of what constitutes our nation's indisputable record of accomplishment  in accordance with our principles  our political system and the socialist rule of law  in the name of consolidating the unity of the people in the effort for the common good.56.	Our independent existence  sovereign development and lasting security are inseparably bound up with the strengthening of socialist Poland  which is linked through friendship and alliance with the Soviet Union and is a strong component of the community of socialist States. Precisely such a Poland  an important factor of stabilization and peace in Europe  will continue to be fully committed to its role of co-maker of permanent security on our continent and an active contributor to efforts towards peaceful and equitable cooperation throughout the world. Such a Poland is and will remain a consistent advocate of a broad dialogue and many-sided cooperation with States having different socio-political systems  on the basis of the record so far accomplished in this field  in keeping with the principles of peaceful coexistence.57.	We come to the present session faithful to the principles and purposes on which Poland's foreign policy has invariably been based throughout the entire post-war period. They include the struggle for the peace and security of the nations of Europe and of the world  the consolidation of detente and the development of comprehensive international cooperation.58.	We have been witnessing lately numerous threats and tensions in international relations. Their underlying causes are varied and complex. Together with our allies  we have been pointing out for yearsâand  last May  we most forcefully reaffirmed this in the declaration of States parties to the Warsaw Treaty âthat the main threat to peace and detente lies in the arms race  encouraged as it is by cold war circles and by military and industrial complexes  and in the attempts to revive a policy based on a position of strength.59.	The sources of evil include  moreover  all vestiges of colonialism and neo-colonial forms of domination and interference and the practice of apartheid and various forms of racism and racial discrimination  which continue to breed tensions not only on a regional but also on a global scale.60.	The economic difficulties  and the energy problems in particular  which the world is now experiencing  combined with policies of protectionism  differences in the level of economic development and mounting demographic problems  are further important indicators of the present state of the world.61.	Many statesmen believe that mankind has come to a crossroads. Our Polish experience of history and the vital interests of all nations generate a desire that the world follow a road based on peaceful coexistence  strengthening of mutual understanding and just  equitable cooperation and on the implementation of the noble  humanistic purposes of the Charter of the United Nations. It cannot  however  be based on the escalation of dangerous and costly armaments  the incitement of mutual distrust and the creation of ever new tensions.62.	We firmly believe that  despite pressures brought to bear by imperialism  the world will choose the road of peaceful development. We are fortified in this conviction by the positive experience and achievements of the years that have passed. For no sensible person can deny that the time which separates us from the most ferocious of wars  the time during which it proved possible to avert a global conflict  has brought much good to the nations of all continents. Indeed  would it have otherwise been possible to pursue the policy of active peaceful coexistence of States with different political systems and to continue detente and extensive cooperation between them? Would the social progress achieved in many States have been possible? Would the entire process of decolonization and of the economic development of many regions of the world have proved feasible?63.	The positive impact upon European relations of the process of constructive transformations between East and West  especially in the past decade  can hardly be denied. The signatories of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe can be credited with important accomplishments in peaceful cooperation.64.	Poland was one of the initiators of this process. We have been fully involved in the action to ensure its success. We know full well what a difficult task it was and how many obstacles had to be overcome on the road to detente. In this process there was and still is room for positive action by each and every State  irrespective of its socioeconomic system  size or potential. Poland  together with its allies  advances consistently towards the goal of building strong foundations of peace and security and establishing an infrastructure of all-round cooperation in Europe. We invariably favour the broadest possible dialogue with all States. Our contribution to European politics can be illustrated by the traditional relations between Poland and France  which might serve as a good example of relations between States with different political systems. Ten years ago we concluded a treaty with the Federal Republic of Germany on the basis of which we have developed the process of normalization of our mutual relations. Basing ourselves upon the historic Final Act of Helsinki  we have further developed the dialogue and cooperation with its signatoriesâall European States  the United States and Canada. We shall follow this course consistently.65.	Our concern for the fate of European detente and world peace and security has been reflected  in the present difficult period  in a number of initiatives and specific actions. Along with our allies  we have elaborated many constructive proposals with a view to easing and eliminating tensions in Europe and the world at large. At a time when the policy of detente was being threatened  we were among those who were doing their utmost to preserve contacts and dialogue in relations between East and West.66.	This year marks the tenth anniversary of the adoption by the General Assembly of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security. It provides a good opportunity to reflect on what we have attained and on what still remains to be done to give effect to its provisions. We can say with a full sense of responsibility: there is no such thing as a situation on which it is too complicated to take up or resume a dialogue  to seek constructive solutions  as long as all the parties are ready to demonstrate the indispensable political will  stemming from an understanding of the vital significance of the most important matters  namely  the maintenance of international peace and security and respect for the sovereign rights of nations.67.	In the struggle for peace  all rational  constructive initiatives count. We note with genuine satisfaction that  in response to tensions and threats  broadly representative social forces which come out in support of protecting and continuing detente and halting the arms race are becoming more active. This is  in fact  becoming a preoccupation of many people of great wisdom and goodwill. We highly value the words of Pope John Paul II on the supreme question of peace for mankind.68.	We consider the consolidation of detente and the prevention of a new escalation of the arms race to be most urgent at present. These two component questions are closely interlinked and mutually conditional. What is more  their successful resolution will determine the political situation throughout the world.69.	The state of relations between the Soviet Union and the United States remains of paramount importance. These relations  it is obvious  exert a decisive impact on the international atmosphere and on matters of the peace and security of nations in a global context.70.	A year ago  from this rostrum  the Polish delegationâlike  indeed  many other delegationsâexpressed optimism and hope  which we all shared at the time  in connexion with the signing of the Treaty on the Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms  SALT II. We trust that the Treaty  which serves not only the vital interests of the two Powers but the cause of world peace and security as well  will be ratified at the earliest possible time.71.	In December 1979  the Council of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] took a decision concerning deployment in Western Europe of new types of nuclear missile weapons. The decision  without any doubt  has become a factor hindering the process of detente  and not on a European scale alone. Dealing as it does a blow at the principle of equal security of the parties  it aimsâwhich is particularly dangerousâat the lowering of the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons. It carries a threat of inconceivable consequences for the nations of Europe and for world peace.72.	Poland  therefore  supports the constructive proposals of the Soviet Union to their full extent and declares itself in favour of negotiations on nuclear missile weapons in Europe. We welcome the announcement of a prompt commencement of such negotiations and hope for their success.73.	Seven years have passed since the initiation of the Vienna Talks on the Mutual Reduction of Forces  Armaments and Associated Measures in Central Europe. Poland is unceasingly interested in a prompt and meaningful breakthrough in these talks  so that they produce appropriate agreements. The latest proposals presented by States parties to the Warsaw Treaty constitute another significant step towards bringing the respective positions closer together.74.	Considering the realities of the situation now obtaining on the European continent  we believe there is urgent need to elaborate a satisfactory negotiating formula concerning military detente and disarmament. This  in our opinion  could be made possible by taking up and developing the idea of a conference on military detente and disarmament in Europe  which has been advanced by the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty. Such a conference should agree upon confidence-building measures and subsequently lead to a reduction of military confrontation and a limitation of military activities in that important part of the world which has the greatest accumulation of dangerous weapons.75.	In reiterating early this year the proposal to convene the conference  Poland offered to act as host to it in its capital. This would be an honour for our country  and Warsaw  we believe  would be a worthy and proper place to hold such an important international meeting.76.	Poland will seek a decision during the Madrid meeting which will make it possible to convene such a conference in the shortest possible time. Its deliberations would make a valuable contribution to the consolidation of a broad and positive process  combining political and military detente into one inseparable whole.77.	Disarmament issues  which are closely linked with the security of nations and with the conditions for their socioeconomic development  have been and continue to be the focus of attention of the States of the world. This was confirmed by the debates and results of the tenth special session of the General Assembly in 1978. I should like to express the conviction that the impulse which that session gave to disarmament negotiations will result shortly in the finalization of new disarmament agreements  including those concerning the prohibition of all nuclear weapon tests  the prohibition of chemical and radiological weapons and the prohibition of new types and new systems of weapons of mass destruction. Poland will continue to act with all determination in this direction.78.	In the present complex situation  it is important to initiate realistic steps with a view to reducing the danger of war. That is the idea behind the proposals submitted the other day by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  Andrei Gromyko [6th meeting]. They include most timely postulates concerning non-expansion of existing military political groupings and renunciation  as from 1 January 1981  of the expansion of armed forces and conventional armaments. Other important proposals made by the Soviet Union cover negotiations with a view to granting appropriate guarantees to non-nuclear weapon States as well as the prompt conclusion of an international treaty on the complete and general prohibition of nuclear weapon tests. In our opinion  giving effect to these proposals would considerably reduce the direct threats facing mankind today. They contain an initiative which  when taken up  would give a new  broader dimension to the struggle for a more secure world for us and for the generations to come.79.	We believe that  in view of the special significance of disarmament in the nuclear field  the strengthening of the regime of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons retains its lasting importance. In this context  it is worth stressing the validity of the idea of nuclear free zones in Europe also  and zones of peace in different regions of the world  for instance  in the region of the Indian Ocean  as well as the validity of the idea of strengthening security assurances to non-nuclear weapon States.80.	At the recently concluded Second Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  we paid special attention to measures aimed at the strengthening of the regime of non-proliferation  which would also be compatible with the interests of peaceful utilization of nuclear energy.81.	The concern for the future of the world and for the fate of nations makes it imperative to break out of the vicious circle of tensions and conflicts by seeking just and enduring solutions to acute political problems in different regions of the world. In reducing and extinguishing hotbeds of tension and conflict  we recognize an important component of the struggle for the strengthening of international security. To the best of our ability  we have taken and are still taking part in the efforts aimed at their solution pursued both within and outside the United Nations.82. We fully reaffirm our position concerning a comprehensive and just settlement of the situation in the Middle East  in which the key issue is the question of ensuring independent statehood for the Arab people of Palestine  in accordance with the postulates of the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]  a settlement that would bring lasting security to all States of the region.83.	It is imperative to ensure peaceful development  good neighbourly relations and cooperation for all nations of Southeast Asia. A good basis to achieve this has been provided by the proposals of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and of a number of other States. The acceptance of political realities  including the recognition of the People's Republic of Kampuchea and its Government and the termination of hegemonistic pressures against the States of IndoChina  constitute an important condition for a process of stabilization and cooperation in the region.84.	Realism  honesty  the right to progressive transformations and securityâthese are the guiding elements of our approach to the complex problems of Southwest Asia  including the situation concerning the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. We support the initiatives of the Government of Afghanistan towards solving the existing issues through mutual recognition  in the spirit of good neighbourliness and cooperation.85.	On the twentieth anniversary of the historic Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  we could not stress more emphatically the need for immediate and final eradication of the remnants of colonialism in southern Africa and of its particularly abhorrent form  apartheid. The elimination of the vestiges of colonialism and of all forms of neo-colonial dependence is also an essential prerequisite for ensuring world peace  justice and the security of nations.86.	Poland is in full solidarity with the peoples of Africa  Asia and Latin America fighting for their national and social liberation  the consolidation of their statehoods and their socioeconomic development. We feel close to the main themes and objectives formulated by them  inter alia  in the resolutions of the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-aligned Countries  held at Havana from 3 to 9 September 1979.  We highly appreciate the constructive role played by the nonaligned movement in international relations.87.	We view with understanding and sympathy the economic claims of the developing countries emanating from their long-term legitimate interests and objectives. At the recently concluded eleventh special session of the General Assembly  we presented Poland's position regarding these matters.  To the best of our ability  we shall act jointly in developing a new  just world economic order. Our position of principle has been repeatedly placed on record on various occasions  also in the course of formulating the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade.88.	We realize the significance of and support the concept of global negotiations on economic cooperation for development. We believe that these negotiations  conducted within the United Nations system  should aim at taking specific action  promoting development of international economic cooperation.89.	Poland is vitally interested in the expansion of comprehensive cooperation with the countries of Asia  Africa and Latin America. We are linked to many of them by intensive and mutually advantageous trade exchanges and industrial cooperation  as well as collaboration in the sphere of investments  science  technology  culture and training of personnel. We shall consistently strive to expand this cooperation in the spirit of the idea of partnership for development.90.	I have outlined in general terms Poland's position with respect to the key issues of the international situation as it obtains at present. I realize that I may have left out many important and crucial issues. They will be dealt with  though  by members of my delegation in other statements during the Assembly's current session.91.	The awareness that we have to live and act in a world full of complex problems and tensions should stimulate us to even more active endeavours. In the interest of world peace and in the interest of progress and mankind's development  the entire international community should concentrate on activities covering these fundamental objectives: we should strive  by way of concrete action  not only to maintain  but greatly to intensify the international dialogue on the basic issues of international security and cooperation; we should bring about  through a cooperative effort  the consolidation of the process of political detente and its extension into the military field; we should make a genuine breakthrough in the efforts to halt the arms race and proceed to real disarmament; we should demonstrate the maximum political goodwill and wisdom in action aimed at reducing tensions and strengthening peace and security in different regions of the world; last but not least  we should strive energetically to overcome the obstacles on the road towards the establishment of a new international economic order based upon the principles of justice and equality and enhancing the solution of difficult and complex problems of socioeconomic development.92.	Poland appreciates the important role which the United Nations can and should play in the strengthening of peace and security  in the development of friendly relations between nations and in the expansion of international cooperation. What counts is the fullest possible utilization of the possibilities offered by the constitution of the Organization; the Charter of the United Nations  in initiating actions of both global and complementary regional dimensions  for peace is an indispensable prerequisite for the successful solution of other pressing international problems  in particular for accelerating socioeconomic development.93.	In the course of the 35 years of existence of the Organization  the world has time and again lived through difficult moments. Thanks to joint efforts  we have managed so far to weather the crises. The United Nations has taken an active part in these efforts  becoming ever stronger and richer with new experience. Today  the Organization is faced with particularly important tasks. In declaring my country's readiness to cooperate  I wish to stress that Poland has followed  is following and will continue to follow a policy of respect for and realization of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. As a European State  it will at the same time strive for a full and integrated implementation of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. It is in this spirit that the Polish delegation intends to play a constructive part in the current session of the General Assembly and will do all it can to contribute to its successful work and fruitful results."
"112",5741,"PRT",35,1980,"ï»¿I should like to begin by extending to Mr. von Wechmar my warmest congratulations on his election as President of the thirty- fifth session of the General Assembly. It is with deep satisfaction and confidenceâinspired by his outstanding personal qualities and wide diplomatic experienceâthat we see presiding over this session the representative of the Federal Republic of Germany  a Western European country with which Portugal maintains the closest links of cooperation and friendship and with which Portugal is bound by culture  geography and history.76.	I should like also to express our admiration to his predecessor  Mr. Salim of the United Republic of Tanzania  with whose country we also maintain warm and friendly relations  for the most praiseworthy way in which during the course of the past year he presided with the greatest efficiency and distinction over four sessions of the General Assembly.77.	Finally  I wish to welcome the admission to the United Nations of its newest Member  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  whose Government and people we warmly congratulate. We hope that our delegations will soon establish a close relationship of fruitful co-operation.78.	Once more the General Assembly is meeting to debate and analyse the problems that beset the world and to attempt to find solutions enabling us to overcome the grave obstacles that lie in the path of peace and progress  to which we all aspire.79.	The seriousness of the questions facing us and of certain situations that endanger our collective security has already been stressed by the speakers who have preceded me. We share those concerns and we are aware of the responsibilities incumbent upon our Governments and of the difficult task facing the General Assembly.80.	It is  nevertheless  satisfying to begin by pointing out that during the course of this year some positive and indeed highly encouraging events have taken place. Foremost among them undoubtedly is the independence of Zimbabwe. I should like to pay a special tribute to all those who have contributed  through their efforts and perseverance  to the solution of a grave problem that had dragged on for nearly 20 years: to all the front-line States  particularly Mozambique  for the spirit of sacrifice and solidarity they have shown throughout; to the people of Zimbabwe and its leaders for the courage and tenacity with which they led the struggle for independence and for the outstanding civic maturity and patriotic spirit they have shown since peace was achieved; and  lastly  the United Kingdom for the deep sense of history which once again it demonstrated by initiating and carrying out successfully the Lancaster House talks. I would express the hope that  once the wounds of war have healed  the Government and people of Zimbabwe will succeed in their efforts towards national reconstruction and the building of an harmonious  non-discriminatory and tolerant society that will provide a prosperous future for its people.81.	I should like also to express my satisfaction at the successful completion of yet another important event: the ninth session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  at Geneva. Portugal  which had closely followed the lengthy negotiations at this Conference  hopes that the progress recently achieved in matters that we consider to be of primary importance  such as the delimitation of the exclusive economic zone  the protection of living resources beyond the 200-mile limit  the regulation of scientific research and the protection of objects of archaeological and historical interest  will be appropriately reflected in the final text of the convention. The long-awaited adoption of the convention on the law of the sea will no doubt be one of the great achievements of the United Nations.82.	The almost universal character of the General Assembly constitutes undeniable proof that  despite all the divergent interests and at times the very hostility that separates the peoples of the world  we are all prepared to persevere along the path of dialogue. Indeed it is only fair to recognize that the institutionalization of the dialogue that the United Nations has made possible is certainly one of its most valuable contributions to the cause of peace. However  the preservation and continuation of that dialogue demands of all Governments an unfailing respect for the rules and principles on which international relations and co-operation among States are based.83.	What do we see in the world today? We see States Members of the United Nations ignoring or flouting international law and the very principles of the Charter; some  invoking the most questionable pretexts  intervene blatantly in the internal affairs of others  violating their sovereignty and territorial integrity. We see other States refusing to co-operate with the Organization and ignoring its recommendations and resolutions  including those that are binding under the Charter. Finally  we see yet others violating formally established principles  namely  those of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.84.	A State Member of the United Nation has for almost a year held diplomats of another country hostages  notwithstanding the injunctions of the Organisation and the decision of the International Court of Justice of 24 May I980 demanding that this situation be ended forthwith. Such an attitude  besides constituting a flagrant violation of international law and a grave offence against the human rights of the detainees  undermines the very basis of peaceful relations between States and threatens the very instrument that makes them possible  namely diplomacy. It is imperative for the leaders of Iran to understand that  in attempting to hurt a country against which they claim to hold grievances  they are  above all  jeopardizing Iran's own international image and the rules that govern the relations between States and  I dare say  even imperilling the weaker countries whose security rests mainly on the observance of international law.85.	On the other hand  some States  moved by clearly hegemonistic aims  do not hesitate to violate the frontiers of defenceless neighbours  to occupy their territory and to oppress their peoples by force of arms  in spite of repeated calls to withdraw by the international community. The Soviet aggression against Afghanistan has continued uninterruptedly for almost one year  although condemned by the vast majority of the international community.86.	That unlawful and appalling act of force is a serious breach of the principles of the Organization and undermines the whole process of detente which we have so painstakingly sought to carry out. 87.	Detente is in essence global and indivisible  as is in fact laid down in the Final Act of Helsinki: global  because the States participating in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe have the duty to respect its Final Act even in their relations with non-signatory States; indivisible  because  since detente is based on mutual trust  it is not possible to appear to adhere to it in some areas while violating it in others. Detente is indeed a dynamic process nurtured by the proper attitude of States and  for that reason  susceptible to both progress and retrogression.88.	In this respect  I would add that the position my country upholds isâand will continue to be during the second review session at Madrid of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europeâthat all the participating States should show their Government's sincere support for detente  not through mere declarations of intent  but through clear attitudes and concrete actions. For without a climate of mutual confidence  true detente will never be possible.89.	At this very moment  two brother countries  both non-aligned and sharing the same religion  Iran and Iraq  are fighting one another in an open war. Despite the efforts undertaken by the Islamic Conference  the Secretary- General  the Security Council and others  they have not yet laid down their arms to seek to resolve their differences through dialogue. The Portuguese Government appeals to those two countries to seek a negotiated solution to their conflict  which only increases the threat to security and peace that for so many years has been latent in the situation prevailing in the Middle East.90.	The General Assembly is aware of the position of my Government on the question of the Middle East. We believe that the problem in that region can be resolved only through a comprehensive solution that on the one hand respects the right of all States in the area to a secure existence and on the other hand guarantees the Palestinian people the right to self-determination.91.	As we have repeatedly stated  the foregoing implies that the parties concerned  in particular Israel and the PLO  should take steps that will make it possible at last to put an end to the mutual mistrust that at present impedes any progress towards peace.92.	The Palestinians and the other Arab peoples must accept the fact that the State of Israel is an unquestionable reality and that its legitimate aspirations to security must be recognized and met. Israel  for its part  must understand that its right to statehood cannot be founded on the denial of that same right to the Palestinian people. Nor does that right justify violation of the frontiers of other States  such as martyred Lebanon  or the unlawful occupation of foreign territory.93.	Like the problem of the Middle East  many other situations that are a cause of serious regional and international tension can be resolved only through an open and patient dialogue  established without pre-conditions and with the participation of all interested parties.94.	May I recall briefly some examples that are no doubt present in all our minds. The situation in Namibia is a problem whose solution we hope will be positively affected by the example of Zimbabwe. The Portuguese delegation understands and shares the concern of the international community  particularly that of the African countries  like Angola  over the obstacles that have thus far prevented the implementation of the United Nations plan to resolve that problem. We believe  however  that the long and continued negotiations initiated by the five Western countries  and arduously continued by the United Nations since  have created irreversible conditions that will shortly lead Namibia to the independence to which its people is entitled.95.	I also have in mind the intolerable practice of apartheid  which Portugal has condemned in the past and continues to condemn today. Here again  however unacceptable that practice may be  we face a problem that will be resolved only through a long process of transformation of South African society  a process that the international community should encourage and promote.96.	Let me also recall the question of the self- determination of Western Sahara  in respect of which there cannot be a just and lasting solution unless the legitimate interests and aspirations of all the parties involved are taken into account.97.	Although this last is a problem of a different character  I shall finally mention the question of Cyprus. In relation to that question  my delegation would like to take advantage of this opportunity to express its satisfaction at the resumption of intercommunal talks  an event brought about thanks to the unceasing and unremitting efforts of the Secretary- General.98.	Obviously  all those processes are of necessity slow and require patience  perseverance and clear thinking on the part of all the participants.99.	The foregoing also applies to the item on the agenda which most directly affects my countryâthat of East Timor  regarding which my Government issued a communique on September that clearly defines Portugal's position.100.	We have no claims on the Territory of East Timor  to which we continue to be linked by the ties of human solidarity existing between our peoples  which were forged through a long and today closed chapter of history  but which we believe have left a lasting and profound cultural legacy.101.	The question of East Timor is a sensitive one  as indicated by the attitude of the international community  which has insisted that it be solved in accordance with the principle of self-determination. Portugal cannot and does not wish to renege on its responsibilities towards the Timorese people; that is why it has announced a plan of action that will shortly be implemented. But we feel justified in emphasizing here that it is fundamentally within the framework of the United Nations that a solution to that problem must be found. In this respect  my country is also ready to co-operate closely with the United Nations and with all the interested parties in searching for a solution that  in conformity with the principles enshrined in the Charter and in the relevant resolutions  would be acceptable to the international community. Given their special urgency  we must finally express our concern with the humanitarian problems that have arisen out of the situation in East Timor. We hope that through the negotiations which we  for our part  are ready to undertake  those problems can begin to be properly tackled and finally solved.102.	I should now like to make a very brief comment on the question of disarmament. At the tenth special session the General Assembly recommended through consensus  in which my country participated  the priorities to be followed in the process of disarmament. We believe  however  that all relevant measures must respect the security of States in such a way that their safety will not be diminished and that they will continue to enjoy the same level of security. For that reason  the problems of disarmament must be considered from a global point of view in order to keep in mind  in so far as possible  the structural differences that exist primarily between the armed forces of the militarily most powerful States.103.	The promotion of universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms  without discrimination based on race  sex  language or religion  constitutes one of the most important aims of the international community. The Portuguese Government attaches the greatest importance to the furtherance of this objective  as was demonstrated by our adherence to the principal international instruments concerning human rights  as well as by the positions we have adopted in all forums where this matter has been discussed  in particular in the Commission on Human Rights  of which we are privileged to be a member.104.	Portugal will continue to devote itself to the defence of civil and political rights  which we identify with the highest principles and values of a civilization that should not  on the other hand  be oblivious of the economic  social and cultural rights which are inseparable aspects of the same reality. Unfortunately  there still exist many cases in which the human rights of whole populations are systematically ignored and denied  and peoples are condemned to the most implacable repression  to hunger or to forced exile  victims of supposedly liberating ideologies which end up creating the most inhuman oppression. This aberrant situation has resulted in the creation of an ever-growing flux of refugees that has become one of the most disturbing scourges of our timeâand this is true and especially obvious in South-East Asia  but also significant in other regions of the world.105.	We believe that it is wrong to ignore both the political origins of those exoduses and the disruptions and problems that they cause by endangering the prosperity of those who harbour the refugees. We cannot but stress that this is an unacceptable subversion of the international order  which if not corrected in the short term can pose a serious threat to peace.106.	However  other problems still lie on the horizon. Of those I have especially in mind the grave consequences for future generations of the very serious deprivation of food  health  housing  education and employment  which even today affects such large sectors of humanity. This is doubtless an area in which the work under way within the United Nations system can and must assume a true universal dimension. Only thus will it be possible to avoid results such as those arising from the recent eleventh special session of the General Assembly. On the one hand  we consider the adoption of the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade a very positive fact  but on the other we view with deep concern the failure to reach a consensus in regard to the global negotiations.107.	Allow me also to stress that the dichotomy to which the North-South dialogue is reducedâthat of the developed countries versus developing countriesâis not helpful to the resolution of the difficulties faced by the international com-munity and does not even correspond to the reality which confronts us. Just as there sometimes are substantial differences in the wealth and levels of economic and technological development of developed countries  not to mention the diversity of their economic and social systems  so there are also considerable distances separating the developing countries.108.	We believe that there would be much to gain if proper account were to be taken of the real conditions prevailing today. Such recognition would be most advantageous to all  for it would allow for a more equitable sharing of efforts by all and for a more adequate distribution of available resources. My country  which is at an intermediate stage of economic and technological development and which is simultaneously a recipient and a donor of assistance  feels this problem most acutely. We understand full well the demands of the developing countries because we face those very problems ourselves. But we are also aware of the difficulties arising from the present international economic crisis which prevent their full and immediate satisfaction.109.	Despite its own difficulties  Portugal has none the less assumed its responsibilities and sought to contribute to the extent of its ability to the common efforts to assist the most needy sectors of humanity.110.	My country has always held that only through constructive dialogue and co-operation in the search for common goals will it be possible to achieve victory in the battle for development. Our candidature to the European Community is based on our identification with the countries that comprise it  because we share their commitment to a free and democratic society. But we also see it as a way to cope with and overcome the problems of development that confront us.111.	This solidarity  rooted therefore  in political  cultural and geo-economic factors  does not  however  exclude other deep ties and affinities  such as  for example  those that bind us to the countries which have Portuguese as their officiallanguage and to other non-European nations with which we have created close links throughout our history as a maritime nation and in many of which there live large communities of Portuguese origin  of which my Government and my country are justifiably proud.112.	The most important role of the United Nations is to promote understanding among peoples and strengthen the solidarity that should unite us. In a world that has the capacity to destroy itself  that solidarity should take precedence over interests that are selfish and ephemeral when compared with the very survival of the human race. My country believes that if such is our common will we can overcome the difficulties faced by the international community. The main weapon that we possess to achieve this aim is the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes and conflicts through dialogue and conciliation. It is unfailing respect for that principle that has guided our conduct in the United Nations and inspired our work in the Security Council.113.	We firmly believe in the capacity of man to devise the means to free himself from all oppressions and alienations that hamper him. We believe that we can unite our efforts to overcome poverty  hunger  disease and war so that together we can tread the path of peace  progress  freedom and justice.114.	We believe  above all  that history moves inexorably towards the conquest of freedom and that the evolution of mankind will continue to be marked by progressive steps in the direction of the fin;'' liberation of individuals and societies."
"113",5787,"PRY",35,1980,"ï»¿On behalf of the delegation of Paraguay  I am pleased to welcome the new Member States of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Zimbabwe to our community of nations.205.	The long list of items on the agenda of the present session of the General Assembly contains a few of undoubted interest to my country  such as the United Nations Special Fund for Land-locked Developing Countries; the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea; the draft international convention against the recruitment  use  financing and training of mercenaries; the banning of nuclear weapons in Latin America and other continents  as well as related questions; development and international economic co-operation with all their implications; the draft articles on most-favoured-nation clauses and so on. The delegation of Paraguay will be setting forth its views on those and other questions. This should  of course  not be taken to imply a lack of interestâfor of course we are interested to some degreeâin all the other agenda items.206.	Having offered this brief clarification  in the interest of the brevity that should mark what is termed the general debate  I am pleased to make mention of the positive contribution of my country throughout the long period that has passed since Paraguay  with 49 other countries  signed the Charter in San Francisco. Since then  we have watched this Organization grow and our words have never strayed from the ideals which attended its birth.207.	We are a peace-loving people. In two world wars  we have defended our honour  our land and our rights with bravery.208.	Our country is no improvisation. Our international identity has deep roots in the history of America  and the name of my country is synonymous with firmness  decisiveness and crystal clarity in its dealings with other nations. We have a keen sense of friendship and co-operation  as well as an inflexible and inveterate instinct for independence and uprightness.209.	Thanks to those qualities of the Paraguayan people  the Government of President Stroessner has been able to give our country an unprecedented and unparalleled rate of growth in progress and prosperity  in a climate of peace  with guarantees for the essential rights of the human person. Paraguay  which is governed by a modern Constitution democratically adopted in 1967  enjoys the free interplay of political parties and  at the present time  boasts an annual growth rate of 10.5 per cent  the highest on the continent  and perhaps in the entire world; our foreign public debt situation is sound  our rate of exchange with the dollar having remained unchanged since 1960; we keep within our public budget in a satisfactory manner  and our unemployment rate is practically nil. Eighty percent of the population can read and write  and education and public health receive priority attention from the Government; indeed  sizeable portions of our budgets are allocated to those areas. The large projects in Itaipu and Yacyreta  the expenses for which we share with Brazil and Argentina respectively  will make Paraguay a leading producer of electric energy.210.	I take the liberty of providing the Assembly with this brief outline of the general situation in Paraguay today because it is essential that we all get to know one another at first hand and in a straightforward manner  especially those of us who do not utilize the secrets of mercenary propaganda and who do not have the economic or political power to stop that kind of propaganda. This is a universal forum where there must be not only a legitimate desire for peace but also an honest desire to speak the truth. We are a responsible  respectable country which has rightly earned its place in the civilized world.211.	Barely two weeks ago  the city of Asuncion  the capital of my country  was the scene of a barbarous act of terrorism in which General Anastasio Somoza Debayle  ex-President of the Republic of Nicaragua  was brutally assassinated.212.	That heinous murder  so alien to the peaceful life that the institutions of Paraguay have enjoyed for more than a quarter of a century  elicited vigorous repudiation  quite apart from the question of who were morally or materially responsible  and quite apart from their motives.213.	That infamous act of aggression had one novel feature typical of terrorism: the civilian population was placed on the brink of disaster of incalculable dimensions  for the savage and dastardly act was perpetrated in the full light of day  right in the middle of the city.214.	In 1947  international communism  in league with opponents of our regime who had become docile instruments  attempted to set up a Marxist regime in my country. This resulted in an armed clash that lasted nearly half a year  but was put down thanks to the indomitable will of the Republican National Association and the Colorado Party  which closed ranks with the loyal and uncontaminated army. In 1959 and 1960 armed gunmen  who had been clandestinely infiltrated from abroad  once again tried by force of arms to impose Marxist dogma on Paraguay. No holds were barred in the bloody fighting which ensued  which was marked by the ferocity of the attackers. But it was all to no avail  because not only was there no response from the rural population of my country  but  more importantly  the perpetrators were identified and severely punished by the very peasants whose lives and property had been so heedlessly assaulted. Thus this is not the first time that my country has been the victim of aggression.215.	On this last occasion the entire citizenry in a variety of ways condemned the crime perpetrated in Asuncion  and both Houses of the National Congress  in a genuine expression of the popular will  unanimously adopted pertinent legislative resolutions. The Chamber of Deputies expressed its ""firmest determination not to compromise or falter in the struggle to preserve the immutable principles of Western Christian civilization"". The Senate  for its part  after referring to the refugee status of the principal victim  declared that:""... from the material evidence and the data thus far collected  there is ample reason to conclude that the assassination was conceived and decided upon abroad; that it was executed by foreigners  with weapons brought in clandestinely for this purpose  and that their motives  which are foreign to our country  were at variance with its customs  its respect for human rights  and the democratic nature of its political struggles. Therefore  irrespective of the cause motivating the crime  this criminal act constitutes a barbaric act of aggression by international terrorism against Paraguay. It disrupted the public tranquillity in our country with unprecedented bloodshed and has sullied our image  although it is obvious that it was nothing other than an act of political spite and vengeance on the part of other countries"".216.	By way of additional information  I should like to bring to the attention of this Assembly the fact that the Government of Paraguay has decided to suspend diplomatic relations with the Nicaraguan Government of National Reconstruction.217.	This decision was based on a number of clues pointing to the participation of the Sandinista Movement of Nicaragua in the crime perpetrated on Paraguayan territory against the ex-President of Nicaragua.218.	There was also presumption and obvious bad faith in the remarks made by a member of that governing Junta  Rafael C6rdova Rivas  who  in a statement on 17 September 1980  made grave threats against the chief magistrate of the Republic of Paraguay  which was a provocation of the Paraguayan people that had elected him  in free elections and by an overwhelming majority  as their chief of State.219.	Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights says that ""Everyone has the right to life  liberty and security of person""  and article 14 says that ""Everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution""  while  under articles 10 and 11  only judicial action can impede that right; and article 30 says that no State  group or person has the right ""to engage in any activity or to perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms set forth herein"".220.	Consequently  with justified indignation  I wish  on behalf of my country and in the name of human rights  to express in this Assembly our most vigorous protest and repudiation of that terrorist act.221.	We must ask ourselves whether mankind  represented in this Assembly  has suicidal tendencies. A well- known military leader of the United States  Douglas MacArthur  once said that  in the final analysis  the reason for all failures is that one ""arrived too late"".222.	May time not work in favour of barbaric acts and may God kindle a ray of common sense and hope in our consciences. That is Paraguay's hope  so that the current session of the General Assembly  guided by the well-known diplomatic experience and personal qualities of its President  Mr. Rudiger von Wechmar  will become a landmark in the difficult task of maintaining international peace and security."
"114",5852,"QAT",35,1980,"ï»¿It gives me great pleasure at the outset to extend to Mr. von Wechmar  on behalf of the State of Qatar and on my own behalf  our warmest congratulations on his election as President of the thirty-fifth session. His ability and long experience in the work of the United Nations  as well as the high regard his country enjoys in the international arena  give us hope and  indeed  confidence that he will guide the work of this session with the wisdom and effectiveness demanded by the complex political and economic problems facing the United Nations at this significant juncture in its history.133.	I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to pay a special tribute to his predecessor  the President of the thirty-fourth session  Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim. He earned the admiration of all for the keen wisdom and outstanding skill with which he conducted the deliberations of the thirty- fourth session as well as of the three special sessions held this year. The characteristically competent way in which he performed his arduous duties must be a source of pride not only to his friendly country and the rising African continent  but to us all.134.	I take this opportunity to reaffirm our confidence in and appreciation of the Secretary-General of the United Nations for the great unceasing efforts  wisdom and broad knowledge he places at the service of peace and the just causes of peoples in dealing with the complex issues confronting our contemporary world.135.	I also seize this occasion to convey the greetings of the Government and people of Qatar to the Government and people of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines on its admission to the international family. We wish that country all progress and prosperity.136.	At the outset of this session's deliberations  it behoves us to review quickly what this international Organization has achieved  in order to realize  as an international community  where we have succeeded and where we have failed in dealing with the international problems that have confronted us. It is necessary to take stock of our successes and our failures in order to set ourselves on the right path and to discern the course that will lead to a better future.137.	It is a significant source of rejoicing and optimism that at this session it has been possible for the first time to remove from the agenda the item on Southern Rhodesia which had been discussed by the General Assembly for several years. Therefore  we are overjoyed to see among us now the delegation of independent Zimbabwe. Its independence is the culmination of the heroic struggle waged by its valiant people. The United Nations also can congratulate itself on this triumph. Zimbabwe's independence was a goal that the United Nations sought and played a role in achieving. This momentous historical event has  per se  other significant dimensions  for it has rekindled the hope of the oppressed peoples still striving for emancipation and independence. This event has given a new momentum to the march of peoples in quest of their right to freedom and independence.138.	While making this review  we cannot fail to note the outstanding achievements of the United Nations in the area of decolonization and the attainment of independence for peoples and in the other various economic  social and humanitarian activities of the United Nations.139.	It is most pertinent to stress the role the United Nations playsâwith limited success  sometimesâin containing and restraining regional conflicts and avoiding their turning into catastrophic world confrontations in an era dominated by the balance of nuclear terror. We must also express our gratification and optimism at the concrete progress achieved this year at the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  in particular since this progress was achieved after long years of hard work during which the Conference was sometimes the target of expressions of disappointment and criticism  and even bitter ridicule.140.	We would have preferred to confine this statement to achievements and gains. However  unfortunately  when we view reality we realize that the achievements are fewer and less significant than the setbacks. We even find that some contemporary world issues  far from being solved  have deteriorated and become much more complex.141.	The first and foremost task ^rusted by the Charter to the United Nations was the abolishment of a solid system for international peace and security. Today the world still lacks such a system. There arc numerous political and economic issues that still constitute threats to international peace and security. Some of them are potentially replete with the danger of horrible catastrophes that may engulf the whole globe.142.	The Government of the State of Qatar  as it follows the development of bloody hostilities between the two Islamic neighbours  Iraq and Iran  with profound concern and sorrow  hopes that wisdom will soon prevail. The voice of reason always prompts brothers to settle their disputes peacefully to avert bloodshed and to spare potential that should be used to consolidate the struggle of our Islamic nation in the face of aggression by the common enemy against our rights as Arabs and against our Islamic sanctities  so that we may prevent this conflict from being used as a pretext for foreign interventions. We should all work to prevent that. Therefore  we hope that the Government of Iran will follow the example of the Government of Iraq in responding to the efforts exerted by the Islamic Conference and the United Nations to secure a cease-fire as a preliminary step towards eliminating the reasons for dispute between those two Islamic countries in a peaceful way for their own good as well as for the good of the region  and even of the world as a whole.143.	The serious situation in the Middle East is the primary question  which  if it persists  may seriously endanger the entire world. The whole international community is called upon to exert serious genuine efforts to solve the Middle East crisis. A prerequisite for this solution is a proper viewing of the nature of this question. Ever since Arab Palestine was subjected to the Zionist invasion  the Arab Palestinian people has suffered the most hideous oppression  displacement  persecution and deprivation of political rights  not to speak of the most fundamental human rights. Yet  this valiant people rejected the conspiracy aimed at effacing and eliminating it. With unfailing patience and steadfastness  it has striven to preserve its identity  in the first place  and to attain its right to self- determination and independence in its own homeland  in the second place.144.	The aggressor has had recourse to all kinds of terrorist  brutal means to pursue its racist designs. It has displaced more Palestinians and used military force and terrorism to dominate the rest of the Palestinian homeland  and even other Arab lands neighbouring Palestine. It has colonized those territories and pursued an expansionist policy at the expense of the indigenous inhabitants of the region  in contravention of all international norms and agreements. The villainous attack that is being conducted today by the Zionist authorities inside and outside Palestine is proof of the terrorist  racist nature that has characterized Zionism since its inception.145.	Needless to say  the Zionist colonial authorities are engaged in a race against time to accelerate the implementation of their expansionist policy in the occupied territory  their expansionist racist designs having already been revealed to the whole world. The entire world is aware today of the extremist terrorist groups that engage  with the consent and encouragement of the Israeli authorities  in activities aimed at the perpetuation of an irrevocable fait accompli. This policy of fait accompli involves grave dangers  the ominous nature of which must be understood by the international community. The continuous Zionist aggression against Lebanese territory constitutes a flagrant violation of the Charter. The State of Qatar calls on the Security Council to take appropriate measures to end these acts of aggression and to preserve Lebanon's independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity.146.	The whole world has realized that the Palestinian question is the core of the Middle East conflict. Peace cannot be maintained in that sensitive area of the world without a just solution to that question  a solution based on the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination  independence and sovereignty  under the leadership of the PLO  the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.147.	The Secretary-General has declared in his report to this session on the work of the Organization that ""the Middle East situation continues to dominate the affairs of the international community and remains central to the political and economic stability of the world"". He has underlined the principles on which a solution should be basedâprinciples which are embodied in the numerous resolutions of the General Assembly  especially resolution 3236 (XXIX).148.	The main obstacle standing in the way of a solution to the Middle East crisis arises from Israel's indifference to General Assembly and Security Council resolutions. This intransigent Israeli position remains the major source of danger threatening the region. Moreover  it is a continuous threat to the very being of the United Nations itself. The Secretary-General has referred clearly to this aspect in his report  declaring:""It is rightly a matter of general concern that the decisions of the Security Council and the resolutions of the General Assembly often go unheeded  so that problems which should have been brought under control persist  proliferate and pose continual threats to international peace. This failure also has a debilitating effect on the United Nations itself.""149.	More than one Zionist leader has stated that United Nations resolutions are not worth the paper they are written on. Practical experience has shown that Israel and South Africa disregard this Organization and its resolutions.Israel's annexation of Jerusalem as its eternal capital  after having incorporated vast areas of the occupied West Bank in it  is flagrant defiance of the feelings of 700 million Moslems in the world  apart from being a villainous transgression against the rights of the Palestinian people  as well as the entire Arab nation. Furthermore  Zionist practices in the Holy City constitute a criminal transgression against the historical and cultural values inherent in the Holy City of Jerusalem  which are cherished both by the Islamic world and by the world as a whole. The State of Qatar affirms its insistence on adherence to the resolutions adopted by the ministerial meetings of the Organization of the Islamic Conference concerning Jerusalem at Islamabad  Amman and Fez.150.	We wish to thank the States that have implemented Security Council resolution 476 (1980) concerning Jerusalem by moving their embassies from occupied Jerusalem. At the same time  we call on the Security Council to take more stringent measures under the Charter if Israel persists in its intransigence and its refusal to abide by the resolutions on the Holy City.151.	The situation in Afghanistan represents another hotbed of tension that threatens international peace and security. Foreign troops are still entrenched on Afghan territory; the people of Afghanistan are still suffering foreign occupation. The relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the Islamic Conference held at Islamabad have not yet been implemented. I wish to reaffirm here the position of the Government of Qatar concerning this questionâa position which we stated in the General Assembly and at the Islamic Conference. We also wish to declare our adherence to the position of the Standing Committee of the Islamic Conference on Afghanistan that any political solution to the question of Afghanistan should be based on the aspirations of the Afghan people and on respect for its national independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity  under a leadership accepted by the Afghan people that pledges to pursue a policy of non-alignment and friendship with its neighbours.152.	The people of South Africa are still subjected to a policy of racial discrimination and apartheid which embodies violation of human rights and dignity. Instead of consenting to the call of the international community to abandon this criminal policy  the apartheid regime has perpetrated new crimes this year  thus demonstrating its tenacious clinging to that internationally rejected system. In view of this  we call on the United Nations and the international community to take all adequate measures to eliminate racial discrimination and apartheid.153.	We greet the people of Namibia and all the struggling peoples of southern Africa. We share their confidence that the victorious outcome of their just battle is imminent. We believe that Namibia's independence is but an historical inevitability. Any attempt to delay it will only lead to more bloodshed. Similarly  regardless of all delaying tactics and manoeuvres on the part of the racist regime in Africa  the march of history in that continent will not be stopped.154.	Despite the painstaking and serious efforts that have been made by the United Nations for general and complete disarmament  the most significant result of which was the disarmament strategy adopted at the tenth special session of the General Assembly  the world is still witnessing a feverish escalation of the arms race. The continuation of this trend increases the menace of a dreadful world nuclear disaster  and continually depletes the world's economic resources. While millions of human beings suffer from fatal famine  available statistics indicate that the world will spend nearly $500 billion this year on armaments.155.	The Government of Qatar joins the Governments of other States in calling for the channelling to economic development of the resources spent on the arms race. It appeals in particular to the two super-Powers to limit their huge military expenditures and report once more to negotiations to reach an agreement on arms limitation and subsequently halt and reverse the arms race.156.	This session bears the burden not only of the international problems handed down from previous regular sessions  but of new additional responsibilities left over by the eleventh special session  on international economic cooperation. The failure of that session to reach agreement concerning global negotiations is due to the fact that some developed industrial countries regard the establishment of the New International Economic Order as a process in which what one party gains  the other loses.157.	 The deterioration of the economic situation in the third world countries is illustrated by the aggravation of balance-of-payments deficits  economic inflation  rises in prices of processed goods  transnational corporations' control of raw materials produced by developing countries  the widening gap between rich and poor  and the failure of developed countries to pursue an effective energy conservation policy and to find suitable alternatives so that mankind may be able to make use of oilâit being the cheapest fuel available so farâfor the longest time possible. This deteriorating condition continues to threaten international peace and security. It is imperative that the international community  represented by this forum  address this problem with determination and genuine co-operation.158.	In conclusion  it should be stressed that this session's success or failure will be an important juncture in the history of the United Nations and in its role in solving international problems. Its success or failure will add new dimensions to the future of international relations. Genuine co-operation and the determination to succeed will surely lead to a fruitful outcome of this session  which assumes greater significance for all peoples as a result of the increasing instability that has afflicted the world."
"115",5898,"ROU",35,1980,"ï»¿It is a great pleasure for me to convey to you  Sir  our warmest congratulations on your election as President of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. I avail myself of this opportunity to stress the satisfaction of the Romanian Government at the development achieved during the last few years in relations between Romania and the country which you represent  the Federal Republic of Germany.95.	This session of the General Assembly is carrying out its work in the context of a particularly complex international situation. The Romanian Government considers that the threats to international peace and security and to the independence and free development of peoples  more than ever in the past  call for the United Nations and for all States  irrespective of their size  to take action in a spirit of high responsibility to settle  on just and equitable bases and in the interest of all peoples  the problems today confronting mankind.96.	The peoples of the world expect this session of the world forum to open new prospects for the prevention of growing international tension  for the resumption and continuation of the policy of detente  independence  peace and cooperation; for the complete elimination from international relations of the policy of force and threat of force; for the settlement  exclusively by peaceful means  of all disputes among States; for the cessation of the arms race and the urgent adoption of practical measures of disarmament  primarily nuclear disarmament; for the eradication of underdevelopment and the establishment of a new international economic order; for the democratization of international life in its entirety; and for the strengthening of the role of the United Nations and its contribution to the consolidation of peace and cooperation among nations.97.	Since the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly  particularly in the first part of this year  international life has been fraught with tension which has seriously endangered the policy of detente  peace and national independence. This situation  which is the result of the intensification of a policy of division and consolidation of zones of influence and spheres of domination  the sharpening of contradictions between States and groups of States  the acceleration of the arms race  and the deepening of the gap between the rich and poor countries. This situation has been aggravated by the deepening of the economic crisis and by the energy crisis  particularly as it affects oil  and by the delay in the settlement of situations of tensions and conflict  including existing hotbeds of war  because of the emergence of new confrontations.98.	At present  as a result of the peoples' struggle and the vigorous reaction of world public opinion and the progressive forces on all continents  we are witnessing some alleviation of tension. However  given the fact that the problems that have led to the aggravation of the international situation have not yet been settled  particularly great dangers continue to threaten the independence and freedom of peoples and the peace and security of all mankind.99.	Developments in world affairs have convincingly shown that international peace and cooperation depend essentially on respect for the right of each people to decide its own destiny  strict and consistent observance of the principles of independence  sovereignty  and equality of rights  non-interference in internal affairs and mutual advantage in relations among all States. Everyday life constantly offers fresh proof that the observance of those principles is the cornerstone of international peace and security and that the main cause of tension  conflict and upheavals around the world can in the main be traced to violations of those principles. Those situations are the result of the manifestations of the anachronistic imperialist policy of force and diktat  and interference in the internal affairs of other peoples.100.	As was recently pointed out by President Nicolae Ceausescu:""Romania has declared and declares itself firmly against the policy of tension and force. Our country strives for the settlement of matters in dispute by political negotiations only  on the basis of observance of each people's independence and of non-interference in internal affairs. We are convinced that the peoples  the progressive anti-imperialist forces  have the capacity to prevent the worsening of the international situation  to ensure the resumption of the policy of detente  peace and respect for national independence and to bring about conditions in which all peoples can focus their energies on economic and social development.""101.	In this spirit  the Socialist Republic of Romania and President Ceausescu carry out wide-ranging intensive activities on the international scene. Proceeding from the right and duty of each country  irrespective of its size  strength or social and economic system  to take part in the settlement of problems of concern to the international community as a whole  the President of Romania has maintained and maintains direct dialogue with a great number of heads of State or Government  and with political leaders in socialist  developing and developed countries. Romania's international activity has constantly been designed to foster the peaceful approach to problems confronting mankind and the achievement of solutions through negotiations in accordance with the interests of the freedom and independence of peoples  peace  security and cooperation among nations.102.	Romania is developing relations of friendship  solidarity and cooperation with all socialist States  strengthening the multisided cooperation with developing and nonaligned countries  extending its relations with all countries of the world  and taking an active part in the world exchange of values. Romania's international relations are part of the universal process of free and independent affirmation of nations  a contribution to the promotion of the policy of peace  detente  understanding and equal cooperation among all countries of the world.103.	The Romanian Government considers that the United Nations and all peoples in the world should firmly condemn any manifestation of the policy of force and of threat of force in international relations. History has shown that whatever was built on force  diktat and pressure of any kind finally crumbled under the vigorous blows of the just struggle of the peoples. Recourse to force and war in relations between States has never led to a settlement of the problem  but rather has brought about huge human and material losses  poisoned international relations  made the quest for solutions more difficult and generated a grave threat to peace in the respective areas and in the world as a whole. The way of force and military might is the main threat to peace and the freedom of peoples  and represents a dangerous anachronism of the contemporary world which must be completely eliminated from international life.104.	Serious and difficult as the problems between States may be  nothing can justify the avoidance or abandonment of political means of settlement; nothing can justify recourse to force or the threat of force. Reality is a forceful factual witness that  when the path of negotiations has been chosen  appropriate solutions have been found to the most thorny problems  or at least a diminution of tension has been achieved.105.	In this context  I should like to stress that last year  in requesting the inclusion in the agenda of the General Assembly of the item entitled the ""Settlement by peaceful means of disputes between States""   Romania proceeded from the need to make use of the possibilities provided by the United Nations and its Charter to act more effectively to prevent and settle conflicts between States on just and durable bases. The extensive debate on this item revealed wide adherence by States to this basic principle of the Charter  and a consensus on the importance of preparing a declaration of the General Assembly on the peaceful settlement of disputes between States was reached. We consider that such a declaration  as a first step towards the adoption of a world treaty embodying firm commitments in this field  would have a positive impact on world political life and would help to enhance international legality.106.	The setting up of a permanent commission of the General Assembly for good offices and conciliation  which would function in close connexion with the Security Council in order better to fulfil the responsibilities of the United Nations in the maintenance of international peace and security  would be a substantial contribution to the strengthening of the role of the United Nations in the peaceful settlement  and particularly in the prevention  of disputes between States.107.	As a representative of a European country  I should like to refer to the new prospects opened up by the Helsinki Conference and the Final Act adopted five years ago. Unfortunately  subsequent developments in Europe have not lived up to the expectations of peoples; in the past five years the arms race has continued and intensified  the accumulation of weapons of increasingly destructive capacity has continued without interruption  and foreign troops and military bases are still stationed on the territories of many States on the continent. Two opposing military blocs arc facing each other in Europe  which is indeed the main arena from which a new devastating world war could break out.108.	Romania  like other European States  has a vital interest in putting an end to the deployment on the continent of new medium range nuclear missiles. For this reason  we strongly support the opening of negotiations on this issue. We consider that the proposals put forward in this respect by the Soviet Union are good  and on that basis negotiations for the cessation of the deployment of new missiles could start. The Romanian Government also supports the earliest possible ratification of the SALT II Treaty.109.	Attaching great importance to the careful preparation and smooth functioning of the Madrid meeting  we are endeavouring to ensure that that meeting will give a new and strong impetus to the policy of detente and to the implementation in full of the documents signed at Helsinki  reaffirm the principles contained in the Final Act  agree on the convening of a European conference on the strengthening of trust and disarmament  adopt measures aimed at expanding cooperation in various fields such as energy  transport  the environment and industrial cooperation  as well as in the fields of cultural and artistic exchanges  and at the same time reach an agreement to ensure the continuity of meetings dealing with European security.110.	Romania is striving for the development of bilateral and multilateral cooperation among the Balkan States and for the transformation of the Balkans into a region of peace  good neighbourliness and confidence  into a zone free of nuclear weapons  as an integral part of the efforts devoted to detente and European security.111.	Allow me to express from this rostrum the deep concern of the Romanian Government and people at the dangerous situation caused by the continuation and intensification of the arms race  which has acquired huge dimensions and leads to greater and greater waste of financial  material and human resources and to a further increase of insecurity and the danger of war. In the circumstances  where so many grave problems still remain to be settled in order to ensure the economic and social progress of each country  the burden of armaments on all peoples has become unbearable. Such a situation cannot last any longer.112.	In the present international situation  the cessation of the increase in military expenditures and the adoption of firm measures to reduce military budgets  armaments and armed forces represent a task of the utmost urgency and importance. This would save each year resources amounting to dozens and dozens of billions of dollars which could be used for the economic and social development of each nation  particularly for achieving more rapid progress in the developing countries.113.	Romania  acting in accordance with its concerns and its stand on this matter  recently decidedâfor the third timeâto reduce its military expenditures for 1980 by 16 per cent and to devote the funds thus saved to the implementation of the programme designed to raise the living standards of the people.114.	The interests of peace and the progress of all peoples require that the military balance and the guaranteeing of the security of individual States be achieved not through the escalation of the arms race  the increase of the military expenditures and the accumulation of arms but  on the contrary  by reduction of military budgets  armed forces and armaments  by disarmament measures. It is necessary  more than ever  for the United Nations  for all the States of the world  to act with the utmost resolution to bring about a genuine process of disarmament and  first of all  nuclear disarmament. Everything must be done  before it is too late  to halt the arms race  to defend the fundamental rights of peoples to peace and disarmament.115.	The Romanian Government considers that the concluding of international agreements on the freezing and reduction of military expenditures would be an important step in that direction and therefore it has presented practical proposals to that end. Of great importance would be the achievement of international agreements under which States  particularly those heavily armed  would commit themselves  until new agreements on the freezing and reduction of military budgets had been concluded  to show self-restraint with regard to increases of military expenditures.116.	We regard as positive the fact that the Disarmament Commission at its last session began a more thorough examination of the problem of military budgets. Romania will at this session present a draft resolution. It is our hope that at the next stage the United Nations will embark upon the identification and drafting of principles which would govern the activities of States in the matter of the freezing and reduction of military budgets.117.	In the view of Romania  among the disarmament measures absolute priority must be given to the matter of nuclear disarmament. We are  obviously  aware that disarmament is a complex  long-term process. Therefore we believe that it would be particularly important to adopt partial measures  such as the abolition of foreign military bases  the withdrawal of all troops and armaments within national borders and the dissolution of military blocs. Such measures would strengthen confidence among States and would open the way to general and complete disarmament.118.	In the opinion of the Romanian Government  the tenth special session  the first special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament  established a more democratic organizational framework for the consideration and solution of these problems. Certain positive results achieved in the work of the Committee on Disarmament at Geneva confirm this assessment. It is essential now to use this framework  and  first of all  the Committee on Disarmament  for the negotiation and adoption of practical measures of disarmament.119.	Taking into account developments in weaponry  which are increasingly dangerous to world peace  it is necessary to do everything to ensure that the preparation for the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament and the work done at that session will produce a radical improvement in the endeavours of the entire international community to achieve disarmament.120.	The conclusion  without the expected results  of the recent eleventh special session of the General Assembly on the new international economic order places before the international community  with even more acuity and urgency  one of the gravest problems of the contemporary worldânamely  the perpetuation of the condition of underdevelopment in which most of mankind live and the division of the world into rich and poor countries.121.	The existing and deepening gaps between the rich and poor countries are not unavoidable. The situation is perpetuated by the present structure and machinery of the world economy and by the maintenance of inequitable relations and a system of international economic relations in which the rich become increasingly richer and the poor increasingly poorer.122.	It is an undeniable fact that the developed countries have accumulated the riches they have today not only through their own efforts  but also through the exploitation over centuries of dozens and dozens of other peoples. Another fact  which cannot help but cause anxiety  is that the rich countries are not only opposed to radical changes that need to be made in the existing machinery for international cooperation  but they resort  on a large scale  to new and insidious forms of exploitation of the weaker countries and obstruct the access of those countries to the achievements of contemporary progress.123.	The persistence and deepening of the phenomenon of underdevelopment  the grave implications of the economic  energy and raw materials crises and of the monetary and financial crises  have very adverse effects on the economies of all countries and especially on those of the developing countries. Those factors undermine their programmes of national development  aggravate distrust and contradictions  conflict and tension  and represent a direct threat to international peace and security.124.	The liquidation of underdevelopment certainly implies above all the efforts of the developing countries themselves and broadening of cooperation among them  together with radical changes in current international economic relations and machinery which should ensure the development of relations based on equity and equality. The active participation of the rich countries in this process and the substantial support that those countries should give the developing countries are not questions of charity  but of justice and international morality  an imperative demand of progress in a world of increasing interdependency  an essential prerequisite of international economic and political stability.125.	Experience has clearly shown that the problems of underdevelopment  of the normal functioning and stability of the world economy  cannot be solved through superficial measures  but rather call for far-reaching changes  both in the economic structures and the international flows and machinery and in the transfer of technology and the granting of technical assistance  and at the same time  in the mobilization  for development  of all material  financial and human resources. We should like to stress  in this respect also  Romania's proposal  made together with other States  that the savings effected through a 10 to 15 per cent reduction in military budgets be reallocated for the social and economic development of each country  and particularly of the developing countries. That is why it is so urgent  in this area as well  to proceed from words to deeds  to effective measures of real significance in the field of disarmament.126.	Romania  together with the other States members of the Group of 77  submitted at the eleventh special session considerations and proposals stressing the urgent need to embark purposefully on the negotiation of practical measures  in accordance with the requirements of the new international economic order.127.	The Romanian Government considers that the basic objective of the present session remains the launching in 1981 of comprehensive negotiations and the concentration of efforts on reaching integrated and worldwide solutions within the framework of the United Nations and  with the participation of all Member States. These solutions should provide answers to the urgent problems and  at the same time  respond to the long-term interests of the progress of the developing countries and of a healthy and stable expansion of the world economy as a whole. In order to prevent grave implications both for the developing and the developed countries  and for international economic and political life  it is imperative to carry through rapid and resolute actions to deal with the problems of energy  external debt  access to financial markets  reform of the international monetary system and the campaign against protectionism  in order to establish a new international division of labour and new economic relations.128.	It is necessary to understand that stability and lasting peace in the world  the independent affirmation of peoples  require the elimination of the serious anomaly of underdevelopment which keeps the majority of the world's population in a state of poverty  hunger and backwardness.129.	Romania  like other States  is deeply concerned by the maintenance and worsening of tension and conflict and by the emergence of hotbeds of war and armed confrontations in different parts of the world  since they endanger international peace and security.130.	We should like to reaffirm Romania's unshakeable view that all States should direct and intensify their efforts  and do their utmost to bring about  as quickly as possible  settlement of disputes between States by political means only  through negotiations  completely avoiding armed confrontation and the use of force.131.	In this spirit  Romania has constantly declared itself  and does so again  in favour of a political settlement of the problems of the Middle East and of a comprehensive  just and lasting peace in that part of the world. That would require Israel's withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied in 1967  including Arab Jerusalem  settlement of the question of the Palestinian people on the basis of their right to self-determination  the establishment of a national independent State  and a guarantee of the independence and territorial integrity of all States in the area. We consider it necessary that  after wide consultations  an initiative be taken leading to the creation of a new framework  a new basis for negotiations  in the form of a conference under the auspices  and with the active participation of  the United Nations. Such a conference should provide for the participation of all parties concerned  including the PLO  as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  the USSR and the United States  as well as other States that can make a positive contribution to the efforts directed towards a peaceful comprehensive settlement of the Middle East situation.132.	Romania stands for a political settlement of the situation in Afghanistan  leading to the cessation of all external assistance to the antigovernmental forces and  at the same time  to the withdrawal of Soviet military units from that country. It stands for respect of the independence and sovereignty of Afghanistan  for the respect of the right of the Afghan people freely to decide their own development  in accordance with their own national will and interests. We want to see direct negotiations started between the Afghan Government and the Governments of neighbouring States  which should lead to the settlement of the problems  to the normalization of the situation in the area and to the development of good neighbourly relations among all States in that region of the world.133.	We are also in favour of a political solution to the question of Cyprus by negotiations between the two communities  which should ensure the independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity  unity and nonalignment of the Republic of Cyprus  cooperation and the peaceful coexistence of the two Cypriot communities.134.	We wish to reaffirm  on this occasion too  our full solidarity with the just struggle of the Korean people to fulfil their national idealâthe independent  peaceful and democratic reunification of the country by the Koreans themselvesâon the basis of the constructive proposals put forward by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and of the provisions of resolution 3390 (XXX) adopted by the General Assembly on 18 November 1975.135.	One imperative of our times is the complete eradication of the vestiges of colonialism  of the policy of racial discrimination and apartheid. We welcomed with satisfaction the proclamation of the new State of Zimbabwe and its admission into the great family of the United Nations and  under the new conditions  we wish to develop further the relations of friendship and solidarity already established between the Romanian people and the Zimbabwean people during the long struggle of the latter against colonial domination and to achieve independence. We give our full support to the struggle of the Namibian people  led by the South West Africa People's Organization  for the earliest possible achievement of its full national independence.136.	We support and feel full solidarity with the peoples of southern Africa in the struggle they are waging to put an end to the policy of apartheid and all racial discrimination  and to stop the acts of aggression being committed by the South African regime against neighbouring independent countries. We consider that the United Nations and all the States Members of the Organization should do their utmost to put an end to manifestations of colonialism and to any policy of oppression of a people by another people and to bring about the complete liquidation of imperialist  colonialist and neo colonialist policies throughout our planet.137.	For some time problems connected with the free and full development of the human personality have held the attention of the international community.138.	The Romanian delegation believes that debates on human rights should place a particular emphasis on the fundamental right of people and nations to life  peace and a free and independent existence  which are supreme values to which all nations aspire and on whose fulfilment depend respect for and the exercise of all the other fundamental human rights and freedoms.139.	The Romanian delegation will support the further consideration by the General Assembly of the universal implementation of the right to education  since it is deeply convinced that the development of education and the training of national personnel  particularly in the developing countries  are primary requirements for ensuring the broad development of the human personality and for the overall progress of society.140.	With regard to the decision of the General Assembly on the designation of 1985 as International Youth Year  with the theme of participation  development and peace  we believe that it is necessary to make thorough preparations for this in order to encourage the intensification of United Nations activities for and concern with youth  which is an important social force for progress  democracy and peace.141.	The solution of the complex problems of our times requires the participation on a basis of equality of ail States  irrespective of size or social system  and especially that of the small and medium sized countries  the developing countries and the nonaligned countries  which constitute the great majority of our world.142.	It is necessary that the United Nations and other international organizations should play an increasingly active role in the democratic and equitable solution of the problems confronting mankind by promoting a policy of peace and detente and of respect for the national independence of all peoples. Romania is in favour of intensifying the efforts of the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization to identify new ways and practical measures to enable the United Nations to discharge its great responsibility for the defence of international peace and security and the development of cooperation among all States.143.	The Romanian delegation is participating in this session of the General Assembly in the conviction that  given the present international circumstances  the United Nations should involve itself more directly in the prevention and elimination of crises and conflicts and in the promotion of effective action capable of furthering understanding and peaceful cooperation among all countries.144.	I wish to express from this rostrum  on behalf of the Romanian Government  Romania's determination closely to cooperate with other States and peoples in the peaceful settlement  in the interest of all nations  of the great problems confronting mankind today  in ensuring the fulfilment of the aspirations of peoples to live in full freedom and independence  peace and security  and in the establishment of a better and more just world."
"116",5944,"RUS",35,1980,"ï»¿Mr. President  I should like to congratulate you on the occasion of your election to your highly responsible position and to express my conviction that your activities will contribute to the fruitful work of the present session of the General Assembly of the United Nations.93.	Speaking today from this rostrum  I should like to emphasize at the very outset the great importance which this session of the General Assembly would have if its work were successful. In view of the specific character of the situation in the world arena today  it is essential for the work of the session to be conducted in a constructive atmosphere. Its participants will have to display to an even greater extent than before a sense of realism  a considered approach to key international issues and a genuine interest in finding solutions to them.94.	Thereby the States Members of the United Nations would demonstrate their commitment to the principles and purposes of this world Organization and awareness of their responsibility for the destinies of peace. Indeed  this is now a vitally important task for them individually and collectively.95.	We focus attention on this because the state of affairs in the world has lately become more complicated as a result of a sharp turn in the policies of the United States of America and some other members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO].96.	Let us look at the factsâthey are more eloquent than words.97.	Back in May 1978  the NATO countries decided automatically to increase their annual military expenditures almost to the end of this century. Last December  they took a decision to produce and deploy in Western Europe new American medium range nuclear missile systems designed to change the military and strategic situation to the unilateral advantage of the NATO bloc. Simultaneously  Washington also announced its own multibillion dollar build-up programme.98.	The course chosen by the United States of America  which cannot be called anything but militaristic  is expressed in the so-called ""new nuclear strategy"". Under the cover of arguments that have nothing to do with reality concerning the possibility of some ""limited"" or ""partial"" use of nuclear weapons  the architects of this strategy seek to instil in the minds of people the idea of the admissibility and acceptability of a nuclear conflict. This foolhardy concept exacerbates the risk of a nuclear catastrophe  which cannot but cause concern throughout the world.99.	And is it not contrary to the expectations of the peoples of the world that Washington should have indefinitely postponed ratification of the Soviet American treaty on the limitation of strategic offensive arms  SALT II?  It has demonstrated that it sets a low value on the assurances and promises it gave earlier.100.	Several theses have recently been adopted by American foreign policy which  by all appearances  are regarded as its credo. Here is one of them. A given region of the world is chosen at willâespecially if it is rich in energy resources or important from the point of view of transport and communications  or simply if the Pentagon has taken a fancy to itâand that favoured area is declared with naked bluntness to be a United States ""sphere of vital interest"". And if  to boot  it is a sphere of American interests  not just anyone's  and on top of thatâGod only knows whyâof ""vital"" interests  efforts are made simply to deprive the peoples who live in that area of the right to be masters in their own home and masters of their own wealth. It is even harder to understand that at the end of the twentieth century generally recognized rules of international law hallowed by time should be so blatantly and so rapaciously flouted.101.	Another proposition is that any internal changes in any Stateâmerely because they are not to Washington's likingâare considered to be a good enough pretext for United States interference in the affairs of that State  including the dispatch there of armed forces and commandoes. It is precisely these functions that have been assigned to the rapid reaction corps. And it is surely those countries which cannot defend themselves that become the first victims.102.	And what about the treatment of Cuba? This is a striking example. Contrary to the legitimate demands of its Government and people  a part of Cuba's territory  Guantanamo  where a United States military base is located  is held by force. But at Washington they reason in the following way: we want this baseâso that is that. It is of no importance to them that the sovereign rights of Cuba and its people are thus flagrantly ignored  once American interests stand to gain.103.	And what a host of statements are made to justify such a policy. Those deal at length with human rights  the rights of States. It is simply amazing how such a policy can be combined with genuine respect for the rights of States  the rights of peoples  and human rights. If such statements are to be believedâand they are  incidentally  repeated with the importunity of commercial advertisingâthen all manuals and all books on international law  and indeed the United Nations Charter itself  which strictly protect the sovereignty of States  should all be discarded. But no verbal acrobatics  no diplomatic contrivances can conceal the real essence of such a policy.104.	The methods of pressure and blackmail in foreign policy are making themselves felt in various parts of the globe. Blatant violence is employed against Iran. Everybody knows this. United States actions in the Persian Gulf area threaten the sovereignty not only of that country but of other countries of the region as well.105.	A build-up of the United States military presence is under way in East Africa  where  most recently  new American military bases have been coming into being. This is taking place in particular in Somalia  a country whose leadership continues to make groundless territorial claims in respect of its neighbours. The Soviet Union fully supports those States which raise their voices in protest against the establishment of such bases. Surely  those who offer their homes for American military bases assist in the accumulation of inflammable material in that area  with all the ensuing dangers.106.	The anti-Arab Camp David deal has as its direct consequence unabated tension in the Middle East  where the situation is fraught with perilous and unforeseen developments  That should not be overlooked. That deal  which runs counter to the interests of and slights the just demands of Arab States and the inalienable rights of the Arab people of Palestine  whose only legitimate representative is the PLO  is intended to satisfy Israel's annexationist claims and to affirm an American military presence in the Middle East.107.	In short  since the time of the separatist collusion among the United States  Israel and Egypt  the situation in that region has proved to be further from genuine peace than ever before. It is for that reason that Camp David is rejected by Arab States and denounced by all those who are interested in a just and comprehensive settlement in the Middle East  not in a settlement dictated by imperialist interests. That has been graphically demonstrated by the recent resolutions of the seventh emergency special session of the General Assembly  on the Palestinian question  and by recent resolutions of the Security Council.108.	In another region  the Far East  Washington is striving to strengthen its political and military position and is heating up militarist trends that are far from being on the wane in certain quarters in Japan. Beijing is acting in unison. Yet one would think that the Japanese leadership would display the ability to see things as they are and succeed in resisting the outside influences prodding that country onto the road of hostility towards the Soviet Union  a road that has already led Japan to catastrophe.109.	The United States  whose troops  contrary to General Assembly resolution 3390 B (XXX)  still remain on the territory of the Republic of Korea  shares with the puppet Seoul regime the responsibility for the fact that the Korean problem is still unresolved. It obstructs the normalization of the situation on the Korean peninsula and the reunification of Korea on a peaceful and democratic basis without any outside interference  as is proposed by the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.110.	The United States adds to the destabilization of the situation in IndoChina and in the whole of South-East Asia. Here  too  the United States acts in league with the Beijing hegemonists who  having committed aggression against the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  continue their demonstrations of military force on the Sino-Vietnamese border and stage provocations against the People's Democratic Republic of Laos and the People's Republic of Kampuchea  whose voice  we are sure  will sooner or later be heard from this rostrum. Other countries of that region are also under constant pressure from Beijing and Washington.111.	In recent years  the United States and some other Western countries have resorted ever more frequently to playing the ""China card""âthey love itâin order to use to their own advantage the great Power ambitions of Beijing  which is itself keeping pace with the most zealous proponents of the position of strength policy and is stubbornly and cynically advocating the idea of the inevitability of another world warâwith never a thought of giving up this idea. I stress this idea of the inevitable nature of a new world war.112.	While these countries are intent on having China follow ever more closely in the wake of their policy  Beijing  for its part  in seeking a rapprochement with them  attempts to put them on the track of the cold war and confrontation with the Soviet Union  although our country  I would note here  stands for the normalization of relations with the People's Republic of China  as has been repeatedly stated at the most authoritative level. Even if we leave aside the question of who is playing whose cards more  it must be emphasized that this game is dangerous to the cause of peace.113.	The facts I have enumerated suffice to lead us to the conclusion that influential circles in some countries would like to squander away the substantial assets of the policy of detente that were accumulated  especially in the 1970s  as a result of prolonged and strenuous efforts by many States.114.	Not long ago  at Vienna  where the SALT II Treaty was signed  there was a frank conversation between Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev  General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and President of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR  and President Carter of the United States. The latter also recognized the need to maintain the existing approximate parity of military strength between East and West  the Soviet Union and the United States. This was recognized also by the leaders of other NATO countries. At present  contrary to their previous statements  the leaders of the NATO bloc are seeking to change the strategic balance of forces in the world in that bloc's favour. That is the root cause of the aggravation of the present international situation.115.	Attempts to give a different interpretation of world developments and to cast aspersions on the foreign policy of the USSR by once again resorting to the myth of a Soviet military threat constitute a gross deception.116.	Only the gullible could heed the groundless assertions to the effect that the aggravation of the world situation has been caused by the temporary introduction of a limited Soviet military contingent into Afghanistan. As has already been explained repeatedly  our move was made to assist the Afghan people in protecting their country's sovereignty and repelling armed incursions into its territory from the outside  as well as to prevent the emergence of a direct threat to the security of the USSR on its southern border. That assistance was rendered in response to repeated appeals by the Government of Afghanistan  and it is in full accord with the Soviet-Afghan Treaty of 1978 and the United Nations Charter. I believe that there still exist in the United States persons who signed the United Nations Charter  which contains a provision relevant to this. Now that the situation in Afghanistan is gradually returning to normal  some of our military units have been brought home by agreement with the Afghan Government.117.	Not infrequently  and notably at the United Nations  one may hear persons speak in favour of a complete withdrawal of the Soviet military contingent. To that we reply that the USSR will withdraw its contingent by agreement with the Government of Afghanistan as soon as the reasons that made the introduction of a contingent necessary have been removed  but not before.118.	It will be recalled that the Afghan Government has put forward a programme for a political settlement of the situation around Afghanistan. It is quite possible to achieve such a settlement on that basis and the Soviet Union is firmly in favour of that. But any attempts that run counter to the sovereign rights of Afghanistan are futile. The truth about the nature and essence of events in Afghanistan and around that nonaligned State is steadily gaining ground.119.	The allegation being bandied about in certain Western countries that the Soviet Union is building up its military might on a scale that exceeds its defence requirements is also patently false. There are some experts who make such claims. Our country believes that the strategic parity of forces obtaining in the world is sufficient to protect its own security and that of its allies and friends. Our country aspires to nothing more.120.	Let us take Central Europe  the area with the highest concentration of military forces confronting each other. There  the Soviet Union  unlike the NATO countries  has not for a long time now increased its forces by a single soldier  a single tank  a single aircraft. On the contrary  it has been reducing them.121.	As for the medium range nuclear systems deployed in the European part of the USSRâwe do not deploy them on the territories of other States at allâin terms of the number of launchers and the yield of their nuclear warheads  such systems have recently even been somewhat reduced. The leaders who  with a specific purpose in mind  are trying to mislead people are also fully aware of that. However  being at odds with the truth  they systematically feed public opinion with fraudulent propaganda whenever they talk about the foreign policy or the armed forces of the Soviet State. The products of such propaganda are often to be seen floating around this hall.122.	Against that background  it is obvious that those who speak of some unprecedented build-up of our country's defence potential are in fact trying to turn attention away from their own plans to deploy hundreds of new United States nuclear systems on the territories of several West European countries.123.	In order to prevent another round of the arms race  the Soviet Union has proposed negotiations to be held on the basis of equality and with observance of the principle of equal security. In order to remove the obstacles to negotiations arising from the NATO decision  we propose that discussions be initiated without delay on the question of medium range nuclear weapons in Europe and the question of United States forward based systems  concurrently and in organic interrelation. It is understood that eventual agreements would be implemented after the entry into force of the SALT II Treaty.124.	The USSR has not so far received a substantive reply to its initiative. The Soviet proposal is talked and written about; various assessments of it are made  and it is sometimes alleged that it is unclear or even mysterious  But those who are supposed to respond to it have as yet said nothing intelligible. And the reason for all this is that the Soviet Union's proposal is designed to find a genuine solution to the problem of strengthening European security and to erect a barrier to prevent Europe from becoming an even more dangerous staging area for military confrontation  with enormous quantities of nuclear weapons in readiness day and night.125.	It would seem that the delays in making a constructive reply to the substance of our proposal are intended to muffle the positive international response which it has evoked. We express the hope that common sense and a responsible approach to improving the situation in Europe will yet prevail. We would like to believe that. The Soviet Union is ready to start talks with its partners on the aforementioned just basis at any time 126.	Of course  if there is any lack of clarity as to the substance of our proposal  we would not be averse to removing it through consultations and exchanges of views  but it is essential that the participants in such exchanges of views should join us at the negotiating table in good faith and not just to kill time. At the same time  it must be clearly understood that the Soviet Union and the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty will not allow the military strategic balance they have achieved between them and the States members of NATO to be upset. Any calculations aimed at disrupting this balance should be discarded.127.	The USSR and other countries of the socialist community have never sought  and are not seeking  any military superiority. They have not had  and will not have  any strategic doctrine other than a defensive one. As Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev stated once again  with all clarity  in his recent speech in the city of Alma-Ata:""Our country's foreign policy is a clear and honest policy of peace which is not directed against anyone else. We do not encroach on anybody's land; we do not interfere in anybody's internal affairs. But we shall always manage to defend our rights and legitimate interests"".128.	Peaceableness is an inherent feature of the foreign policy of socialism  which is a social system having no classes interested in war. A world without wars  said Lenin  is the very ideal of socialism. The source from which the policy of the socialist countries draws confidence in its strength is the identity of their objectives in constructing a new society  in defending the cause of peace. To this end  the perfecting of relations of full equality  fraternal unity  comradely mutual assistance and fruitful cooperation in all spheres of life is constantly in the forefront of their attention  and this was once again borne out by the results of the meetings held in the Crimea last summer between Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev and the leaders of fraternal parties and States.129.	The Soviet Union and the socialist community have been and will continue to be in the vanguard of the struggle for international security. However  we do not claim a monopoly in this field. We shall stand in the same line with all States which consistently pursue a policy of peace and of averting the threat of another world war  a policy of detente.130.	The concrete deeds of the socialist countries are shown in a whole series of initiatives  in particular those they have advanced since the previous session of the General Assembly. These are: the proposal put forward by the meeting of the Political Consultative Committee of the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty  for holding a top-level conference of the leaders of States of all regions of the world to discuss problems related to the elimination of hotbeds of international tension and to the prevention of war; the measures for curbing the arms race  for disarmament and for strengthening peace in Europe and throughout the world contained in the declaration which was adopted at that same meeting; the initiative of the USSR with regard to holding negotiations on medium range nuclear weapons in Europe in close interrelation with United States forward based systems; the recent withdrawal by the Soviet Union of 20 000 troops  1 000 tanks and other materiel from the German Democratic Republic  a process which has been completed; the proposal submitted by the socialist countries at the Vienna talks"" providing  among other steps recommended  for the reduction of United States military personnel by 13 000 and of Soviet military personnel by 20 000  in addition to the Soviet military contingent which has been unilaterally withdrawn from the territory of the German Democratic Republic; and the withdrawal of some Soviet military units from Afghanistan.131.	A comparison of the list of the initiatives we have advanced during the past year alone with NATO's record immediately reveals the contrast between the two main lines in world politics. The facts are self-evident in showing which policy line is consonant with the aspirations of the peoples and which is in conflict with them.132.	It certainly seems to be far from easy to create a distorted picture of our foreign policy in the minds of the peoples. Misinformation and  primarily of course  slander directed against it backfire on those who resort to them.133.	Given the present state of international relationsâ when the policy of detente is being put to a severe test  when the danger of war is growingâit is essential to multiply efforts in order to arrest this course of developments. Even if the initial steps were not to be the most radical ones possible  they would still be steps which could infuse an invigorating spirit into the international political climate.134.	Proceeding from this  the Soviet Union proposes the inclusion in the agenda of this session of the General Assembly of an important and urgent item entitled ""Urgent measures for reducing the danger of war""  and we are submitting for the Assembly's consideration a relevant draft resolution What is proposed here is the adoption in the immediate future of the following measures.135.	First  an important step would be for the States members of military alliances to renounce the expansion of existing military political groupings through the admission of new members  and for countries which are not members of such groupings to renounce joining them. All States  without exception  should avoid any action conducive to the establishment of new military alliances or to assigning military functions to regional organizations which have no such functions at present. At the same time  the statements repeatedly made by the USSR and the other socialist countries concerning their readiness to disband the Warsaw Treaty organization if  simultaneously  the NATO bloc were dissolved and  as a first step  to eliminate the military organizations of the two groupings  starting with a mutual reduction of their military activities  remain fully valid.136.	Secondly  it is essential that all States  and  first of all  the permanent members of the Security Council and countries which have military agreements with them  undertake not to increase as from a certain dateâsay 1 January of the coming yearâtheir armed forces and conventional armaments  as a first step towards their subsequent reduction.137.	Thirdly  proceeding from the premise that an early conclusion of an appropriate convention  with the participation of all nuclear and nonnuclear States  would best serve to strengthen security guarantees for nonnuclear States  the USSR is also prepared to consider other possible solutions to this problem  provided the other nuclear Powers adopt a similar approach. We call upon all nuclear countries to make identical and solemn declarations concerning the non-use of nuclear weapons against nonnuclear States which have no nuclear weapons on their territories. Such declarations  if they serve the aforementioned objective  could be reinforced by an authoritative decision of the Security Council. At the same time  the Soviet Union reaffirms that it will never use nuclear weapons against those countries which renounce the production and acquisition of such weapons and do not have them on their territories.138.	Fourthly  we are convinced that  if our partners in the negotiations  the United States and the United Kingdom  show corresponding readiness  it is quite realistic to expect a successful conclusion within a short time limit of the elaboration of an international treaty on the complete and general prohibition of nuclear weapon tests. We consider this to be possible. There are no insuperable obstacles.139.	To this end  the USSR proposes that all nuclear Powers declare themselves ready to renounce within a period of one year  beginning on a date to be agreed by them  all nuclear explosions. The point is to have a one year moratorium while negotiations would continue with a view to achieving a more radical solution.140.	A prompt implementation of all these measures would blunt the edge of some of the issues in international relations. It could be instrumental in easing the burden of military expenditures of States  strengthening the regime of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons  and creating favourable conditions for progress in the field of the arms race limitation. We hope that the General Assembly will give these proposals careful and due consideration  and that it will support them.141.	In today's international conditions  the Soviet Union considers it an imperative duty of the United Nations Member States to intensify their efforts in all major directions of the struggle for peace. As hitherto  the Soviet Union will maintain and deepen the dialogue and cooperate with all States that display political will towards this end. By the way  with regard to ""dialogue""  this is a term often used nowadays. One way of reasoning goes like this: if there is something I do not like in the policy of a State  I will not speak with it. But to our mind such capriciousness  such vagaries  have been widely condemned  and rightly so. There should be no place for them in politics.142.	At the current session  we consider it necessary to recall the United Nations decisions which have yet to be implemented  proposals put forward by the USSR and other countries  as well as to set forth our views on enhancing the efficiency of efforts in specific sectors of this historic struggle. To this end  the USSR is submitting at this session a memorandum entitled ""peace  disarmament and international security guarantees"" 143.	There is hardly any need to prove that the greatest threat to peace on our planet is posed by the unabated nuclear arms race. There is  however  a need to say again and again that it is inadmissible to put up with a situation where people live under the burden of a constant fear of a nuclear disaster.144.	While recognizing the complexities of the problem of nuclear disarmament  one should not toe the line of those who shirk even its discussion. It is for people to resolve this burning problem. People have created the nuclear weapon  and it is they who can and must outlaw and destroy it. There is no denying that man's mind is stronger than his fists. None the less  the fact remains that the negotiations proposed by the Soviet Union for ending the production of all types of nuclear weapons and gradually reducing their stockpiles until they have been completely destroyed have never started  owing to the negative position of certain Governments. We stand for the talks getting under way and for the Governments concerned to adopt a serious attitude towards them  so that the relevant decision of the special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament may be fulfilled.145.	The conclusion by States of an agreement on the renunciation of the use of force in international relations would be of great importance for the cause of peace and detente. In statements made from this rostrum the Soviet Union has repeatedly stressed the importance of such an agreement and of resolution 2936 (XXVII) adopted by the General Assembly in 1972 entitled ""Non-use of force in international relations and permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons"". In the current situation  the duty of the United Nations to pronounce itself in favour of the prompt completion of efforts in this field is becoming ever more imperative.146.	To lessen the threat of nuclear war  it is of decisive importance to check the further growth of the strategic potentials of States and subsequently to reduce strategic nuclear weapon systems quantitatively and to limit them qualitatively. And could anyone deny how significant would be the entry into force of the Soviet American Treaty on the Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms  SALT II?147.	The USSR is ready to ratify the SALT II Treaty and afterwards strictly to comply with all its provisions. It is also the intention of the Soviet Union to participate in the negotiations on the further limitation and reduction of strategic arms  with strict observance of the principle of equality and equal security. But it would not be out of place to say in this connection that  although the Treaty has not yet entered into force  the American side is already laying a mine under it in the shape of a plan whose implementation would open up the possibility of excluding from appropriate verification a large number of strategic nuclear missile systems. I think that this is well known to all representatives in this hall.148.	Now that the nuclear missile arsenals of States are being constantly inflated  the question of elaborating and adopting more reliable measures to prevent the possibility of the accidental or authorized use of nuclear weapons is becoming ever more acute  and repeated false nuclear alarms in the United States armed forces give ground for serious thought in this regard. Indeed  the fact that the alarm was false becomes known laterâafterwards. And this surely leads to certain conclusions. Such things should not take place if the leadership of a State deals with all questions pertaining to nuclear weapons with a sense of responsibility.149.	It has always been the stand of the Soviet Union that the strengthening of the regime of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons should be a subject of unfailing concern. The failure to see that transfers of nuclear equipment  materials and technology intended for peaceful purposes could serve as a channel for spreading nuclear arms is fraught with the most negative consequences. An important step would be taken if an international agreement were reached on the non-stationing of nuclear weapons on the territories of countries where there are no such weapons at the present time  regardless of whether or not these countries are allies of a given nuclear State. However  owing to the opposition of certain Powers  progress in negotiations on this question is slow  to say the least.150.	The lethal power of such means of mass destruction as chemical weapons does not at all pale in comparison to the monstrous destructive force of nuclear armaments. The negotiations on their prohibition have been dragging on for many years  with the distance to the finishing lineâthe signing of a relevant international conventionâremaining almost as long as ever. It will be impossible to cover the remaining distance without energetic efforts on the part of all participants in the negotiations. We  for our part  have been persistently working towards that end.151.	The Soviet Union  as before  is fully in favour of observance of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development  Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction. It has always been  and remains  faithful to the spirit and letter of the Convention  which constitutes a measure of real disarmament.152.	Sometimes representatives of military quarters float allegations that the Soviet Union does not always respect the obligations it assumes under international agreements. But such allegations are a ploy that is as old as the universe. The reasoning of their authors is obviously as follows: if peoples are to be deceived  let the deception be huge to make an impression. But in the contest between truth and deception  truth has always been victorious sooner or later. The Soviet Union has not violated one single international agreement and it does not intend to do so.153.	Those who resort to such allegations attempt to weave them into a thick shroud to cover their own unseemly deeds. Look at what is taking place in the country whose representatives indulge in such statements: plans are openly being discussed there for building new plants to produce chemical weapons. I said plans are being discussed there  but it would be more accurate to say that they are being discussed here  and this is being done at a time when representatives of that very country are sitting at the negotiating table where the question of banning chemical weapons is being discussed 154.	And how often has the Soviet Union made representations regarding noncompliance with agreements by those who aim such allegations at the Soviet Union? Those for whom these words of ours are meant know that very well. That is how things are with attempts to cast a shadow on the attitude of the Soviet Union towards its international obligations 155.	The world is not safeguarded from the possible emergence in the not too distant future of new types and systems of weapons of mass destruction. This is particularly dangerous now  since forces have appeared that are counting on achieving military superiority. The USSR favours the adoption of additional measures to ensure the conclusion of an international agreement banning the development of new types and systems of weapons of mass destruction  as well as the conclusion  as necessary  of special agreements on individual types of such weapons.156.	Vigilance and perseverance are required in the struggle against the neutron weaponâthat barbarous means of annihilation. The position of our country  which declared in the past that it would not begin production of neutron weapons unless the United States did so  remains valid and it also applies to the possible emergence of such weapons in any other State.157.	Objectively  there is a basis for the early completion of work on a treaty banning one type of weapon of mass destructionâradiological weapons.158.	Owing to the opposition if certain Powers  the question of what are called conventional armaments has actually been left outside the sphere of concrete negotiations. The solution of that question should be speedily moved to a practical plane. Representatives of certain countries wish to talk endlessly and willingly on that subject  while doing nothing  however  to facilitate agreement.159.	The danger of war could also be reduced in no small measure by the limitation and cessation of the arms race in particular geographical areas as well. That applies first of all to Europe. Developments in Europe have always had a most significant impact on the state of world affairs. The Soviet Union  like other countries of the socialist community  is seeking to ensure a steady continuation of the process initiated by the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and compliance with all the provisions and principles of the Final Act which it adopted.160.	As we are staunch advocates of the Leninist principle of peaceful coexistence  we have always striven to ensure that no avenue in our relations with States belonging to a different social system  including the United States  should remain unexplored. We expect those States to do likewise. Indeed  an overwhelming majority of them do build their relations with us in that fashion.161.	The course for maintaining and strengthening security in Europe and for reducing the level of military confrontation on the continent was convincingly demonstrated last May at the meeting of the Political Consultative Committee of the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty. It was also manifested during the recent talks held by Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev with French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing and with the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany  Helmut Schmidt.162.	In the series of proposals made by the countries of the socialist community with regard to Europe  a prominent place belongs to the initiative for the conclusion by all States participants in the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe of a treaty on the non-use of either nuclear or conventional armsâI repeat  nuclear or conventional arms. Does anybody who stands for peace object to this proposal?163.	The socialist countries have taken steps  some of them quite recently  which provide a solid basis for reaching agreement at the Vienna Talks on the Mutual Reduction of Forces  Armaments and Associated Measures in Central Europe. Success in that work is being obstructed by those who do not wish to give up attempts to gain unilateral advantage to the detriment of the security interests of the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty.164.	The holding of a conference on military detente and disarmament in Europe is a matter of paramount importance. We express the hope that all States concerned will contribute to the realization of this idea. This is a good idea.165.	A significant role in achieving general agreement on the convocation and the subject matter of the conference is to be played by the Madrid meeting of representatives of States participants in the European Conference. We wish the meeting to be business-like and to be crowned with positive results on all sections of the Helsinki Final Act. We urge other countries to display the same constructive approach to the Madrid meeting.166.	The problem of lessening tensions in the Indian Ocean is increasingly important. The Soviet Union has invariably supported the initiative of the littoral States to turn the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace. For the purpose of implementing that initiative  we shall continue to cooperate with all States concerned  inter alia  at the Conference on the Indian Ocean scheduled for 1981. The same objective would be served by the resumption of the Soviet American talks  suspended by the United States  on the limitation and subsequent reduction of military activities in that ocean. We are ready at any time to sit at the same table with the United States and to continue negotiations on that matter. It is now up to the United States.167.	The States parties to the Warsaw Treaty favour discussion within the framework of the United Nations of the question of limiting and reducing the level of military presence and military activities  be it in the Atlantic  the Indian or the Pacific Ocean  in the Mediterranean or in the Persian Gulf. Agreements in that field would serve the interests of peace and stabilization of the international situation. The Soviet Union is prepared at any time to come to the negotiating table to discuss this issue with the States concerned.168.	More than once the United Nations has tried its hand at achieving agreed decisions on the reduction of the military budgets of States. However  each time  it encountered resolute opposition and all means of misinformation are employed here to frustrate any progress towards agreement in this extremely important field. As a result  the military appropriations of States have been growing from year to year. And what a variety of methods have been devised by certain Governments to extract from the taxpayer ever greater sums to be fed into the grinder of military production. And this is taking place at a time when hundreds of millions of people in the world are suffering from starvation  have no access to proper medical services and education or have no roof over their heads. Resources which could be used for the benefit of people are being consumed by the arms race. Regrettably  the United Nations has not so far pronounced its weighty opinion on that score. It has great possibilities for speaking out.169.	Now as before  the USSR is prepared to proceed to negotiations on specific reductions  in absolute figures or in terms of percentage points  of military budgets of States permanent members of the Security Council as well as of other States with large economic and military potential. We are also prepared to reach agreement on the amounts which each State reducing its military budget would allocate for increased economic aid to developing countries.170.	The Soviet Union believes that thorough preparations should be carried out for the special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament  which is to take place in 1982. That session should be followed by a world conference on disarmament to ensure that a profound consideration of disarmament issues may result not merely in recommendations  but in decisions to be implemented by States fully without any exception.171.	There must be implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples adopted 20 years ago on the initiative of the USSR.172.	We welcome the emergence this year of new independent States. In southern Africa there is the Republic of Zimbabwe  which was born in the flames of the long struggle of its valiant people. We are convinced that the day will come when the people of Namibia  too  will win their freedom and independence. Everything must be done to bring nearer the moment when here in this hall of the General Assembly final victory will be solemnly celebrated over the monster which has taken the lives of or crippled many millions of human beings  which for centuries has mercilessly exploited many a people and whose name is colonialism.173.	The Soviet Union has always shown respect for the legitimate aspirations of States which have freed themselves from the yoke of colonialism. We have good relations with most of them. We note with satisfaction the increasing role of these States in international politics and appreciate the peaceful anti-imperialist orientation of the movement of the nonaligned countries.174.	Our country has consistently supported the developing States in their desire to attain economic independence  their inalienable right to dispose of their natural resources and their legitimate demand for the restructuring of international economic relations on the basis of equality  without any discrimination.175.	Problems affecting all mankind are becoming ever more conspicuous in the broad spectrum of the concerns of our time. I shall make special mention of one of them: preservation of nature. The Soviet Union wishes to see man show greater care and concern for nature  and to see natural resources used in the interests of all nations on a scientific basis.176.	However  everybody knows what immense material and intellectual resources are being deflected from the solution of this problem by the arms race  how ruinous and perhaps irreversible is the damage inflicted on the entire human environment by military activities of States such as tests of various types of weapons and  above all  of nuclear weapons  the stockpiling of poisonous chemical agents and so on  to say nothing of the disastrous consequences which a nuclear war would have not only for people but also for nature in general.177.	It is the duty of the United Nations to draw the attention of the States of the world to their historic responsibility for preserving the nature of the earth  which is indispensable for the life of present and future generations  and to make its contribution to the development of international cooperation in this field. We have submitted an appropriate draft resolution for consideration by the General Assembly at the current session.178.	Our views and specific proposals on important measures which should be adopted in the evolving situation stem from the peaceful nature of the foreign policy of the Soviet Union. We are convinced that the necessary possibilities for staving off the threat of war and putting international peace on a more solid foundation exist. There are forces able to do that. For it is the will of the peoples and the policies of States  not late  that determine the trend of world developments.179.	No responsible politician in the world can remain indifferent to the course pursued by those countries in whose policies the cult of war is becoming the dominant factor. Indeed  even here and now in the host country of the Headquarters of the United Nations there is massive propaganda in favour of nuclear warâbefore our very eyes  it can be said  But it is not only a question of propaganda; plans for such a war are being worked out and discussed  and this is all being done at government level. In the atmosphere of militarist frenzy which has of late become so widespread in the United States  there is ever less room left for sound and sober assessments of the world situation and well considered conclusions on the conduct of policy.180.	The United Nations would be right to issue a firm warning to those who seek a dangerous exacerbation of tension and war hysteria. It would be a good thing to say to those responsible: ""Gentlemen  do not push the rock down the hill  for there is a risk that you will not be able to stop it later on"".181.	Saving mankind from the scourge of war is the goal towards which the States should direct their efforts  instead of preparing for war. If the General Assembly took that stand  it would add a bright page to the book of modern history.182.	Despite all the differences in social systems  levels of economic development  national characteristics and historical destinies of the States represented in the United Nations  all peoples want to live with confidence in their future. No country  no Government  if it expresses the aspirations and will of its people  can remain aloof from the struggle for disarmament  for the relaxation of tensions and for peace.183.	This is the basis on which the Soviet Union acts. ""We shall continue to spare no effort""  stressed Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev  ""to preserve detente  everything positive that was achieved in the 1970s  to ensure a turn towards disarmament  to uphold the right of peoples to free and independent development  to preserve and consolidate peace.""184.	Our country and its representatives are prepared to participate in a most constructive manner in the work of this session and to contribute actively to its success."
"117",5991,"RWA",35,1980,"ï»¿Mr. President  the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly  over which you have the honour of presiding  is for me a pleasant opportunity to associate the Rwanda delegation with those delegations that have spoken before from this rostrum in conveying sincere and warm congratulations to you on your unanimous election to the presidency of this session of the General Assembly.3.	Your election constitutes a tribute to your outstanding statesmanlike and diplomatic qualities and  through you  confers a signal honour on your country  the Federal Republic of Germany  which ever since its admission to the United Nations has constantly displayed its political maturity and its determination to contribute to the strengthening of its relations of cooperation  both political and economic  with all countries that love peace and justice.4.	I take the greatest pleasure  therefore  in the fact that you are a national of a friendly country  with which Rwanda maintains special and historical links of dynamic cooperation.5.	You may rest assured  Sir  that my delegation will spare no effort to make its modest contribution to the success of your lofty and noble task.6.	I should also like to extend my gratitude to your predecessor  who  with such remarkable competence  conducted the proceedings of the thirty-fourth regular session  the sixth and the seventh emergency special sessions and the eleventh special session of the General Assembly of our Organization. I mean  of course  Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim  the worthy representative of the United Republic of Tanzania. He deserves the congratulations and the expression of the highest esteem of my delegation for having  once again  contributed to enhancing even further the credibility of Africa in the family of nations.7.	It is also my pleasure to make special mention of the Secretary General of the United Nations  Mr. Kurt Wald heim  for having measured up so ably to the task with which he has been entrusted.8.	Rwanda has always appreciated his numerous initiatives to find appropriate solutions to the various situations of conflict that have arisen in different places  the repercussions of which have come so near to endangering international peace and security.9.	The presence among us of the delegation of independent Zimbabwe is for my delegation a genuine cause for joy and satisfaction.10.	Rwanda warmly welcomes the admission of this youngest African nation to the family of the United Nations and we associate ourselves most willingly with the other nations of the world in once again conveying congratulations to the Government and people of Zimbabwe  who are now engaged in the task of national reconstruction under the enlightened leadership of their illustrious Prime Minister  Comrade Robert Mugabe  who has shown such fighting spirit and great strategy in the course of the national liberation struggle.11.	The victory of the Zimbabwe people without any doubt constitutes a victory for free Africa over colonialism and the exploitation of man by man  outmoded systems which unfortunately still afflict part of southern Africa.12.	We should also like to welcome to our community the State of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  whose accession to national sovereignty is a further step in the struggle for the granting of independence to peoples and territories under colonial domination.13.	With regard to the distressing problem of colonialism in general and colonialism in Africa in particular  there is nothing original in stating that the role of the United Nations was decisive in the process of the accession to independence of the African States that have now become full Members of the United Nations.â14.	One should  however  recall the adoption on 14 December 1960 of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) which launched our States' great independence movement  thanks to which the African presence in the international arena has now become a reality.15.	Rwanda  which assumed its own independence on 1 July 1962  has been a Member of the United Nations since 18 September of that same year. Ever since its admission  my country has worked for the creation of conditions that favour respect for the noble ideals contained in the Charter of the United Nations  whose focal point is the maintenance of international peace and security.16.	My present visit gives me another pleasant opportunity to reiterate the determination and readiness of Rwanda to contribute within its means to that global task of preserving international peace and security  something that has been advocated by the United Nations ever since its foundation.17.	In the work of creating conditions favourable to the building of a better world  Rwanda remains on the side of those struggling for their political and economic emancipation.18.	It is on the basis of this same concern that we deplore the negative attitude of those countries that continue to defy the international community by pursuing  often arrogantly  their odious and inhuman policy of apartheid  racism and domination  thus scornfully and insolently flouting the spirit and letter of the Charter of the United Nations  to which nonetheless they have themselves subscribed.19.	The Rwandese Republic has always unambiguously condemned the anachronistic nature of those barbaric practices  whether they be in Africa or in other parts of the world. It is highly regrettable that in those parts of the world the most elementary rights are denied to a whole people  are indeed trampled underfoot  despite the appeals issued from all quarters for an end to such practices.20.	In southern Africa  the independence of Zimbabwe has tightened the ring surrounding apartheid and racial domination  policies pursued by the white minority of South Africa  and has revived the hope of a rapid solution in Namibia in spite of the obstinacy of the Pretoria regime  which continues to refuse to evacuate this Territory.21.	Rwanda persists in believing that the Western countries have the power to exercise considerable influence  both political and economic  on Pretoria  in order to prevail upon it to take more realistic positions  positions that will be more favourable to the United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia and the democratization of its inhuman regime of apartheid and racial discrimination.22.	The Rwanda Government  for its part  will continue within the limits of its resources to provide unswerving support to the Namibian and South African peoples for as long as the most fundamental rights and the most elementary justice continue to be denied them.23.	Rwanda has repeatedly expressed its unswerving support for the just cause of the Sahraoui people  which  like other peoples  must be able to exercise its right to self-determination and freely to choose its own destiny. The tragedy in Chad is for us in Africa highly alarming  and the disintegration of that brotherly country  which unfortunately is liable to ensue  would constitute a severe blow to the unity of our continent.24.	The Rwanda delegation again makes an urgent appeal to the good sense  patriotism and wisdom of the warring brothers in Chad to put an end to their hostilities and reach a peaceful settlement of their conflict. It is becoming both alarming and clear that this fratricidal struggle will lead to the total destabilization and  indeed  the extinction of the Chad nation. Obviously this can only be to the detriment of the whole people of Chad  which is already tired of that futile war.25.	The situation in the Middle East is becoming ever more precarious. The persistent refusal of Israel to evacuate the occupied Arab territories and recognize the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people blocks any hope of the solution of a problem which has lasted far too long. For its part  Rwanda remains profoundly convinced that that tragic conflict will find no just or lasting solution without the unconditional withdrawal of the Zionist troops from the Arab territories occupied since 1967 and total respect for the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people  including their right to establish their own State. We also believe that the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]  recognized as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  must be intimately involved in any search for a solution to this grave problem.26.	The Korean question is one of the major concerns of the international community. Rwanda  for its part  believes that any foreign interference in this problem seriously jeopardizes the objective search for a broadly acceptable solution. The Government of Rwanda is convinced that the unification of the Korean nation can be brought about only by the withdrawal of all foreign troops from that area  thus making it possible for the Korean people to find a peaceful solution to the problem of its reunification.27.	This position reflects the general attitude of the Rwandese Republic with regard to the situation of all divided nations. Those nations have an absolute right to find ways and means of bringing about their peaceful reunification  because they are indivisible.28.	It is in this context that the Government of Rwanda also appreciates the spirit of detente which has motivated both German States for some years now and which has been reflected in a series of arrangements in various fields with a view to diminishing as far as possible the effects of the division of the German nation. We are convinced that it is in the interests of all for that dialogue to continue and to go as far as possible towards the free and peaceful reunification of the German nation and the consolidation of peace in the area concerned.29.	In other parts of Africa and the rest of the world the international community is witnessing helplessly upheavals which are due mainly to struggles for influence between the great Powers. We have therefore been following with concern the development of the situations currently prevailing in the Horn of Africa  Afghanistan  Southeast Asia and  in particular  IndoChina and Lebanon.30.	The innumerable and distressing consequences of those conflicts  the origin of which often lies outside the areas concerned  include hunger  massive destruction of socioeconomic infrastructures  loss of human life and the outflow of refugees who are forced to live in subhuman and intolerable conditions  without food or housing.31.	International solidarity demands that aid be given to those who have been driven out against their will and continue to wander outside their own countries without any means of subsistence  housing or means of defence. One of the solutions to this distressing problem lies in the search for peaceful coexistence among nations. The only road to this ultimate objective is that of mutual respect and non-interference in the internal affairs of other States  interference often being the underlying cause of such conflicts.32.	World peace is therefore increasingly threatened by all these sources of tension which are being maintained unnecessarily at the expense of the noble objectives of international security and understanding. Instead of encouraging detente among all nations  great and small  rich and poor  these conflicts encourage the great Powers to intensify even further their competition in the arms race and disregard the political and economic rights of other States. It is the small and the weak that are more often than not the victims of these manoeuvrings of the great Powers.33.	The proliferation of weapons of all kinds is becoming every day a subject of pressing concern. Fabulous sums of money are being spent on the search for new weapons of mass destruction.34.	Permit me to mention in this regard a poignant truth uttered by the Secretary General of the United Nations  Mr. Kurt Waldheim. In his address at the seventeenth ordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity [OAU]  on 1 July last  he said:""There exists in the world today more explosive power than food measured in pounds per person. Military expenditures are taking a toll of a million dollars per minute. They thus impose a cost which far exceeds what would be required to control disease and reduce hunger.""35.	It is indeed shocking to observe that  at the very time when the international community has embarked upon an era of detente and a disarmament programme  military expenditures have grown  according to known figures  from $225 billion in 1974 to more than $400 billion at the present time. Responsible and competent sources have also declared that $100 million  or in comparative terms the annual budget of my own country  are being devoted every day to the expansion of nuclear arsenals.36.	I am firmly convinced that such sums should be devoted  rather  to assistance to the least developed countries and economic and social projects such as the development of agriculture and cattle raising  education  the building of hospitals  the development of road and energy infrastructures and the improvement of means of communication and transport. I also continue to believe that this problem is the responsibility of the great Powers  who alone can play a decisive role.37.	Realistically  the Members of our Organization ought to cultivate understanding and peaceful coexistence among themselves  without any distinction as to political or ideological preferences. Only then can peace and international security  the only preconditions of economic development  be preserved and our peoples be spared all the vicissitudes of the spectre of war  which haunts and disheartens us.38.	The Rwandese Republic is proud to belong to the nonaligned movement  which has as its objective the achievement of a balance among the nations of the world and serves as a stabilizing element between the two blocs of influence.39.	In this regard Rwanda encourages all the nonaligned countries to safeguard the objectives of the movement by avoiding the risk of falling into the grip of either bloc at the risk of weakening and diminishing the role and the mission of our movement.40.	I should like to take this opportunity to recall here the glorious memory of the late President Broz Tito  the great champion of the nonaligned movement; he and his work serve as a model for us all. He was a great man who  more than anyone else  left an imprint on the political life of the twentieth century. Even in death Marshal Tito is and will remain a living symbol of concern for and courage in the defence of the noble ideals of the nonaligned movement and in the struggle to safeguard the independence of his country  Yugoslavia.41.	I have spoken of the turmoils and political conflicts which are tearing apart many parts of our planet at this very moment. However  there exist other problems  even more serious because they are so lasting  which are rife in the majority of our countries: hunger  malnutrition  poverty  disease and other scourges which threaten to be more destructive and devastating  making still more precarious the existence of our populations. In Africa  for example  in areas spared the ravages of floods  the drought is devastating everything in its path as it advances in an alarming manner over vast extents of territory  visibly reducing the acreage of arable land. The damage caused by natural catastrophes is incalculable. In particular  they upset development programmes and cause famine in the affected regions. The domestic effort of each nation and international solidarity and cooperation remain beyond doubt the most effective tools for stemming these courses.42.	The United Nations  apart from the safeguarding of international peace and security  has set itself other objectives  including that of achieving international cooperation by resolving international problems of an economic  social  intellectual or humanitarian nature and developing and encouraging respect for human rights and basic freedoms for all without distinction as to race  sex or religion.43.	In this context the economic difficulties with which our economies are now confronted lead me to refer here to the plight of a great number of developing countries which continue to eke out their existence in a desperate economic situation. It is useless to try to seek the underlying reasons and causes for this economic stagnation through which the majority of our countries are passing  for the positions of the various parties differ to such an extent that in our international meetings our delegations cannot succeed in coming to an agreement.44.	We are  nevertheless  all in agreement in observing that for more than a decade the economies of the third world countries  instead of improving  are becoming further bogged down in stagnation and are in fact even in retreat. There is no need to demonstrate the continual decline in the prices of raw materials. It has reached the point where it is for the moment difficult  even impossible  to reconcile the export income of raw materials and the ever-growing expenditure which we have to make for the importation of manufactured goods.45.	The commercial deficits which flow from this have forced and will continue to force the developing countries to have recourse to other measures not less dangerous for their political and economic viability. Among those measures I would mention indebtedness  which seems unfortunately now to have been set up as a golden rule in the relations between the still underequipped countries and the industrialized countries. It is not certain that our problems will be solved by the continual piling up of debts. What we should do  rather  is to introduce austerity into the management of the scanty means of which we dispose and to create conditions favourable to the growth of international confidence in financial matters.46.	Above all  it is the inadequacy of financial assistance which is likely to deepen the gulf between the rich and poor countries  since the latter expect from the former more solidarity and bounty in their economic difficulties. It is  indeed  the duty of the wealthy countries to come to the aid of the poorest countries  especially when one must take into account the fact that it is often nature itself which favours some countries and frowns on others.47.	It is in this context that I recall the particular conditions of my own country  Rwanda  which is situated far from shipping lanes and whose subsoil seems lacking in natural resources. The little we have of raw materials does not even suffice to cover our import expenses. Similarly  in spite of the goodwill and constant effort made by the Government and people of Rwanda to free our country from underdevelopment  our landlocked condition imposes on us a permanent stranglehold so tight that without outside support it would be impossible for us to accomplish the difficult task of national development.48.	The situation of landlocked countries deserves more care and attention from the whole international community. Apart from the effects of the present economic crisis which afflicts them much more acutely than others  these countries are also faced with the problems of lack of access to the sea which forces them to pay very high costs for international transportation of their goods.49.	What is even more serious is that in some cases the economies of these countries are often victims of situations beyond their control  with the consequence that the sources of their supply and the marketing of their products are disrupted. I dare to hope that the current negotiations on the law of the sea will take into account this quite special situation of the landlocked countries.50.	Furthermore  we must stress that in order to halt the present economic crisis which is marked by a decline in the terms of trade  ceaselessly galloping inflation  disruption of the international monetary system and the energy crisis  which continues to lead to increases in the price of oil  all countries must unite their efforts to establish new rules for international economic conduct. International forums have made it clear that it has become unthinkable to continue to conduct international economic affairs in a system which no longer responds to present conditions.51.	Rwanda  for its part  thinks that the moment has come to be frank and to speak the truth. In fact the developed countries have every interest in seeing the developing countries become viable partners. In consequence  the developing countries must have access to the management of international affairs on an equal footing with the developed countries; otherwise the gap between them will continue to widen. Unless this happens  the fashionable slogans of ""international cooperation"" and ""North South dialogue"" will remain empty words.52.	If we genuinely wish to establish a new international economic order  we must renounce the spirit of confrontation and selfishness and seek common ground for mutual concessions in our positions  always with mutual respect. The means to build a new world are not lacking; it is the will to combine our efforts which is still absent. The developing countries possess impressive amounts of raw materials and constitute in addition a considerable market for manufactured products; the developed countries have at their disposal enormous amounts of capital and a very advanced technology; and so the pooling of all this potential would give rise to a symbiosis that would be profitable for all and that would do a great deal to reduce the gap which marks present North South relations.53.	But until that hoped-for moment comes  the developing countries have a stake in embarking without delay upon horizontal cooperation at all levels  bilateral  sub regional and regional  and in all fields; and they should pursue such cooperation where it exists at the moment. This is the only possible means of access to rapid and integrated development. This cooperation among developing countries demands  above all  good organization and an exhaustive inventory of the potentials and possibilities of each  as well as of the needs to be met.54.	The members of the [OAU] for their part already took an important step last April at the second extraordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU with the adoption of the Lagos Plan of Action for the Implementation of the Monrovia Strategy for the Economic Development of Africa  which outlines the priorities for development until the year 2000  including food  agriculture  industry  science and technology  as well as transport and communications.55.	Particular stress is placed on the urgency for the African countries to achieve self-sufficiency in food as a socioeconomic imperative  bearing in mind that the food situation in Africa is on the brink of catastrophe and that the wolf of hunger is prowling ever closer to our door.56.	This concern with economic integration which animates the African countries certainly constitutes the living expression of the political will of all parties to establish a new type of economic relations among all States on the basis of active solidarity and frank collaboration in a spirit of mutual respect for the political or ideological options adopted by each State.57.	The role of the United Nations would then consist in serving as a catalyst and a framework for concertation to establish that new system which would be characteristic of the economic relations of the international community.58.	The holding in this very hall of the eleventh special session of the General Assembly  which concluded its work just a few days ago  speaks eloquently of that political will to concertation of States Members of the United Nations. Although the results of that eleventh special session of the General Assembly  devoted to economic questions  did not live up to the hopes placed in it by our peoples  I should like for my part to call for a continuation of negotiations in a spirit of constructive dialogue  even if it is true that we shall have to wait quite a while longer before they produce useful results.59.	The developing countries are well aware that their road to progress is a long one and that they must persevere in the search for solutions acceptable to all their partners.60.	The Rwandese Republic would finally encourage a more emphatic and more concerted commitment on the part of developing countries  within the circle of the Group of 77  in the negotiations with the developed countries  with a view to the establishment of a new international economic order. We remain convinced that such unity of action of the Group of 77 will sooner or later prevail upon the developed countries to adopt more flexible and more positive positions on the questions which are the subject of global negotiations.61.	Once again it is appropriate to repeat unambiguously that international economic relations need to be made more dynamic and to be directed towards equity  sharing and distributive justice  and that we need to be complementary in our international relations in order to reach that sublime objective.62.	It is within that context of interdependence that we shall build a contemporary society that we hope will be more just  more sound and imbued with a greater degree of solidarity. We count on the United Nations to channel our efforts  and we count on it also as the focal point for heightening  by dialogue and consultation  the awareness of all the peoples of the world."
"118",6036,"SAU",35,1980,"ï»¿I should like first  Sir  to add my voice to the voices of those heads of delegations who preceded me in addressing this session  and to congratulate you on your assumption of the high position to which you have been elected as President of the General Assembly at its thirty- fifth session. This is an election which reflects the great esteem enjoyed by you and by your country. We hope  under you wise guidance  to achieve substantial progress towards the realization of the goals and objectives of the United Nations and towards dealing with the issues before us  as was the case during the presidency of your highly esteemed predecessor  Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim.246.	In this connection  I must not fail to extend my thanks and appreciation to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Wald- heim  for his tireless efforts to achieve the goals of the United Nations  goals on which the hopes and aspirations of peace- loving nations are centred.247.	It is my pleasure to join in welcoming the State of Zimbabwe as a new Member of the United Nations. I should like to take this opportunity to extend my country's congratulations to the people of Zimbabwe  whose determination and national struggle have been crowned with the attainment of freedom and independence.248.	We also welcome Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to membership of our Organization and look forward to its positive contribution to the activities of the United Nations.249.	It is also my pleasure  while the world of Islam is on the threshold of its fifteenth century  to take note of the comprehensive and well-rounded speech delivered by Mr. Mohammad Zia-ul-Haq  President of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. That statement constituted in itself a comprehensive framework and a true and genuine expression of the attitude of the Islamic States  and in particular of the Islamic Conference  towards the various regional and international issues and problems.250.	In this world  where the interests of the various nations interlock and overlap  where various trends and ideologies compete for predominance and where a conflict rages between the desire to acquire influence and control and the hope to achieve a permanent peace which would allow all peoples of the earth to live in freedom  friendship and equality of rights and obligationsâin this kind of world  the United Nations stands as the beacon guiding the steps of peoples on the road to the future to which they aspire.251.	I am not going to cite in detail the achievements of the United Nations in the various fields of human endeavour; other heads of delegations have already done so. We all  in one way or another  bless those efforts and believe in their importance and in the need for them and contribute  to the extent of our ability and as far as possible  to them. However  I feel it is necessary to reiterate the basic goals for which our Organization was establishedâthe goals on which its Charter was based and to the achievement of which the United Nations devotes tremendous efforts. I mean the goals of establishing and preserving world peace and laying the foundations of justice through co-operation among nations in the political  economic and social fields.252.	If there is a hope of avoiding the woes and horrors of war and if there is a way for peoples to realize their aspirations in terms of welfare and prosperity  that hope or way lies in the capacity of this Organization to work to maintain  consolidate and serve those goals. This requires a sincere effort to prevent the use of the tools of mass genocide and destruction  which have become so powerful and so effective as to be capable of annihilating the population of the world within a very short period and of endangering world peace in every way.253.	We know  of course  that this overwhelming threat and the horrible ""balance of terror"" among those Powers that possess such awful weaponsâespecially the United States and the Soviet Unionâare among the main reasons preventing the recurring crises in the world from turning into full-scale destructive wars.254.	It is natural to hold the super-Powers responsible  first and foremost. They have the capability to launch the forces of destruction. Since they bear such important responsibilities in this field  they are required to commit themselves  devotedly  genuinely and efficiently  to maintaining peace and realizing justice and equity  since those ideals represent the basic objectives with a view to which this Organization was created.255.	It is taken for granted that international detente is an arrangement among those Powers  an arrangement imposing obligations and responsibilities on them rather than giving them rights and privileges. An arrangement among them does not mean that they have the right to impose their will and desires on nations or  on the pretext of that arrangement  to divide the world into zones of influence and dominance. Detente does not mean giving preference to certain areas of the world. We welcome initiatives and conferences aimed at maintaining the security of certain areas in the world  provided that such initiatives and meetings do not expose other areas to conflict and aggression. On the contrary  those Powers are bound by their obligations and responsibilities to uphold the interests of the small nations and support their independence. They are also obliged to create the bases for a balanced and just international cooperation. World peace will not be established and consolidated unless it is based on the principles of right  equity and justice. In their totality  those principles form an indivisible and integrated framework for peace.256.	There is indeed no doubt that the destinies of the world should not be left in the hands of a number of Powers to steer as they wish  imposing their authority and dominance through their weapons of terror and destruction and the advanced technology they possess. If we allow those States to do this  we shall be consecrating a theory that history has proved to be extremely dangerous and extremely unjust. It is the theory of the strong dominating the weak and controlling their fate and destiny. Also  we are suspicious of and question the conduct of the super-Powers that proclaim themselves the protectors of world peace and security  while at the same time they do not hesitate to use sheer force  domination and military intervention to impose their will and achieve their greedy aims. Such conduct also reflects a logic that in effect says that the super-Powers  just because they are so powerful and so dominating  have the right to interfere in the affairs of any independent State they consider to be within their zone of influence in order to protect their so-called interests or  in fact  to impose the political system they want on that State. Unfortunately  when the interests of the super-Powers are incompatible while they seek to impose their influence and control  the net result is the development among them of conflicts creating concern and tension throughout the world and leading  ultimately  to the destruction and doom of mankind.257.	The responsibility for establishing a just and equitable peace throughout the world should be shouldered by all of us  as Members of the United Nations  even when we also recognize the special responsibility assumed by the great Powers  which should be complementary to the responsibility of the United Nations and in no way contrary to it.258.	As developing and third world countries  our role and duty in that respect should be based on our ability to avoid the evil of international polarization and  with growing determination  to give our homelands the chance of avoiding the climate and tension of international conflict  so that they may be far removed from any kind of ""umbrella"" of domination. At the same time  we should realize that it is necessary to correct the course of the non-aligned movement so as to restore its originality  efficiency and vitality and enable it to produce results compatible with the genuine aims and principles of non-alignment. To do this  it is imperative that we exert every possible effort to keep our homelands out of the conflicts of the super-Powers and in no way allow them to become the theatre for such conflicts. We should never become obedient tools in the hands of the great PowersâEastern or Westernâand we should not allow them to use our homelands as fuel in the furnace of their conflicts.259.	By seeking relentlessly to consolidate those principles  we shall be securing many advantages; most importantly  we shall be achieving international security and stability  and thus we shall be able to rescue mankind from the threat of destruction as a result of international conflict. In that way  we can also uphold the ethics of dealings among nationsâethics ordained by our Islamic principles and traditions. At the same time  we should be keen to guarantee that our relations with the great Powers are based on mutual respect and in no way prejudice the legitimate interests of those Powers.260.	If world peace cannot be established unless several prerequisites are met  including the achievement of political equity among the nations of the world  that equity nevertheless cannot be realized without economic equity. The set of realities  economic and other factors that swept away the foundations of the traditional economic structure of the worldâespecially when we view that structure in the light of the increasingly acute crises of food shortages  unbalanced growth and population explosionâcreated the necessity of reconsidering the structure and foundation of the international economic system in order to find appropriate solutions for those problems and to make the system more capable of establishing equity while respecting the rights of all the countries of the world  whether developed or developing.261.	The aim of establishing a new international order is to prevent the pooling of the wealth of the world in certain States and instead to channel and direct this wealth  in real terms  to the developing countries. This aim  even if it requires short-term sacrifices  represents  in the long run  the opportunity for the advanced industrial States to maintain continued economic growth. The transfer of wealth to the developing countries enhances the potential of development and lessens the degree of rivalry in the commercial and industrial fields among the industrial States arising from keen competition and the curtailing of opportunities for marketing their products. Consequently  this will bring about a relaxation of world tensions in general.262.	We wonder how we  as a developing nation  can accept the blame .or the current economic situation when  in the first instance  we are one of its principal victims. The advanced and industrial States  first and foremost  should be held responsible for this situation. Consequently  it is their responsibility to assist the developing countries in their efforts to industrialize while co-ordinating their new industries with their natural resources and the needs of local and international markets. They should also transfer technology to these developing countries. The Eastern industrial States should contribute to this effort as well. Their international responsibility in this respect is not less than that of the Western industrial States. Certainly  the developing countries should bear a considerable share of the responsibility. They should redouble their efforts to absorb the aid they receive. They should also work hard to create an organized and carefully considered co-ordination between their resources and potential and avoid committing harmful blunders in exploiting their resources and managing their industries.263.	The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has spared no effort or opportunity to demonstrate its solidarity with the other developing countries seeking to establish this new economic order. It has expressed its readiness to contribute to any international effort aimed at the resumption of the dialogue in the relevant fields under a formula taking account of the aspirations of the developing States in particular and the Members of this international Organization in general. On the basis of this stand  the ""Kingdom of Saudi Arabia supports the trend towards holding international economic negotiations to discuss those world economic issues that have been raised and establish the new international economic system.264.	The object of holding the eleventh special session of the General Assembly was to assess the progress achieved in the establishment of the new economic order; and  on the basis of such an assessment  appropriate measures were to be taken to enhance the development of the developing nations and international economic co-operation. During that special session  the General Assembly achieved some success in relation to the main issues pertaining to the new international development strategy which  in turn  represents an important and vital part of the efforts exerted for the establishment of the new international economic order. But the session completely failed in its attempt to reach agreement on the round of global negotiations. That will not help to improve the prevailing atmosphere of mistrust among nations and will not strengthen international political stability.265.	The establishment of the new economic order requires an approach covering all aspects of economic and social development and based on the concept of co-operation and sacrifice. It behoves the advanced industrial States to realize that their technological progress and industrial superiority will not bring them prosperity and security unless they share that technological progress with the developing nations. The countries of the world are no longer isolated; in fact  they have taken long strides on the path of increasing and consolidating their interdependence. It is useless to place all the blame for certain deteriorating economic situations in the world on a certain State or group of States. In varying degrees  all States should be held responsible. That being so  the advanced industrial StatesâEastern or Westernâare bound to bear their full share of responsibility towards the international economy in general and the economies of the developing countries in particular.266.	At a time when we are stressing the need to achieve political and economic equity and social justice for all the peoples of the world  we in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia are deeply grieved at the recent unfortunate developments in our region affecting Iraq and Iran. We pray God the Almighty to crown with success the efforts of both the Islamic Conference and the United Nations to remove the reasons behind this conflict  put an end to the bloodshed and restore peace to these two countries. We also appreciate the roles played by President Zia-ul-Haq of Pakistan and the Secretary-General of the Islamic Conference  Mr. Habib Chatti. We are gratified by the good and hospitable reception extended to them by the two countries. We consider their initiative as the first step on what we hope will be the road to the settlement of the conflict between the two States.267.	We welcome the Iraqi Government's positive response to the cease-fire resolution and its unilateral announcement that it will comply with it. We consider that move as representing a positive step and initiative helping to clarify and improve the climate. We hope that the Government of Iran will also respond positively to that resolution. However  what is important is to see the good offices continued in order to put an end to the conflict without any foreign intervention  whether from the super-Powers or any other quarter.268.	Unfortunately  during the same year in which we are celebrating the independence of the State of Zimbabwe  we see another independent and sovereign State  Afghanistan  the victim of an invasion that deprived it of its independence. The dangerous situation created by the Soviet invasion and flagrant military occupation of Afghanistan has raised fears among the people of the region and posed a threat to its security and stability. It also threatens international peace and security. It is a matter of concern to all the peoples of the world. Accordingly  it is the duty of those peoples to assume their full responsibilities in opposing this aggression and regional expansion. It is an aggression and an intervention committed by a super-Power that constantly claimed to be pursuing a policy of international peace and friendship and proclaimed itself the protector of world peace against an independent and sovereign State  a full- fledged Member State of the United Nations  and a member of the Islamic Conference and the non-aligned movement. All attempts by the Soviet Union and the regime it imposed by force and coercion on the people of Afghanistan to find justification and fabricate pretexts for and allegations to cover and defend that intervention and aggression have failed. That is because intervention in the internal affairs of other States is totally rejected  since it is incompatible with the right of peoples to self-determination and deprives those peoples of the freedom to choose their own system of Government.269.	What renders that intervention more objectionable and reprehensible is the fact that it came from a super-Power' in such magnitude and violence as to attain the dimensions of an attempt physically to obliterate the people of Afghanistan  with acts of aggression committed against the sanctity of mosques and peaceful villages  and their strafing with napalm bombs. It has gone even so far as using chemical means of warfare and attacking the most fundamental principles of human rights.270.	Unfortunately  the world community has failed so far to adopt decisive measures to put an end to the Soviet military occupation of Afghanistan and to the inhuman actions committed by the Soviet army of occupation there. However  the States members of the Islamic Conference  with one voice  have shown the world the serious dimensions of that intervention  condemned the Soviet Union and stressed their demand for an unconditional and complete withdrawal of the Soviet military presence from Afghanistan and non-recognition of and non-co-operation with the regime established there.271.	We call on the other States of the world to help and support the Islamic Conference in its stand against the action taken by the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. We call upon them to denounce such action  to support the struggle of the people of Afghanistan and to work for the elimination of injustice  oppression and occupation so as to enable the Afghan people to free itself  to secure its right to freedom and independence and to enjoy sovereignty over its territory. None of those objectives will be achieved unless and until the Soviet Union withdraws completely and unconditionally from Afghanistan.272.	Thirty-two years agoâmore specifically on 29 November 1947âforces from the East and West combined and collaborated to partition Palestine  in total disregard of international law and against the will and wishes of the majority of the population of Palestine. Under the partition scheme the now so-called State of Israel was given half the Palestinian homeland. The Palestinians were driven from their homes and their rights and lands were usurped. Later  Israel devoured the remainder of the Palestinian territory. Not satisfied with all that  it has gone further and occupied lands of neighbouring Arab States  Members of this Organization. In its arrogance  its challenging of and scorn for the international community  Israel has been encouraged by the unconditional support that it receives from the United States. The Security Council has been rendered powerless and unable to adopt a resolution to deter Israel; and every resolution adopted by the General Assembly denouncing and warning Israelâwhich owes its very existence to a resolution adopted by this Organizationâis ignored and goes unheeded by Israel. Israel's stand and actions run counter to those resolutions. What is more  Israel has been attacking the United Nations and accusing it of bias and prejudice  and may ultimately accuse it of anti-Semitism.273.	The General Assembly has adopted dozens of resolutions on the question of Palestine and the Middle East. The Security Council has also adopted several resolutions on the same matter. But as long as those resolutions fail to provide for sanctions  Israel will continue to ignore them and publicly announce its determination to challenge them.274.	It is worth mentioning that this year the Security Council adopted three resolutions on the Holy City of Jerusalemâresolutions 465 (1980)  476 (1980) and 478 (1980). In the second and third resolutions  the Security Council firmly and decisively declared that Israel's proclamation of the City of Jerusalem as its capital is basically null and void. The Security Council called upon all States not to recognize that Israeli measure and called on those States which had established diplomatic missions in Jerusalem to withdraw them.275.	Accordingly  and on the basis of those two resolutions  my Government objects to the participation of the Israeli delegation in the deliberations of this and future sessions of the General Assembly. Israel does not enjoy a privileged status that allows it to ignore and challenge United Nations resolutions.276.	In the name of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  I should like to extend our thanks and profound gratitude and appreciation to all the States which have complied with the resolutions of the Security Council and withdrawn their missions from Jerusalem. The stand they took was based on principle.277.	The Zionist aggression represents the greatest challenge and the most dangerous threat to the goals for which the United Nations was established. The continuation of that challenge and threat subverts the effectiveness of the Organization and shows disrespect for the aims and principles of its Charter. The tool of that aggression  that is Israel  has not been satisfied with its aggression against the Palestinian people  coupled with colonial and settlement practices  persistently carried out in those territories occupied by force with a view to emptying the land of its rightful population. Israel has gone further in its aggression: it has annexed other Arab areas  sown the seeds of subversion and destruction in the neighbouring countries and desecrated the Holy Places in Jerusalemâyes  the Holy Places revered in all revealed religions and by believers everywhere.278.	Israel  having secured for itself continued human  military  economic and political support from the great Powers  led by the United States  and feeling assured of success for its schemes to sow dissension and division in the ranks of the Arab world  went further and challenged and showed disrespect for Arab and Islamic feelings and world public opinion. It decided to annex Jerusalem  proclaim it its capital and ignore  with unprecedented arrogance  the relevant resolutions of the international community whether adopted by the United Nations  the Islamic Conference  the League of Arab States  the non-aligned Movement or other international organizations.279.	Those practices  coupled with other crimes against religions  international values  traditions and rules  are not new. But what is strange is to see Israel continuing its aggression and at the same time claiming that it is seeking peace. However  its conduct and intransigence belie its assertions of peace and show clearly the falsehood of its pretensions. Israel remains a racist and expansionist State.280.	While Israel continues its aggressive practices  the Arab countries have tended towards settlement by peaceful means. That tendency does not stem from weakness or defeatism; it stems from the Arabs' keen interest in seeing the world avoid the horrors and woes of war and in maintaining international peace and security. The Arab States are seeking a just and permanent peace through the adoption of the principle of international legitimacy. They have spared no effort and have done everything possible to give momentum to the advancement of peace in the region. The courageous and heroic residents of the West Bank have stood up and struggled against the criminal actions of Israel in all occupied territories and they are still resisting and making sacrifices  regardless of their daily sufferings from the cruellest forms of oppression  torture  liquidation and deprivation. But Israel  by the aims of its racist and expansionist policies against the Palestinian people and international legitimacy; by its repeated barbaric acts of aggression against southern Lebanon  in violation of international rules of law and ethics. the ideals and values of mankind; and recently by its annexation of Jerusalem which it has declared its eternal capital  Israel  I repeat  is dissipating every Arab hope and all prospects for achieving a just and comprehensive peace  thereby obstructing stability in the Middle East and pushing the region towards a crossroads.281.	Confronted with these challenges  the Arab countries have exercised self-restraint and sought peace. Their position stems from their Islamic principles  which call for peace  from their keen desire to avoid the horrors of war in the region and in the world and from their preoccupation with the development of their social and economic resources  while achieving internal security  peace and stability. But Israeli challenges and practices are forcing the Arab nation to react in self-defence and protect its inalienable and legitimate rights  which cannot be trifled with. We believe that nobody can fairly attribute blame to our nation  after all the good intentions it has shown and the desire it has demonstrated for peace based on righteousness and justice. Our nation has exhausted all possible ways and means of achieving that goal. Yet those efforts have met with hostility  scorn and further challenges. I do not think anyone will blame us if we mobilize our potentialities and devote our resources and capabilities to repelling Zionist aggression  based as it is on religious  racist and military arrogance and on greedy expansionist ambitions.282.	The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  faced with dangerous Israeli practices which aggravate the conditions in the region and the Israeli challenges to the feelings of the peoples of the region has no recourse but to call for a jihad in order to establish the supremacy of right and justice and to eliminate falsehoods. In calling for this we aim at restoring usurped rights and defending the profaned Holy Places. The jihad we call for begins with self and involves dedication and pooling all our potentialities and spiritual  cultural  physical and military capabilities in one melting-pot. This call is as important to hundreds of millions of Christians as it is to hundreds of millions of Moslems. It requires the development of Islamic-Christian co-operation to rescue Jerusalem. This is the only way to free Jerusalem from the grip of racist Zionism.283.	Genuine peace in the Middle East region will not be established without full recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to the establishment of its own independent State and until the Israelis withdraw from all the occupied Arab territories  including  first and foremost  Jerusalem.284.	There can be no real peace in the Middle East as long as Israel continues to establish Jewish settlements in usurped Palestinian and Arab territories.285.	True peace will not prevail in the Middle East while Israel continues to violate the most basic human rights of the Palestinians in the occupied territories and to subject them to various kinds of torture and terrorism.286.	Genuine peace will not prevail in the Middle East until Israel desists from its repeated barbaric acts of aggression against the Lebanese people and its land  ignoring the presence of the United Nations forces. Peace will not be attained unless the United Nations resolutions are implemented and those States that support Israel take clear-cut positions regarding aggressive Israeli practices and practical steps to guarantee the restoration of their legitimate rights to those deprived from them.287.	Last  but not least  genuine peace will not prevail in the Middle East as long as Israel continues its expansionist schemes and racist policies.288.	What the United Nations and the peoples of the world aspire to  in terms of a just and comprehensive peace in all parts of the world  can be realized if intentions are genuine and sincere and if all peoples and Governments of the world mobilize all their resources and capabilities  sacrifice all that is precious to them and co-operate constructively and positively among themselves for the benefit of all and to give momentum to the march of mankind towards a better and brighter future."
"119",6073,"SDN",35,1980,"ï»¿175.	I have the pleasure  on behalf of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of the Sudan  of extending to Mr. von Wechmar our sincere congratulations on his unanimous election to the presidency of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. The Sudan  which enjoys cordial and developing relations with his country  is confident that his varied experience in the political and diplomatic fields  especially in the work of the United Nations  qualify him to occupy the Chair and to contribute to the success of the deliberations at this session.176.	My delegation wishes to express its appreciation to Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim  the outgoing President of the General Assembly  which during his term held four important sessions to consider international political and economic issues of great concern to the international community. The achievements under Mr. Salim's presidency are a source of pride for the peoples of the third world in general and to the peoples of Africa in particular.177.	My delegation welcomes the accession of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to membership of the United Nations. We are confident that this new Member will enrich the work of the Organization. The admission of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to the United Nations proves that the Organization is about to achieve its universality.178.	We meet at this session at a time when the world is passing through a critical period characterized by complexity and escalating tension that further diminishes the chances for peace and detente. With the exception of the achievement of independence by Zimbabwe  the gloomy predictions and apprehensions regarding the state of international relations voiced by many delegations during the thirty-fourth session have been confirmed by the events of the past year. It was a turbulent year  in which the world was buffeted by serious political and economic crises which presented a tough challenge to the United Nations and which necessitated holding two emergency special sessions in January and July and a special session in August and September. The situation  however  remained unchanged: deterioration in international relations  continuous flaring up in regional conflicts and an increase in the use of force  persistence of the economic crisis and deadlock in negotiations on international economic issues. The United Nations is thus faced with insurmountable difficulties which render incapable of carrying out its responsibility and playing its role in the political and economic arenas and in realizing its noble objectives in promoting international co-operation and preserving world peace and security.179.	It is regrettable that even today the policy of dividing the world into spheres of influence is still actively pursued. As a result some of the countries of the third world are denied the exercise of their legitimate right to independence and to sovereignty over their natural resources. The Sudan  in reiterating its commitment to and respect for the Charter and international law and conventions  has rejected and will continue to reject an international system that is based on power politics and the division of the world into spheres of influence. We reject such a system because it contradicts and suppresses our aspirations to true independence  sovereignty and true democratic international relations. Therefore we condemn and denounce any foreign intervention or interference  from whatever source  in the domestic affairs of any country. Foreign intervention  in whatever form  is irreconcilable with the duties and obligations of the States Members of the United Nations. It threatens not only the independence and sovereignty of countries but also international peace and security.180.	The Soviet intervention in Afghanistan  to take a recent example  is still a source of concern to the international community because of its serious repercussions and implications in the region and the world at large. The General Assembly has  of course  met in emergency special session and has clearly pronounced itself on the issue in its resolution ES-6/2. However  today  that resolution notwithstanding  the situation in Afghanistan remains unchanged. Therefore we call on the Assembly to consider the situation in Afghanistan  in order to take the appropriate measures that will ensure the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Afghanistan and guarantee its independence  sovereignty and non-aligned status.181.	The ongoing war between Iraq and Iran  two neighbouring Moslem countries that have strong historical ties  is deeply deplored by the Government and people of the Sudan. It is also deplored by all Moslem peoples  who are saddened and pained at this bloodshed between Moslems. We appeal to those two brotherly countries to put an end to this bloodshed and wasting of potential  to renounce the use of force and to resort to the procedure of dialogue and negotiations. We hope that the initiative of the Islamic Conference and other initiatives will succeed in containing the conflict and in bringing about an immediate end to the war  so that Islamic capabilities and potentialities may be spared and properly oriented towards social and economic reconstruction and the confrontation of the common enemy.182.	The situation in the Indian Ocean is deteriorating at an alarming rate. The conflict is widening to engulf new areas. The fleets of the big Powers are rushing to the scene.We in the Sudan  alarmed and concerned  are closely following these serious developments. We believe it is imperative that urgent and serious action be undertaken now to defuse this explosive situation which threatens the security and the very survival of us all. The Sudan emphasizes once again the importance of adopting practical measures to implement General Assembly resolution 2832 (XXVI)  which contains the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace. This cannot be achieved unless we opt for a genuine international collective security system and refrain from joining military alliances. Therefore the Sudan calls upon all the States of the region to refrain from joining in military pacts and alliances of any kind. We declare our support  once more  for the right of all States to free navigation of the Indian Ocean for peaceful purposes  in accordance with international law and conventions. This is an international objective and responsibility that calls for a collective commitment and solidarity. The concerted efforts of the littoral and hinterland States of the region  though indispensable  will not be enough to achieve that objective unless reinforced and supplemented by the co-operation of the big Powers and the major maritime users. Now that the Sudan is a member of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean  we take this opportunity to reaffirm our commitment and readiness to work seriously within that Committee towards the crystallization of the objectives and principles we have already mentioned and for the preparation of the Conference on the Indian Ocean to be held at Colombo in 1981.183.	Another important factor is that peace and security in the Indian Ocean will not be realized unless the littoral and hinterland States of the region cultivate and pursue friendly and good-neighbourly relations among themselves. We  for our part  have always believed in that principle and have always been guided by it in our relations with our neighbours.184.	The situation in the Middle East is increasingly and menacingly deteriorating every day. The mass media keep assiduously informing us of the dangerous and catastrophic incidents occurring there which threaten world peace and security. The numerous urgent meetings held by the Security Council on the situation in the Middle East during this year bear testimony to that fact. In his report on the work of the Organization the Secretary-General has pointed out that the Middle East question is unique in its complexity and widespread repercussions. Eventually the Assembly should devote most of its time and efforts at this session to taking positive measures to ensure the implementation of the resolutions already adopted instead of adopting more resolutions. The origins and dimensions of this question are no longer subject to any manoeuvres  tricks or pretence at justification. The international community has become fully aware of it and has clearly pronounced itself on it on many occasions  most recently at the seventh emergency special session  last July.185.	The Sudan has repeatedly expressed its belief in the possibility of a just and peaceful solution to the Middle East problem  provided that the genuine will exists and that expansionist and hegemonistic ambitions are disavowed. Peace cannot be established permanently in that area except on a just and comprehensive basis.186.	The inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  particularly their right to self-determination and the establishment of an independent State on their territory need no reiteration since they are completely recognized by the international community represented in this Assembly as well as other forums. The cause of the rights of the Arab Palestinian people is the core of the Middle East conflict  therefore no permanent  peaceful and just solution can be achieved if that question is neglected or bypassed. The barbaric Israeli acts against the Palestinians in the occupied territories and refugee camps aimed at exterminating them and defeating their cause are criminal acts. In spite of various policies of torture  expulsion and intimidation  Israel will never be able to defeat and suppress the will of the valiant Palestinian people in their struggle for liberation  which is supported by the Arab nation and all friendly and peace-loving nations. Israel  after 30 years of illegal existence  should learn the lessons of history. The recent example of Zimbabwe proves that the will of the people can never be defeated and that their aspirations to freedom and dignity will sooner or later be realized.187.	The recent Israeli legislation declaring Al Qodsâ Jerusalemâthe eternal capital of Israel confirms the arrogance and intransigence of the isolated Zionist entity. While the Security Council and the General Assembly frequently meet and adopt resolutions condemning and denouncing Israeli brutalities against and torture of Arab citizens and their leaders in the occupied Arab territories  the establishment of new settlements and the violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon  Israel continues to defy the resolutions of the highest international organs responsible for the maintenance of peace and security. Such defiance and disregard of United Nations resolutions  the Charter and the will of the international community are the direct causes of the deteriorating situation in the Middle East. Unless the international community adopts concrete measures to put an end to the Israeli arrogance and intransigence and its continuing defiance of resolutions of the highest international organs responsible for the maintenance of peace and security  it will have to face the serious repercussions of the conflict in the area.188.	The Arab nation has confirmed its belief in a peaceful  just and permanent solution of the Middle East question. In declaring its commitment to a peaceful settlement  the Arab nation has also reaffirmed its position  namely  that the Middle East conflict is not amenable to compartmentalization or partial solutions. However  it is a source of hope that the international will represented in the General Assembly  at its seventh emergency special session  confirmed that Arab conception and demonstrated that partial and unilateral solutions would not affect the roots of the conflict. At that same session it emphasized the need to give effect to the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people under the leadership of their sole and authentic representative  PLO.189.	The creation of obstacles in order to delay the peaceful  comprehensive and just solution desired by the Arab nation and the international community as a whole  could cause tension to escalate and lead the region to a devastating war. To avoid that explosive situation  which endangers all nations and indeed all human heritage  the United Nations should shoulder its responsibility for the achievement of a peaceful  comprehensive  just and permanent solution to the Middle East conflict. The United Nations  in our view  is the appropriate body for the attainment of a peaceful settlement of the Middle East conflict  in accordance with the principles and purposes of the Charter. At this session the General Assembly is called upon to put all issues pertaining to the Middle East question in their proper perspective and to adopt appropriate measures to enable the United Nations to carry out its responsibility for the achievement of the peaceful  comprehensive and just settlement that will resolve the conflict in an area which is of vital strategic  political and economic importance to the whole world.190.	In southern Africa the situation is deteriorating steadily and is a serious threat  to the peace and security not only of Africa but of the entire world. On the question of Namibia  we  together with the rest of Africa  have repeatedly expressed a genuine desire to resolve the problems of southern Africa peacefully and have welcomed and supported the initiative of the five Western Powers regarding Namibia. Within the group of African States  we have also affirmed our commitment to exert every effort to ensure implementation of the plan for a peaceful settlement. However  the machinations and delaying tactics employed by the racist regime of Pretoria to abort that plan have greatly diminished the chances of a peaceful settlement in Namibia.191.	We therefore condemn the perpetuation of the occupation of Namibia and the looting of its natural resources by the racist regime of Pretoria. We condemn and reject all the measures and steps implemented by racist Pretoria to deny the Namibian people the exercise of their right to self- determination and national independence and to install a puppet regime in Windhoek that represents and defends the interests of the racists in Pretoria  not the interests of the Namibian people. My country reiterates here its declared firm stand on the illegality of the unilateral elections conducted by the racist regime of South Africa in Namibia and of the institutions that resulted therefrom. Any government that emerges in Windhoek must be the result of free elections conducted under United Nations supervision according to the agreed plan.192.	The serious and deteriorating situation in Namibia makes it imperative for the Security Council to carry out its responsibilities as specified in the Charter by urgently imposing on the racist regime in Pretoria the necessary effective sanctions for the maintenance of international peace and security. If the Security Council fails to carry out its responsibilities  there will be no alternative to armed struggle by the people of Namibia under the leadership of SWAPO  their sole legitimate representative  with assistance and support from the African people and friendly nations which cherish peace and freedom. I should like to reiterate here the commitment of my Government to continue to extend all possible support to SWAPO until the Namibian people have regained their independence and sovereignty.193.	We also hail the heroic role played by the African front-line States in the battle to liberate Namibia and reaffirm our commitment to support them in their struggle. In this connection  we call upon all sister and friendly nations and all nations which love peace and freedom to give SWAPO and the front-line African States the support that will ensure victory in the struggle for the liberation and independence of Namibia.194.	Many years have elapsed since the international com-munity condemned the inhuman policy of apartheid viciously pursued by the white racist minority in South Africa. Numerous resolutions have been adopted by the United Nations and other regional and international organizations denouncing that policy  but the racist regime in Pretoria  persisting in its intransigence and its defiance of international will  made it impossible to implement those resolutions  and as a result the majority of the people of South Africa are still denied the exercise of their fundamental human rights.195.	The recent minor reforms and legislative measures introduced by the racist regime of Pretoria  which were applauded by some circles as positive developments  are nothing more than superficial cosmetic changes in the ugly face of apartheid to stem the rising tide of resentment and resistance internally and to buy acceptance and approval abroad.196.	The atrocious policies and practices of that racist regime  which include discrimination  repression  torture  daily organized violation of human rights and the establishment of new bantustans  are glaring evidence that no real change or reform is taking place and that the regime is still defying and disregarding the will of the international community as embodied in resolutions adopted against apartheid. The international will and determination that defeated and eliminated Nazism and fascism is called upon today to stand firmly in the face of apartheid and to help the majority in South Africa to regain its freedom  dignity and basic- rights. We call upon all Member States to uphold the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and to desist from engaging in any kind of co-operation with the racist minority regime in South Africa.197.	As well as being concerned over the international situation as a whole as it pertains to the Middle East and Africa  we are concerned also with areas of conflict and tension all over the world. With regard to Cyprus  we note and appreciate the efforts exerted by the Secretary-General  which came to fruition in the high level 10-point agreement of May 1979. We are pleased that intercommunal talks are now underway and that agreement has been reached to proceed to the substantive stage of the talks. We sincerely hope that this positive step will result in peace and national unity for Cyprus.198.	As regards Korea  we are concerned that the country is still divided  in spite of the aspirations of its people to achieve reunification by peaceful means. The continuation of the present situation poses a serious threat to peace and stability in that area. It is gratifying  however  to note that the Korean people in the North and the South are exerting serious efforts to reunify the peninsula peacefully and without foreign intervention.199.	The serious economic crisis facing the world today necessitates that the international community confront it with wisdom  objectivity  universality and far-sightedness  shunning confrontation and the pursuit of narrow national interests. The destiny of the world today is more interlinked and interdependent than at any time before. It is therefore evident that only through collective and positive action can we achieve development and prosperity for all peoples of the world. International action through international economic co-operation to establish the new international economic order will undoubtedly be in the common interest of all countries of the world  rich and poor. Neglecting serious and fruitful co-operation will surely lead to certain international disaster. It is fitting here to refer to the recently published 1980 annual report of the World Bank  in which it is stated  as a conclusion to the analysis of the world economy during the past decade  that all countries  rich and poor  will face a bleak future in which their stability and survival will be threatened unless they engage in serious co-operation in all economic fields. It is only natural that such an effort should entail greater concessions and sacrifices by the richer developed countries  since the end result will be in the common interest and to the mutual benefit of both developed and developing countries.200.	By proposing the launching of a new round of global economic negotiations  the developing countries have tried to give new impetus to the stumbling North-South dialogue and to accelerate progress towards establishing the new international economic order. The results of the eleventh special session were  however  frustrating and disappointing. The Assembly could not reach an agreement on the procedures of the proposed global negotiations and has failed to launch the negotiations. The developing countries have exhibited great flexibility and a genuine willingness to co-operate  in recognition of the importance of the global negotiations and in the conviction that the failure of the special session will have serious repercussions on the future of international economic co-operation and even on world peace and security. The failure of the special session is the inevitable result of the lack of political will on the part of a few developed countries and the fact that some major Powers are still prisoners of the traditional attitude towards the international economy  as pointed out by the Foreign Minister of Sweden before the Assembly on 23 September.201.	The setback to the North-South dialogue should not discourage developing countries from the pursuit of economic and technical co-operation among themselves. In this context  we laud the results of the second extraordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU  held at Lagos in April this year  the first such session devoted to economic matters. The Sudan has declared its full commitment to the African development strategy and to the Lagos Plan of Action for the Implementation of the Monrovia Strategy for the Economic Development of Africa. We are convinced that solving the economic problems of Africa  the poorest and most underdeveloped continent  must start first in Africa  and that collective self-reliance is the only approach to the realization of economic and social development in Africa and the third world. It is also the principal means of achieving economic independence and actively participating in the economic activities directed towards the establishment of the new international economic order. We are confident that the international community will support Africa's efforts by supporting the Lagos Plan of Action to implement the African development strategy.202.	In unanimously adopting General Assembly resolution S-11/4 regarding the critical economic situation of the least developed countries  the international community reiterated its concern over the problems of those countries. We hope that this attention and concern will result in concrete measures to assist those countries to overcome their basic structural problems and to proceed towards the realization of economic development. We also hope that the international community will  during the current session  continue its efforts to ensure adequate preparation for the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries  to be held in 1981. We attach great importance to that Conference  as it symbolizes the climax of international action in favour of the least developed countries. We expect that Conference to adopt urgent and concrete measures to ensure massive transfer of financial and technical resources to those countries in the context of the Substantial New Programme of Action for the 1980s to be elaborated and adopted by the Conference. We also expect the Conference to consider seriously the recommendations of the UNCTAD Intergovernmental Group on the Least Developed Countries  with a view to implementing them.203.	The Sudan  one of the least developed countries  is deeply concerned at the fact that vast resources are being squandered annually on the arms race. The sum of $450 billion is spent on military installations and hardware  while millions of people around the world are starving to death and others are victims of poverty and disease. The international community is called upon to put an end to this irrational state of affairs and this irrational rule. Serious and urgent action must be undertaken towards complete disarmament and the utilization of the financial and human resources thus freed in developing the developing countries  particularly the least developed among them  and for the prosperity of all mankind.204.	In concluding my statement before the Assembly  I find it fitting to address myself to the refugee problem. The Secretary-General has pointed out in his report that natural disasters and military and political conflicts have created millions of refugees around the world. That the majority of these refugees are in Africa is a fact which is often neglected  together with the fact that African countries hosting these refugees are facing serious difficulties. The situation of African refugees in the Sudan deserves special attention and consideration. The Sudan  because of its particular geographical location  is adjacent to many African countries which suffered or are still suffering natural disasters  political crises or civil wars resulting in the exodus of about half a million refugees into the Sudan looking for refuge and sustenance. Because of the heavy burden of taking care of half a million refugees  the Government of the Sudan declared 1980 a Year of Refugees in the Sudan. The objective is to highlight the plight of these refugees and solicit international assistance. The focal point of the programme for the Year was the International Conference on Refugees in the Sudan  held at Khartoum in June 1980. We take this opportunity to express from this important rostrum our appreciation and gratitude to the States and regional and international voluntary and intergovernmental organizations  particularly the United Nations and its agencies  whose effective participation and contribution made that Conference a success. We are particularly grateful to the Secretary-General and his senior assistants for the personal interest they have shown in the Year and the Conference and to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and his aides for the positive role they played in preparing for and participating in the Conference. We are also grateful to the States members of the Economic and Social Council  which unanimously adopted its resolution 1980/10 calling upon Governments  the United Nations and other organizations to render all possible assistance to the refugees in the Sudan. We are particularly grateful to the head of the United Nations interagency mission and its other members who prepared a report on the situation of refugees in the Sudan and on programmes of assistance to them.205.	The Khartoum Conference has studied all aspects of the problems of refugees in the Sudan and indicated the size and the quality of the assistance required to provide them with basic necessities. We are confident that the international community  represented in this forum  will respond generously to the appeal of the Conference for the financial and material assistance necessary for the implementation of the measures and recommendations adopted by the Conference  which are reflected in the report of the interagency mission.206.	This is the international situation on the threshold of the 1980sâone characterized by tension  instability  lack of peace and security and gloomy economic and social prospects. If this precarious situation is allowed to deteriorate further  the outcome will inevitably be disastrous. As the world today is inextricably interdependent  international co-operation stands as the only option for satisfying the common interest and maintaining peace and security. But this will not be achieved in the absence of the necessary political will to act collectively. We harbour great hopes that this Organization will  if we adhere to its noble principles and objectives  succeed in maintaining world peace and security and achieving prosperity for all mankind. My delegation will therefore spare no effort to work together with other delegations towards the achievement of these goals  and we shall sincerely cooperate with all delegations believing in the objectives of the United Nations and committed to their attainment."
"120",6119,"SEN",35,1980,"ï»¿Mr. President  the excellent relations which unite our two countries  the Federal Republic of Germany and the Republic of Senegal  are the reason for our pleasure in seeing you assume the lofty post of President of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. I should like to congratulate you on behalf of my country and Government.103.	I should also like to take this opportunity to pay a well-deserved tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Salim of the United Republic of Tanzania. The competence  intelligence and wisdom he demonstrated throughout the many sessions which were held during the year under his presidency did particular honour to the African continent.104.	I should like also to discharge another duty  that of expressing gratitude to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim. Senegal  through me  would like to thank him in particular for the efforts that he made to free our compatriot  Warrant Officer Papa Coly Sarr  who was unjustly detained by the Israeli Government when that Senegalese soldier was taking part  courageously and with self-sacrifice  in the peace-keeping operation in the Middle East. The attitude of Mr. Waldheim and his colleagues throughout this affair  which we mentioned here last year  was further proof that law and justice  coupled with patient persistence in matters of principle  always finally triumph over incomprehension and intolerance.105.	My delegation also welcomes the membership of a new State in the Organization  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. My Government would like to assure that State of its entire willingness to co-operate with it.106.	This is another opportunity for Senegal to welcome the presence of Zimbabwe  a multiracial State  in our midst. The birth of that State is a victory for the people of Zimbabwe  but also for the United Nations as well. Accordingly this historic event should provide an example in the resolution of the difficult problems of southern Africa which continue to be of concern to us.107.	A year ago  from this very rostrum  I voiced the great hopes of the international community in a perturbed and uncertain world. The past year has been rich in events. Poverty has continually beset the great majority of the populations of the world  those of the countries of the third world. Even the rich countries were not spared the disruptive phenomena: political instability  unemployment  inflation  recession and sometimes even stagnation.108.	Pockets of tension have been created here and there  seriously threatening international peace and security.109.	These  in sum  are the fears that we feel in the face of the succession and exacerbation of all kinds of imbalances to which the community of men has been more and more subjected.110.	That is why we would draw the attention of the international community to the important responsibility incumbent upon us to establish the conditions necessary for the full attainment of economic  social and cultural rights of man and peoples  as an essential means of ensuring to each individual the effective enjoyment of civil and political rights and fundamental freedoms  so that an era of peace  happiness and solidarity can be ushered into the world.111.	Considerable efforts are made along these lines each year  notwithstanding all kinds of obstacles and constraints  notwithstanding ideological confrontations and struggles for influence  because in the final analysis the salvation of humanity  as we understand it  is in the hands of the nations we represent in the Assembly.112.	My country  Senegal  has always attached particular importance to the establishment among these nations of a climate of peace and a network of abiding solidarity  without which no viable solution can be found to the complex and grave problems which are confronting the world today.113.	Our foremost concern in this respect is the situation still prevailing in southern Africa  and in particular in Namibia and South Africa. The South African Government  supported materially  financially and militarily by certain industrialized States  continues to disregard with impunity the recommendations of the Organization.114.	Thus  three and a half years after the adoption of the settlement plan which was to conduct Namibia to independence  the South African Government  through manoeuvres  the motives and aims of which are obvious  is trying to promote the establishment of institutions and bodies designed to lead to an ""internal"" settlement  as if the edifying example of Zimbabwe had not provided a lesson for those who want to turn their backs on history.115.	It is not enough for it to proclaim its willingness to implement the settlement plan of the United Nations  and to demand at the same time the impartiality of neighbouring States  suggesting the creation of a demilitarized zone between them  because at the same time the South African Government is continuing its raids against those States  in particular against the fraternal people of Angola  under the pretext of the right of hot pursuit from Namibia  which has been illegally occupied.116.	Senegal considers that the settlement plan constitutes the only valid and viable approach to finding a final solution to the question of Namibia. In this respect  the independence of Zimbabwe is once again of very particular importance. President Leopold Sedar Senghor said of this:""This independence proved to the international community that the African peoples were rebelling against bondage. It showed that the law of the minority cannot be imposed indefinitely on a people determined to recover its freedom. Finally  it showed that peoples retain deep in their ancestral memory a capacity for resistance which foils the calculations of the most able politicians.""117.	That is why there is no doubt that the present manoeuvres by South Africa will never break down the determination of SWAPO  under the guidance of our brother Sam Nujoma  to conduct its people to independence.118.	It is fitting to pay a tribute once more to the Secretary-General for the efforts that he tirelessly exerts with a view to the implementation of the United Nations settlement plan.119.	South Africa  in its letter dated 29 August 1980  questioned the impartiality of the Secretary-General  attributing to him the responsibility for the delay in the implementation of the plan. Obviously these accusations are diversionary tactics of the type South Africa has accustomed us to. Has it not once again shown its inclination to hold up the implementation of the settlement plan of the United Nations  by deciding to organize elections in Namibia next month to choose authorities at the second administrative level who will be responsible for the administration of tribal affairs?120.	It will be remembered that on 8 December 1978 South Africa organized elections on the same conditions  which produced an assembly which was contested and then  in July 1980  the constitution of a Council of Ministers  which was also challenged.121.	The acts committed by South Africa in Namibia look strangely like those incessantly perpetrated by the Israeli Government in the occupied Arab territories and in Jerusalem. The countries in the contact group  for their part  which have made an effort and taken initiatives which no one can deny  should actively support the Secretary-General in this decisive phase of the evolution of the Namibian question. Accordingly  the Assembly should reaffirm its resolve to put an end to the shady doings of the South African Government in Namibia.122.	The Security Council  in drawing up the settlement plan  omitted or ignored the United Nations Council for Namibia  which the General Assembly recognized as having full responsibility for administering Namibia. That gap should be filled. The implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) remains the basis of an acceptable solution of this problem.123.	The policy of apartheid and racial discrimination of the South African Government is for my country another cause of disquiet. It has given rise to the general condemnation of the international community. In addition  the segregation to which the black population of South Africa has fallen victim because it is based on racial and cultural prejudice is a deep-seated insult to the conscience of mankind.124.	When we underscore the right of the people of South Africa to exercise their right to self-determination  we are not invoking any racial or ethnic considerations. The law of the majority should prevail within a multiracial society  mobilized  as in Zimbabwe  to ensure its happiness in solidarity and unity.125.	Senegal  which has never stinted its support to the liberation movements  ANC and PAC  considers that there will never be peace in this world as long as the racist minority continues to deny the majority its fundamental right to a life of dignity and freedom. Together we shall pursue our common effort along these lines.126.	In regard to Western Sahara  at the seventeenth ordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU  held at Freetown last July  my country advocated the establishment of a dynamic African compromise among all parties to the conflict in order to put an end to it  in the obvious interest of all peoples of that particular region and the African continent in general.127.	The Ad Hoc Committee of the OAU  after the meeting held in September 1980 in Freetown  submitted a new proposal in the obvious interest of our entire continent. That is why my country considers that the OAU should continue to study the case without hindrance of any kind and protected from any initiative that might compromise the present position  which gives cause for some optimism.128.	Regarding the Comorian island of Mayotte  our country will continue to encourage the parties concerned to engage in continuous dialogue in accordance with resolution 34/69 especially as the parties concerned  the French Republic and the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros  have never rejected the procedure of a trusting and fruitful dialogue.129.	If we mention the question of Chad briefly  it is to emphasize the fact that it is time for us to act together in the spirit of the resolution and recommendations of the OAU to assist the fraternal people of Chadâwithout any desire to interfere in its internal affairsâto find a way out of the tragic situation from which it has been suffering for six months without any immediate hope of an end to that heart-rending conflict.130.	The Lagos agreement  signed by the 11 parties to the conflict in August 1979  seemed to open the way to peace and national reconstruction for the people of Chad. If the present situation continues  it will be opportune to implement the recommendation of the OAU  to call  in specified conditions  on United Nations forces  composed solely of African blue berets  to ensure the return of peace to that country and the implementation of the provisions of the Lagos agreement. The need for that action  which was envisaged at the seventeenth ordinary session of the Assembly of the OAU  seems more urgent than ever today.131.	In concluding my remarks on Africa  I should like on behalf of my country to make an appeal to the international community. In our continent we have recently seen a transposition of the struggles for influence and hegemony which formerly rent Asia asunder to ideological or economic bases.132.	The international community should concern itself increasingly with respect of the right of peoples to self- determination  to decide freely on their development and the ways that are most likely to lead them to that development  bearing in mind their own history  culture and fundamental characteristics. Thus any attempt to destabilize Africa  through zones or countries  on the basis of different political or ideological options  whether those attempts stem from African countries or non-African countries  should be vehemently condemned  and the States responsible should be denounced.133.	It is at this price and this price alone that our continent will be able  given its diversity and the complementarity of its potential and riches  to secure its own development  in security  so that we can contribute to international peace and security.134.	The problem of the Middle East is one of the most serious problems confronting our present-day world. My Government therefore remains convinced that only a just and comprehensive solution of that problem can bring about lasting peace in the region  and the final solution of that question resides essentially in the exercise  by the fraternal people of Palestine  of all its inalienable rights  including its right to establish an independent sovereign State in its own homeland.135.	Senegal  as the Assembly knows  has always sup-ported General Assembly resolution 181 (II)  which foresaw the establishment of two States in Palestine  a Jewish one and an Arab one. The Jewish one has been created and we think it is only fair that the international community should assist in the creation of the Arab State in Palestine. In this respect  the intransigence of Israel makes it responsible for the persistence of tension in that part of the world. Israel not only refuses to evacuate the Arab territories occupied by force in 1967  notwithstanding the many resolutions adopted by the Security Council  the OAU  the General Assembly  the Islamic Conference and the non-aligned movement  but also is increasing the number of its illegal settlements with the same disregard for international law.136.	As we said at this rostrum during the seventh emergency special session on Palestine  convened on the initiative of Senegal and certain other members of the Assembly  the Palestinian people is a major people  and if any settlement of the question of Palestine is to be viable it must of necessity be reached with the full participation of that people through its legitimate  sole and authentic representative  the PLO  under the guidance of its Chairman  Mr. Yasser Arafat.137.	Today  the implementation of that right is demanded by more than 100 countries. It would be unrealistic and dangerous to reduce the right of the Palestinian people to create a sovereign State in Palestine to a mere right to administrative autonomy  without any real content  without any true significance. That solution has been irrevocably rejected by the principal parties concerned  in particular the Palestinians themselves.138.	My delegation considers  therefore  that it is urgent that negotiations be undertaken to settle the Palestinian matter in conformity with the principles contained in the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly. But  and we cannot repeat this too often  the PLO must of necessity be associated in all phases of those negotiations and at all levels.139.	At the seventh emergency special session  on the question of Palestine  almost all the members of the international community expressed their conviction that the participation of the Palestinian people' was fundamental and essential in all efforts to establish a just settlement of the Middle East conflict.140.	The problem of the Middle East  as we know  is a complex and delicate one. But Israel must understand that it cannot indefinitely deny on the pretext of preserving the security of the Zionist State the fact of Palestine  the Palestinians' right to self-determination  their right to existence and an independent State in Palestine or  finally  their right of return to their homeland.141.	The establishment of Jewish settlements in the Arab territories must stop  as must the successive violations of the fourth Geneva Convention and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.142.	The City of Jerusalem  the cradle and common patrimony of revealed religions  must preserve its historical and religious nature; this was confirmed once more by the Security Council in its resolution 478 (1980) adopted on 20 August 1980 declaring null and void the unilateral annexation by Israel of the Holy City.143.	Fortunately  the countries which had their embassies in Jerusalem decided to withdraw them following the adoption of that resolution by the Security Council. It is time for all States in the international community  particularly the big Powers  to adopt a clear stance on this question  assuming their full responsibility to secure immediate and unconditional withdrawal from all occupied Arab and Palestinian territories  including Jerusalem.144.	It has now been established that the decision of the Israeli Government to annex Jerusalem and to make it the capital of a Hebrew State was a serious violation of international law and an additional reason for the worsening of the conflict in the Middle East. There are 2 billion Moslems and Christians throughout the world who are affected by this decision and who will never accept any illegal  unilateral modification of the status of the Holy City of Jerusalem. In this connection  my country  a member of the Islamic Conference  takes this opportunity to reaffirm its support for the resolutions adopted by the United Nations and for the actions envisaged by the Al Qods Committee  over which His Majesty Hassan II  King of Morocco  presides.145.	It is along the same lines that we view United Nations peace-keeping operations. Faithful to its commitment to contribute to the maintenance of peace throughout the world  Senegal has always supported the establishment by the United Nations of peace-keeping forces as a practical means for defusing regional conflicts. Accordingly  we have been participating in peace-keeping operations  thus assuming our share of the role incumbent on the international community in this field.146.	But Senegal cannot accept acts by the Israeli Government which indisputably undermine the credibility of our Organization. We remain particularly concerned by the harassment of UNIFIL by the de facto forces aided by Israel. Those forces have hampered the deployment of UNIFIL and continue to interfere with its activities. The situation thus created has been considerably worsened by the infiltration  in UNIFIL sectors  of armed elements which have been provoking incidents frequently resulting in the loss of human life.147.	It is appropriate to reaffirm our solidarity with the fraternal people of Lebanon  which  at the price of repeated sacrifices  has conveyed to the world the image of a courageous people determined to face its destiny  weapons in hand. That is why Senegal is devoted to Lebanon's integrity and sovereignty and deplores the attacks and acts of aggression to which it is constantly subjected by troops of Israel and its allies.148.	In order to facilitate the mission of United Nations troops  Senegal is proposing the establishment of a system of guarantees and immunities for troops placed at the disposal of the United Nations for peace-keeping operations so that they can effectively discharge their mission of peace.149.	Serious as all those pockets of tension are  we cannot overlook the fact that elsewhere in the world there are situations that may threaten international peace and security.150.	Regarding Cyprus  it is regrettable to note that  despite good will on both sides  the intercommunal talks  so ardently encouraged  have not led to an agreement that would preserve the interests of the Cypriot communities  Greek and Turkish. Senegal hopes  consequently  that the negotiations which have been advocated between the two communities will yield a just and peaceful solution preserving the unity and sovereignty of Cyprus and its choice of non-alignment.151.	In Asia  the situation in Kampuchea threatens the peace and stability of the region. We must say  there is no such thing as good or bad foreign intervention. The Kampuchean people must exercise its right to complete independence  without foreign occupation or intervention.152.	The war now being organized and maintained in Kampuchea must stop so that an end can be put to the various attacks upon the liberties of the Kampuchean people and the sufferings imposed on it. The legal Government of Kampuchea  represented here by Vice-Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs Mr. Ieng Sary  must continue to enjoy the support of the international community  in accordance with the principles established by the Charter.153.	The situation in Afghanistan is of concern to the Organization in general  and to the Islamic world in particular. It was the subject of the sixth emergency special session of the General Assembly  in January 1980; it was also taken up at the Islamic Conference at its last two sessions held at Islamabad.154.	At the thirty-fifth session the General Assembly must discuss the matter again  because the question has once more been included in the agenda at the request of 32 countries  including Senegal itself. Indeed  we believe that not only can no just and lasting solution be found to the Afghan crisis as long as foreign troops remain in that country but also that the prolongation of such occupation is a direct and grave threat to peace and security in the whole region  including  in particular  the neighbouring countries.155.	It is imperative that our deliberations on this question at the present session yield decisions that will promote a return to peace and tranquillity in an independent and non-aligned Afghanistan. Such a settlement  moreover  could yield a just and lasting peace throughout the region.156.	Our policy is based essentially on non-alignmentâ non-alignment which  notwithstanding differing political and social systems  is  without a doubt  a fruitful element in international relations. Therefore  we continue to strive to uphold the purposes of the movement  based on the democratization of international relations and the independence of its members vis-a-vis all military blocs and the transcending of those blocs for the security of all States and for peace  without any ""natural"" alliances with any bloc or Power. Those are the principles that our country defended and upheld at the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries. 157.	While the turn of events has proved our arguments correct and shown the validity of our positions here  the only conclusion we can draw is that duty to the truth and loyalty to principle are the stamp of peoples like my own  which consider non-alignment  in the final analysis  the salvation of young nations and the guarantee of their independence. For security cannot be imposed by force; it can only result from respect for every country's choices and from the commitment of every nation  large or small  to respect the sovereignty of others.158.	It is acknowledged today  by large and small countries alike  that pockets of crisis lead to violence in the world and that the stockpiling of weapons can at any time give rise to a local explosion that could assume cataclysmic dimensions. That is why my country remains deeply concerned by the question of disarmament and the arms race. The concern which every people has over the problem of its security and its very survival is so great that maintaining peace among peoples must remain for us an abiding priority.159.	Was not the United Nations created precisely to preserve succeeding generations from the scourge of war? Because the existence in the world of nuclear stockpiles entails the threat of nuclear conflagration  the most urgent task humanity must face today is that of dismantling the hierarchical international order that supports the present military system  replacing it by a security system based upon peaceful coexistence  but also on practical acceptance of the sovereign equality of all nations.160.	The present proliferation of nuclear know-how may have allayed some concern through a balance of terror  but impulsive or irrational behaviour  in the presence of sudden serious tension  could at any time trigger a nuclear war.161.	Senegal had occasion to hail the initiative which led to the tenth special session of the General Assembly  devoted to disarmament. We must note  however  that the resultant Programme of Action for nuclear disarmament  which proceeded from the concern to stem the nuclear arms race and to undertake reductions leading to the elimination of existing stockpiles  is  unfortunately  far from having made any progress in its implementation  despite the consensus it had enjoyed here.162.	Moreover  the draft comprehensive treaty banning nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons testing has yet to be completed. We deplore that fact  even though  since the tenth special session  in 1978  the United States and the Soviet Union have signed the SALT II agreement. 163.	It will be recalled that Senegal  at all international conferences on disarmament  had clearly advocated the reduction of arms expenditures and the allocation of 5 per cent of their current volume to development assistance.164.	At the same time  Senegal  which remains in favour of the creation of nuclear-weapon-free zones  particularly in Africa  favours a review and re-orientation of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons machinery in order to enable States parties to the Treaty to benefit from the peaceful industrial uses of nuclear energy.165.	Basic as solution of political problems is  the solution of economic problems remains no less essential for the attainment of peace.166.	The Government of Senegal  faithful to its staunch position on the defence and promotion of human rights  has always emphasized  and will continue to stress the idea that economic  social and cultural rights are inseparable from civil and political rights. Both seek the same goals and proceed from the same basis and have recourse to similar protection methods. But civil and political rights demand  furthermore  combined efforts of all members of the international community.167.	In that respect  Senegal emphasized in the Commission on Human Rights the concept of the ""right to development"" ânamely  the acknowledged right of all peoples and individuals to satisfy their needs in accordance with their aspirations  to the fullest extent consistent with the equitable enjoyment of the goods and services produced by the community.168.	Indisputably  development is a particularly binding imperative. In this connection the division of the world between rich and poor countries is one of the most serious concerns of our time. However  safeguarding peace does not depend merely on development; it also depends on respect for human rights by all Governments.169.	Unlike most other rights having to do with the human person  the right to development is first and foremost a collective right. As the President of the Republic of Senegal  Mr. Leopold Sedar Senghor  is wont to stress  ""Man is the beginning and end of development"". Senegal has understood that well. Indeed  it has since the earliest years of its independence striven to implement a policy of development adapted to its national realities by stressing respect for human rights.170.	While it is certain that human rights are one of the main elements of development and that their violation cannot be justified by the demands of development  it is also obvious that there cannot be a new economic order without a new world cultural order.171.	The cultural dimension of development cannot in these conditions be dissociated from its economic dimension. The third world countries would do well to appreciate more clearly the interaction between cultural and economic objectives to the extent that the cultural prejudices to which they are subject are a destructive obstacle to the elimination of unfair trading practices in international economic relations. Consequently  the new cultural order should be based on recognition of our differences and the acceptance of our172.	Senegal  which has been a member of the Commission on Human Rights for several years  attaches overriding importance to the sacred rights of the human person  as enshrined in its Constitution and its laws. We continue to believe that only the creation of a United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights would help the United Nations to gain a better understanding of the problem  which from year to year becomes more serious.173.	Accordingly  Senegal took the initiative in proposing a charter for the creation of an African commission on human rights and the rights of peoples.174.	The OAU has already endorsed that idea and has held several meetings on the subject. Such a regional commission could be envisaged for other continents as well  thus enabling the future United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to rely on those regional structures on the same basis as the Economic and Social Council relies on the regional commissions.175.	To revert to economic development  the eleventh special session of the General Assembly certainly did not achieve the results hoped for  but it had the advantage of raising the problem of development in all its multiple aspects. We hope that the consensus reached at that session  will provide a basis for the future global negotiations which are to take place at the beginning of next year  which will also mark the launching of the Third United Nations Development Decade.176.	To that end  the political will shown throughout that session should be increased by all States in a spirit of interdependence and solidarity which will ensure the early advent of genuine international co-operation in the best interests of all mankind. Mankind is entitled to live in peace. To that end  the nations represented here must once more take a close look at the principles of the Charter  by which we are bound  and scrupulously apply them.177.	If ever-more-numerous regional conflicts are monopolizing the attention of the United Nations and the Security Council  it is because those principles  coupled with the rules of good-neighbourliness  are  unfortunately  not always respected. Here my delegation wishes to stress the importance of the role of the regional organizations in the search for the peaceful settlement of disputes which pit one State against another.178.	Indeed  regional organizations  where they exist  should act as buffers in order to help in resolving disputes between States of the same region  as the OAU has done on several occasions  thus allowing the United Nations to devote more effort to the serious problems of economic and social development and disarmament.179.	For its part Senegal is applying those principles  in particular with regard to all its neighbours  with which it enjoys the best possible relations. It is true that our political philosophy is based first and foremost on humanism  which means that continuing dialogue is the essential element in resolving disputes.180.	We continue to believe in the United Nations and its mission as the custodian of peace and the guarantor of international security  and we take this opportunity of assuring the United Nations of our abiding and unswerving support in its quest for a more just and united world based on trust  tolerance and understanding among all peoples."
"121",6165,"SGP",35,1980,"ï»¿85.	Mr. President  your election to the presidency of the thirty-fifth session of the United Nations General Assembly is both a tribute to you personally and a recognition of the important place which your country  the Federal Republic of Germany  occupies in the world today. In the 35 years since the end of the Second World War  the Federal Republic of Germany has rebuilt its economy into one of the most dynamic economies in the world. It has successfully imbibed the democratic form of government and faithfully adhered to its ideals and values. You  Mr. President  are known to your colleagues at the United Nations as a man of extraordinary intellect and charm  a person who always seeks to understand the other man's point of view and to reconcile the differences which exist among men and among nations.86.	I should like to pay a deserved tribute to the President of the thirty-fourth session  Mr. Salim of the United Republic of Tanzania. Mr. Salim's fair and efficient management of our affairs during the past year has earned him universal acclaim and admiration. One of his more remarkable accomplishments which  I am glad to see you are trying your best to maintain  is that he has cured the United Nations of the disease of never starting its meetings on time. It is also my pleasant task  as a fellow member of the Commonwealth  to welcome Zimbabwe and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to membership in this Organization.87.	In his report on the work of this Organization during the past year  the Secretary General has correctly summed up that year as one which has provided us with some reasons for celebration and many for anxiety. The Secretary General pointed to the negotiated agreement which paved the way for the independence of Zimbabwe and the important breakthroughs which occurred at the ninth session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea as two of the silver linings in a sky full of dark clouds.88.	Dark clouds still hang over southern Africa  the Middle East  Afghanistan and Kampuchea. In southern Africa very little progress has been achieved in the struggle for the freedom of Namibia and to dismantle the evil policy of apartheid. We pledge our support to our African brothers in their struggle to free Namibia from the illegal embrace of South Africa and in their campaign against racial discrimination in South Africa.89.	In the Middle East  the peace process of the Camp David accords has made little progress for some time now. Singapore has always stated unequivocally that Israel has the right to exist. We agree that Israel is entitled to exist within safe and secure boundaries recognized and accepted by its neighbours. However  if there is to be peace between Israel and its Arab neighbours  Israel must be prepared to do three things. First  Israel must give back to the Arab countries the territories it occupied as a result of the June 1967 war. Secondly  Israel must be prepared to recognize the right of the Palestinians to self-determination and to a homeland of their own. Thirdly  Israel must rescind the illegal measures it has taken recently to alter the character and status of the city of Jerusalem.90.	It is a matter of great concern to us that the Israeli Government has enacted legislation incorporating East Jerusalem into its territory and has proclaimed the city of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. While Israel  as the occupying Power  has the responsibility to protect and preserve the unique spiritual and religious character of Jerusalem  this unilateral action by Israel to transform the character and status of Jerusalem  pending a settlement of the Middle East problem  is tantamount to converting the spoils of war into national territory and does not help progress towards a solution to the Middle East and Palestinian problems.91.	The majority of us here  Members of the United Nations  gained our independence from Western imperialist Powers in the last 35 yearsâthe years since the end of the Second World War. Most of us were colonies or protectorates or subservient to imperial Powers in one way or another. Those who gained their independence early helped others to gain theirs. We sought and obtained help from many quarters in this struggle for independence and national dignity. We had the support of liberals within the imperial countries. We had the support of socialist States like the Soviet Union. The material and moral support. We received from those various forces will not be easily forgotten by us. It is natural that  because of our history  for most of us suspicion of and antagonism towards the Western imperial Powers are not far below the surface of the friendly and amicable relations we have established since independence with most of the colonial Powers.92.	Singapore is a small country that gained its independence only 15 years ago. Since we are small  it is in our interest to be friendly  not only with our immediate neighbours but with all countries. It is not at all in our interest to be caught in the press of power contests  be they contests between superpowers or regional Powers. However  when the sovereignty  territorial integrity and independence of other small nations are violated by bigger nations we feel that our own security is endangered. This is why  for the past two years  Singapore has spoken out clearly against certain of the policies of the Soviet Union and Viet Nam. We are not anti-Soviet or anti-Viet Nam because they have chosen a system of government and economy that is different from ours. What internal policies they follow is entirely their business. But  when their external policies impinge on our security and set precedents which can be used against us  we have no alternative but to do all we can to cause them to change those policies.93.	It is in this context that I ask this Assembly to consider our views on the events in Afghanistan and Kampuchea. They arise from a deep concern for what those events portend for us who belong to the third world. Singapore is not alone in its concern. Many other countries  especially the small nonaligned nations  share this concern. Like Singapore  they too have been alarmed by the implications for themselves of these events. The 91 countries that voted in the United Nations General Assembly in November last year to call on Viet Nam to withdraw its forces from Kampuchea did so for this reason. Likewise  104 countries voted in the United Nations General Assembly in January this year to call on the Soviet Union to withdraw its forces from Afghanistan.94.	The Soviet Union and Viet Nam have dismissed those resolutions. They argue that those countries were pressured by the United States and China to support those resolutions. This is an argument which  in my opinion  does not warrant repetition. They must know it is simply not true. We hope that  in spite of such public postures  both the Soviet Union and Viet Nam will pay careful heed to the frank views which are expressed by many nonaligned nations on those issues in this Assembly. If they want to retain the confidence of the world community  especially that of the nonaligned nations  they must change their policies in Afghanistan and Kampuchea.95.	The majority of us in the United Nations  especially those of us in the third world  have taken a clear and unequivocal position on the issues of Afghanistan and Kampuchea. We will continue to oppose the actions of the Soviet Union and Viet Nam in those two countries. If we show that we acquiesce in  compromise with or condone the actions of those two countries  we in the third world will surely pay the price  as the next victim will come from our ranks.96.	The Soviet Union and Viet Nam claim that they were invited to send their military forces into Afghanistan and Kampuchea and that this is a sufficient and legitimate reason for them to intervene militarily. A brief review of the events in Afghanistan and Kampuchea will show that this was never the case.97.	In Kampuchea  the formation of a group called the National United Front for the Salvation of Kampuchea was announced by Viet Nam on 2 December 1978. Three weeks later  on 25 December 1978  Vietnamese forces invaded Kampuchea. By 11 January 1979  the large Vietnamese forces had overrun the country. They then set up a puppet regime headed by one Heng Samrin. On 18 February 1979  nearly two months after the invasion  a so-called Treaty of Peace  Friendship and Cooperation was signed between Viet Nam and the puppet Heng Samrin regime. It was subsequently claimed that under the terms of this Treatyâa Treaty signed two months after the invasionâVietnamese troops were invited into Kampuchea. Today  Vietnamese troops numbering more than 200 000 remain in Kampuchea.98.	Similarly  in Afghanistan  Soviet airborne troops landed at Kabul on 25 and 26 December 1979. On 27 December  they attacked and captured governmental installations  killed Amin  the head of Government  and disarmed Afghan army units. They brought in one Babrak Karmal  who was not even in the country during the Soviet invasion. They installed him as head of a new Government and then announced that they had been invited under the Treaty of Friendship  Good Neighbourliness and Cooperation of 5 December 1978 between Afghanistan and the Soviet Union.99.	While the ostensible reason advanced by the Soviet Union and Viet Nam is that they were invited by the Governments of Afghanistan and Kampuchea  the real reasons have since begun to emerge. One need only read the various publications of the Soviet Union and Viet Nam for evidence. Today they are increasingly admitting that their real reason for intervening militarily in those two countries is that events in the neighbouring States threatened their own security. In fact  one Soviet commentator  Alexander Bovin  went so far as to say that ""We [the Soviet Union] knew that we would cease to be a great Power if we refrained from carrying the burden of taking unpopular but necessary decisions"". In other words  an imperial Power would lose its credibility if any of its satellites or protectorates were allowed to pursue an independent policy.100.	In Afghanistan  the Soviet Union considered that a revolt by the people of Afghanistan against their communist Government was a threat to the security of the Soviet Union. In Kampuchea  a Government that refused to accept the leadership of Viet Nam in an IndoChinese federation was considered to be a threat to Viet Nam's security. The pattern of invasion was the same in both countries. Having concluded that its security was involved  the aggressor nation first invaded its neighbour with massive military power  then established a puppet regime and then got the puppet regime to acknowledge subsequently that it had invited the foreign forces.101.	Most of us have no wish to become partisans in the rivalry and contests between the big Powers. We wish to avoid the fate of becoming cannon fodder in the conflicts between the great Powers. This is why many of us chose to be nonaligned. For many years we have held the view that nonalignment is our best safeguard. For many years the Soviet Union supported the concept of nonalignment to such an extent that some members of the nonaligned movement even championed the Soviet Union as the natural ally of the movement. Today  events in Afghanistan and Kampuchea have shown that nonalignment by itself no longer offers us protection. Both Afghanistan and Kampuchea were nonaligned nations. Both professed the communist ideology. In both cases the national integrity has been violated  in the case of Afghanistan  directly by the Soviet Union and  in the case of Kampuchea  by Viet Nam with the aid and support of the Soviet Union.102.	Did the Soviet Union support nonalignment all these years as a cover  to persuade countries to dissociate themselves from and weaken links with Western Powers until the Soviet Union was in a position to bring than within its orbit? That question is not as farfetched as it sounds. Today the Soviet Union already has allies and proxies in the nonaligned movement which are completely in support of its policies. Viet Nam  for example  declared on 15 July 1980 that ""solidarity with the Soviet Union has always been the basis of our foreign policy"". With such allies and proxies within the nonaligned movement  the Soviet Union can be assured that there will be no clear consensus among nonaligned countries to oppose its moves against a nonaligned nation.103.	What is most distressing is that Viet Nam  a member of the movement  a nation that has suffered the ravages of war for 30 years  should have betrayed the nonaligned movement and the ideals for which it sacrificed so much. The Vietnamese underwent an heroic struggle for their independence. They should therefore understand how dearly their neighbours value their independence. For 15 years Viet Nam fought against the United States in a war which the United States claimed was aimed at containing China and preventing the rest of Southeast Asia from falling into communist hands. With that experience  the Vietnamese should know the fallacy of overrunning a small nation on the grounds that that is intended to counter the threat of China. They now advance the same reasons as did the United States in the past. They claim they are a dam containing the Chinese menace. How are they containing the Chinese menace? Not by confronting China. Today it is Kampucheans who are dying  not Chinese. Vietnamese troops are unwelcome guests in Laos  not in China. And on 23 June Vietnamese troops made incursions into Thailand  again allegedly to fight the Chinese menace.104.	The events in Afghanistan and Kampuchea have great significance for us small nations. Precedents and principles are being established which have profound implications for us. Unless we resist and reject them now  one of us may become the next victim.105.	In both Afghanistan and Kampuchea  we are being asked to accept a certain code of international relations. The elements of that code have been clearly expressed in numerous Soviet and Vietnamese publications and broadcasts  such as the Vietnamese commentary entitled ""From Phnom Penh to Kabul"" broadcast by Radio Hanoi on 31 January 1980  an article in the Soviet New Times in January 1970 and an article by one Alexander Bovin in the Soviet newspaper Izvestia of 22 April 1980. Those are only a few examples.106.	What are the elements of this new code of conduct that we are asked to accept?107.	First  we are asked to accept that a country has the right to invade another country and set up a puppet Government if the invading country considers its security threatened or if it disapproves of the internal policies of the neighbouring Government.108.	Secondly  we are asked to accept that it is the internationalist duty of the Soviet Union and communist States to provide military aid to elements in other countries which seek to overthrow their Governments by force and establish communist and pro-Communist regimes.109.	We are also asked to accept that if a people of a nonaligned country wants to change its Government from a communist or pro-Communist to some other type of Government  then it can be prevented from doing so by another communist Power under its internationalist obligation to safeguard the gains of revolution.110.	We are asked to accept that communist Powers are not under an obligation to uphold the principles of independence  territorial integrity and sovereignty and that communist imperialism and interference in the internal affairs of other States are morally justifiable and acceptable since they promote socialism and not capitalism.111.	To accept that code of conduct would be to spell our doom. We must reject those propositions and make it clear that we are against all forms of imperialism and domination.112.	We must make it abundantly clear that  just as we fought to dismantle capitalist imperialism  we will resist communist imperialism or any other form of imperialism. We must make it clear that we reject the right of any nation to violate the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of another nation to impose or preserve communism  capitalism or any other form of government. We must reject the notion that either the communist or the capitalist State or any other type of State has a moral right to pursue an expansionist foreign policy.113.	We have to reject all forms of imperialism for our own preservation. We are not anti-Soviet or anti-Vietnam. We wish those Governments well in whatever way they want to pursue the happiness and wellbeing of their own people  so long as their foreign policies do not endanger our security.114.	How do we reject and oppose those moves? First  on Kampuchea we must resist any attempt to unseat Democratic Kampuchea from the United Nations. To allow Democratic Kampuchea to be unseated would be to endorse and encourage the policy of aggression by Viet Nam. We are not here to decide on the merits of the Democratic Kampuchean Government in its dealings with its c v people. We did not create the Government of Democrats Kampuchea nor did we sustain it. Vietnam nurtured and sustained it and defended its internal policies until 25 December 1978. It was only after Viet Nam invaded Kampuchea that it seemed to have suddenly discovered that the Government of Democratic Kampuchea was a barbaric and genocidal Government.115.	Here in the United Nations we are faced with a simple question. Are we going to allow the legitimate Government of a country  which is fighting against a foreign invader  to be unseated just because the foreign invader has been successful in establishing a puppet regime in the capital city? Some are advancing the idea of leaving the seat of Kampuchea vacant here in the United Nations. That would only punish the victim and reward the aggressor because an empty seat is a prelude to the puppet regime's making a bid for the empty seat.116.	Secondly  we must continue to insist that foreign occupation forces must be withdrawn from both Kampuchea and Afghanistan  and that the people of Kampuchea and Afghanistan be allowed to chart their own destiny. The root cause of the present problem in Afghanistan and Kampuchea is the occupation of those countries by foreign forces. Both the Soviet Union and Viet Nam would have us believe that the root cause of the problem is the resistance by the people of Afghanistan and Kampuchea. They would have us believe that the way to solve the problem is for resistance to cease. Are nationalists fighting against foreign invaders for their nationhood  their dignity and self-respect to be told by us that they are wrong? Does that not go against the very principles which united us Members of this Organization? The least we can do is to stand by the nationalists of Afghanistan and Kampuchea. No effort or great sacrifice is demanded of us. All we are asked to do is to vote for their just cause. The moral force of such a vote will mean a great deal to people fighting against the invaders at desperate odds. It is the least we can do for a just cause.117.	Thirdly  through our stand here on those two issues we must show clearly to the superpowers that we will have no truck with the policies of their proxies. If we condone Vietnamese action in Kampuchea it will be a clear signal to the superpowers that they have our licence to canvass for proxies among the nonaligned nations to promote their interests.118.	The events in Afghanistan and Kampuchea are not distant events that have no bearing on us. The security of small countries like mine is adversely affected whenever the sovereignty  territorial integrity and independence of other countries are violated. This is why we must speak out and defend the independence and integrity of Afghanistan and Kampuchea. There is another reason why we must continue to condemn the actions of the Soviet Union in Afghanistan and of Viet Nam in Kampuchea. It is that  in trying to justify their actions the Soviet Union and Viet Nam have attempted to circumscribe the application of some of the most basic principles of the United Nations Charter  including the principle that every State is entitled to respect for its sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity  the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other States and the principle of non-use of force in international relations. We must defend these principles against any attempt to revise or undermine them  for these Charter principles afford us  the small countries  some degree of protection in a world in which a few who have the military might may want to impose their will on the many."
"122",6245,"SLE",35,1980,"ï»¿During the middle of this year the heads of State and Government of the continent of Africa conferred a singular honour on my country by graciously accepting our invitation to host the seventeenth ordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity [OAU]  at Freetown  from 1 to 4 July 1980. They further conferred upon me the onerous responsibility of chairing their deliberations and being at the helm of the organization's affairs for the current year. It is therefore with diffidence and humility  and conscious of the immense responsibilities and confidence bestowed upon me by my African colleagues and brothers  that I address this Assembly today in my capacity as the current Chairman of the OAU.3.	On behalf of the member States of the OAU and on my own behalf I extend to you  Mr. President  our sincere congratulations on your election to the high office of President of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. Africa has over the years maintained very close relations with your country and we are grateful for the various technical assistance programmes to developing countries which today benefit many African States. We in Sierra Leone have vivid evidence of your contribution to our economic development programme.4.	You yourself  Mr. President  have contributed immensely to the high regard of your country in the international community by your devotion to duty  your intellectual capacity  your integrity and sound judgement as an eminent diplomat and politician. We are confident that with these qualities you will discharge the responsibilities of your office with the honour and dignity many of your predecessors have displayed. This Organization stands in need of such qualities  particularly at this time when the many pressing problems of yesteryear cry out for urgent solutions in our day.5.	Africa  which represents a third of the States Members of this Organization  pledges every assistance to facilitate the successful performance of your task.6.	Permit me  Mr. President  to express my thanks to your predecessor  Mr. Salim A. Salim  for the exceptional competence and patience with which he conducted the deliberations of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly. I extend my Government's appreciation for his immense contribution to the perennial search we make towards peace and security in our world.7.	I must at this juncture crave the indulgence of this body to pay my respects to the memory of one whose contribution to the freedom of man and the peace of our world has been universally recognized and will for long be remembered. I refer to no less a personality than Marshal Josip Broz Tito  President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. With his death the cause of the dignity of man and the rights of nations has lost a champion. He was a redoubtable advocate for closer international cooperation. His life and actions will continue to be a source of inspiration. May his soul rest in peace.8.	In the same vein I pay tribute to my predecessor  the late President William Tolbert  President of the Republic of Liberia  whose untimely death we all mourn. We also express our deep condolences to the people of Angola for the passing away of our illustrious friend and brother  President Agostinho Neto  whose valuable contribution and selfless devotion to the liberation struggle in southern Africa will always be remembered. All of them in their respective ways contributed to peace and security in our troubled world. Africa and indeed the world were equally distressed at the news of the death of the President of Botswana who was widely recognized as an international statesman. His contribution to the political  social and economic advancement of Botswana will remain in the historical records of that region.9. For 35 years this fraternity of nations  born of the realization of the futility of war and the need to improve the human condition in an age fraught with tension  social inequalities  bigotry and rabid intolerance  has existed  surmounting the natural obstacles and manmade difficulties in its path. Throughout this period mankind has been engaged in living at peace with itself  in order to rise above the artificial barriers of race  religion and divergent political ideologies  to reach across the wilderness of self to pursue a common objective.10.	This in itself is an achievement  for it marks the pledge made 35 years ago to free succeeding generations from the scourge of war and to harmonize a world torn by prejudice  mistrust and misunderstanding. These annual gatherings have therefore become yearly rituals to reawaken our consciousness of that thin line separating man from annihilation  and to renew our faith in our  pilgrimage to an age of peace and plenty.11.	The progress that has been made so far is considerable and we cannot deny that the prospects for bringing us closer to each other are many  if only we are willing to explore them.12.	Yet if this community of States is to continue to survive not as a fossilized institution of manmade curiosities  but vibrant  viable and relevant to our age  the whole edifice of international relations  hung with the trappings of hypocrisy and cloak-and-dagger intrigue must be torn down and in its place a new structure erected  infused with genuine understanding and forthrightnessâa testimony to our honest promise to put aside the instruments of war and carnage and embrace the tools of peace and progress.13.	Whatever progress can be made towards achieving a united world is only possible within the confines of mutual trust and the willingness to view issues honestly and without duplicity. These are basic conditions without which the realization of the objectives of this international community is impossible. It is the lack of these conditions that has plagued our world for decades  rendering meaningless and ineffective the steps that have been taken time and again to improve the human condition.14.	But now there is a growing current of feeling sweeping across our planet that the human race is running out of time  that man is about to make an inevitable rendezvous with catastrophe.15.	These are not alarmist postures. They represent that inner awareness in every individual of the need to change to a new order in the face of the realization that our many political  social and economic ills no longer respond to the trusted conventional therapies of former decades.16.	We must now be galvanized into concrete and sincere action to stem this headlong disintegration of order while there is still time. We must demonstrate that the confidence which our people place in us as determiners of their fate is not misplaced. We must prove  even to ourselves that we are capable of living up to and discharging our responsibilities. It is for this reason that I believe that a new confidence in international relations must be built up or else we shall make hardly any headway in devising solutions to our many problems.17.	Allow me now to glance at the economic problems facing the continent of Africa. I appear on this rostrum as a representative of the least developed continent  with the lowest indicator of physical quality of life; a continent that not only has been a victim of colonial and racist exploitation  but continues to be subjected to external forces which seek not only to influence but to dominate the economic policies of our countries.18.	I am representing a continent whose gross domestic product is only 2.7 per cent of that of the world  a continent with 18 of the 25 poorest countries  a continent of poverty and suffering.19.	The overdependence of the economy of the African continent on the export of basic raw materials and minerals has perpetuated the high susceptibility of our economies to external developments  with detrimental effects on the interests of Africa.20.	The bulk of manufacturing in Africa is still centred on import substitution and there are some export oriented operations almost exclusively related to the primary processing state of minerals  timber and agricultural products. Our industries have been growing more or less according to the trend of the colonial economy which existed at the periphery of the metropolitan economy.21.	It was as a result of that awareness that  for the first time in its history  the OAU held at Lagos  on 28 and 29 April this year  an extraordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government  devoted solely to economic problems in Africa  and adopted what arc now known as the Lagos Plan of Action and the Final Act of Lagos.22.	The Lagos Plan of Action is an attempt by independent African States to cultivate a spirit of self-reliance and to adopt a policy of organizing our own socioeconomic progress by raising that Plan to the level of a priority action programme.23.	The Final Act of Lagos recognizes the need to look beyond the artificial boundaries that separate African peoples. It looks at Africa in its entirety within the framework of an African Economic Community. That Community aims at promoting collective  accelerated  self-reliant and self-sustaining development  as well as cooperation among its members.24.	We are fully aware of the important role that will be played by the international community in the implementation of both the Lagos Plan of Action and the Final Act of Lagos. We have consequently mandated the secretariat of the OAU to enlist the active support of the international community as well as of the relevant international organizations. May I make a solemn appeal to all those concerned to give maximum support to the OAU in this enormous task.25.	I should like to comment very briefly on the state of international negotiations. So far  very little hope has been given to those who live in desperation and frustration. Looking at the years 1978 and 1980 alone  we see interminable discussions at the United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development; the renewal of the Lome Convention between the European Economic Community and the African  Caribbean and Pacific States;' the fifth session of UNCTAD and the Third General Conference of UNIDO. We have come out of most of those major world conferences with only some broadly worded declarations.26.	For the past six years mankind has been engaged in drawing up a comprehensive convention under which the resources of the sea could be fairly and equitably distributed as the common heritage of mankind.27.	Africa  as an integral region within the Group of 77  has played an active and important role in those negotiations  to the extent that the Council of Ministers of the OAIJ  at its thirty-fifth ordinary session  held at Freetown from I8 to 28 June this year  adopted a Declaration on the Law of the Sea which succinctly stated Africa's position on the main issues of the Conference. That Declaration in fact affected the negotiations at the resumed ninth session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  which resulted in the preparation of a third  revised informal composite negotiating text of the Conference.28.	The text  which is to form the basis for further negotiations at the Conference  is on the whole acceptable to African delegations as a compromise text  except that in some areas  particularly the transfer of technology  the text has fallen short of our expectations. Technology that does not include processing  marketing  transportation and the training of personnel is not in the interest of African States. Africa has on a number of occasions emphasized the importance it attaches to this matter. We entertain the hope that this requirement  on which the whole framework of the convention on the law of the sea is based  will be reflected in a subsequent revised text of the convention in a manner consistent with the OAU Declaration on the law of the sea.29.	The decision by certain developed countries to declare unilateral legislation on deep seabed mining last spring came as a disappointment to many African States  particularly because negotiations are still going on towards the adoption of a United Nations convention on the law of the sea. Such a decision is evidence of a lack of good faith in the negotiations and in the efforts that are being made to finalize a universally acceptable convention.30.	It is regrettable that  despite all protests against such an act  when it became obvious that there were moves in that direction  some States decided to ignore those protests as if international opinion or condemnation had no direct effect on their decision.31.	We hope that those States have realized the adverse effects of their actions on the negotiations and a future convention on the law of the sea  to the extent that they will endeavour to adhere fully to the United Nations convention when it is finalized and adopted.32.	Conscious of the fact that education and culture constitute the surest means for African peoples to make up for their technical backwardness  African States give high priority to educational reform and development and the affirmation of our cultural identity.33.	To that end  laudable efforts have been made by the OAU to establish and strengthen cooperation among member States. In order to harmonize educational objectives  programmes and diplomas  technical meetings of experts on different subjects are periodically organized.34.	Conscious that illiteracy constitutes a brake on Africa's economic and social development  African States have made the education of the masses their major concern. With the promotion and utilization of the major widely used national languages in adult education  encouraging results have been recorded in many States in the fight against illiteracy.35.	In the field of culture  the periodic organization of national and pan African cultural festivals has had a happy effect on the affirmation of our cultural identity. The promotion and revalorization of our cultural heritage are inspired by the African Cultural Charter  supported by an African Cultural Fund.36.	The OAU gives a place of honour to the child  the youth and the woman.37.	After having actively organized events dedicated to the International Year of the Child  the African heads of State and Government  at the sixteenth ordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU held at Monrovia from 17 to 20 July 1979  adopted an historic Declaration on the Rights and Welfare of the African Child. 38.	African Ministers of Social Affairs will meet at Addis Ababa next month to prepare for the International Year for Disabled Persons  in conformity with General Assembly resolution 31/123 and the resolution adopted by the OAU on the issue.  The OAU attaches particular importance to the promotion of women  especially to the efforts made for their integration in the development process. To that end a programme of action for the promotion and integration of women in development was incited in the Lagos Plan of Action adopted at the second extraordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU  held at Lagos on 28 and 29 April I980. 39.	The second World Conference of the United Nations Decade for Women  held from 14 to 30 July this year at Copenhagen  in which the OAU and African women's organizations participated actively  did not fully meet our expectations. The activities during the first half of the Decade for Women were inadequate. The international community should contribute more resources towards the attainment of the objectives laid down for the promotion of women.40.	We are pleased with the declaration by WHO of global eradication of smallpox.41.	The attention of African Governments was drawn at our last meeting at Freetown to the advent of the traffic and consumption of narcotic drugs in the African continent. Africa is aware of the dangers of this new scourge. A series of technical symposia and meetings scheduled on this issue will enable African Governments to take appropriate measures to control drug abuse and its illicit traffic in the continent.42.	Since 1973 a relentless drought seems to have settled almost permanently in the States neighbouring the Sahara and the desert areas of Africa. Furthermore  in those same countries the encroachment of the desert is becoming more and more alarming. The joint effects of drought and desertification affect the agricultural resources of those countries. In spite of the laudable efforts made by those countries to control these disasters  they continue to suffer important food grain deficits leading to serious famine and losses of their livestock. According to FAO estimates  the food assistance requirements of African countries for the next five or six months will reach at least 1.2 million tons of cereals. The Sahelian area needs 140 000 tons of emergency relief and at least 150 000 tons to re-establish its food security. Mali  Senegal  Mauritania  Cape Verde  Ethiopia  Djibouti  Somalia and Uganda  among others  are undergoing the most serious food shortages.43.	One bright spot in the continent's long and resolute struggle to rid Africa of the scourge of colonialism  racist arrogance and naked imperialist exploitation has been the heroic achievement of independence by Zimbabwe  after seven long years of courageous struggle. The OAU was proud to welcome Zimbabwe as the fiftieth member of that organization during the second extraordinary economic session  held in April 1980 at Lagos. We all join in the well-deserved congratulations already extended by all delegations to Zimbabwe on its recent admission as the one hundred and fifty-third Member of the United Nations family.44.	This historic victory by the Zimbabwean people is an eloquent lesson that the forces of justice will inevitably triumph over the organized might of oppression  that liberty is a birth right which can never be extinguished by bigotry and massed weapons  however sophisticated  and that the destiny of Africa will be determined by its indefatigable sons and daughters. In the hour of triumph  however  the people of Zimbabwe  under the leadership of that indomitable fighter  Comrade Robert Mugabe  have displayed exceptional magnanimity towards their former oppressors  to whom they have extended the hand of cooperation in the task of building the new nation. This is a demonstration that the struggle for freedom and independence is motivated not by lust  for revenge but by the unquenchable thirst for liberty  which for centuries has motivated African freedom fighters in their sacrifice of all they have  including their own lives  in resisting waves of oppressors or aggressors. As we celebrate with our brothers and sisters in Zimbabwe  let us not forget to pay a deserved tribute to the martyrs who paid for freedom with their own lives. We hope the futility of resisting the struggle of a proud people for its freedom will be fully appreciated by the remaining bastions of racism and oppression in southern Africa and that there will be a discontinuance of the slaughter in our tormented continent.45.	I take this opportunity of congratulating Saint Vincent and the Grenadines on its admission to the United Nations.46.	Alas  the lessons of history continue to fall on deaf ears with respect to independence for Namibia. It is now over five years since the Security Council called on South Africa to terminate its illegal presence in Namibia and leave the people of that Territory free to determine their own future; but  true to the nature of that intractable racist regime  South Africa has cynically disregarded international public opinion. Far from withdrawing from Namibia  the regime has resorted to ruses and manoeuvres designed to entrench itself deeper in a Territory in which its presence has not even a figment of legality. With brazen effrontery  designed to hoodwink international public opinion  South Africa has instead resorted to concocting a puppet clique within the country  to which it is now going through the motions of transferring administrative authority.47.	Africans  and indeed the entire international community  totally reject any attempts to circumvent the fact that true self-determination for Namibia can be achieved only through the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO]  the true and authentic representative of the Namibian people. If the South African regime desires a peaceful solution to the Namibia problem  it must be prepared to accept that it can achieve that only by negotiating with SWAPO and not with such bogy men of its own creation as the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance.48.	We commend the gallant freedom fighters and their leadership in SWAPO  who have intensified their armed struggle in Namibia and who have been dealing telling blows at will at the aggressive racist regime and its puppets. We commend the steadfastness of these fighters and the frontline States for their immense sacrifice in defence of freedom. We call upon the international community to express solidarity with them  not only in mere sentiments but also in concrete material  financial and military assistance to help them cope with this unwarranted aggression.49.	The efforts of the United Nations to achieve a negotiated settlement have led to nothing but frustration  because of the chicanery and delaying tactics adopted by South Africa. It is manifest that South Africa has no intention of implementing the United Nations plan for elections. Notwithstanding this  we hope that the further negotiations which have been called for will be speedily held and will result in success.50.	Pari passu  it is but right that I should indicate that  in accordance with the resolution recently adopted at Freetown on Namibia and in the light of the negative and obstructionist attitude of South Africa  African States will not hesitate to call on the Security Council  if necessary  to convene urgently to take effective enforcement measures against the racist South African regime and to impose comprehensive and mandatory sanctions under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. It is our earnest hope that no permanent member of the Security Council will exercise its veto power to block the imposition of economic sanctions. An exercise of veto power might be interpreted as collusion with the racist regime's dilatory obstructionist policies  designed to perpetuate its illegal occupation  for their mutual economic gains. In such an eventuality a special session of the General Assembly should be convened to decide on effective measures to bring independence to Namibiaâincluding Walvis Bay  which is an integral part of Namibia. Independence for Namibia has been postponed far too long.51.	In South Africa itself  the racist regime continues to refuse to see the writing on the wall and to enter into meaningful dialogue with the majority of the population on the total eradication of the apartheid system and the creation of a truly representative multiracial society. Apartheid  as an entrenched system of national oppression  institutionalized racial discrimination and Fascist terror against the black majority of the people  remains the cornerstone of the racist regime's policy.52.	At the same time  the archdeacon of the regime  Premier Botha  has embarked on a cunning but shallow and frantic propaganda offensive designed to hoodwink international public opinion  mollify the guilty consciences of his collaborators in the West and make them believe that he is doing everything possible to create a new and just system for the entire population. In this campaign he has gone as far as stating that South Africa does not have any moral justification for the humiliation and oppression of the apartheid system and that South Africa is committed to the achievement of equality for both the Coloureds and the black majority.53.	The people of South Africa have clearly demonstrated that there is no more time for racist discrimination and exploitation. Through the boycott of classes by schoolchildren  strikes for better working conditions by workers' movements and demonstrations by church leaders of all faiths  the people have spoken with one voice and defied bullets and police dogs to demand parity of treatment and of rightful expectations. The liberation movements are continuing to strike blow after blow at the very nerve centres of industry. While the regime is far from finished  it is clearly losing its nerve. Yet it continues to offer mere palliatives instead of entering into serious dialogue on the necessary fundamental changes.54.	At its session at Freetown in July this year the OAU expressed its total commitment to the struggle against apartheid. We intend to press strongly for total economic sanctions  including an oil embargo  under the mandatory provisions of Chapter VII of the Charter  while taking into due consideration the needs of States in southern Africa  such as Lesotho  Botswana and Swaziland  which are almost totally dependent on South Africa for their economic life. We intend to intensify our collaboration with all antiapartheid movements  and to this end the OAU called upon its member States to participate fully in the International Conference on Sanctions against South Africa of the OAU and the United Nations.55.	With regard to the eradication of the apartheid system  African States demand that the international community demonstrate its commitment by concrete action and not by mere empty exhortatory denunciations. The time has now come for the international community to make a clear choice between the interests of the African continent and support for the apartheid system.56.	This year our continent has continued to experience many crises which have resulted in untold human suffering and diverted scarce resources from much needed economic development. One of these crises is the tragic  senseless  fratricidal carnage that has continued to afflict the Republic of Chad  despite the tireless efforts of the OAU to bring the warring factions to their senses. As a result  there are now over 300 000 refugees of Chadânot to mention other countless displaced personsâin the neighbouring States  particularly in the United Republic of Cameroon. While we appreciate the international assistance that has been rendered to help these innocent victims of the conflict  particularly by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Committee of the Red Cross  we should like to appeal to the entire international community to come to the aid of these unfortunate victims of the civil war.57.	In its efforts to contain the civil war while seeking to find a peaceful and durable solution to the conflict  the OAU intends to set up a neutral peacekeeping force for Chad. Unfortunately  up to now no conclusive action either to set up the force or to raise the $62 million required to finance such a force has been taken. I intend to call on the Secretary General of the United Nations during my visit here to explore possible and feasible means of assistance from the United Nations system.58.	Another crisis situation in Africa is in Western Sahara  where the incomplete task of decolonization has left a situation fraught with tension and the potential of developing into a major confrontation not only affecting the States in the region but also endangering international peace and security. Having displayed commendable courage and foresight  Mauritania decided to withdraw its forces from the southern part of the Territory it occupied and signed a peace treaty with the POLISARIO  Front  recognizing the right of the people of Western Sahara to self-determination and independence.59.	Unfortunately  that encouraging step in the right direction did not lead to the restoration of peace  as Morocco promptly proceeded to occupy the part vacated by Mauritania. Armed conflict continues to rage between Morocco and the POLISARIO Front  despite strenuous efforts by the OAU and its Ad Hoc Committee of Heads of State on Western Sahara to try to bring about a ceasefire and organize a referendum giving the people a chance to exercise its right to self-determination in a free and fair manner.60.	During the seventeenth ordinary session of the Assembly  held at Freetown  the Heads of State and Government of the OAU authorized me to convene the Ad Hoc Committee once more with a view to reconciling the parties to the conflict and seeking a peaceful and lasting solution thereto. I convened the fourth session of the Ad Hoc Committee at Freetown  from 9 to 12 September 1980  and that Committee's recommendations are being forwarded to the heads of State and Government of the OAU.61.	As if we did not have enough problems in the continent  the tension between Somalia and Ethiopia over the Ogaden continues to increase. This has been seriously complicated by the situation in the Middle East in general and in the Gulf in particular and the build-up of the presence of major Powers in the Indian Ocean.62.	To lessen these tensions and to prevent the conflict over the Ogaden from becoming the fuse for igniting a major superpower confrontation  the Good Offices Committee  established by the OAU in 1973 to try to effect reconciliation between Ethiopia and Somalia  met at Lagos from 18 to 20 August 1980. At the conclusion of that meeting  at which both Ethiopia and Somalia were represented  the Committee recommended that a peaceful solution to the Ogaden dispute could be arrived at on the basis of the following principles  which are already enshrined in the charter and relevant resolutions of the OAU: recognition of territorial integrity  non-interference in domestic affairs  peaceful settlement of disputes  prohibition of subversion and inviolability of borders inherited on decolonization. It further recommended that the two States should resume diplomatic relations so as to facilitate the restoration of peace in this troubled area. Unfortunately  the efforts of the Good Offices Committee do not seem to have been successful and  if anything  tension appears to have increased of late.63.	Major blame for tension in the Indian Ocean region must be assigned to the big Powers  which have recently stepped up their military activities in the entire area  contrary to the principles and objectives of the Declaration making the Indian Ocean a zone of peace. Recent agreements leading to the establishment of military bases and installations in the area cannot but exacerbate an already grave situation. I must draw the Assembly's attention to the resolution on the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace adopted by the Council of Ministers of the OAU at its thirty-fifth ordinary session  held at Freetown which  inter alia:""Demands the removal of bases and other military installations belonging to the big Powers in the Indian Ocean and calls upon them to refrain from establishing new ones"" 64.	We must warn the big Powers to take heed of this resolution  as they will be held responsible if their actions lead to major confrontation in this highly sensitive region.65.	In addition to the liberation struggle in southern Africa  we are faced with the conflicts that have contributed to the tragic and phenomenal increase in the number of refugees and displaced persons on the continent. With a growing refugee population currently estimated at 5 million  Africa has to find food and shelter for more than half the world's total number of refugees. It should not be difficult to imagine what a heavy social and economic burden such a large number of refugees places on the host countries. The misery and human suffering of these refugees  the majority of whom are children  women and elderly persons  are all too well known to the international community through the mass media.66.	We welcome with profound gratitude the assistance provided to these unfortunate refugees and displaced persons by international organizations  particularly the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  UNICEF and the International Committee of the Red Cross. But the OAU is seriously concerned at the scant interest displayed by the rest of the international community in coming to the aid of these unfortunate human beings in concrete terms  as compared to refugees in other regions  who  while equally deserving  are nowhere near the number of those in Africa.67.	It was for that reason that  in its resolution on refugees  the Council of Ministers of the OAU invited the Secretary General of the OAU""in collaboration with the UN Secretary General and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to hold consultations with governmental and nongovernmental organizations as well as governments of countries which are likely to offer contributions and the UN specialized agencies  in order to assess the possibility of holding a pledging conference for African refugees under the auspices of the United Nations"". 68.	It is my most sincere and ardent hope that those consultations will be positive  so that such a pledging conference will be held  and that all States will adequately face up to their common obligation of burden sharing to alleviate the misery of those human beings who  through no fault of their own  find themselves in a predicament in which they can no longer control their environment.69.	The situation in the Middle East is of the gravest concern to the OAU. Israel's intransigence has reached new heights as the leaders of that country continue a policy of ""might is right"". The continued occupation of Gaza  the West Bank and the Golan Heights  the growing oppression of the Palestinian people  the repeated acts of aggression against Lebanon and the creation of more and more settlements in the occupied territories all indicate the contempt with which Israel looks upon the principles of international law and morality. The negotiations between Egypt and Israel have amply demonstrated that Israel really has no intention of making any major concessions to the Palestinians  and the whole situation has been aggravated by the Israeli decision to make Jerusalem the undivided eternal capital of Israel.70.	Taking into consideration all these developments in the Middle East  the OAU is of the view that the Middle East crisis can be resolved only in a sincere spirit of give and take. But as long as one of the parties interminably upsets the mechanisms of settlement by engaging in jolting unilateral actions  it can only bring upon itself almost universal condemnation. The OAU  the nonaligned movement and the United Nations cannot be satisfied by the adoption of resolutions which Israel is always ignoring  while the international community looks on helplessly.71.	As I have indicated in my remarks  Africa shares many of the problems and challenges that currently affect the world  but I should like to revert to a problem that will have a particular impact on the development of many African countries in the coming decade  and I am speaking especially of those countries on the continent that are not blessed with petroleum resources.72.	Economic development and economic independence were expected to follow our successful struggle for political independence. Our plans and hopes are now in jeopardy because we have not successfully confronted the onerous burden that the energy crisis has placed on the poorer nations of the world. We are hit in three ways: by the increase in the price of petroleum  on which we all depend; by the declining price of raw materials resulting from economic stagnation; and by the curtailment of credits  on which many of our development programmes depend.73.	I speak to the Assembly now not only as the leader of an African country that is greatly affected by this economic imbalance but also as a man who has seen much of life and can therefore speak with the candour and directness that are traditional in our society.74.	The General Assembly has just completed the long awaited eleventh special session  devoted to these economic problems. Much was hoped for  but little was achieved. I now call for a renewed effort to address this issue. I call upon the Western industrial countries and the socialist countries and  yes  the oil producers themselves to face up to the plight of those countries which  even before the energy crisis  had already been subjected to serious economic difficulties.75.	Orderly development and the consequent political stability of the continent require that this issue remain on the world's agenda and be tackled with imagination and speed. We must bear in mind that  in a world of global interdependence  economic and political instability in one area  such as the continent of Africa  is bound to have a disastrous impact on other areas. Indeed  we must now accept and practise the age-old truism that we are  each and every one of us  our brothers' keepers.76.	In conclusion  the United Nations remains the effective forum for reconciling conflicting claims of nation States in our one world of today  and the proper forum for the search for acceptable and lasting solutions to some of the problems I have tried to catalogue in my address here today. In our collective venture for a safer and more prosperous world we must have the vision and the goodwill to sustain our efforts. Permit me  therefore  in this regard to register our appreciation and gratitude to our indefatigable Secretary General and his team of dedicated staff who over the years have endeavoured to keep alive that vision for a safer and more prosperous world."
"123",6291,"SLV",35,1980,"ï»¿Mr. President  the cordial relations which exist between El Salvador and the Federal Republic of Germany make your election to the presidency of the thirty- fifth session of the General Assembly an opportunity for us to reaffirm the links of co-operation between our peoples and our Governments. I am certain that your skill and experience will ensure that the work of the Assembly reaches a successful conclusion. I congratulate you and your Government on your election  which carries with it such honour.2.	This is also an excellent opportunity for me to express to the outgoing President  Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim of the United Republic of Tanzania  our appreciation of the brilliant way in which he fulfilled his mandate.3.	I am pleased to reiterate our welcome to the Republic of Zimbabwe  which  after a glorious struggle  achieved its independence. It is also a pleasure for me to welcome the State of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  which has recently become a Member of the Organization. We are linked with that country because we are both Latin American countries.4.	This statement has as its starting point the fact that international relations are closely related to the dynamics of the internal social-political process. For this reason  my statement will stress this twofold approach.5.	El Salvador is now going through crucial times  times of political  social and economic definition.6.	My country belongs to the group of underdeveloped countries which export agricultural goods and have dependent economies. These characteristics prevail in many third world countries.7.	The nature of this society constitutes an obstacle to development and to the establishment of democracy. Lack of control over land-holdings  the financial system and foreign trade have been the structural bases of this type of society.8.	This generates levels of poverty that reach the limits of destitution and hunger and create a process of alienation of vast human sectors. This produces insufficiencies in domestic markets  obstructs agricultural  industrial  and service sector development and also creates a socio-cultural infrastructure that undermines the dignity of the human person.9.	These structural circumstances in our case are worsened by demographic growth  compounded by emigration from the countryside to the city  producing a serious problem of urban social alienation.10.	The effects of this situation have been  at the political level  overt or covert dictatorships  electoral fraud  corruption  the distortion of the institutions created to foster development  and a lack of ability to make effective use of international co-operation. At the social level there has been moral disintegration  illiteracy and the presence of a frustrated youth  youth without any prospects for the future.11.	Starting in the decade of the 1960s  there was in our country a process of public awakening which gave the alienated masses and the population in general hopes for a different fate. Trade union movements rose as well as ideological political parties  organizations of the workers and the masses. These popular movements aspired to and struggled for economic and social reform and for the establishment of a democratic government.12.	With these tools for social action  the people on three occasions engaged in democratic electoral processes  in 1966  1972 and 1977. In all those campaigns an apparatus of fraud and repression was mobilized. On those three occasions the will of the people was betrayed and the possibility of introducing reforms through electoral means lost all credibility.13.	This cut-off of democratic viability intensified the struggle of political and trade union organizations. The groups that held power turned a deaf ear to the outcry of the people  who were with good reason demanding a new  more just and more humane society. In this context  neither democracy nor development had any alternative.â14.	Because of this  on the basis of the right to insurrection  the Administration in power was overthrown on 15 October 1979 and the Revolutionary Government Junta was established.15.	That insurrection began a revolutionary process which attempts to combine social and economic factors with political factors in order to create a democratic  pluralistic society in which all may play a part. There has been an attempt to accomplish a series of structural changes  making it possible for us to have a society and a style of life which would be more just  more humane and more united.16.	We are aware that it is only through structural changes  only through providing an escape valve for social and political expression that we shall be able to eradicate the deep-rooted motives for violence which the system in force before 15 October had produced.17.	At social and economic levels  my Government had been legislating and carrying out integral agrarian reform. We have completely eliminated the system of large land- holdings and have begun a system of agrarian reform  making it possible for 70 per cent of our masses in the countryside to own their own land. It will be the first programme of agrarian reform which in its first year will achieve a 25 per cent increase in agricultural production  especially in food grains. This demonstrates the absolute support that has been given to the agrarian reform system in our country. We have also carried on a nationalization of foreign trade and of our domestic financial system.18.	At the political level  my Government has set a political time-table for itself which includes a series of measures and a full process of democratization which will lead to free and democratic elections in the near future so that the people may be the master of its own destiny.19.	In this way we are creating a political organization which will be a tool used by the society as a whole and which will make it possible for us to bring genuine peace to the country.20.	Violence  in fact  is a phenomenon caused by incompatibility between popular aspirations and economic  social and political structures; hence the eradication of violence  in the case of my country  is being made dependent upon the establishment of economic  social and political machinery to produce social flexibility  confidence and co-operation.21.	We are endeavouring to build a system of democratic life  a legal system of full respect for human rights to make it possible for us to conduct a process of social and moral integration.22.	My Government is taking positive steps towards the achievement of these goals. We require the co-operation of all Salvadorian citizens for this purpose without any discrimination or political or ideological differentiation. The important thing is to put an end to violent means and to seek to have reason prevail through calm  objective dialogue in order once and for all to put an end to irrational political action and to outbursts of emotion.23.	Our struggle is a difficult one because emotions and interests have been aroused that at present would seem to be irreconcilable. None the less  we are optimistic because we have faith and trust that we shall manage to establish a democratic society in which the people will be able to express themselves freely and in which the vote will be respected in the election of officials. Given a disintegrated society  a society in a state of conflict as a result of years of pain and exploitation  we have taken as our objective harmony and justice. We are optimistic because we believe in Salvadorians  in their intelligence and hard-working nature which will make it possible for them through self- determination and self-development  to emerge successfully from this time of trial.24.	As regards the international situation  we have seen that detente has lost ground in the face of confrontation between the super-Powers. We have seen this not only at the world level  in the problems in reduction  control and balance of nuclear weapons  but also in the proliferation of hotbeds of tension.25.	In these circumstances  the world runs a greater risk of a wide-ranging conflagration. This is most significant when Powers that in the past had confined their interests to given areas now wish to extend them to other regions  regions that had been traditionally more or less left out of the game of political and international ambitions.26.	In the face of the major Powers  in a world fought over by blocs and alliances of power  El Salvador has set for itself a clear foreign policy line based on its affirmation of its own sovereignty and independence in the face of any plans for expansionism  hegemonism or subjugation. Here we fully support the non-aligned countries.27.	The third world countries have matured sufficiently to make their positions of nationalism and self-determination prevail. It is authentic nationalism that must prevail in response to the conditions existing in each country.28.	We must reiterate that relations among sovereign States must be based on mutual respect for the principle of non-intervention. In relations among States  stable and precise rules and values must prevail  not temporary attitudes or expediency.29.	The people prefer attitudes of principle to demagogic posturing. The people are aware that different problems must be given different treatments and different responses. Even though we may try to compare different social phenomena  it is impossible to distort the essence of the social and political forces at work in each individual situation. The Government of El Salvador wishes to emphasize that respect for such principles will be its guiding light in its foreign policy. We see international law as essentially dynamic in a world of constant change  where principles are basically stable and permanent. The principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations provide the best approach to important problems in the international field.30.	With regard to South Africa  a country with which the Revolutionary Government of El Salvador broke  diplomatic relations less than a year ago  we see that it has continued to sponsor racial discrimination and the odious policy of apartheid and that it has done little to help the independence process of Namibia. This reluctance on the part of South Africa comes as no surprise to the Members of the United Nations.31.	We must be aware of the justified impatience of the people of Namibia  which  following its lengthy struggle for national identity  wishes to see the realization of its dearest ideal: complete independence. We wish to express our recognition of and support for the people of Namibia and its African brothers.32.	In connection with the process of decolonization in the north of Africa  El Salvador is in favour of the independence of Western Sahara.33.	We should now like to comment on a few international problems that affect peace in the world. These problems are of such importance that they have an unfavourable impact on other areas of the world.34.	The war that has been unleashed between Iran and Iraq is a matter of concern to my country. The conflict is particularly serious because of its potential for expansion and it unfavourable effects on the international economy. We urge the parties to the conflict to negotiate a cease-fire and to seek terms of understanding in order peacefully to resolve their disputes.35.	With regard to the situations of conflict in Afghanistan and Kampuchea  the international community has stated its opposition to the presence of foreign forces in those countries. The peoples of those nations must have the opportunity to determine freely their political future.36.	When a powerful State opposes the appeal made by the United Nations for it to correct its behaviour in the international field  the small countries have no alternative but to rely on the strength given them by the principles of the Charter and they must insist on the need for the application of the full force of international law and express their emphatic condemnation.37.	The non-aligned countries played a relevant role in the convening of the seventh emergency special session in July of this year to deal with the question of Palestine. My Government already expressed its views to the General Assembly in that connection. These views may be summarized as follows.38.	First  in the Middle East crisis the question of Palestine has a predominant place. In the Arab-Israeli problem the destiny of the people of Palestine is the nucleus.39.	Secondly  the Palestinian people has an inalienable right to self-determination and the establishment of its national homeland  that is  the right to form an internationally recognized sovereign State.40.	Thirdly  the acquisition of territories by force cannot be accepted  and therefore Israel must return such territories.41.	Fourthly  the Palestinian people has the right to be represented by whatever organization it deems fitting. The Arab world without exception has recognized the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO] as the sole legitimate representative of that people. Therefore that organization must be accepted and included in peace negotiations.42.	Fifthly  all States members of the international community must recognize the existence of the State of Israel and its right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries.43.	Jerusalem  because of its history and its religious importance  must be subject to a special regime in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.44.	We feel that the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to establish a State can be associated with the corresponding right of Israel to existence as a sovereign political entity. My delegation urges that efforts continue for a process of negotiation with the participation of all the parties concerned in the conflict.45.	In the Middle East region also  in regard to the question of Lebanon  my country hopes that that nation will at last recover the peace that is so necessary for the harmonious coexistence of its people.46.	El Salvador has given constant support to the work of the United Nations in the field of disarmament. That goal  which responds to the desire for world peace  has implications for development because of the vast resources that are diverted to the arms race. One step in that direction is represented by Protocol I of the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America. We hope that other regions will adopt similar denuclearization schemes.47.	With regard to the agreements between the major Powers  we feel it is a negative sign that the ratification of the SALT II Treaty is still pending and that no definite date has been set so far for the third round of negotiations on strategic arms limitations  known as SALT III. The escalation of the arms race in a search for advantage in the balance of weapons continues uninterrupted  with the assistance of vast technology which should be used for the development of peoples.48.	The overwhelming majority of States are at the present time spectators of a drama which  if it were to lead to tragedy  would turn them into protagonists. The Disarmament Decade will have significance only if we promote negotiations towards general and complete disarmament.49.	Allow me now to make a few comments on the world economic situation and on the aspirations of the developing countries. The economic problems facing our world are many and complex and are manifested in an economic crisis with a vast global impact  especially on the majority of the developing countries. We must find a solution to these problems within the framework of the United Nations.50.	At the eleventh special session  which has just been concluded  a consensus was reached on the text of the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade. While the text is not completely satisfactory  at least there was progress on agreements in the framework of the North-South dialogue. However  the aforementioned special session also had as its objective the launching of a global round of negotiations to begin in January of next year  and here there was failure. In fact three industrialized countries did not give their consent to a consensus on a text concerning procedure for that new round of global negotiations.  El Salvador is confident that at the thirty-fifth session it will be possible to achieve that consensus.51.	I wish to reiterate our full support for the positions of the Group of 77 and the group of countries that are members of the Latin American Economic System with regard to the new International Development Strategy and he global negotiations. My delegation considers that the items that should be given priority in the negotiations are those concerning raw materials  trade  development  energy and monetary and financial questions.52.	Although they are all of singular importance  in the view of my country the issue of raw materials is vital.53.	El Salvador  as a producer and exporter of coffee and a country whose economy depends to a great extent on that product  is affected by the unjust prices imposed by the international market while the prices of the goods that we need to import from developed countries increase day by day.54.	Moreover  the establishment of customs and non- customs barriers  mainly export quotas  by the industrialized world continues to have a negative impact on the economies of our countries.55.	Our country is awaiting with particular interest the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries that will be held next year. We are optimistic that positive results will be achieved for this category of countries  within the philosophy of international justice in distribution.56.	I should now like to refer to the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  which completed its ninth session after making marked progress. My Government wishes to stress the importance it attaches to the early signing of a convention regulating the issues. El Salvador has a maritime vocation and bases its hopes on its potential for exploiting the resources of the sea as an aid to its economic and social development. I wish to reaffirm our position that we consider to be under national sovereignty the adjacent sea to a 200-nautical-mile limit  without prejudice to freedom of navigation in accordance with international law.57.	I should now like to refer to a few relevant aspects of my country's foreign relations at the regional level.58.	At the Latin American level  El Salvador joins those countries that are fighting for democratization  countries from which it has received considerable demonstrations of solidarity and understanding. We have carried out a very successful dynamic policy aimed at increasing our ties.59.	As regards the Central American countries  in particular  we have given priority to the search for an agreement with the sister Republic of Honduras. A considerable part of our efforts have been geared to direct negotiations in a process of mediation effectively guided by the distinguished jurist  former President of the International Court of Justice  Mr. Jose Luis Bustamante y Rivero. The progress achieved is a source of well-founded optimism and we are confident that very soon we shall be signing a peace treaty  to which our peoples aspire.60.	Fortunately our countries have been able to use peaceful means to resolve their disputes  following their principle of respect for the rules and objectives of the Charter of the United Nations and the charter of the Organization of American States  a body that has played a relevant role in our search for understanding and harmony between the two nations.61.	In connection with the sister Republics of Guatemala  Nicaragua  Costa Rica and Panama  we have endeavoured to maintain the best possible level of relations  and to this end  the visits  dialogue and constant communication of our views and concerns have been fundamental.62.	We hope that in the framework of the principles contained in the San Jose Declaration  signed on 15 March  we shall be able to strengthen further our ties of regional co-existence  co-operation and integration.63.	I should like to read the first three paragraphs of the San Jose Declaration  which include the fundamental rules which should prevail in present relations among Central American countries.1.	""The peaceful and harmonious coexistence of the States of the Isthmus requires respect for the different social  economic and political systems  the right to self- determination and the right to resolve their internal matters in accordance with their own historic development.2.	""The absolute and unrestricted observance of the principle of non-intervention in the affairs of other States is vital to the maintenance of peace and security of the countries of the area.3.	""Respect for sovereignty  territorial integrity and political independence are vital conditions for guaranteeing the peaceful coexistence and economic and social development of States.""64.	It is fair to state that at this point  a crucial one for Central America  we have seen the generous will and readiness of Central American Governments to create renewed links of understanding and friendship.65.	Once again  sister States have felt their calling for unity  peace and close relations. In Central America  the reconstruction of the greater fatherland is a mystical concept. For El Salvador it is the height of our international political aspiration and responds to our deepest wishes. Hence  our devotion to Central American integration  to the strengthening of its common market  the creation of the most favourable atmosphere for a rapprochement and so overcoming the differences and problems that arise.66.	We see the safeguarding of human rights as an integral system that does not exclude continents  regions or countries because of different ideologies. Action should be undertaken without discrimination and without any political sectarianism. There should be a crusade to condemn violence  regardless of its source and of its motivation.67.	We are confident that the maximum protection of human rights requires a just and non-discriminating international system. In this context  we welcome and shall support the proposal to be submitted under agenda item 114 by the Nordic countries concerning the protection of diplomatic representatives and other persons invested with similar functions  such as officials of international organizations. The status of immunity is not a mere privilege; it has been and will continue to be a requirement for the normal fulfilment of the functions of a diplomat. It is inconceivable to any civilized mind that a diplomat should be a natural target for acts of terrorism.68.	In the context of human rights  we wish to refer to the deplorable fact of terrorism. Terrorist actions are in themselves violations of the most basic human rights. Of course  this phenomenon must be analysed in all its complexity in order to reveal its causes  to understand them and to eliminate them. Terrorism as such is an action that  because of the irrationality of the means used and its intrinsic brutality  violates the most sacred values and legal and moral concepts of society.69.	The Government of El Salvador highly appreciates the support received from friendly countries for its revolutionary process and wishes to stress that  on the basis of principle  it rejects in advance any conditions that might be attempted to be imposed on the granting of any sort of assistance. Likewise  for the same reason we reject any attempt at interference in our internal affairs  which would be inadmissible.70.	El Salvador demands  urges and asks countries that are interested in its internal affairs to respect the self- determination of its people  which will resolve its own problems. The internationalization of conflicts that are strictly domestic only worsens those conflicts. Intervention can endanger the peace and security of a regionâin this case  Central America.71.	The Revolutionary Junta of the Government of El Salvador places and reiterates its trust in the United Nations as a forum for unity within a plurality of interests and ideological and political trends  which confront each other with the force of their ideas and arguments in a constant search for reconciliation and consensus  on the understanding that the destiny of mankind will be shared and that we must all shoulder the serious responsibilities of avoiding its destruction and of promoting harmony  progress and well- being."
"124",6363,"SOM",35,1980,"ï»¿126.	I am happy to extend to you. Sir  on behalf of my delegation and in my own name  our congratulations and those of the Somali Government on your election to the presidency of this thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. Your election is a fitting tribute to your country  the Federal Republic of Germany  and to your personal attributes of wisdom  scholarship and expertise. My delegation assures you of its support and cooperation as you guide the deliberations of this session to fruition.127.	We also wish to express our appreciation of the hard work and outstanding accomplishments of your predecessor. Ambassador Salim  during his presidency of the thirty-fourth session and of the three special sessions over which he presided during 1980.128.	I cannot fail to mention here the tireless efforts of the Secretary-General. Mr. Kurt Waldheim. In strengthening the role of the United Nations and promoting world peace and progress. His personal dedication to the principles of the Charter and to the task of carrying out the mandates of the General Assembly and the Security Council continue to earn him the respect and gratitude of the international community.129.	It is always a pleasant duty to congratulate a valiant people on securing its independence and to welcome the accession of more States to membership of the United Nations. In the case of Zimbabwe we fully associate ourselves with the sentiments of other Member States which have preceded us in welcoming the assumption by Zimbabwe of its rightful place among the international community of nations 130.	My delegation also extends its most cordial good wishes to the Government and people of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines on their accession to independent nationhood and membership of the United Nations; together with Zimbabwe they have brought the world Organization a further step closer to the goal of universality.131.	As Member States assess the progress made over the past year towards the peaceful solution of international problems and the realization of the objectives of the Charter  it can hardly be denied that the overall state of international affairs gives little cause for optimism. Once again we find ourselves seized of issues that have preoccupied the international community before and continue to do so with little hope of progress towards their resolution by way of the promotion of the aims and objectives of the Charter. Some of those problems have even been aggravated  which has resulted in situations adding further to our concern and preoccupation. Meanwhile  totally new crises have been created by the actions of certain Member States  in violation of the basic and fundamental principles enshrined in the Charter  thus bringing about heightened international tension and serious threats to world peace and stability.132.	At present a grave and truly disturbing situation obtains in the Horn of Africa. Although that region has known little peace and stability over the past century  developments during the last six years have greatly exacerbated the prevailing crisis.133.	In Somalia we continue to face the problem of dealing with the largest refugee population in the world. The number of refugees currently being cared for in and outside camps has passed the one and a half million mark and continues to increase steadily  with a daily influx of well over 1 000 refugees arriving at camps. Since we were already experiencing the difficulties of underdevelopment  world inflation and natural disasters  it can be readily understood that this refugee problem has placed a quite intolerable burden on our country.134.	We are profoundly grateful for the assistance received directly and through the intermediary of the United Nations. However  unless the international response to the worsening refugee crisis is more forthcoming  thousands of women and children  who make up the bulk of the refugees in Somalia  may well die of starvation and disease in the near future. We have therefore to appeal for continued and more generous humanitarian assistance so that the serious plight of the refugees can be alleviated. Even so  it must be stressed that the refugees are themselves a symptom of deeper problems.135.	It is particularly important that the international community should understand and insist upon just solutions of the underlying political problems which are the basic cause of the refugee situation in the Horn of Africa. In the case of Western Somalia the refugees are fleeing from their homes because of the oppression and persecution to which they are subjected and because of the ravages of the unjust war which has been waged against the people by the ruling cliques in Addis Ababa ever since their attempts at colonization at the end of the last and during the present century.136.	By a combination of mass extermination  forcible expulsion and the total destruction of all means of livelihood  the present Ethiopian regime seeks to depopulate Western Somalia completely. The aim behind that Fascist scheme is to bring about a total transformation of the ethnic and demographic composition of the territory in question and to achieve a final solution by transplanting other nationalities to take their place  all under the guise of resettling so-called displaced persons. The international community has already condemned the barbarous and inhuman policies of those in power in the Ethiopian empire  who have fully earned the abysmal human rights record for which they are notorious. Such diabolical plans must be opposed not only by virtue of our humanity and sense of morality but also in view of the dire consequences which similar attempts have evoked in the past.137.	The refugee tragedy throughout the entire north-east of Africa is an outward manifestation of the aggressive and truculent stand on the part of the Addis Ababa regime in its vain efforts to confront its internal and external problems with naked force. Unable to suppress the intensifying liberation struggles  they have in desperation facilitated direct military intervention by the Soviet Union  a Power which has particularly recently  achieved notoriety for its exploitation of such situations. By arming its client State on a massive scale and by using surrogate forces  the Soviet Union has succeeded in gaining strong bases of operation for the advancement of its over-all political  economic and strategic ambitions in a sensitive area  which commands the commercial lanes of the Red Sea  the Indian Ocean and the Arabian Gulf.138. That unwarranted intervention has been at the expense of those still struggling to assert their rights to self-determination and independence: it has encouraged intransigence and persistent colonialism on the part of the cruel regime in Addis Ababa and has totally frustrated every avenue which might otherwise have led to a just resolution of the problems of the Horn of Africa through negotiation. Indeed  the peace  stability and security of States and peoples throughout the region arc in jeopardy. No State is capable of lacing such a challenge alone. Governments must play the role expected of them by their people and by the international community by virtue of their commitment under the Charter to safeguard international peace and security. They are obliged to take all the necessary precautions.139.	It is surely most surprising that the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union should be the one to accuse any nation of endangering peace in this context  as he did in his statement on 23 September. For the record  I can assure this Assembly that no agreements  recent or otherwise  made by my Government have ever permitted foreign military bases to come into being in our country. Moreover  it ill behoves the Soviet Government to sit in moral judgement on Somalia where the question of bases is concerned 140.	It is a well-known fact that the Soviet Government is for ever striving to establish a network of military bases in the Horn of Africa  the Red Sea  the Indian Ocean and elsewhere. No less than three Soviet naval bases have been established  in agreement with the colonialists in Addis Ababa  at the Eritrean ports of Massuwa and Assab and on the Dahlak Islands in the Red Sea. All this is in addition to the unfettered use of military and civil airports in Ethiopia for the furtherance of Soviet hegemonism.141.	Soviet-led intervention apart  I must re-emphasize that the problems of the Horn of Africa have one root cause and one alone; I refer of course to persistent colonialism on the part of Abyssinia. Despite its so-called socialist revolution. The regime in Addis Ababa has never abandoned its attempts to enslave the peoples of Western Somalia  Eritrea  Tigre  Oromia and Abbo. Abyssinian colonial activity in these territories is historically unquestionable  just as it is illegal and immoral. In this age of emancipation  when the wind of freedom has swept across almost the length and breadth of the African continent  the rise to arms by subject peoples is historically inevitable and demands the understanding  encouragement and support of all who cherish freedom and liberty in this world.142.	The dangerous combination of militarism  foreign intervention  confrontation and instability is but a consequence of the forcible denial of the inalienable rights of these peoples to self-determination and to shape their own destiny. While such a situation continues  international peace and security remain in grave danger. My Government  of course  continues to be ready and willing to discuss the problems of the Horn of Africa with the parties directly concerned and fully supports the principle of the right of all peoples to self-determination and emancipation.143.	Most unfortunately  as the Chairman of the OAU pointed out in his statement to the Assembly on 24 September  the ministerial meeting of the Good Offices Committee on the Ethiopia-Somalia dispute has not ""been successful and if anything  tension appears to have increased of late."" The reasons for this failure are only loo clear. In its deliberations  the Committee failed to take into account the legitimate rights of the people of Western Somalia themselves  which  after all  constitute the crux of the matter. Surprisingly  they also failed to reiterate the well-known OAU position that foreign Ibices should refrain from intervention in Africa's internal problems.144.	The alarming truth is that the colonial clique in Addis Ababa has no interest in taking such constructive steps as would reduce tension but has embarked instead on a path of increasing escalation which is currently involving not only the oppressed peoples of Western Somalia but the Somali Democratic Republic itself. No longer content with poisoning wells  bombing and burning settlements and strafing herds  since the beginning of this year Ethiopian ground and air forces and their alliances have repeatedly launched attacks against towns  villages and refugee camps well inside Somalia. A most blatant and recent example was on 27 August  when a fully motorized force supported by tanks  artillery and tighter planes invaded my country. The encroaching columns penetrated into our territory at points along the de facto border in the north-eastern part of the country  causing in the process much wanton destruction of life and property. However  the Somali armed forces compelled them to retreat. It is quite clear  however  that the Ethiopian warmongering leadership has failed to learn from this experience  a further act of aggression by their land forces took place even more recently near the town of Dolo  and the town of let has been bombed and strafed from the air.145.	Similar acts of military barbarity are committed daily against other colonized peoples currently struggling under the Abyssinian yoke. To cite one pertinent example  the people of Eritrea  whose national status has been recognized by the United Nations and whose right to self-determination was the very basis of the federation with Ethiopia recommended by this Assembly and established in 1952  only to be contemptuously cast aside by that same colonialist regime  have been compelled  like the Western Somalis  to take up arms in defence of their rights. The world cannot afford to ignore such liberation struggles  not only because they are just and legitimate but also because the conflicts in the Horn of Africa  like those in South-East Asia and the Middle East  provide an opportunity for the spreading of new imperialism and hegemony.146.	Indeed  liberation struggles arc the natural response of the peoples of Africa wherever vestiges of the colonial past linger on. This is as true in southern Africa as it is in the north-east. It is the duty of us all to support and encourage emancipation in Africa and elsewhere until it is achieved totally  and the few surviving colonial and oppressive regimes  irrespective of their colour or creed  are dumped into the dustbin of history. I have referred to the joyous celebration by the Government and people of Somalia of the resounding victory of the people of Zimbabwe. In the meantime we reflect not only on the problems of the Western Somalis and the Eritreans but on the circumstances which keep the people of Namibia under illegal  racist and persistent colonial domination and which also subject the majority of the people of South Africa to the indignity and the inhumanity of apartheid.147.	Over the past five years the numerous ultimatums directed to South Africa by the Security Council on the question of Namibia have so far been flouted with impunity by the minority regime. South Africa has been able to buy time for its machinations. My Government shares the frustration of the vast majority of Member States as negotiations on the Western proposals are held up on one pretext or another  while at the same time the Botha regime persists in its plans to establish its puppets in Namibia and to launch large-scale military aggression against SWAPO  the legitimate representative of the Namibian people  and against the Republic of Angola. We call again on the Security Council to fulfil its responsibilities to the Namibian people 148.	Within South Africa itself the so-called guardians of Western civilization steadily descend to new and more barbarous depths. The recent clubbing  tear-gassing  imprisonment and even massacre of school children protesting at sub-standard education surpass in horror the callous murder of hundreds of men and women at Sharpeville. My Government is convinced that the last bastions of racism and persistent colonialism in southern Africa will be eliminated. Somalia strongly supports the international consensus that mandatory sanctions against South Africa under Chapter VII of the Charter are eminently justified and constitute an essential weapon in the struggle against colonialism and racism in southern Africa.149.	I shall now address myself to a problem of particular concern to us all in terms of its relevance to the enduring validity of basic rights and freedoms enshrined in the Charter and its even graver implications for international peace and securityânamely  the Palestinian question. It is quite clear that on the core issues of Palestinian nationhood and self-determination  Israel continues in arrogant defiance to thwart all international effort. Its contempt for the norms of international law and morality is illustrated by the acceleration of its expansionist and annexationist policies in the occupied territories and its frequent acts of aggression against Lebanon.150.	The extent to which Israel is prepared to go in its quest for the realization of its expansionist dreams is evidenced by its recent attempt at formalizing the illegal annexation of the Holy City of Jerusalem and declaring it to be the capital if Israel. We are convinced that strict adherence to the letter and spirit of cardinal principles guaranteeing basic and fundamental rights enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations  as well as to the relevant decisions of the General Assembly and of the Security Council  is the only basis for a just  equitable and durable peace. In practical terms  this calls for appropriate action by the international community to compel Israel to withdraw from all occupied Arab lands and to ensure Palestinian self-determination and statehood.151.	My delegation takes this opportunity to reaffirm its support for the implementation of the declaration of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace. As a member of the Ad Hoc Committee which is currently seized of this important matter  we are in favour of the holding of the projected conference on the Indian Ocean  to be held in Sri Lanka in 1981. It must be pointed out  however  that the laudable objectives of the conference can be achieved only when the forces of the great Powersâand. I would stress  those of all their surrogatesâreturn to their own countries and cease obstructing the legitimate desires and  in some instances  struggles  of the inhabitants of the region to live in peace and freedom and to determine their own destiny.152.	Indeed  in several areas of the world  disputes of long-standing duration remain unsettled and new ones become entrenched also  in part because of the presence of foreign forces. This is the case in Democratic Cambodia and Afghanistan  where outside intervention prevents the people of those countries from deciding upon their own future and destiny. In our view  the immediate withdrawal of all foreign forces from Afghanistan and Cambodia is an essential prerequisite for the creation of a climate of peace and international security in Indo-China and West Asia.153.	There can only be alarm and despondency over the failure of the nuclear Powers to make any real progress towards disarmament. Untold wealth and vast and valuableâ but nevertheless finiteâresources are being squandered annually in the name of defence  but actually on the refinement of the concepts of ""over-kill""  the further development of sophisticated armaments and nuclear weapons and ever larger stockpiles. The arms race is undoubtedly one of the links in the chain of cause and effect which involves confusion in the international monetary system  spiralling inflation  protectionism on the part of the major industrial Powers  the decline of world trade and adverse terms and sharp increases in trade deficits for the developing countriesâ not to mention a steady reduction in development aid.154.	It remains a fact  however  that the only real defence against utter chaos must be the bridgingânot the wideningâ of the dangerous abyss now yawning between developed and developing nationsâbetween North and South. Alarming predictions already current on levels of world hunger in the year 2 000 are a grim reminder  if one were needed. My Government therefore urges wealthy and industrialized countries to pledge resources and energies that have to date been devoted to the destructive arms race to the promotion of development  in the conviction that thus only can a new chain of events be set in motion which will be beneficial to all nations and which will ensure world peace and progress.155.	For these and other reasons  progress on the world economic scene has been very modest indeed over the past decade  Meanwhile  the population of our planet continues to increase  Beset as we in the developing world are by the adverse economic trends 1 have described  and by the effects of the ever increasing price of oil. We recognize most clearly the urgent need for the adoption of new and wider measures. This has been suggested by the Secretary-General on IS September'"" at the conclusion of the eleventh special session of the Assembly which discussed our critical economic situation and agreed in consensus on a text for an International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade. We also consider it very significant that the special session agreed on the adoption of resolutions on assistance to the least developed countries.156.	Moreover  particularly in view of the fact that the goals and objectives of the Second United Nations Development Decade remain largely unfulfilled  it is imperative that we lose no time in commencing the restructuring of the international economic order. We cannot conceal our extreme disappointment over the failure of the fifth session of UNCTAD and the launching of global negotiations relating to international co-operation for development. It must be admitted that the group of countries that has the advantage in the current system is still dangerously declining to recognize the interdependence that exists in our world today. This attitude is in need of fundamental change. The fifth session of UNCTAD has drawn up a sound and urgent programme of action and has outlined the steps needed to help developing countries over the next few years. Its basic programme of action for the 1980s can provide the less favoured among the international community with at least a minimum in the fields of nutrition  health  housing  communications  education and employment.157.	Such issues are particularly urgent for countries which like my own  from time to time suffer from natural disasters and longer term problems such as desertification  yet must also face all the problems of inflation and rising prices. It is still not too late for the steps recommended to be put into effect  in order that the Strategy for the new International Development Decade be implemented to the ultimate benefitâand indeed the very survivalâof all mankind."
"125",6400,"STP",35,1980,"ï»¿The thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly is being held at a time of growing tension in international relations. This situation is hindering the efforts and the prospects with regard to the need for a climate of dialogue essential to the solution of the basic questions facing mankind on the threshold of the year 2000.45.	This assertion prompts us to reflect on the role of the United Nations in the context of the major problems of our day. The ideal forum in which peoples can come together; the United Nations is also the catalyst for the hopes of most of mankind  which is working tirelessly to realize the ideals of freedom  peace and dignity.46.	In this context  the admission to our Organization of the Republic of Zimbabwe represents a twofold victory. On the one hand  it demonstrates once more that the determination of a people is the fundamental factor in the struggle to win its right to manage its own destiny; on the other  it crowns the efforts of the international community.47.	Thus  in welcoming the delegation of the Republic of Zimbabwe as the one hundred and fifty-third full-fledged Member of the United Nations  we greet all those who  united by the principles and ideals of our Organization  contributed to the triumph of justice and freedom.48.	We also welcome the republic of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to our Organization.49.	In the context of the contradictions and changes of our time  the United Nations assumes a primary role as a forum for the condemnation of situations and actions which aim to stifle the rebellious outcry of peoples resolved to burst the chains of injustice and humiliation. In this connection  we cannot disregard the tragic situation in Chile  El Salvador and Bolivia  where the peoples find their basic human rights stifled by successive waves of repression and terror. Our silence would constitute a complicity hardly compatible with our commitment to defend manâthe subject  object  end and raison d'etre of our Organization's existenceâby every means at our disposal.50.	Finally  the United Nations is above all the most appropriate forum for seeking constructive and essential dialogue among nations and peoples sharing a common concern to build a future worthy of mankind. Yet developments in the international situation prompt us to observe with apprehension another dimension of the United Nations.51.	Have we succeeded in using the United Nations truly to bring the peoples of our planet together?52.	The difficulties faced by our Organization in realizing the ideal of bringing peoples together for the achievement of well-being for all might lead us to believe that the path of dialogue has not been embarked upon equally by all the Members of our Organization and that we are running the risk of diverting dialogue from its true end  that of uniting and bringing closer together peoples and countries in defence of shared ideals.53.	There is a tendency in the United Nations to turn dialogue into a diversionary exercise  which leads us to a constant postponement of solutions commensurate with the seriousness of problems and the expectations they raise. This constant postponement of adequate solutions might  if senselessly prolonged  make peoples lose faith in the strength of dialogue  which would lead to growing feelings of despair in the context of the expectations of nations and peoples yearning for redress.54.	In this context  what can be said of the situation in Namibia? The right of the people of Namibia to independence has continued through the years to be the subject of longâinterminableâscrutiny. Despite the sacrifices made by the Namibian people  led by SWAPO  and despite our efforts  that heroic people has had as its sole reply repression and terror.55.	Only the irresponsible blindness of the apartheid regime in the face of the progress of history and the shameful interests of a group of Member States can explain the systematic rejection of the solutions proposed by our Organization. The United Nations considers apartheid to be a crime against humanity. Yet  in spite of the heroic struggle of the people of South Africa  under the auspices of the African National Congress  and in spite of our repeated condemnations millions of people continue to live in conditions unworthy of human beings.56.	And in this context  what can be said of the aggressive and criminal policies of that racist State against the People's Republic of Angola and against other sovereign States of the region? What is the meaning of dialogue in these circumstances?57.	The problem of Palestine has been discussed in our Organization for some four decades. The solution to this question involves  first of all  recognition of the right to self-determination  the establishment of an independent State and the Palestinian people's return to its homeland.58.	The PLO is today an essential factor for peace in the Middle East. Whenever the need for peace in that region is felt with greater urgency and a comprehensive solution appears urgently necessary  we witness attempts to disregard the legitimacy and representative nature of the PLO as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. If we envisage a solution which serves the circumstantialâand therefore ephemeralâinterests of the moment  to a problem which requires the effective participation of the United Nations and all the concerned parties  we are inevitably doomed to failure.59.	What explanation can be found for the obstinacy of Israel and its supporters in their rejection of a dialogue which would spare mankind the risks of a crisis with unforeseeable consequences?60.	Is the systematic policy of taking unilateral and aggressive measuresâsuch as the recent transformation of Jerusalem into the capital of Israel and the acts of aggression perpetrated against southern Lebanonâa measure leading to dialogue?61.	The invasion and occupation of East Timor since 1975 by Indonesian forces have tragically interrupted the process of decolonization in progress in that Territory.62.	The international community should pay particular attention to the struggle of the Maubere people for its right to self-determination and independence under the aegis of its legitimate representative  FRETILIN.  We also hope that Portugal will more clearly assume its position as administering Power.63.	The distressing division of Cyprus and the obstacles in the way of the peaceful and independent reunification of Korea only reinforce our desire for peace and co-operation among peoples.64.	Likewise  the presence of military bases is a source of concern for the Government of Sao Tome and Principe. In spite of repeated declarations by the United Nations  the non-aligned movement and the OAU aimed at making the Indian Ocean a zone of peace  we find that new bases have been set up in that region. These manoeuvres endanger the integrity  security and sovereignty of nearby States and contribute not at all to the establishment of an atmosphere of harmony in the world.65.	It is with a sense of urgency that we reiterate the support of the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe for the peoples of these countries and appeal to our Organization to assume all the responsibilities demanded by each of these issues so as to prevent the prolongation of situations of flagrant injustice which are so costly in human lives. In this connection  it would be remiss of us not to mention the situation of Western Sahara. We hope that the course of dialogue and understanding will triumph in order to enable the Democratic Sahraoui Arab Republic to join the great family of the United Nations.66.	The situations which we have mentioned by no means constitute an exhaustive list of the problems facing mankind which require us to take a specific position.67.	There is  in fact  a fundamental question at issue for our Organization. If we persist in the present course of fruitless and frustrating dialogue  we could compromise the essence of our Organization  namely its great moral force as the spokesman for the conscience of mankind. This immense storehouse of trust and hope which our moral force represents must be preserved and protected against the attempts at erosion to which it is subjected.68.	Indeed the forces that persist in disregarding the role of the United Nations by consistent and repeated rejection of its decisions recognize  in their attempts to evade the implementation of our decisions  often by unjustifiable means  the power of our moral force.69.	The impasse which characterizes our debates and initiatives concerning the need for a new international economic order and general and complete disarmament under effective international control is for us and for the majority of the peoples of the world a source of constant and growing concern.70.	Day by day the incidence of death  destruction  misery and disaster increases and spreads. Is it our role to watch that increase?71.	Rendered powerless by our limitations and by the interests of a selfish  necrophil minority  are we to allow man to destroy mankind?72.	Is it not time to put an end to this dangerous situation by introducing into our process of dialogue the real  concrete dimension of our resolve  commitment  determination and responsibility to do all in our power to ensure that the fundamental rights of peoples and nations are respected and defended?73.	By acting in this way we may avoid a situation in which the feeling of frustration caused by the lack of response to the urgent and vital problems of our day might lead to despair and insidiously substitute itself to the feeling of hope in the heart of man.74.	We believe that the major responsibility lies with the United Nations if it is to remain faithful to the noble principles set forth in its Charter.75.	Within the framework of the responsibilities which our Organization is called upon to assume  the Secretary- General plays a primary role.76.	We are therefore very happy to congratulate Mr. Kurt Waldheim on the persistent efforts which he has made to implement our decisions and on his relentless search for viable solutions to the delicate and complex problems that require his constant intervention. We are convinced that the example of his dedication will go down in the annals of ourOrganization and that this will be a source of additional encouragement in our collective commitment.77.	Your own qualities  Sir  as a diplomat and a man of action  demonstrated throughout a long career characterized by your great competence  are a guarantee of the success of our work.78.	We wish to take this opportunity to congratulate the outgoing President  Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim  on the brilliant manner in which he discharged his responsibilities in the search for solutions to the problems of our time. The efficiency  care and commitment with which he dealt with the problems considered by the General Assembly only served to confirm the qualities and merits that contributed to his election.79.	We cannot conclude without expressing the concern of the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe with regard to the recent conflict between two fraternal non- aligned countries  Iran and Iraq. We are convinced that those two countries will demonstrate tolerance and understanding in order to make it possible to reach through dialogue an appropriate and definitive settlement of their dispute."
"126",6432,"SUR",35,1980,"ï»¿The task of the President of the General Assembly becomes more difficult each year  due in part to the special sessions of the Assembly. It is therefore a cause for satisfaction to know that a diplomat of the stature of Baron Rudiger von Wechmar  whose outstanding personal qualities  great diplomatic ability and skill are well known to us  has been entrusted with guiding this Assembly. We also extend our greetings to him as a representative of the Federal Republic of Germany  a country with which Suriname has long-standing relations of friendship and co-operation and which plays an increasingly important role in the shaping of world affairs. We are confident that his extensive knowledge of United Nations affairs will be a major asset to the successful work of this session.2.	We offer special thanks to his predecessor  Ambassador Salim Ahmed Salim of the United Republic of Tanzania. At the time of his election to the presidency of the thirty-fourth General Assembly session we were certain that he would perform his task excellently in all respects  for Ambassador Salim always exceeded our expectations.3. We include in our expressions of thanks the Secretary- General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  who once again put forth his best efforts in the performance of his difficult tasks  especially that of promoting international peace and security.4.	When Suriname was admitted to our international Organization in 1975  our country had reached quite satisfactory political and economic levels. Before its independence  Suriname was already autonomous in its domestic affairs  while it had the right to have a say in the foreign relations of the Kingdom of the Netherlands  of which it formed a part. The natural resources of the country  especially in the areas of land  forestry and mining  offered good prospects for a favourable economic development. Consequently  Suriname amply met the conditions which are indispensable for real independence in the community of nations.5.	What holds true for individual persons  howeverâ namely  that the availability of sufficient means does not guarantee growth towards spiritual adulthoodâalso holds true for a country  as an association of individuals. For the development of a country towards true independence  it is certainly required that the State organs act according to certain moral values in order to prevent disorder  stagnation and deterioration. I regret to say that in recent years those norms were not observed in an appropriate manner  as a result of which our country was threatened with slipping into a deep abyss.6.	Since 15 March of this year we have had a new Government in our country  and it has undertaken a total renovation of policies. We have set ourselves the goal of arresting the process of moral and physical deterioration which had unfortunately set in during recent years and of guiding the country on a new course oriented to the development of Suriname and its people for the benefit of the people.7.	We are well aware that this will have only symbolic value if the management of the country is not supported by our people in all walks of life. The process of renovation is already in progress and will be completed in the following sectors: the governmental and political order  the social welfare order  the social economic order and the education order.8.	The Government of Suriname will lead the country in a truly democratic spirit  and in accordance with the best democratic standards and traditions  in order to realize these objectives  in which it has the full support of the people  the National Military Council and other functional groups. It is our desire at all costs to prevent our country from again t 'king the road of increasing injustice and arbitrariness. We particularly want to prevent development from benefiting only a small group of privileged persons  Extremism  whether from the far right or the extreme left  is not welcome in Suriname. The policy pursued by the Government is aimed at establishing social peace and justice for all. This places the Government slightly left of centre.9.	Our country fully respects its bilateral and multilateral commitments  in particular those enshrined in the Charter of our Organization  the authentic principles of the non- aligned movement and those of the Organization of American States.10.	It is our intention to strengthen our ties with other progressive Governments  both in the region and elsewhere. Suriname will continue to conduct its foreign policy as a truly independent State  guided by the abovementioned principles. It has no intention whatsoever of becoming a satellite State.11.	Suriname favours a world order based on mutual respect and dialogue among States and respect for human rights. In our opinion  relations between States should not be determined by elements of power. In no way should differences in military or economic might determine these relations. Countries should be able to settle their own internal affairs  free from outside interference  and to develop along the lines decided by their people.12.	The delegation of Suriname therefore views with great concern the expanding war between Iran and Iraq. The continued war between these two non-aligned nations could develop into a most serious threat to international peace. Consequently  my delegation urgently calls upon the Governments of Iran and Iraq to comply with Security Council resolution 479 (1980) of 28 September 1980.13.	Within a period of seven months the Government of Suriname had to deal with two planned coups intended to end the reforming process set in motion in our country after 25 February of this year. The first action pitted against the Government elements of the old regime  which harboured the intention to return the previous incompetent  corrupt and arrogant rightist regime to power. The second action pitted extremists from the left against the Government and was even more dangerous. To keep matters under control  the Government had to declare a state of emergency and dissolve Parliament. Consequently  the Constitution had to be suspended.14.	A new Constitution is now being drafted. As an intermediate step  an Assembly will be appointed until a new Parliament is elected. The Assembly will consist of representatives of various functional groups of the population  labour unions included. Those unions continue to function normally. In addition  a planning council will be established. It will be a tripartite organ in which representatives of Government  workers and employers will collectively bear responsibility for Suriname's economic policies.15.	Our population warmly supports the liquidation of the old corruptive system. Those who have profiteered under that system will be held responsible. Consequently  a special court has been established to deal with the large number of corruption cases. That special court will observe internationally accepted principles of criminal law and conduct its sessions in accordance with fair judicial procedures. Therefore  the defendants are guaranteed a fair trial. We should welcome observers to the proceedings of the court  which will be open to the press and the public.16.	' My delegation warmly welcomes the arrival in our midst of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Zimbabwe as independent States. On this happy occasion we extend our most cordial congratulations to the Government of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and the Government of Zimbabwe on their membership of the world Organization. We are convinced that they will make an important contribution to the translation of the objectives and principles of the United Nations into reality.17.	Since the independence of Zimbabwe could only be achieved after the defeat of the forces of colonialism and racism  the emergence of that country on 18 April of this year as an independent nation and its subsequent admission as a new Member of the United Nations during the recent special session of the General Assembly on economic development has a special significance for peoples all over the world who are interested in justice  human dignity  and peace.18.	The result of the struggle in Zimbabwe is the light at the end of the tunnel for peoples still struggling for justice and human dignity. We salute the courageous people of Zimbabwe and wish them well in all their future endeavours.19.	A special tribute goes to the Government of Great Britain which as the administering Power combined wisdom and resoluteness in the critical hours of Zimbabwe's transition to independence.20.	The admission of new Members to the world Organization in a year in which commemoration of the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples is envisaged highlights the important work being done by the Special Committee on the situation with regard to the implementation of that Declaration. We commend the Special Committee for its important work in eliminating colonialism from the face of the globe and wish it strength and the power to persevere in its noble task.21.	The Charter of the United Nations calls the maintenance of international peace and security one of the Organization's most important functions. That task has become still more difficult during the course of this year owing to the increasing international political tension and the deterioration of the world economy.22.	The worsening political situation is noticeable on almost all continents  while political problems are unfortunately not limited to the countries or regions in which they originated. Many of those crises have the potential for spreading beyond the borders of the countries and regions directly involved. It is in that context that we see the continued presence of foreign armed forces in Afghanistan in spite of the request contained in resolution ES-6/2 of 14 January 1980 adopted at the sixth emergency special session of the General Assembly. This is true also of the situation in South Africa and the Middle East  the Palestinian question  the annexation by Israel of the eastern part of Jerusalem  notwithstanding protests from the entire world community  the Korean question  the situation in Namibia  the still unresolved problem of the American hostages in Iran  the situation in South-East Asia  and the situation between Iran and Iraq.23.	The Government of the Republic of Suriname is of the opinion that all those problems should be solved peacefully through dialogue in accordance with the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations.24.	On our continent the growing tension in Central America is a source of considerable concern to us. A bright spot is provided by the fact that the new Government of Nicaragua is raising that fraternal country from the ashes of the previous regime.25.	The possibility of internal and external outbursts in the Caribbean area is constantly on the increase  in particular as a result of the deterioration of the social and economic situation and the increasing unemployment associated therewith.26.	The Government of Suriname is aware of the fact that we are a part of the American continent and that many bonds connect us with the fate of the countries of the Caribbean. Therefore  it intends to strengthen the bonds linking us to our Caribbean brothers. Not only does it support the further improvement of existing bilateral relations  it is at the same time a vigorous proponent of regional co-operation with those countries.27.	Our stand on the right of self-determination  the right of a people to chart its own destiny  led us to vote for the General Assembly resolution of 29 July 1980  which is in general consistent with the principles on which our position is based. Our positive vote on the resolution  however  does not mean that we would not have preferred a reinstatement of the right of all the States in the regionâincluding Israelâto a secure and independent existence  as provided for in Security Council resolution 242 (1967).28.	It is not lost on us that the separate peace agreement of 1979 between Israel and Egypt has not proved contagious and that it did not result in a solution of the central problem of the Middle East conflict.29.	All other issues  however important they may be  such as the increasingly harsh Israeli military occupation  the rigid attitude of the Government of Mr. Begin and the latest sad act of the Knesset regarding the eastern part of Jerusalem  are more symptoms than problems. The central problem remains that the Palestinians want a State of their own and that Israel denies the Palestinians their right to determine their own political future. That is the basic issue which lies at the very core of a solution. A solution to the Middle East problem can be found only if Palestinians and Israelis accept each other's right to have a State.30.	By its resolution 273 (III) of 11 May 1949  the General Assembly  noting that Israel was a peace-loving State able and willing to carry out the obligations contained in the Charter of the United Nations  decided to admit it to membership of the United Nations. That historic resolution was based on the acceptance by the world community of the right of the Israelis to establish their own homeland.31.	We fervently hope that the Government of Israel will be capable of rethinking and reconsidering its traditional position and that it will be able to accept for the Palestinians the same raison d'etre which led to the establishment of the Jewish homeland and the adoption of that 1949 resolution by the world Organization.32.	At the end of the tenth special session  devoted to disarmament  the General Assembly adopted on 30 June 1978 the Final Document of that session  which contains a Declaration from which the following is taken:""Mankind today is confronted with an unprecedented threat of self-extinction arising from the massive and competitive accumulation of the most destructive weapons ever produced. Existing arsenals of nuclear weapons alone are more than sufficient to destroy all life on earth. Failure of efforts to halt and reverse the arms race  in particular the nuclear arms race  increases the danger of the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Yet the arms race continues.""33.	That Final Document was adopted unanimously without any opposition from nuclear or other States. However  since its adoption  the arms race has continued unabated in the areas of both nuclear and conventional armaments.34.	The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  which has now been signed by 113 countries  was reviewed during the second Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty  held at Geneva from 11 August to 7 September 1980. The Government of Suriname expresses its regret that differences over nuclear arms control issues have prevented the Review Conference from adopting a comprehensive final document  despite the fact that general agreement had been reached on many significant issues. The provisions of the Treaty should have been given full support in order to avoid a possible weakening of this unique instrument for international peace and security. It is beyond any doubt that the Treaty has prevented the horizontal spread of nuclear arms and thereby strengthened international security.35.	On the other hand  China and France are not yet parties to the Treaty  and other non-nuclear countries which are now on the verge of crossing the so-called nuclear threshold have not yet signed it. The Treaty can also bring to a halt the continuous expansion and modernization of the nuclear-weapons arsenals of the Soviet Union and the United States.36.	For those reasons the Government of Suriname is convinced of the essential importance of this Treaty. As a country which is not an oil producer  we fully realize the enormous importance of the peaceful use of nuclear power. That  however  should in no way be an obstacle to the signing of the Treaty. Therefore  we are of the opinion that acceptance of this Treaty must be made more attractive by creating greater and easier access to the possibilities of the peaceful use of nuclear power.37.	An outstanding and unique example of a regional approach to non-proliferation is the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of TlateIolco)  which has been ratified by Suriname. It offers the possibility of preventing a nuclear holocaust in the Latin American continent. Moreover  it can serve as a prototype for other treaties for nuclear-weapon-free zones.38.	The Government of Suriname and the 22 sister countries in which the Treaty is in force would feel more secure if its full effect were extended to Argentina  Brazil  Chile  Cuba and Guyana. In particular  we hope for rapid ratification of that Treaty by Argentina and accession to it by Cuba and Guyana. Moreover  it calls on the Governments of France and the United States to ratify its Additional Protocol I.39.	An alarming phenomenon in the macabre tragedy of the arms race is certainly the fact that the third world countries  whose subsistence levels are under increasing pressure from external factors such as imported inflation  capital shortages and oil prices  are utilizing their already limited resources for the acquisition of arms to a constantly increasing extent. In the 1970s the total importation of arms by third world countries quadrupled compared to that of the 1960s.40.	A serious setback in the efforts to slow down the arms race is the fact that the SALT II Treaty  which was signed by President Brezhnev and President Carter at Vienna on 18 June 1978  are at present in danger of becoming victims of the bloc policies of those super-Powers.41.	Although the SALT II Treaty itself does not contain any drastic solution to the armaments problem  important political advantages are connected with it. In particular  it offers the hope that detente between the super-Powers will increase  which could exert a positive influence  especially if the treaty were followed immediately by new bilateral negotiations on further reductions in nuclear and conventional armaments.42.	Political decolonization is almost complete  except for some exceptions such as Namibia and several smaller areas  even on our continent.43.	In Namibia  the United Nations is again confronted with an attempt by the Government of the Republic of South Africa to prevent independence in that area. Pretoria originally gave the impression that it was in agreement with the so-called Western plan to hold elections under the supervision of the United Nations and with the stationing of United Nations troops there. Moreover  South Africa agreed in principle with the proposal of the Secretary- General  Mr. Waldheim  for a demilitarized zone between Angola and Namibia.  Since then  however  Pretoria has presented new conditions which are unacceptable not only to the front-line States but also to the United Nations. In this connection I should like to refer to South Africa's attempt to ignore all United Nations resolutions on Namibia  including those in which the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO] is recognized as the sole legitimate representative of the Namibian people.44.	The problem of Namibia cannot be considered separately from the political situation in South Africa itself  which is determined in all respects by the apartheid problem. The Government of Suriname condemns the apartheid policy of that country on moral grounds. No other position is conceivable  considering  among other things  that our population is composed of descendants from different continents. Our concept of life and our morality lead to a sharp rejection of any form of racism.45.	Since the founding of our world Organization  much has been said about the apartheid problem and Namibia. Various measures which are unquestionably useful have been taken within the framework of the United Nations. One of them is the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid  which was signed by Suriname on 3 June this year. However  the resolutions of our world Organization will be powerless as long as they do not affect the economy of South Africa.46.	The Government of Suriname supports  for example  Security Council resolution 473 (1980) of 13 June 1980  which was introduced as a reaction to the terror perpetrated by the Government of South Africa against schoolchildren who had demonstrated against the apartheid policy.47.	The call in that resolution on Pretoria to end its apartheid policy  to grant an amnesty to prisoners  to refrain from aggression against independent African States and so on  will always be ignored as long as no concrete measures are taken  particularly a comprehensive policy of mandatory sanctions including especially an embargo on oil products.48.	It is important to note that South Africa expressed interest in the Western plan for Namibia only when faced with an impending embargo. The time for verbal condemnation has passed; the time for concrete action has now arrived.49.	The Government of Suriname formally expresses its support for the oppressed peoples of Namibia and South Africa  and in particular for SWAPO  the African National Congress and the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania. It fully supports the struggle for national liberation and the eradication of racism  racial discrimination and colonialism in those areas.50.	In this connection  allow me to make a few remarks about the spectre of a new and subtle form of apartheid which seems gradually to be emerging and which has not yet been subjected to sufficiently thorough consideration in international forums. I am referring to the problem of the cultural and ethnic minorities in parts of Europe.51.	The rapid economic development of Western Europe could be achieved only through the importation of a large amount of cheap labour from third world countries  among them Algeria  Turkey  Morocco and countries in the Caribbean region. Those workers were lured from their homelands under numerous pretexts. Roughly one third of the total Caribbean population now live in Western European countries. Western Europe's prosperity would be unthinkable without the contribution and efforts of those so-called guest labourers or migrant workers to its industrial process.52.	However  as a result of the current global recession  we are now witnessing emerging patterns of racism and inhuman and discriminatory treatment of those minorities. The rate of unemployment of people in that category is disproportionately high  their living conditions are deplorable and their children in many cases are being deprived of adequate education  while they are often excluded from public accommodation. They cannot participate fully in the common opportunities of public life because they are often denied access to that accommodation. The ethnic minorities are frequently de facto restricted to secluded areas and subjected to police brutality in many cases.53.	This leads me to the conclusion that human rights problems are not limited to South Africa or to certain regimes in some third world countries. They are certainly not alien to Europe. The many cases of infringement on the human rights of ethnic minorities in that part of the world bear witness to that sad fact of life. If not checked  that problem could  in our opinion  turn into a source of tension that will not be in the interest of international peace.54.	For these reasons my delegation suggests that a special session of the General Assembly be convened to deal with this unfortunate problem. In the meantime  we believe that the appropriate organs of our Organization should address themselves more extensively to that phenomenon.55.	In this regard  my delegation will support every effort to improve the lot of migrant workers  a problem which appears on the agenda of the Third Committee at this session of the Assembly. More specifically  my delegation will lend its support to the coming into being of a convention aimed at furthering the cause of those workers and their families. Such a convention could also deal with the serious problem of the brain drain from developing nations. Many among us would not contest the expert opinion that the development aid given to the developing nations is surpassed by the benefits derived from that brain drain.56.	The eleventh special session of the General Assembly  held recently  marked the beginning of the third United Nations Development Decade. The outcome of this Decade is uncertain  but it is clear that the economic development of our planet will be influenced by the achievements of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. Since the first session of that Conference in December 1973  more than 66 weeks have been spent in meetings to establish a new international regime for hydrospace.57.	Considerable progress was made at the recent session at Geneva. It is our hope that the third revision of the informal composite negotiating text of the draft convention will be transformed into a final draft treaty during the next and  I hope  final session. My Government is concerned at the unilateral mining legislation promulgated by certain States and urges other industrialized States not to follow that example. It is hoped that those States will not limit themselves to paying lip-service to the noble concept of the common heritage of mankind.58.	With regard to general aspects of the law of the sea  the Government of Suriname deplores the fact that no compromise solution has been reached on the delimitation of maritime boundaries between opposite and adjacent States. It is regrettable that the exchange of views during the ninth session between the two interested groups has not produced any text satisfactory to the sponsors of document NG7/10/Rev.2 and like-minded delegations. It seems to us that on this issue the sea does not escape national egoism. We express the hope that a negotiated solution will be reached at the session to be held in March next year.59.	The Conference on the Law of the Sea is now at a crossroads. The Government of Suriname is convinced that only a comprehensive and carefully balanced treaty on the law of the sea can avoid a scramble of claims to exploit the wealth of the oceans beyond the limits of national jurisdiction  in accordance with the Declaration of Principles Governing the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor  and the Subsoil Thereof  beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction contained in General Assembly resolution 2749 (XXV).60.	The first international development strategy  adopted in 1960  is already fading away in the mist of unfulfilled expectations. The then prevailing optimism that the gap between rich and poor countries could be narrowed seems  with hindsight  almost incomprehensible and rather frivolous. And yet the first strategy constituted a real breakthrough because of the acceptance by the advanced countries of the fact that the development problem was a matter of mutual concern and interest to both the developed and the developing nations.61.	At that time  however  we did not fully realize that the idealistic ideas laid down in that strategy  in particular those regarding development aid  had to be confirmed by the national legislators of the advanced countries. The expectation that those legislative bodies would prove to be equally enlightened was a serious miscalculation.62.	Having gone through the negotiating process which led to the adoption of a second strategy and after two decades of frustrating North-South discussions about the economic future of the world  we are now painfully aware that it will take gigantic efforts  if not a miracle  to prevent the rich-poor gap from widening even further.63.	The establishment of a new international economic order  aimed at a more just relationship between the poor and the rich nations  remains a distant goal. Frankly  we are rather pessimistic about the willingness on the part of industrialized nations to make the necessary political and economic sacrifices  which are essential to the attainment of that goal. We do indeed wonder if they will lower their trade barriers  amidst the ever-increasing protectionist voices. We are not optimistic that the necessary reforms in the international monetary system will be effected. Neither are we inclined to believe that advanced countries will raise their development aid to adequate levels  and our pessimism does not appear to be unduly great against the background of recession and inflation  coupled with almost automatically rising oil prices  which seem to shatter all hopes for a brighter economic future.64.	Only a few weeks ago  notwithstanding long and often acrimonious discussions between the advanced and the less- advanced countries  during which  as so often in the past  we seemed to talk past and not to each other  we could not even formally adopt the third international strategy for the 1980s.65.	We still hope to improve the North-South relation-ship  since the rift between the ""haves"" and ""have-nots"" in our world is potentially as dangerous and lethal as the Middle East crisis and the arms race. Notwithstanding our somewhat restrained optimism  we vigorously support the continuation of the North-South dialogue  since the maintenance of open communications is what the United Nations is all about.66.	During the eleventh special session of the General Assembly we wasted much time in trying to work out the ground rules for the global negotiations on essential matters relating to official development assistance  monetary affairs and the energy problem. During those discussions  many of us low-income and middle-income countries  haunted by the spectres of recession  inflation and expensive oil  felt completely dismayed and frustrated that those negotiations were prevented from getting off the ground as a result of a deadlock. We are of the opinion that those negotiations  assuming that they are decided upon  should concentrate on root problems such as development aid  energy and monetary reforms  which must be dealt with in an open and objective manner directly related to those problems.67.	The disheartening failure of the Third General Conference of UNIDO  held at New Delhi from 21 January to 9 February 1980  and the fiasco of the fifth session of UNCTAD  held at Manila from 7 May to 3 June 1979  should serve as danger signals for all of us. In this connection  the unfair way in which international development aid is structured should be highlighted. Promises made by donor countries are well publicized and get broad media attention. But actual development aid is slow in coming and difficult to obtain because of red tape  and has many constraints. Furthermore  much of the development aid returns in one form or another to the donor country and only marginally benefits the recipient country. It is obvious that the intention of closing the gap between rich donor and poor recipient countries cannot be fulfilled in this manner.68.	It is not generally recognized that rapid inflation adversely affects the real value of development aid offered by the donor country. Therefore  we would strongly support building inflation hedges into aid programmes. Otherwise those programmes could eventually prove to be birds in the bush and not in the hand.69.	Understandably  we in Suriname are strong protagonists of the indexation of multilateral and bilateral aid in order to prevent offers of such aid from becoming mere token grantsâin other words  grants that do not really contribute to development. This may be considered one of the reasons which may urge people to leave their homelands in search of greener pastures.70.	In rightly criticizing the advanced States for their lack of generosity and their often myopic chauvinism or ideologies  we developing nations are inclined to forget that the stagnation in our development sometimes arises from our own shortcomings  particularly in the field of management. Those developing countries which are almost on the threshold of becoming industrialized nations often excel in one particular aspectâfor example  in the management of their own affairs. My Government  for one  is willing to acknowledge this fact  since  notwithstanding our ample natural resources; our development has been seriously hampered in recent years as a result of inadequate management. We therefore believe that  apart from and perhaps owing to the absence of the necessary global  regional  sub regional and intraregional measures  we should in the next decade rely more on careful but firm management of our own capacities and of our resources.71.	In short  in striving for a better world economy and in supporting those who aspire to a more just New International Economic Order  we must first set sail from the principle of self-reliance in the sea of continuing troubles in our world. On the other hand  having adopted so many undoubtedly highly important global strategies and programmes of action in the past decade  we think that the time has now come to gear ourselves to parallel actions more limited in scope but none the less of essential importance.72.	More concretely  the Government of Suriname  while loyally and actively continuing its participation in the realization of comprehensive universal programmes  wishes to suggest that from now on we should concentrate to a greater degree on. the possibility of regional  sub regional and intraregional efforts.73.	After having attained our independence five years ago and having been an isolated colony for more than three centuries  we are still trying to establish our own identity. We in Suriname have now made a fresh start towards a better future for our countrymen. In so doing  we realize that the nations of the world cannot live without international peace and security  a principle upon which the United Nations rests. For these reasons  I chose to make my first address to the international community in the forum of our world Organization."
"127",6526,"SWE",35,1980,"ï»¿It gives me great pleasure to express the satisfaction of my delegation at the election of Ambassador Riidiger von Wechmar as President of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. His professional skill and wide experience in the United Nations sphere are well known to all of us and they justify our confidence that this Assembly will be wisely guided. I wish him and the other members of the Bureau luck in their very important task.221.	May I also add the voice of the Swedish delegation to the voices of all those who have expressed thanks to the former President  Ambassador Salim of the United Republic of Tanzania  for the excellent way in which he conducted the work of the thirty-fourth session. Furthermore  I wish to welcome the new Member of our Organization  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  who by its accession to membership has strengthened the representation in the United Nations of the Caribbean region.222 The 1980s have begun in an atmosphere of crisis.223. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan has tipped the scale from detente to distrust in the relations between the two superpowers. The arms race is gaining new and unprecedented momentum. The threat of new countries acquiring nuclear weapons has become more acute. The world economy is facing serious difficulties aggravated by the energy crisis.224.	Not only is the world thus moving deeper into crisis  but our collective will to deal with the situation seems to be faltering.225.	International disarmament negotiations have come to a virtual standstill. The United States Senate has failed to ratify the SALT II agreement. The Second Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ended at Geneva without agreement.226.	The eleventh special session assembled to deal with development and international economic cooperation was unable even to agree on the formula for starting the so-called global round.227.	Why all those failures?228.	There is no simple answer to this question. Nor are there any easy solutions to the complex problems the world is facing. There is no shortcut to peace  no simple remedy for the world's economic crisis. But one thing is clear. The issues we are facing ultimately concern our survival.229.	A failure of international economic cooperation is a question of life and death for millions of people in the third world. If we fail to curb the arms race and prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons  there is a danger that nobody will survive. Only if those simple truths arc brought home can we hope for the spirit of compromise between ideologies and interests necessary to make headway in the difficult negotiations before us.230.	Let us begin by looking at disarmament efforts.231.	The armaments situation has many contradictory features. Thus  for instance  all countries agree that more armaments create a situation in which the security of all nations is diminishing. Yet almost all countries arc trying to improve their security merely by increasing armaments.232.	All countries also agree in principle that the best way to improve security is to curb the arms race through negotiations. Yet those who play the decisive role in the disarmament negotiations always seem very careful to see to it that what comes out of those negotiations will not affect their own military capabilities. That reluctance is year by year bringing the world closer to the brink of disaster. That is particularly clear when one looks at the situation in Europe.233.	Both East and West agree that war in Europe may lead to a nuclear holocaust. Political leaders in both East and West also agree that the limitation of armaments in Europe is the way to reduce the danger of the ultimate catastrophe.234.	We are at present discussing the holding of a conference dealing with disarmament in Europe  a continent where the enormous military forces of East and West stand face to face and from which two world wars have already emanated.235.	Western countries have primarily stressed the importance of obtaining far-reaching confidence-building measures. As for arms limitations  they have tended to refer to ongoing negotiations in existing forums. The Soviet Union and other States parties to the Warsaw Treaty wish to discuss limitations on nuclear and conventional weapons and disarmament in more general and political terms. The importance of those differences of opinion on what purpose the conference is to serve should not be underestimated. Nevertheless we do have to find a compromise.236.	The Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe which will be held at Madrid could be the forum used for laying the groundwork for such a compromise. In the view of my Government  a possible basis for a compromise would be to allow for different timescales for different disarmament measures.237.	We should like to have the Madrid meeting decide on certain confidence-building measures and formulate a concrete and precise mandate for a European disarmament conference.238.	The first phase of such a conference should aim at agreement on further and considerably more substantial confidence-building measures. A mandate adopted at Madrid should also deal with limitations of conventional and nuclear arms  to be discussed as soon as sufficient progress has been made in the negotiations in other forums concerning troop reductions and limitations of strategic and theatre nuclear weapons. Thus  even if actual negotiations take place in other bodies  a European disarmament conference would play a significant role by monitoring the state of negotiations on conventional and nuclear arms.239.	The purpose of the conference should be to establish a system where all the nations concerned can state their views on how European disarmament should be achieved and put pressure on those which bear the main responsibility for the arms race. If that formula is adopted  a European disarmament conference would naturally unfold inconsecutive phases  each dealing with the measures which seem realistic at the time. That would give room for stocktaking and for formulating new objectives appropriate for later stages.240.	Let us go forward step by step but never lose sight of the final goal: a Europe where the nuclear threat has receded and stability and confidence reign.241.	The nuclear arms race is of concern not only to the superpowers and the European countries.242.	In the strategic thinking of the nuclear weapon States  it is frequently suggested that nuclear wars can be fought and that nuclear wars can be won. But a recently concluded United Nations study initiated by Sweden two years ago shows that even the effects of a so-called limited nuclear war would be disastrous. In addition it seems highly unlikely that either side in a nuclear conflict will be able to exercise the restraint assumed by strategic planners in peacetime.243.	While the nuclear weapon States continue to build up and improve their nuclear arsenals there is a risk that they will encourage those in other countries who believe that the acquisition of nuclear weapons can increase national security and enhance national prestige. During the past few years there have been alarming reports that new countries  some of them in regions of tension  might have acquired or were seeking to acquire nuclear explosives. That heightens our concern about the threat of the proliferation of nuclear capability.244.	It is highly regrettable that the Second Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons could not agree on a final document. The outcome of that Conference cannot  however  detract from the vital importance of the Non-proliferation Treaty. We must continue the struggle to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. We must strengthen and broaden the scope of safeguards formulated by IAEA. We must search for common approaches to nuclear cooperation and achieve more reliable assurances as regards both supply and non-proliferation.245.	In the field of economic cooperation  those who hold power seem to be captives of their own conventional thinking and unaware of the fact that the international economy of the 1980s is very different from any we have experienced in the past.246.	If the armament situation is dangerousâand indeed it isâso is the world economic situation.247.	We know that the South badly needs to import the goods necessary to develop its resources and infrastructures. We also know that the North suffers from unemployment and idle industrial capacity. Furthermore  we know that large sums are available in the international capital markets which are not being put to productive use.248.	Properly coordinated  those three negative components can be transformed into positive action. What is needed for that is cooperation between rich and poor  between the developed and developing regions of the world  between oil producing and oil importing countries  between the industrialized countries of the old establishment and newly industrialized nations. That cooperation should aim at achieving a more equitable distribution of the world's resources  thus creating jobs and wellbeing for us all.249.	The recent report of the Brandt Commission eloquently elaborates that reasoning. Its most remarkable feature is that it is submitted jointly by a group of members with widely different backgrounds and political persuasions. It is now for the Governments to discuss to what extent the consensus in the Brandt Commission can be transferred to the intergovernmental level and transformed into agreement.250.	A summit meeting early next year might well be needed to acknowledge that North South relations must receive attention at the highest political levels.251.	Interdependence was also a theme underlying the eleventh special session that ended just a week ago. It is highly regrettable that the session ended without agreement in that respect. Although one should not underestimate the complexity of the problem and the difficulties in finding quick solutions  it is obvious that the failure of the session was due not to technical obstacles but rather to lack of political will.252.	The present international economic order is changing only slowly  and the change meets with resistance from those who see their interests threatened. While this may be understandable in a short-term perspective  our common interests in a longer perspective should dictate a more forthcoming position even if this appears to imply giving up positions of power.253.	Since the special session failed  it is all the more important that this session come to agreement on a global round of negotiations. The Swedish Government believes that such a new effort is essential to bring about concerted solutions to problems which are of concern to everybody.254.	Sweden will make every effort to contribute to an agreement on the procedures and the agenda in the course of this session. The results achieved so far should serve as our basis.255.	The consensus on the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade was an important step forward during the eleventh special session. Its very existence is an important basis for further efforts to be made by the international community to combat poverty and starvation in the coming decade. We have the tools at our disposal for this  but we do not have much time. To put it as the President of the General Assembly did in his speech of acceptance a week ago:""The need to create a new  more just and balanced international economic order ... is much too urgent to permit any substantial further delay. For millions  it could literally mean the difference between life and death."" 256.	The arms race and the world economic crisis are global phenomena which have implications for the security of all nations. The tensions and problems in the Middle East  Southeast Asia and southern Africa may have local roots and causes  but if they remain unresolved they may have worldwide repercussions as well.257.	Viet Nam  once the symbol of the peopleâs fight for independence  has now itself embarked on the road of armed intervention. Sweden has condemned the Pol Pot regime's unparalleled cruelty to its own citizens  but Pol Poi's reign of terror can never justify the continued occupation of Kampuchea by Viet Nam. The Vietnamese troops must be withdrawn and the Kampuchean people be allowed to determine their own political future without foreign interference. Only then can Kampuchea begin the gigantic task of reconstruction after years of war  terror  invasion and famine.258.	Unanimous reports tell of a constant and increasing military build-up along the border between Thailand and Kampuchea. This build up has already led to armed clashes between Thailand and Viet Nam in June this year  when Vietnamese troops reportedly crossed the border.259.	My Government urgently appeals to all the parties concerned to prevent the situation from escalating into an open conflict causing more suffering for the already hard hit population and increasing once again the risk of a great Power clash in that region. The refugees must be protected  the territorial integrity of Thailand respected and tension along the border reduced.260.	In southern Africa  the struggle for freedom and justice has led to an important victory. Zimbabwe is a forceful reminder to all that southern Africa is moving irresistibly towards majority rule. Judging from past experience  we could not expect the South African regime to draw the right conclusions from this development. Through the years it has resisted pressure from a united world opinion and remained impervious to both humanitarian considerations and the arguments of reason. However  we do expect other  more enlightened  States to play their part in efforts to abolish apartheid.261.	The instruments of peaceful action at our disposal are economic sanctions as envisaged by the United Nations Charter. It is  therefore  the duty of the permanent members of the Security Council to consider what means may still contribute to a peaceful dissolution of apartheid in South Africa. We appeal to them not to shirk this responsibility.262.	It has been argued that negotiations on Namibia would be hampered by Security Council action against South Africa. My Government believes the contrary to be true.263.	Measures against South Africa must be taken  and taken now  if negotiations are to yield results. Using delaying tactics and pretending to be cooperative  the South African regime continues to exploit these negotiations for two purposes: first  to gain time to build up an administration of its own choice in Namibia; secondly  to avoid the pressure of international sanctions. The negotiations themselves must not be allowed to serve as a means of postponing the freedom of Namibia.264.	Over the years South Africa has  by its illegal occupation of Namibia  by its armed attacks on neighbouring States and by its apartheid policy  accumulated an appalling catalogue of oppression and blatant violations of international law and human rights. It is high time the Security Council took action to implement its own plan for a peaceful transition to majority rule and to a free and independent Namibia.265.	By their well-coordinated and responsible policy  the frontline States are playing an increasingly strong and constructive role in developments in southern Africa  thus exerting an inspiring influence on the majority of the people of South Africa. The Swedish Government will continue to provide development assistance to the frontline States and humanitarian assistance to liberation movements in southern Africa. It will also favourably consider contributing to the regional economic cooperation.266.	For all too long  the peoples of the Middle East have been deprived of the right to live in peace and dignity  free from fear and want. Recent disturbing events and acts of violence have once again demonstrated the implacability of the parties in this tragic conflict.267.	The peace agreements reached between Egypt and Israel were  in our view  an important step towards breaking the vicious circle of violence and hatred in the Middle East. Today we have less reason for optimism. Tension is again rising. Israel is adding to it by its settlement policy on the West Bank  its raids into Lebanese territory and its attempts to change the character and status of Jerusalem through unilateral action. All friends of Israelâand Sweden is among themâmust note with sorrow that Israel is currently pursuing a policy which not only contravenes international law but also runs entirely counter to principles which should be fundamental to a democracy like Israel.268.	It is no less tragic that the Palestinians  in the pursuit of their legitimate national rights  should resort to violence. As has been so woefully demonstrated  violence inevitably breeds counter violence.269.	A political settlement can be achieved not by force but through concessions and compromise by Israelis and Palestinians alike.270.	The Palestinians must recognize Israel's right to exist within secure and recognized borders. Israel must recognize the legitimate national rights of the Palestinians  including the right to establish  should they so wish  a State of their own  living in peace  side by side with Israel.271.	Israel must also realize that it is meaningless to try to reach an agreement on the Palestinian question without negotiating with those who represent the Palestinians. A comprehensive and lasting peace is possible only if all parties concerned participate in itâand that is to say that Israel must negotiate with the PLO.272.	A solution must  furthermore  determine the status of Jerusalem and guarantee freedom of access for one and all to the Holy Places.273.	I want to take this opportunity also to express my Government's deep concern over recent reports of armed hostilities between Iraq and Iran. My Government urges the parties to refrain from further military action and to settle their differences peacefully.274.	Today it is more important than ever to remind the superpowers of their duty to adhere to the United Nations principles on non-intervention and the right to self-determination.275.	The resolution on Afghanistan adopted by this Assembly in January was important in this respect. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan was a flagrant violation of the United Nations Charter and must be condemned as such.276.	Eight months have now elapsed since the Assembly adopted its resolution calling for the immediate  unconditional and total withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan. But Soviet troops are still stationed in Afghanistan; they are engaged in a cruel combat to force the Afghan people into submission. But the Afghans will not let themselves be subjugated  and the Soviet Union will learn the lesson that all imperialist Powers should have learned from history. Mankind's yearning for liberty cannot be extinguished by occupation  repression  terror or torture. Individuals and nations will not give up their fight for freedom and self-determination.277.	The Soviet Union has said that the Soviet troops will be withdrawn as soon as it has guarantees against aggression from the outside. But the only aggression from the outside in this case came from the Soviet Union itself.278.	Only an independent Government which has the support of the Afghan people has any reasonable hope of achieving internal peace and stable relations with all its neighbours  including the Soviet Union. We must therefore once again urge the Soviet Union to withdraw its troops immediately  totally and unconditionally.279.	At the beginning of the 1980s  the most dangerous trend for world peace is the transition in relations between the two nuclear superpowers from detente to distrust. The security of all nations hinges on how the two superpowers handle their relations and what forms their rivalry will take.280.	By reason of their nuclear arsenals  the superpowers are holding the fate of the entire world in their hands. All States therefore have the right to demand that they improve their existing lines of communication. Even if we cannot now have detente  we must urge the superpowers to continue their dialogue. Their channels of communication must always remain open and function effectively in order to avoid misunderstandings  overreactions and dangerous miscalculations.281.	Hence we note with satisfaction that the Foreign Ministers of the United States and the Soviet Union are going to meet here this week. Let us hope that this meeting will be the beginning of a more stable pattern of contacts between the two superpowers and lead to constructive results in the interest of world peace."
"128",6567,"SWZ",35,1980,"ï»¿Allow me  at the outset  to convey to you  Sir  my delegation's warmest congratulations on your well-deserved election to the presidency of this historic thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. We are indeed delighted by your election to the helm of this Assembly  for we feel deeply convinced that with your wide experience and prudent leadership this Assembly will be eminently equipped for tackling effectively the many pressing problems facing mankind in the present decade. We have complete confidence that a man of your calibre  who has already distinguished himself as a statesman of outstanding qualities and a stalwart supporter of his country's commitment to the noble principles of human equality and justice  is indeed suitably qualified to steer the crucial deliberations of this Assembly on the right course to ultimate success.3.	I also wish to express my delegation's heartfelt gratitude to your predecessor  Ambassador Salim Ahmed Salim  for his inspiring leadership and clear insight into the various matters of grave concern to humanity. We were indeed deeply inspired by his frank and practical approach to international problems. Equally  we were touched by his unflagging zeal and complete devotion to duty and by his ingenuity and ability in fostering a brotherly spirit of compromise and accommodation in the quest for solutions to international issues.4.	My delegation warmly welcomes the accession of the Republic of Zimbabwe to the United Nations. Coming as we do from the same region as our Zimbabwean brothers  we are fully aware of the heavy price the people of Zimbabwe had to pay for their freedom. It is because of this awareness that we feel overjoyed to see them take their rightful place in our midst as the one hundred and fifty-third Member of the United Nations.5.	My delegation believes that the triumphant struggle of the heroic people of Zimbabwe is also a victory for all peoples throughout the world that love peace and justice and struggle relentlessly for the creation of a more just and equitable world society  devoid of the callous and shameful machinations for the exploitation of man by man.6.	We further wish to congratulate very warmly the Government and people of the Republic of Zimbabwe on their courageous and enlightened policy of creating in Zimbabwe a land of fraternity and friendship where the spirit of reconstruction and reconciliation prevails  a land of a new social order where erstwhile opponents have turned their swords into ploughshares and are jointly working for the prosperity and well-being of the new Zimbabwe.7.	My delegation believes that the people of Zimbabwe deserve the most unflinching support of the world community in their noble efforts at creating a truly multiracial State in the heart of southern Africa  a region that is notorious for its many appalling examples of racial injustice.8.	We equally welcome and congratulate the new brotherly State of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines on its admission to the family of the community of nations.9.	Thirty-five years have come and gone since those 51 founding nations  prompted by the appalling devastation of the Second World War  signed the Charter which formally gave birth to the United Nations in 1945. Since that date this Organization has played a role of paramount importance in many international spheres of human relations  particularly in the process of dismantling the erstwhile colonial empires and in spearheading the campaign for self-determination for all nations  whether big or small  on the basis of human equality and justice.10.	The past 35 years have indeed witnessed great changes in the world's political map. We have seen the emergence of many third world countries  from a position of relative obscurity and foreign domination  to their present status of full national sovereignty  in which they play an increasing role in shaping the future destiny of this planet.11.	Although rejoicing over the achievements of the past 35 years  we are still painfully aware of the persistent presence on this planet of several obstinate pockets of resistance to the process of decolonization. There are also areas on this globe where the principles of human equality and justice are still being consistently flouted and where some political leaders are still devoting a considerable amount of their time to devising an array of flimsily disguised schemes designed to give a cloak of respectability to the abominable practice of exploitation of man by man. We are convinced that no amount of glossy political machinations by those intent on side-stepping the real issues can take the place of meeting the basic need to adopt authentic and bold measures to give genuine satisfaction to the aspirations of the underprivileged masses to economic  social and political justice.12.	Swaziland is unswervingly committed to the principles of non-racial democracy  non-alignment and complete respect for human dignity  justice and peaceful coexistence for all. It is in this context that we feel deeply concerned about the deplorable persistence of certain inhuman practices of racial injustice in our own sub region which are based purely upon grounds of colour. It is with this feeling of deepening anxiety that we fully share the Secretary- General's concern expressed in these words in his report on the work of the Organization:. . the world community's concern will continue and grow as long as the manifest injustices of apartheid persist."" 13.	We regard it as a great pity that the people of Namibia is still being denied its birth-right of self-determination  independence and full national sovereignty by frivolous wrangles that derive mainly from considerations of sheer political expediency. We regard the present stalemate as showing gross inhumanity and outright callousness to the Namibian people. We therefore appeal most earnestly to the parties concerned to put the interest and welfare of the Namibian people above any other consideration and to facilitate the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). We wish to commend the untiring and noble efforts made by the Secretary-General  Mr. Waldheim  to find an acceptable and peaceful formula by which the people of Namibia can be assisted to move as expeditiously as possible to independence  on the basis of free and fair elections held under the auspices of the United Nations. It is in this context that we welcome the present proposal to hold another round of talks on the Namibian question between the United Nations and the South African Government towards the end of this month. We ardently hope and pray that the forthcoming talks will lead to an early resolution of this problem.14.	We equally applaud the endeavours of the five Western Governments  as well as the efforts of the Organization of African Unity [OAU]  through the front-line African States bordering on Namibia  as a great contribution towards solving the Namibian problem by peaceful means.15.	It is unfortunate that  in spite of the solemn pledge made by the founding nations of this Organization that there would be no more wars  sporadic outbreaks of regional wars and localized conflicts have continued to defy the noble efforts of this world body and are still taking a heavy toll in human lives in many parts of the world.16.	My delegation has learnt with considerable sadness of the recent outbreak of fresh violence in the Gulf region  and we wish to add our voice to those of other peace-loving nations in calling upon the belligerent parties to exercise restraint by halting all acts of hostility in that region and to accept overtures towards a peaceful settlement of this dangerous problem. We strongly urge all the parties concerned in this conflict to adopt a spirit of goodwill and statesmanship and to embark on a process of serious negotiations aimed at resolving their current differences by peaceful means.17.	The people of Swaziland have for many years shared the concern of many other peace-loving nations of the world about the elusive problem of securing durable peace in the Middle East. It was in this spirit of apprehension and anxiety that we greeted with considerable joy and relief the advent of the Camp David accord in 1978.18.	We fully appreciated the limited scope of that agreement and we had no illusions about the immensity and complex nature of the Middle East situation. We were hopeful that the spirit of compromise and reconciliation would pervade the entire region and create a congenial atmosphere under which a process of much more comprehensive negotiations  involving all parties to the problem  could be initiated. Understandably  we therefore feel disheartened by the latest turn of events in the Middle East and are indeed apprehensive that the lack of progress in the current bilateral negotiations between Egypt and Israel may lead to a further deterioration of security in the entire region. Nevertheless  we should still have faith that  with sufficient goodwill  the peoples of the Middle East can still find some common ground upon which valuable negotiations could be based that would probably help to bridge the gap between their divergent interests  deriving from the need for self- determination for the Palestinian people  and the right of the State of Israel to exist.19.	In keeping with its strong commitment to the principle of self-determination  Swaziland fully supports the right of the people of Western Sahara to independence and full national sovereignty. We believe that the forceful annexation of their land against their will constitutes a flagrant violation of the noble principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. We also believe that the current attempt to use military prowess to bludgeon the Saharan people into accepting foreign subjugation is setting a highly dangerous precedent whereby small nations may be subjected to forceful annexation.20.	My delegation views any act of violation of the sanctity of diplomatic missions with great concern. We believe that the existence of secure and well protected diplomatic institutions is of vital importance to the proper and effective maintenance of international peace and security. We therefore urge the strictest adherence by all Governments to the norms of international law regulating the behaviour and setting out the responsibilities of Governments to afford adequate protection to foreign diplomatic missions and their personnel so as to enable them to carry out their diplomatic functions in complete safety.21.	We deeply abhor any act of violent seizure of diplomatic personnel under any circumstances whatsoever  for we believe that adequate provisions exist under the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations for dealing with diplomats guilty of abusing their diplomatic privileges.22.	The worsening crisis through which international relations and the world economy are currently passing presents considerable dangers for the world community. My delegation believes that the yawning economic gap separating rich and poor countries has not been sufficiently recognized as the major factor in the present crisis. Indeed  we regard it to be one of the greatest anachronisms of our age that these widening economic disparities should still persist at this time in history when human society is becoming increasingly aware of the extent to which it is interrelated and of how deeply the rich and the poor countries depend upon one another for the continued well-being of their respective economies. We cannot help expressing our deepening concern about the disappointing lack of meaningful progress towards the realization of the urgent goal of establishing a New International Economic Order that is more responsive to the needs of both developing and industrialized countries.23.	We had hoped that the human instinct for survival and the common concern for the well-being of present and future generations of mankind would produce an adequately strong stimulus to prompt world leaders to overcome their differences and resolve the contradictions between their self-interest and their joint interest. However  in spite of the commendable efforts made by the United Nations and the many conferences held between developed and developing countries on the question of bringing about important reforms in the current world economic system  very little headway has so far been made. Indeed  developing nations have been left with very little hope of ever escaping from the ravages of poverty and the spectre of widespread starvation and human misery that is already haunting many parts of the developing world.24.	Our hopes were further shattered by the failure of the international community last month  at the special session of the General Assembly on economic problems  to agree even on such preliminary matters as the agenda and the procedures to be adopted in future global economic negotiations. Of course  my delegation harbours no illusions about the many hurdles that will have to be overcome before the ultimate objective of restructuring the present international economic system can be successfully accomplished. The road to a new world economic order is fraught with numerous complex and daunting problems. The industrialized countries themselves are in the throes of a serious economic recession arising primarily from ever-escalating oil prices. Those countries are also gripped by rampant inflation and dwindling market demands which have given rise to burgeoning problems of unemployment.25.	Under these circumstances  it is to be expected that the industrialized nations should be concerned about their own economic welfare and tempted by the apparently attractive but transient advantages of restricting imports from developing countries in a bid to protect their own recession- stricken domestic industries against foreign competition. It should be remembered  none the less  that current world economic problems have a far more severe impact on the young and frail economies of the third world nations. The unemployment situation in the developing countries is much more widespread and indeed fast approaching crisis proportions  with dire consequences to the social and political stability of those young countries. Not only is unemployment rising as a result of stunted economic growth in most countries of the third world  but also because the numbers for whom jobs must be provided are multiplying at a rate that far outstrips the sluggish pace of economic growth in those countries.26.	Most third world countries  like mine  are heavily dependent upon primary commodities for their export earnings. In most cases  developing countries export a very limited range of primary commodities  with the result that price fluctuations in world commodity markets have a severely disruptive effect on their fledgling economies.27.	My delegation believes that it is vital for the economic : survival of developing nations that they be given every possible assistance to help them acquire the necessary capacity to process more and more of their raw materials so as to generate much needed employment opportunities in the developing countries and enhance the value of their exports  thus helping to broaden the base of their economies and reduce their high vulnerability to the vagaries to the international markets.28.	I am quite convinced that an internationally agreed programme of progressive transfer of processing industries to the developing countries would be beneficial to the industrialized countries as well  for it would have the advantage of locating the relevant processing industries nearer the source of raw materials and thus bringing about a substantial reduction in the currently high freight costs incurred in exporting bulky raw materials with a relatively low unit value. However  a programme of this nature can only make economic sense if it is based on a universally accepted programme of dismantling the existing plethora of tariffs and other protectionist measures that effectively deny semi- processed goods from the developing nations access to the markets of the industrialized countries.29.	Even if such a transfer programme could be accepted and supported by all nations of the world  developing countries would still take some time to acquire the necessary capacity to process a large part of their raw materials. It is in recognition of this fact  therefore  that my delegation considers it extremely important  and indeed urgent  that positive steps be taken to devise an equitable pricing mechanism that will ensure stability in commodity prices as well as bringing remunerative returns to the commodity producers.30.	I must acknowledge  however  that a small but encouraging step in the right direction has already been made under the auspices of UNCTAD and that a few commodities such as sugar  tin  coffee  and so on  are already covered by international agreements. However  this is still a far cry from the vital need for the early conclusion of comprehensive international agreements that will ensure more stable and remunerative prices and some degree of certainty to the commodity producers. This  we believe  would greatly help developing countries to maintain their foreign exchange earnings and to facilitate their fiscal planning and economic management.31.	In addition  the widening gap between the price of commodity exports from developing countries and the cost of imported manufactured goods has been the main factor in the worsening balance of trade deficits that are being experienced today by a growing number of third world countries. The dictates of justice and common sense demand that international trade relations between North and South be placed on a fairer and more equitable footing.32.	My delegation believes that the international community as a whole  regardless of domestic political and economic systems  should fully contribute to the global efforts of restructuring the existing world economic order. The ravages of widespread starvation and malnutrition affecting certain regions of the developing world are too severe and fast becoming too desperate for mankind to indulge itself in the niceties of blaming our past history for the existence of our present problems. What is needed now is not an analysis of the past misdeeds of colonialism and other forms of exploitation but a forward-looking programme of concerted action to avert the real danger of a large-scale famine engulfing growing numbers of the peoples of the third world countries.33.	The 1944 Bretton Woods international monetary system was designed to serve the needs and the political conditions that were prevailing in the world at that time. Since then  the world political map has changed considerably and new economic problems have now come to the fore. My delegation strongly believes  therefore  that there is now a real and urgent need for the present international monetary system to be restructured in such a way that it takes adequate cognizance of the special circumstances of the developing countries. Greater stability in international exchange rates is essential if the economies of third world countries  which are heavily dependent upon foreign exchange earnings from primary commodity exports  are to be protected from the harmful effects of wild fluctuations.34.	The plight of many non-oil-producing developing countries like mine is indeed fast becoming desperate as more and more important development projects have to be drastically scaled down or abandoned altogether because of the crushing pressure of the mounting energy bills. It is imperative to our economic survival that we  the developing countries  have access to adequate amounts of concessional development finance to help us sustain present levels of economic growth and cope with the balance-of-payments deficits as well as with the heavy burden of servicing presently high interest loans.35.	It has become abundantly clear that the present energy crisis is here to stay and that  if anything  it will worsen rather than improve in the foreseeable future. I need hardly say here that any changes in petroleum prices affect the whole fabric of the economies of the oil-importing countries. Consequently  any instability in oil supplies sends waves of destabilization throughout the world economy and is the main cause of the conditions of general economic malaise that have gripped the world today. My delegation feels  therefore  that there is a need not only to conserve energy but also to increase efforts in the exploration and development of new and renewable sources of energy. We look forward with interest to the forthcoming United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy.36.	Turning now to the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  we are happy to note that this complex legal Conference  which seeks to regularize mankind's activities over two thirds of this planet  may at long last truly be said to be in its final stages.37.	If one were compelled to identify one of the most important features for Swaziland of the future Convention  it would be the articles relating to the right of access to and from the sea and freedom of transit for land-locked States. We are of the opinion that the present text relating to equal treatment in maritime ports should be amplified by providing that ships flying the flag of land-locked States shall enjoy either national or most-favoured-nation treatment  whichever is more favourable to them  in maritime ports used for purposes of access to and from the sea.38.	Additionally  the present text on the continental shelf remains unsatisfactory and serves to truncate severely the concept of the common heritage of mankind  already limited in scope by the exclusive economic zone of200 miles. We continue to believe that the balance can only be redressedâalbeit partiallyâif at the next session positive steps are taken by all participants to enshrine  at least by way of a declaration  the basic elements underlying the common heritage fund proposal.39.	We remain confident that the international community will continue to display the necessary political will and good faith at the forthcoming session to conclude a convention which will be universally respected and durable.40.	May I conclude by expressing the hope that the Assembly will find it possible to address itself positively and constructively to the many urgent problems facing mankind in this decade. Let us build bridges to span the gulfs created by diverse and conflicting interests so that freedom  unity  human equality  prosperity and justice may one day prevail throughout the world."
"129",6604,"SYC",35,1980,"ï»¿First of all  I should like to extend my congratulations and those of my delegation to Mr. von Wechmar on his election to the presidency of this thirty-fifth session. I am sure that this Assembly will benefit from his experience and competence in the conduct of its proceedings and thus be able to continue to pursue its objectives of peace and development. I am happy to be able to assure him of my delegation's wholehearted cooperation in the performance of his delicate tasks.175.	May I also express my Government's deepest gratitude to Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim and convey to him our warmest congratulations on the way he presided over the thirty-fourth session of the Assembly. Fully versed in the workings of the United Nations  devoted to its objectives  receptive to the problems of the world and having particular insight into those of the third world  he lived up to our expectations  for which we thank him most warmly.176.	I should like to take this opportunity also to assure the Secretary General  Mr. Waldheim  once again  of my Government's appreciation of his work. He has ably faced and dealt with many complex problems this year within the limits of the resources available to him.177.	It is with great emotion that I welcome the delegation of Zimbabwe to this Assembly. The people of Zimbabwe has left its mark on history  not only the history of its own country and of the African continent but also that of the whole of mankind. That valiant and self-sacrificing people has shaken the very foundations of a system which extended well beyond the frontiers of what was formerly Southern Rhodesia and which believed itself to be powerful and invincible. Today not only the colonial and racist minority of South Africa  but all the agents of imperialism contemplate the future with somewhat less arrogance and assurance. What is more  they have been given a last chance to reconsider their position in the interest of all parties concerned.178.	My delegation also would like to welcome the representatives of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  a State which recently became independent and was admitted to membership of this Organization at the beginning of this session.179.	For a country like Seychelles  which does not have very powerful information media and does not always enjoy the friendship of those who do  it is not always easy to make its own voice heard. It is true that certain publications in the Western world mention us  but often only in the context of the ambitions and interests of some of those countries. We can thus understand why their articles project a negative image of our society and often express only unfavourable criticisms and recriminations: because their aims and ours are rarely compatible.180.	We therefore value very highly the opportunity to speak at this international forum.181.	Situated in the heart of the Indian Ocean  Seychelles is at the very centre of one of the most sensitive regions of the world. Oil tankers en route from the Middle East and the Far East ply the waters of that Ocean  the resources of which are much coveted.182.	The people of Seychelles has struggled and continues to struggle to safeguard its independence  because it wants to be the sole master of its decisions and orientations  its form of development  its social relations and its philosophy in general; at the same time  it believes in ties of profound and active solidarity with other peoples fighting for the same causes.183.	These three factorsâthat is  our geopolitical position  our choice of social structure and our solidarity with other fraternal peoplesâessentially determine our position in international matters. It is a firm and honest position  dictated by the principles of justice and embodied in non-alignment  as was reaffirmed by our President  Comrade France Albert Ren6  during the Sixth Conference of Heads of State .or Government of Nonaligned Countries  held at Havana in 1979. It is a nonalignment which refuses to take refuge in neutrality and rejects indifference or abdication in the face of international problems. But  above all  it is that freedom to take any position .ye want whenever we wish  faithful to the history of the nonaligned movement  which has always been indissolubly linked with the authentic liberation of peoples and their emancipation from the imperialist yoke.184.	It is imperative that we continue this policy because it involves the very authenticity of our independence  and indeed the possibility of real development. It is within this context that I should like to deal here with some of the problems of concern to the people and the Government of Seychelles.185.	I turn first of all to the question of the Indian Ocean. The great Powers have been engaged in unbridled militarization of that region. The rate of growth of the number of warshipsâsome of which carry nuclear devicesâis intolerable. We are not in a position to assess this build-up in terms of striking power  but from June 1979 to June 1980 the number of warships present in the Indian Ocean more than doubled.186.	Those foreign Powers  when they do not benefit from the complicity of certain Governments in the region in order to install themselves there  simply occupy territory which is subject to the sovereignty of coastal States. Thus  the Chagos Archipelago  including the island of Diego Garcia  which is an integral part of the territory of Mauritius  has been occupied by Great Britain and the United States; the island of Tromelin is administered by France; the island of Mayotte is still juridically separated from the rest of the Comoros. As for the Democratic Republic of Madagascar  it remains stripped of the Glorieuses islands  Juan da Nova  Europa and Bassas da India.187.	The reasons for this militarization of our region are well known to all  even if more often than not they are unspoken. They are both economic and political in nature.188.	A large proportion of the oil being sent to North America  Western Europe and Japan passes through the Indian Ocean. The resources of that Ocean  the raw materials and commercial potential of the coastal countries and the energy resources of the Middle East and the Far East are all greedily coveted.189.	Of course  the great Powers prefer to speak of a protective mission  the defence of a so-called ""free world""  the restoration of a balance of power  the Afghanistan affair  the events in Iran and so forth.190.	However  when we realize how easily the great Powers today are exporting their conflicts to the third world countries and setting up in them proving grounds for their weapons  silence on our part would be censurable. Furthermore  we need peace in order to concentrate all our efforts on the development of our country instead of having to devote some of our efforts to protecting ourselves against constant threats aimed particularly against progressive regimes which are characterized by some as being ""refractory"".191.	Seychelles wishes once again to associate itself with those countries that have already done so  in appealing to the international conscience and calling for the demilitarization of the Indian Ocean. This entails the dismantling of military  air and naval bases and the withdrawal of foreign troops from the region.192.	Of course  the process of demilitarization must be accompanied by the decolonization of the Indian Ocean  that is to say  by the return to the sovereignty of their respective countries of ail islands being used or liable to be used as bases for foreign Powers. So the Chagos archipelago  including the island of Diego Garcia and the island of Tromelin  must be returned to Mauritius; the island of Mayotte to the Comoros  and the Glorieuses  Juan da Nova  Europa and Bassas da India islands to Madagascar  in accordance with the resolutions of the United Nations and OAU. The island of Reunion must be demilitarized and the right of the people of Reunion to self-determination must be respected.193.	Coastal States should provide no foreign Power with any military base  and those who have already done so are urged to reconsider their decisions.194.	For years  the people of Seychelles have been fighting for the demilitarization of the Indian Ocean and have adopted very specific and courageous measures to this end. Our President  Comrade France Albert Rene  recently made representations to the coastal States of the Indian Ocean in an attempt to win their support for the holding of the Colombo Conference convened by the United Nations  followed by that in Antananarivo proposed by President Didier Ratsiraka of Madagascar. In this regard  we wish to denounce the manoeuvres of certain Powers that are working for the failure of these Conferences.195.	If it should prove indispensable to police the oil route  this should preferably be done by the coastal States themselves  if necessary under the control of the United Nations  and not by the great Powers from outside the region  whose interests are necessarily different from our own.196.	Other matters of concern to us are also connected to decolonization  peace and development.197.	We are compelled to note that 20 years after the adoption of resolution 1514 (XV) by the General Assembly on the decolonization of colonial peoples and territories  there are too many peoples who  despite their profound aspirations to liberty  peace and development  know only exploitation  foreign domination and repression.198.	On the African continent  peoples are continuing to shed their blood to wrest themselves from the grasp of colonialism with all its implications.199.	First of all  there is the people of Namibia. It is difficult for us today to understand how the League of Nations at the end of the First World War could have entrusted the administration of the Namibian territory to the South African regime  already well known for its repressive and archaic practices  so that the Namibian people are now confronting in their liberation struggle one of the most barbaric and archaic systems ever known to history.200.	In this Assembly  all the countries represented here would appear to wish for the independence of Namibia. However  without wishing to be cynical or lacking in respect  I cannot refrain from pointing out that  despite the numerous reports  declarations and resolutions adopted and in spite of the United Nations plan for the decolonization of Namibia  the South African regime continues with impunity to defy the international conscience. The fact is that among those very people who call for the independence of that country there are some who remain accomplices of the South African regime militarily and economically. This is a disgrace. The South African regime can continue  unfortunately  to count on powerful allies who are actually sitting here among us.201.	Today  the Namibian people  in order to emancipate itself from the illegal occupation of its territory  has no choice but to confront the South African regime in armed combat  under the leadership of SWAPO  its sole and legitimate representative.202.	The people of the Seychelles will continue to provide unswerving support  politically  diplomatically and even materially  in so far as its resources allow  to SWAPO in its liberation struggle.203.	We also would express the hope that the international community will render assistance to the people and Government of Angola  which  because of their exemplary support for the Namibian revolution  have been the victims of aggression at the hands of the South African regime and consequently have suffered considerable loss of human life and material damage.204.	The victory of the Namibian people is inevitable  as is  indeed  that of the people of South Africa. Both have already shown the Botha regime that they can strike hard. The Republic of Seychelles will continue to support the African National Congress in its struggle and will not hesitate to put into effect the resolutions of the United Nations and of the OAU regarding sanctions against South Africa.205.	With regard to the question of Western Sahara  it is our pleasure to be able to stress that the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic is today recognized by more than 40 countries  including 26 African countries. The Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic thus meets the conditions laid down by the OAU charter for becoming a fully-fledged member of the pan African organization. Last year  from this rostrum"" we condemned once again the expansionist and colonial designs of the Moroccan regime with regard to Western Sahara. We regret to have to do this again. At the same time  however  we wish that the authorities in Rabat would respond tangibly and positively to the appeal for a ceasefire and negotiation issued recently by the Ad Hoc Committee of Heads of State and Government of the OAU on Western Sahara.206.	In the Middle East  Israel continues in its turn  like its ally  the Botha regime in South Africa  to defy international public opinion with impunity by pursuing its expansionist and murderous colonial policy. The recent attempt at annexation of the eastern part of Jerusalem is just one example among so many others. Its ultimate objective is to extend its territory as far as possible and wipe the Palestinian people off the map. Therefore  Israel has no hesitation in violating the principles of the territorial integrity and national sovereignty of neighbouring countries by means of its military incursions and illegal occupation of Arab territories. Israel continues to torture  mutilate  murder or deport Palestinians so that it can establish settlements.207.	The Palestinian question today constitutes a matter of ""international conscience"". Our Organization  furthermore  has taken up this matter on several occasions and has even devoted exclusively to this subject its seventh emergency special session  held in July this year  and we are very happy about that. However  when  within our Organization  the time comes to condemn Israeli aggression  certain great Powers refrain from doing so  and it is those very Powers which pose as champions of human rights  national sovereignty and territorial integrity. We have heard them  in this role  talking about Afghanistan  Iran  and Kampuchea. However  when it is a matter of Israeli aggression they remain silent.208.	This lack of consistency in the practice of international politics  which is  incidentally  only a reflection of the double standard policy  depending on whose interests are at stake  is something which is necessarily going to undermine the authority  the credibility and the effectiveness of many international institutions  including our own. It is in part the reason why some of our resolutions have no effect.209.	This is why my delegation believes that it is time for the international community to condemn unanimously and unequivocally the colonial and Zionist policy of Israel and to decide in favour of the exercise by the Palestinian people of its right to self-determination under the leadership of the PLO  its sole and legitimate representative.210.	Concrete measures must also be taken against Israelâindeed  even the imposition of economic sanctions  in accordance with the spirit of resolutions CM/Res.785 (XXXV)  CM/Res.787 (XXXV) and CM/Res.791 (XXXV) of the OAU on the Palestinian question. The Palestinian people must recover their territorial and national rights as soon as possible.211.	It is in application of these same principles relating to the right of a people to self-determination and the building of its future in peace and security that the Republic of Seychelles supports the people of East Timor in their struggle against the Indonesian occupation and for the independence of their country; that we call for the Afghan people  under the leadership of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan  to be able to manage their own affairs and define their own future without being threatened either in terms of their sovereignty or on their frontiers and with the assistance of allies which they choose; that we hope that Iran  like all other States  will make arrangements to engender respect for international law with regard to the immunity of diplomatic personnel  although  at the same time  there should be an international convention protecting peoples and States against the activities of certain shady foreigners who contrive to obtain diplomatic status to carry out their often clandestine work  particularly in third world countries; that we demand that a halt be called to the repression against the peoples of Chile  Bolivia and El Salvador and that any and all threats of foreign military intervention in El Salvador should be eliminated. Still in application of these same principles  the Republic of the Seychelles has broken off all relations with the bloody Seoul regime and calls for the reunification of the north and south of Korea  in accordance with the legitimate aspirations of the Korean people.212.	For more than a year my country has recognized the People's Republic of Kampuchea and its legitimate and authentic representative  the People's Revolutionary Council of Kampuchea  because it had no doubt that the Pol Pot regime had been among the most murderous in history  having taken the lives of about 3 million people. Today  the people of Kampuchea is able to breathe again now that that regime has been driven out of the country.213.	However  within this Assembly the legitimate representatives of the people of Kampuchea are excluded. We believe that one cannot  as so many delegations have done from this rostrum  invoke the presence of Vietnamese troops in Kampuchea to justify the exclusion of the People's Republic of Kampuchea from our Organization without  on the one hand  interfering in the internal affairs of these two States and  on the other hand  reopening the frontiers of Kampuchea to Pol Pot and his army of butchers.214.	That is why the Republic of Seychelles believes that the People's Republic of Kampuchea must be allowed to take the seat which belongs to it in this Organization  to the exclusion of the representatives of the Pol Pot regime who  in no circumstances  should benefit from the tolerance or complicity of our Organization.215.	The people of the Republic of Kampuchea needs the sincere and effective solidarity of the international community to perform its task of national reconstruction in peace and security.216.	It took our Organization more than 20 years to recognize the People's Republic of China. I mention this in passing.217.	Anxious as always to promote peace throughout the world so that the peoples of the world can continue the building of their future  we support the initiative of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam which is designed to make of southeast Asia a zone of peace. The other countries of IndoChina have associated themselves with this initiative and we know that a dialogue on this subject is possible between the countries of the Association of southeast Asian Nations and the countries of IndoChina  but only on condition that outside influences are not allowed to play a part. We very much hope that our Organization will take a stand in favour of this initiative.218.	I have mentioned here the struggles of peoples throughout the world to obtain or safeguard their political independence. But  as we all know  colonialism was a means of political domination essentially aimed at economic exploitation. Thus  if our political independence is to be genuine it must be allowed to put down deep roots in economic independence; otherwise neo-colonialism will rise to the surface and the same structures of exploitation will persist.219.	But we also know how difficult it is to rid ourselves of the structures of economic dependence. Most of the countries of the developed world which were formerly directly or indirectly our colonizers continue to see their relations with our countries in terms of relations of exploitation. Recently they have transformed our countries into suppliers of raw materials and of cheap labour  as well as consumers of their manufactured products which are sold at prices out of all proportion to the prices they pay us for our raw materials. And this is continuing.220.	There is a deliberate determination on the part of the exponents of imperialism to maintain this situation of economic dependence by keeping our countries in a state of technological and financial dependence. This is all the more true in that too often  the policies of aid and cooperation of certain rich countriesâindeed  even the policy of certain specialized agencies of the United Nationsâconsist in helping countries only if they remain in a state of poverty.221.	At the same time  everyone talks of the need for new international economic relations. In this regard  there have been recently two special meetings convened by OAU and the United Nations respectively: The second extraordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU  at Lagos  on 28 and 29 April  and the eleventh special session of the General Assembly  from 25 August to 15 September. There have been attempts at a North South dialogue. UNIDO and UNCTAD are supposed to have been working for years now to promote new economic relations in the world.222.	But unfortunately we cannot but note that the results achieved so far are rather disappointing. Imperialism continues to dominate the structures of world economy  particularly at the expense of the economies of the third world countries. The great Powers are asserting themselves ever more arrogantly. Thus  we have recently noted with indignation that the United States has unilaterally adopted a law authorizing its transnational corporations to exploit the resources of the seabed  at a time when they claim to be negotiating with the rest of the international community the adoption of a convention on the exploitation of those very resources  which are the common heritage of the whole of mankind.223.	If it happens that the capitalist system makes certain small adjustments  it is in an effort to control its growing internal contradictions  never in an attempt to change its basic method of operation.224.	One thing seems to us to be clear: apart from appreciable support from the community of socialist countries  the third world countries had to fight alone for their political independence; today they are having to fight alone again for their economic independence.225.	The North South dialogue  essential though it is  is bogged down; unfortunately it remains a dialogue of the deaf. It will only make progress under the pressure of South South cooperation  in accordance with the recent declaration of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Group of 77.226.	Thus  the Republic of Seychelles  together with its neighbours and other third world countries  has undertaken to promote horizontal and regional cooperation. In this regard  we wish to express our appreciation to those third world countries that are at the most advanced stage of development and have demonstrated their solidarity with the others  sometimes at the cost of genuine sacrifice.227.	To conclude  permit me to reaffirm the wholehearted support of the Republic of Seychelles for the objectives of the United Nations and its loyalty to the praiseworthy ideals which prevailed at the foundation of an Organization. However  representatives will understand why the Seychelles delegation is worried about the future. There must be an end to certain manoeuvres which have the effect of diverting the United Nations from its primary objective  namely  the promotion of peace and development  with respect for the equality of all nations."
"130",6639,"SYR",35,1980,"ï»¿Mr. President  it gives me pleasure to extend to you my felicitations on your election as President of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly  and to wish you complete success in that most important task. I am confident that your efficiency and experience will enable you to guide our session to a successful conclusion. My delegation will do its best to cooperate with you towards this end.2.	May I express my appreciation to Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim  the President of the previous session  during whose presidency the General Assembly held three special sessions.  Mr. Salim conducted the work of the Assembly with exemplary efficiency.3.	I take this opportunity to welcome the admission of Zimbabwe to membership of the United Nations  following a long and bitter struggle waged by the heroic people of Zimbabwe against the racist colonialist regime  thus proving that peoples fighting for their right to self-determination and independence are bound to win. I also congratulate Saint Vincent and the Grenadines on its admission to the international community.4.	Our faith in the Charter and its principles  and in the United Nations as an international forum for all peoples of the world  is steadily becoming stronger  despite the complicated problems and acute crises facing the world today. Guided by this faith  we rely on the Organization to examine such problems and crises  and we are prepared to cooperate in seeking solutions conducive to security  stability and progress for humankind.5.	The first development during the past year was the severe shock that rocked the process of international detente. Detente had succeeded in keeping the world temporarily free from the cold war  on the one hand  and in creating a new atmosphere of international cooperation  on the other. World imperialism has reverted to its previous practices of seeking to achieve the greatest possible domination by creating spheres of influence  acquiring military bases and facilities  massing troops in specific regions and deploying destructive nuclear missile networks. All those acts have plunged the world anew into the climate of cold war and have created hotbeds of conflict that may explode at any moment. Consequently  we are witnessing growing international tension and a struggle for spheres of influence  as well as resistance to those actions by peace-loving peoples.6.	From this rostrum  we have warned the Assembly on several occasions that the process of detente cannot be universal and worldwide unless its framework is enlarged  encompassing the whole world and enabling us to solve the great international crises. The most significant proof of this is the question of Palestine and the Middle East. The United States  a superpower and a permanent member of the Security Council with specific responsibilities for the maintenance of international peace and security  has removed the question from the United Nations and has sought to take action itself  with Israel and the Egyptian regime  without involving the remaining parties concerned  in particular the Palestinian Arab people  and their legitimate representative  the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO].7.	The continuing existence of such problems and of imperialist practices stresses the need for all nations to participate  on an equal footing  in defining the policy of detente based on right and justice  to give it the comprehensive international dimension it requires so that it may become a positive factor in guaranteeing international peace and security  and in setting up a new order of international relations.8.	Complete and comprehensive disarmament is a major objective which the international community is continually striving to achieve. There is no clearer proof of this than the fact that the agenda of the present session includes more than 20 items related to disarmament  and that the United Nations has held several special sessions and conferences devoted to it. Nevertheless  the arms race grows and intensifies. We are witnessing growing activity by the imperialist forces in establishing military bases in some regions  which represents a challenge. It is therefore high time for the Assembly to make every effort to curb the arms race and the establishment of foreign military facilities  so that the world may feel that the Organization is working seriously and sincerely to spare it the tragedies of a destructive world war.9.	In this connection  we wish to emphasize  as a result of the current situation in the world  that disarmament can be realized only through the elimination of colonialism  racism  Zionism and all aspects of aggression  usurpation  occupation  domination and foreign exploitation. It can be realized only if all peoples come to know that security is based on right  justice and equality  and if they are reassured of respect for their territorial integrity  independence and sovereignty and their right to self-determination and to select the regime they want.10.	Among the major issues which are still burning and dangerous is the problem of the racist regimes  which are still adamant in defying world public opinion and the Charter and resolutions of the United Nations. They are still practising racism in southern Africa and in Palestine and the occupied territories. These regimes are pursuing their expansionist  aggressive policy  consolidating collaboration among themselves in the various fields  particularly in manufacturing nuclear weapons. Owing to weak international deterrence  the regions dominated by such regimes have become hotbeds jeopardizing international peace and security and directly imperilling the peace and independence of the African continent and the Arab world. We reaffirm our complete support for the liberation movements in South Africa and Namibia in their struggle for the rights of their peoples to self-determination  independence and national sovereignty. We also wish to stress our support for the resistance of the African frontline States in the face of the savage racist aggressions and schemings against the aspirations of the peoples of southern Africa.11.	We cannot but express our deep regret for the explosive situation in several regions in Asia  owing to the imperialist plots and attempts to dominate those regions.12.	In addition  the Korean problem remains unsolved. This prompts us to stress the need for withdrawal of all foreign troops and for a dialogue between the two parties  in implementation of the North South Joint Communique signed in 1972 ' in order to reunify the country peacefully and independently without any foreign interference.13.	The situation in Cyprus remains tense and calls for concern. We laud  in this connection  the efforts of the Secretary General  who was able to revive the negotiation process between the two communities  with a view to finding a solution based on the relevant United Nations resolutions and within the framework of respect for the sovereignty of Cyprus  its independence  territorial integrity  unity and nonalignment.14.	The United Nations  through the General Assembly  conferences and committees  has exerted strenuous and benevolent efforts towards setting up a new international economic order. Though five years have elapsed since the foundations of such an order were laid  the industrial nations are still placing obstacles in the way of this order  clinging to the advantages afforded them by the present economic  trade and monetary system  which is based on exploitation and is far from being just. As a consequence  the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and various international bodies are at a deadlock and such efforts have failed so far.15.	This will inevitably lead to a widening of the gap between rich and poor countries and will deprive the developing countries of the means of economic and social development  and especially the means of acquiring the modern technology needed for such development. It will also lead to intensifying the blockade imposed by some developed industrial nations  in collaboration with the transnational corporations  on developing countries to compel them to sell their raw materials at very low prices  while the developed industrial nations are raising the prices of their industrial products in a manner that threatens with collapse the economies of the developing countries.16.	We stress the need for initiating a basic change in the current structure of economic relations and for setting up a new international economic order  thereby consolidating the economic independence of the developing countries  securing prosperity and stability for the peoples and contributing to the maintenance of international peace and security.17.	In our review of some of the international issues and problems  we cannot but touch upon the issue of human rights and the specific interpretations given by certain countries seeking pretexts for interfering in the internal affairs of other countries  mainly the third world countries.18.	We can only caution against the dangers of such attempts and interpretations  especially in view of the fact that their authors belong to countries that do not cease to extend material and moral help and support to the regimes of oppression  aggression  occupation and racism to enable them to persist in violating the human rights and the dignity of man and even his very existence.19.	Proceeding from our faith in the rights of individuals  groups and peoples  big and small  we deem it necessary to confront this artificial offensive aimed at diverting the attention of world public opinion to the rights of individuals in this or that country  rather than focusing attention on the basic rights of millions of peoples still labouring under the yoke of colonialism  occupation  Zionism and racism  and even deprived of their right to life. No human right can be preserved under conditions of the exercise of force  coercion and colonialist and racist oppression  where the human being is deprived of his nation  land and home. A most prominent example is provided by the sufferings of the Arabs under the yoke of Zionist racist colonialism in Palestine and the occupied Arab territories and the sufferings of the Africans under the yoke of the racist regimes in South Africa and Namibia.20.	If the first function of the Organization is the maintenance and consolidation of international peace and security  addressing the explosive situation in the Middle East must rank at the top of the priorities in the United Nations. The Assembly is well aware of the strategic importance of the Middle East region and its impact on international peace and security. Thus  addressing the situation in this region is fundamental to the work of the Organization and its purposes.21.	Our region is suffering and facing dangers because of the Zionist entity in Palestine  as a result of the racist and aggressive nature of this entity  and its persistent defiance of the United Nations and the latter's determination to preserve peace and security. This proves that the prevailing dangerous situation may explode at any moment. This situation has been further aggravated by the tripartite conspiracy concocted by United States imperialism  in collaboration with Israel and the Egyptian regime  at Camp David  designed to realize the following objectives: first  to weaken the Arab nation by embroiling the Egyptian regime in a policy that runs counter to the interests and future of the Arabs and to the interests of peace and security; secondly  to liquidate the cause of Palestine and undermine the national unity of the Palestinian people and their aspirations to liberation and self-determination and to establish their independent State on their national soil; thirdly  to perpetuate the Israeli aggression in Palestine and the occupied Arab territories and to use Israel as a base endangering and imperilling the security  peace and future of the region; and fourthly  to spread United States hegemony in the region  notably military  economic and political hegemony. This trend is manifested in the setting up of a series of United States military bases in some countries of the region.22.	It was natural for the Arabs to reject and oppose this conspiracy  for they refuse capitulation to the same extent as they are eager to realize peace based on right and justice. Peace that is not based on right and justice is no more than a phase towards a new war. The continuous feeling of oppression and injustice is bound to increase the drive towards eliminating the causes of oppression and injustice.23.	The Camp David policy has realized some of the objectives of Israel and the United States by isolating Egypt and embroiling the Egyptian Government in a policy that runs counter to the Arab nation and the interests of the Arab people of Egypt  by setting up United States military bases in some countries of the region and by the adoption of a decision by the Israeli Government to annex Jerusalem and continue with the policy of settlements. However  despite these extremely dangerous objectives  which have rendered the region a field for a fierce international and regional conflict  the Camp David policy has failed to realize one of its main objectives  namely  to liquidate the cause of Palestine  because of its failure to find a Palestinian negotiator and because of the firm Arab opposition to such a policy.24.	For this reason  attempts are being made by some international circles here and there  which are directly linked to the United States policy and strategy. These attempts are designed to find a breakthrough for the Camp David policy to enable it to pursue its course under another title. While cautioning the world public of the dangers of such attempts  we stress that they are bound further to complicate and aggravate the situation in the region.25.	We shall never accept any manoeuvres or conspiracies with respect to our right to liberate our occupied territories and the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  recognized by the United Nations  namely the right to return  to self-determination and to establish their own independent State.26.	The Assembly has defined in many resolutions the bases for a just and lasting peace in the region. Such bases may be summarized as follows: first  complete and unconditional Israeli withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories; and secondly  recognition of the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people. The General Assembly has defined the nature and limits of these rights.27.	However  the Camp David accords have transformed the process of establishing a just and lasting peace into obstacles in the way of achieving peace. These obstacles are: first  the Egyptian Israeli Treaty  and hence the Egyptian Israeli United States alliance and the objectives it aims to achieve in the region; secondly  the establishment of American military bases  which reveal the hegemonistic intent of the United States of America in the region; and  thirdly  the Israeli decisions and measures related to Jerusalem  the establishment of settlements and the alteration of the characteristics of the occupied territories.28.	These aggregate results have created an imbalance in the region  thereby immobilizing the peace process and creating a major deadlock. Such a situation requires that all peace-loving peoples stand at the side of the Arabs in order to eliminate these obstacles. That is the only course that would create normal circumstances for the establishment of peace in the region.29.	That is the situation in our region. The dangers grow day after day because of Israel's continuing policy of aggression in the occupied territories and against brotherly Lebanon  which include ground  air and sea raids that jeopardize the peace and security of Lebanon and the entire region. It has become urgent for the General Assembly to assume its responsibilities by imposing sanctions against Israel  since the United States of America has succeeded in paralyzing the Security Council by the abuse of the right of veto.30.	Thus  there is a pressing need for the world community to re-examine Israel's membership in the United Nations  because Israel not only systematically rejects the United Nations resolutions but also defies them and persists in its defiance. Is there a situation that more warrants attention and the adoption of serious resolutions? We urge the General Assembly to adopt resolutions imposing sanctions against Israel and suspending its membership in the international Organization  to ensure respect for the Charter and resolutions of the United Nations and to stress the significance of working for peace."
"131",6684,"TCD",35,1980,"ï»¿The thirty-fifth session of the Assembly is being held at an extremely critical time in international relations when the relative peace which has prevailed among nations since the Second World War is today seriously threatened.37.	Whether it be in the Middle East  in Asia or in Africa  what we have seen is a recrudescence of violence and turbulence which  if we are not careful  is liable to undermine all the efforts undertaken by the United Nations and other bodies to save present and future generations from the horrors of war in keeping with the ideals of the Charter.38.	The economic and international monetary turbulence at the present time  far from creating a climate of confidence between the industrialized and the developing countries with a view to better collaboration  is  on the contrary  giving rise to a feeling of frustration and is holding up solutions for the establishment of a new international economic order that will be more just and more equitable.39.	That is why our delegation  which represents  as is well known  one of the poorest countries in the world because our resources are not exploited and because we are a victim of the present system  is much concerned both by our internal situation and by the very future of mankind.40- By electing Mr  von Wechmar to the presidency of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly  the United Nations intended to pay a sterling tribute to his great country  the Federal Republic of Germany  with which my country  Chad  maintains excellent relations of friendship and co-operation.41.	It is a particular pleasure  therefore  for us to extend to him  on behalf of our delegation  our warmest possible congratulations  His distinguished diplomatic and statesmanlike qualities make it highly probable that he will with dynamism  tact and foresight conduct the proceedings of the present session of our Organization to full success 42.	The delegation of Chad will spare neither effort nor time contributing its own part to our deliberations.43.	I should like to express our warm satisfaction and great admiration to Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim of the United Republic of Tanzania  That worthy and brave son of Africa conducted the proceedings of the thirty-fourth session and the three special sessions of the Assembly with competence and dynamism.44.	We should also like to congratulate our valiant Secretary-General for having made himself so readily available and for the bold initiatives he has taken to face up to the many situations which seemed liable to threaten or breach international peace and security  which are the fundamental objectives of the Charter of the United Nations  I hope he will find in what I have said an expression of the profound gratitude of the Government and people of Chad for his concern over the situation of exceptional gravity prevailing in our country.45.	We should like also to welcome in our midst the representatives of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. The accession to independence of their beautiful country illustrates once again the victory of the peoples that love peace and justice over the forces of domination and exploitation.46.	The United Nations has set itself the task of ensuring the maintenance of international peace and security  the settlement of disputes by peaceful means  co-operation among States in the various areas of international relations  disarmament and the decolonization of Territories still under foreign domination and administration.47.	If we want to maintain international peace and security  we must continue to work to reduce the causes of tension in the world. Competition among the great Powers in the field of armaments  in spite of the recommendations of the General Assembly at the tenth special session  increases the danger of a war which may turn into a nuclear holocaust in which all nations  great and small  rich and poor  will be destroyed. In order to maintain this international peace and security all those Powers that possess arms must show by specific deeds their determination to respect the fundamental principles laid down in the Charter.48.	Therefore we should like to stress here our concern about the armed conflict between Iraq and Iran  two fraternal countries with which we share so many ideals. We appeal urgently to the two belligerents to listen to reason and find a rapid solution to their dispute by peaceful means. It is within this framework that we welcome the mediation efforts of the President of Pakistan  undertaken in accordance with the recommendations of the members of the Islamic Conference.49.	The obstinate refusal of certain regimes to implement resolution 1514 (XV)  the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  makes manifest the contradiction between the extolling of human rights and the frequent violation of those rights  particularly in southern Africa  in the Middle East  in Western Sahara and in other parts of the world.50.	In southern Africa  the independence of Zimbabwe  so warmly welcomed by all the Members of the Organization  represents an undeniable victory over colonialism. This overwhelming victory of the martyred and heroic people of Zimbabwe arouses our increased admiration and confidence concerning the bright future ahead for all peoples still under colonial and racist domination. The knell is tolling for the last bastion of colonialism and apartheid.51.	The explosive situation in Namibia is of grave concern to us and more sustained efforts are needed to combat the unjust policy of the minority racist regime of South Africa. The installation by Pretoria of a puppet Government in Namibia strengthens our determination to support SWAPO  the sole and legitimate representative of the Namibian people. Any overt or covert attempt to lend a semblance of legitimacy to that Government is clearly doomed to failure. We vigorously condemn the minority regime of South Africa  which  in flagrant violation of the relevant resolutions of the Organization of African Unity [OAU] and the United Nations and in defiance of international public opinion  is stepping up its reign of terror  violence and racial discrimination.52.	Furthermore  we very much appreciate the considerable efforts made by the Secretary-General  and we  too  regret that  as he stressed in his report on the work of the Organization  South Africa in particular is still obstructing the implementation of the proposed settlement approved by the Security Council in resolution 435 (1978).53.	In South Africa itself  international attention is still focused on the odious practice of apartheid. The minority racist regime is continuing its shameful oppression of the African majority. The increase in repression and violent incidents in recent months in South Africa makes it amply clear that Â«hat regime is obstinately pursuing its policy of racial discrimination and apartheid  but nothing can break the will and the resistance of a people when humiliation reaches the point of no return.54.	We should not like to leave the African continent without referring to the situation in Western Sahara. With regard to this  we express the hope that the conclusions of the recent deliberations of the Ad Hoc Committee of the OAU will be applied by the parties concerned. The OAU  we believe  still has vast resources at its disposal and we have every confidence in it.55.	The problem of the Palestinian people over the years has been a focal point of our concern. Any solution of that problem must take into account the effective participation of the PLO  the sole authentic and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. Experience has shown us that none of the partial attempts at a settlement has yielded the results hoped for. For our part  whether in the OAU  among the non-aligned countries or in the United Nations  we have constantly asserted that the Palestinian people  like any other people  has the right to a homeland and its inalienable rights must be preserved. That is why we condemn the decision of Israel to make Jerusalem its capital  contrary to the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.56.	Permit me now  in view of the gravity of the tragedy that has afflicted the people of Chad  to ask the indulgence of the representatives here briefly to recall the facts  so that they may be placed in their proper context  of the events that have been occurring in our country and particularly in the capital  N'Djamena  in order to explain better to the international community the position of our Government. The Lagos agreement signed on 21 August 1979 is a valid historical compromise for the normalization of political life in Chad following the bloody events of February and March 1979. But that agreement as deliberately violated by one of the signatories known as the Armed Forces of the North  a title that only serves to illuminate the separatist tendencies of their leader.57.	In putting into effect its policy of national reconciliation  the military regime of General Malloum  which had overthrown President Tombalbaye on 13 April 1975  concluded on 16 September 1977 the Khartoum agreement with Mr. Hissene Habre  the leader of the Armed Forces of the North. Pursuant to that document  the latter returned peacefully to N'Djamena  where on 25 August 1978 he signed with the central authorities the fundamental charter  the new institutional framework of the country. It was an extremely rare event in the history of Africa that the rebel chief was made Prime Minister of a Government of National Union established in accordance with the provisions of the charter I have mentioned. However  instead of combining his efforts with those of the President of the Republic in order to complete the task of national reconciliation and to bring about a frank and direct dialogue with the other forces still in armed opposition  the Prime Minister set about obstructing them and rose up against the authority of the President. Furthermore  refusing the necessary political debate  the Prime Minister mobilized the support of the section of the public on matters which were as subjective as they were separatist  such as the north-south and the Moslem-non-Moslem antagonism. This belligerent attitude led to the outbreak on 1 February 1979 of hostilities between the national armed forces remaining faithful to the President of the Republic and the Prime Minister's Armed Forces of the North  This was the first war in N'Djamena and the first act of sabotage of the process of national reconciliation. This military explosion caused the people of Chad tremendous losses in human lives and material damage  the consequences of which are incalculable.58.	It was in those circumstances that  thanks to the benevolent and fraternal mediation of neighbouring countries  particularly the Federal Republic of Nigeria  the first conference brought together the warring brothers at Kano from 7 to 15 March 1979. That conference gave rise to the so-called Kano agreement signed by the two opposing parties  that is to say  the President and the Prime Minister  and two other leaders of certain political-military movements invited by the Nigerian authorities.59.	That agreement provided for  inter alia: the observation of a cease-fire throughout the national territory; free circulation of the civilian population; dissolution of political institutions; and the formation of a transitional Government of national union  which was to come into effect only after a meeting bringing together all the political families of Chad with political-military representation in the country.60.	Furthermore  by related arrangement  the President and the Prime Minister promised to resign from their respective posts and to entrust power to a provisional council of State which was to manage the country's affairs until the Government provided for in the agreement was formed. That resignation actually took place on 23 March 1979 and the President withdrew from the political scene in order to facilitate the search for a solution to the tragic situation in Chad. The former Prime Ministerâinstead of following the President's example  since he was equally responsible if not more so for the situation which had been createdâclung desperately to his political life and returned to the second Kano conference at the head of his movement. That second conference was convened at the beginning of April 1979 and brought together all the political groupings in Chad without exception. But that meeting was a failure even before it started  because of the intransigence of the leader of the Armed Forces of the North who systematically opposed the participation of movements which had not been represented at the first Kano conference on the pretext that they had no representatives in the field.61.	That was a further disavowal of the commitments undertaken by the head of the Armed Forces of the North and the second act of sabotage against national reconciliation.62.	In the face of the impasse thus created  the President of the conference  Major-General Shehu M. Yar'adua  then Chief of Staff  and a member of the Supreme Military Council of Nigeria  managed to secure agreementâby way of compromiseâon the establishment of a commission of inquiry made up of representatives of the participating countries and each of the political movements in Chad. Its mission was to verify in the field the political and military presence of the new movements.63.	Faithful to his strategy of systematically going back on commitments  the former Prime Minister prevented the commission from fulfilling its task. Furthermore  profiting by a major military presence in the capital  he was to force the hand of the other heads of movements and form a government in clear violation of the Kano agreement and compromise. That Government  in which the leader of the Armed Forces of the North held the defence portfolio  was not only challenged by neighbouring countries and the rest of the international community but was also flatly rejected by those who had no part in the proceedings.64.	It was in that context that at its sixteenth session the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of OAU decided at Monrovia to entrust the settlement of the Chad conflict to an ad hoc committee composed of Chad's neighbours  observer countries and representatives of the Secretary-General of OAU.65.	Nigeria once again offered its generous hospitality as host to a new conference on national reconciliation in Chad. That was organized in Lagos from 13 to 21 August 1979  Under the aegis of the OAU  it brought together 11 national political and military movements in the presence of those nations which has been duly commissioned by the Monrovia Assembly.66.	Following difficult negotiations  those talks led to the conclusion of an historic political compromise which became known as the Lagos agreement. The relevant provisions of that agreement  which have been aptly recalled in the General Assembly by the Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of the Congo  include the following points; demilitarization of the City of N'Djamena; release of political detainees and prisoners of war; formation of an integrated army; establishment of a neutral inter- African force with the task of maintaining peace; formation of a transitional government of national union with the task of leading the country to free democratic elections within a period of 18 months; and  finally  the withdrawal of French troops.67.	Of those principal points  only the formation of the Transitional Government of National Union  the arrival in N'Djamena of part of the neutral force composed solely of the Congolese contingent  and evacuation of the French military base in N'Djamena were actually carried out.68.	As for the other points  not only was their implementation not even begun but the Armed Forces of the North  whose representatives held two important ministries- defence and financeâstarted to infringe the Agreement. Thus  they violated the cease-fire by attacking the positions of the other movements in the north and centre of the country.69.	With regard to the demilitarization of the city of N'Djamena  the Minister of Defence  who moreover was the chairman of the committee on demilitarization  in no way tried to perform his task but rather strengthened his positions in the capital  thus paving the way to a coup dâEtat. What is more  lie prevented the Congolese continent of the neutral force  which had arrived in N'Djamena  from being deployed in order to ensure order and protect persons of rank in Chad. We should like to take this opportunity to express our admiration and profound gratitude to the Congolese contingent for its exemplary behaviour during the hostilities 70.	Putting his plan for a coup dâEtat into effect  the head of the Armed Forces of the North  after his followers had violated the cease-fire  surrounded the Chamber of Commerce building where a meeting was being held with all the heads of movements and the OAU representative  Chairman of the Independent Control Commission  which was attempting in a concerted way to put an end to the hostilities started by the Armed Forces of the North within the country. Not being able to achieve power in that way  at dawn on 21 March 1980 he launched the hostilities which are still going on. Thus the followers of the former Minister of Defence betrayed the spirit of the Lagos agreement and the confidence of the OAU.71.	The unfortunate consequences of the tragedy caused by the Armed Forces of the North are numerous. The former Prime Minister in effect attempted to bring about a de facto partition of Chad by ordering  in the course of the February 1979 hostilities  the systematic murder of people from the southern part of Chad who were living in the north and in the capital of the country. That Fascist  pursuing his policy of division based on primitive tribalism  is persecuting and exterminating  even before and particularly after the beginning of the events that are now going on  the Arab people of Chad and all enlightened patriots living in the zones controlled by those hordes. The brutalities committed by the Armed Forces of the North  furthermore  provoked the exodus of the civilian population into the neighbouring countries of the United Republic of Cameroon  Nigeria  the Central African Republic  and the Sudan  which have to bear a greatly increased social burden. We should like to repeat to them here the expression of our profound gratitude for the sacrifices that they are so generously making to help the suffering people of Chad.72.	But it should be noted that it is not only the refugees in neighbouring countries whose plight is of such concern to the Government of Chad and the international community; there is also the case of persons displaced within the country itself whose situation is also critical.73.	In the light of the above  one might well ask how it was possible to arrive at this bloody imbroglio  which is almost without solution  after the Lagos compromise which  as so many delegations have so rightly pointed out  gave rise to a gleam of hope after the terrible events of 1979.74.	The answer to that question  as was stressed by President Goukouni Weddeye  is the following:""If Chad has been put to the fire and sword  if the people of Chad are dying in their thousands and have been for a year and a half  if the economy is in ruin and if the very existence of the State of Chad is threatened today  it is because of the satanic ambition of one of our fellow-countrymen.""Indeed  this man believes that he has a mission to govern Chad at any cost75.	However  this nonentity would not have been able to plunge the people of Chad into this tragedy if he had not enjoyed the solid support of certain foreign Powers for which the unity and happiness of the people of Chad matter little in comparison with their ambition to dominate  They do not wish to admit that the individual who has caused so much bloodshed among innocent people who only wish to live in harmony and concord  has been rejected by the country as a whole.76.	The people of Chad  like the other peoples of the world  is jealous of its independence and its national sovereignty  and it refuses to concede to anyone the right to impose any course of conduct upon it.77.	Chad is rightfully respectful of the sacrosanct principles of the Charter and those of the OAU such as territorial integrity  free choice of a socio-economic regime  non-interference in the internal affairs of other States  non- acquisition of territory by force  and the self-determination of peoples.78.	The distressing situation in which Chad has been plunged is  it should be recalled  the result of an internal rebellion against the authority of the State  Hence it is up to the Transitional Government of National Union  which derives its legitimacy from the Lagos agreement  to find an appropriate solution to the conflict. Nevertheless it has always made itself ready to co-operate in any initiative likely to assist in bringing back peace to the whole of its national territory.79.	It was within that framework that  at the OAU meetings in June and July  at Freetown  the Chad delegation gave its full support to the resolution dealing with the Chad crisis with a view to finding an African solution. For to act in any other way would run the risk of lending international dimensions to an internal conflict. We are therefore fully confident that the current Chairman of the OAU Assembly will help the Transitional Government of National Union in its search for a solution to the Chad tragedy in accordance with that resolution.80.	We hope that Mr. Siaka Stevens  President of Sierra Leone  the other African heads of State  and all those who are tireless in their efforts to restore peace to Chad will find in this an expression of our profound gratitude.81.	Because of that serious political situation a country in the heart of Africa is in its death throes. Indeed  ever since its accession to international sovereignty Chad has virtually known no tranquil political life liable to promote its economic and social prosperity. Only five years after independence Chad was faced with a turbulent political situation the epilogue to which was the destruction of the State. Our economic development  which in any case was only embryonic and largely jeopardized by drought  was totally frozen.82.	All administrative  economic  social and cultural structures were disrupted if not swept away entirely. It was a veritable debacle. The whole country must be reconstructed.83.	At this tragic time  when the very foundations of the nation and its unity are threatened  the international community has not remained indifferent. It responded promptly to the appeal made by our delegation at the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly and in resolution 34/120.84.	In that resolution the General Assembly appealed urgently to all Member States  specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system and international economic and financial institutions to provide generous emergency aid to Chad through bilateral or multilateral channels  with a view to meeting its reconstruction  rehabilitation and development needs  both short-term and long-term.85.	In that resolution the Secretary-General was requested to dispatch a mission to Chad to review with the Government the aid it needed for reconstruction  and the question of organizing of a meeting of donors and  in this respect  to co-ordinate his efforts with those of UNDP  ECA and the World Bank.86.	The delegation of Chad repeats here the warm expressions of gratitude which the President of the Transitional Government of National Union and Head of State  Mr. Goukouni Weddeye  addressed to the United Nations following the adoption of that resolution. That resolution gave rise to considerable hopes. Together with the Lagos agreement  it constituted genuine grounds for satisfaction and relief  and it seemed then that everything was going to be restored to order in Chad. But unfortunately that important resolution could not begin to be implemented to any extent at all because of the political situation.87.	As we have said  the people of Chad took refuge abroad or were displaced within the national territory  and they are living in precarious conditions of hygiene  stripped of resources  food and medicine.88.	That situation did  of course  gain the attention of the Council of Ministers of OAU  and at their thirty-fifth ordinary session at Freetown  they adopted a resolution on assistance to refugees and displaced persons in Chad. 89.	We should like to take this opportunity to repeat our appeal to the international community for adequate and even increased assistance for Chad because resolution 34/120 is still valid and we are readying ourselves to embark  once peace has been restored  on an even more formidable warâthe war  as the Assembly may be sure  of national reconstruction.90.	We venture to hope that the will of the international community to help us remains unswerving  because the problem of Chad is just as acute as ever.91.	But  beyond States and specialized agencies  our appeal goes also to the various charitable organizations and welfare organizations throughout the world  because women  children and old persons are languishing in poverty and dying of disease and malnutrition.92.	We believe we have laid sufficient stress on the extreme gravity of the problem in Chad and our appeal to the international community to help us solve our problem. But our internal difficulties  however grave they may be  do not cause us to overlook the equally disturbing problems of the international community at large  because the economic development of each of our countries is to a very large extent dependent on the world economic situation.93.	One thing is certain and universally acknowledged  and that is that we all aspire to a common ideal: improvement of the general well-being of our respective peoples and hence of all mankind.94.	To say that all the hopes in our Organization have been dashed is in our view not very realistic. We cannot pass over in silence the extremely positive role played by the United Nations in the emancipation of the colonized peoples  rapprochement and the peaceful coexistence of all peoples.95.	We cannot underestimate that role inasmuch as economic and political factors are intimately interconnected and very often political freedom has promoted and made possible economic and social advances. In a word  the record of the action by the United Nations is not entirely negative. But we have serious grounds for being disturbed and disappointed. Indeed  when we consider the international economic situation  we cannot conceal either our concern at the negative trends in the world economy or our disappointment in the face of the economic stagnation of the developing countries. However  important measures have been adopted by the General Assembly to promote development and to help the developing countries catch up. But the results that have been achieved still fall far short of the objectives.96.	If we compare the global objectives and targets laid down in the Lima Plan and for the First and the Second United Nations Development Decade with the progress actually achieved  we have to conclude that the endeavour has been a failure. The economic situation of those countries has hardly improved. In many cases it has become even worse. The African continent  which contains the greatest number of least-developed countries  including my own  is the principal victim of the world's economic crisis. The estimates of the World Bank are very alarming in this regard. They are the harbinger of catastrophe for most of the African States since they provide that their growth will be practically non-existent between 1980 and 1985 and that the rate of growth will not exceed 1.1 per cent between 1985 and 1990. Africa has not reached the goals set for the First and Second United Nations Development Decade because there is a lack of correlation between its actual needs and the resources it has available to satisfy those needs  since in 1979 the effective flow of public aid for development did not even attain one half of the target  which was 0.70 per cent.97.	With the prospect of a restructuring of international economic relations  the eleventh special session of the General Assembly has just produced  and we shall shortly adoptâat least so we hopeâthe International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade. 98.	The new Strategy gives us a glimpse of the scope of the efforts that have to be made in the next 10 years nationally  regionally and internationally. It is for each developing country to set its own targets and to take the appropriate measures in the light of its own capacities.99.	In order to embark in the proper way upon the Third United Nations Development Decade  the African countries at the second extraordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU  in April of this year  adopted the Lagos Plan of Action for the Implementation of the Monrovia Strategy for the Economic Development of Africa â a declaration whereby the heads of State and Government have undertaken to respect the guiding principles and measures taken to bring about national and collective self-reliance in the economic and social realms. The implementation of that Plan will without any doubt contribute to the establishment of a new international economic order.100.	Although Africa has undertaken to count first and foremost on its own capacities and resources  it does not thereby exclude international assistance. The international community must help the African countries to put their development strategy into effect  because it is clear that development and the integration of the African continent are preparing it for better participation in the promotion of international economic co-operation.101.	In the final analysis  the international community must be vigilant in avoiding the formidable consequences of any possible failure of the Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade. In that regard  as the Secretary-General has pointed out we must ""bridge the growing chasm between declarations and intentions  on the one hand  and the realities of hardship and suffering  on the other. ..   Exceptional efforts are required from all parties involved"". 102.	It is not enough to take decisions; we must also  and above all  put our decisions into effect.103.	All the players in this international game must be involved in the Development Decade. Developed and developing countries must not be regarded as competitors but  rather  as complementary partners. They must transcend everything that divides them and must rely solely on what unites them; in a spirit of solidarity  they must co-operate in the restructuring of international economic relations. Chad  for its part  is ready to give all its support to the attainment of that noble objective.104.	In conclusion  I should like to say what a dangerous precedent the tragedy of Chad can constitute and what a serious threat it poses to international stability and security  and particularly to stability and security in Africa.105.	For our part  we solemnly declare that the Provisional Government of National Union  formed after the Lagos agreement  is working tirelessly  under the leadership of President Goukouni Weddeye  for the return of peace  union and stability to Chad. With that in view  we urge countries supporting the armed rebellion against the Provisional Government of National Union to put an end to their intervention in Chad's internal affairs.106.	The Provisional Government of National Union is determined to apply the Lagos agreement faithfully and totally. Hence  one of the essential objectives of the Government of Chad is that after the withdrawal of French troops free and democratic elections shall be held during which the people will be called upon to choose their leaders and to decide their destiny. That shows how faithful our Government is to its commitments; it shows that our Government has no intention whatsoever of shirking them.107.	In the meantime  the Provisional Government of National Union will be undertaking a major endeavour of national reconstruction. For that it will need contributions within the framework of the appeal we have just made. To that end  the Government will be guided only by the higher interests of the nation  in accordance with the legitimate aspirations of the people of Chad to independence  progress and social justice.108.	The Government of Chad intends also to pursue a policy of good-neighbourliness and mutually advantageous co-operation with all countries that cherish peace  justice and freedom.109.	Finally  in spite of the long civil war imposed upon Chad by foreign forces and their local lackeys  in spite of the ordeal it has been subjected to for years now because of the ill effects of drought and other natural disasters  despite its land-locked status and its very low level of development  Chad will do everything in its power and will work tirelessly to ensure the attainment of the Organization's objective of a more just and equitable world."
"132",6730,"TGO",35,1980,"ï»¿The thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly is once again this year opening at a time of crisis. The international situation  politically  economically and socially  has never been so tense or so burdened with distress and even despair.274.	The planet earth will very soon have a population of 4 billion people. It is not yet full up but because of the selfishness shown by some and the unequal way in which the wealth of the world is distributed  the presence of 4 billion people will fill the earth to the point of overflowing. One does not have to be any sort of a birth-control expert to predict on the basis of this figure that  unless there is peace on earth  unless there is peace among peoples and nations  people run the risk of trampling on one another; the law of the jungle may well become the order of the day as the crowding begins to be ever more intrusive.275.	Peace on earth  peace between peoples and nations  peace in whose shade people can live in harmony and tranquillity  fully enjoying the happiness produced by their common labour: this should be the main concern of all mankind in this last quarter of the century.276.	The Federal Republic of Germany  the country of the President of the Assembly  surely best represents this desire for peace. War has never settled matters in this world  and Germany can bear witness to this fact before history since  having emerged from two murderous world wars  it resolutely engaged in the task of national construction with the help of all the ingenuity of an industrious  courageous and hard-working people. Germany has more than anyone else understood the benefits of peace and has understood the necessity of living in peace with its neighbours and making peace the corner-stone of all its policies  both national and international. The Federal Republic of Germany maintains no military expenditures for the sake of possessing a costly military potential. That has enabled it to be one of the few industrialized nations of the world to be free of economic caprice and stagnation. This is why it gives me pleasure  on behalf of the Togolese delegation  to congratulate its representative on his well-deserved election as President of the thirty-fifth session.277.	The experience of peace which colours the policies of his country and his exceptional qualities as a seasoned diplomat quite naturally fit him to assume with competence the high office with which the international Organization has just entrusted him. This is why we are convinced that under his enlightened presidency the work of the thirty-fifth session will proceed in an atmosphere of peace  dialogue and mutual understanding.278.	His predecessor  Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim of the United Republic of Tanzania  deserves all our admiration and all our congratulations  having borne the weighty responsibility of skilfully guiding not only the work of our regular thirty-fourth session  but also that of the sixth and seventh emergency special sessions  devoted respectively to Afghanistan and to Palestine  and of the eleventh special session  devoted to economic problems. We would like  once again  to reiterate to him our abiding sentiments of admiration for himself  for his country  Tanzania  and for his President  Mwalimu Julius K. Nyerere.279.	The year 1980 will have been a particularly eventful one for the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim. We have seen that his time has been divided among numerous activities  both at Headquarters and also on the responsible missions which in the performance of his duties he has had to accomplish in the four corners of the world in search of peace on earth and peace among peoples and nations.280.	The Togolese delegation  on behalf of the Government and people of Togo and on behalf of the founding President of the Togolese People's Assembly  the President of the Togolese Republic  General of the Army Gnassingbe Eyadema  would like once more to express to Mr. Kurt Waldheim the full support and admiration which we owe him and to convey to him all our congratulations.281.	This year once again our family has grown. The progress of mankind cannot be measured by the power of destructive bombs but by the freedom of men to live in peace on earth. Zimbabwe  by acceding to independence in a peaceful way  has proved that warsâall wars  whatever their natureâhave never in a definitive fashion been able to settle any problems. It is by seeking peace and agreement that solutions can be found to the great problems of our era. In acceding to independence amid tolerance and a respect for the multiracial complexity of its people  Zimbabwe has given us proof that racism and apartheid have been finally rejected by history. For this reason we salute the entry of independent Zimbabwe as the one hundred and fifty-third State Member of our Organization.282.	We salute the courage and determination of the people of Zimbabwe and the far-sightedness of its Prime Minister Robert Mugabe  and that of all the country's political leaders  who have been subtle and skilful enough to know that it is time to put an end to war by leading the people along the road to peace  concord and national construction. At the same time  we wish to congratulate Saint Vincent and the Grenadines on its admission as the one hundred and fifty-fourth State Member of our Organization.283.	The year now drawing to a close will have been one of turmoil and anxiety. At one time it was felt that the latent conflicts could be reabsorbed so that outbreaks of war might be avoided. Unfortunately  the frenzied arms race continues  the peace initiatives undertaken in the Middle East are flagging and the situation in Kampuchea may well once again involve the destabilization of the countries of South-East Asia. Imprisoned and obsessed by their selfishness  the rich countries  despite their apparent opulence  are living in a closed circuit. Africa  too  has not been spared the clash of arms  while everywhere appeals for peace among peoples and nations go almost unheard amid the deafening clamour and the din of the weapons of war. This year  once more  the African continent will have been the most sorely tried.284.	If  thanks to the universal jubilation which greeted peace in Zimbabwe  jubilation which sprang from the hearts of millions all over the world  the rebel regime of Ian Smith was finally driven out of history by a popular election  the situation in Namibia and in South Africa will continue to constitute a serious threat to world peace  with the wretched system of apartheid persisting in its insolent defiance of the whole of the international community.285.	In fact  while the Namibian people under the leadership of its vanguard  SWAPO  tirelessly pursues its struggle to free itself from the colonial domination of the racist regime of South Africa  the Pretoria authorities continue to violate the most elementary human rights in that part of the continent. Arbitrary arrests  the creation of puppet groups  the use of mercenaries against independent neighbouring countries and repeated attacks against the territorial integrity of Angola and Zambia  in particular  continue.286.	A recent commission of inquiry established by the OAU found that South Africa is using chemical weapons in its undeclared war in Namibia and the neighbouring countries  despite the fact that the use of such weapons has been unanimously condemned by the international community. Will peace-loving people continue for much longer to put up with this challenge by the racist Pretoria regime? It is the height of absurdity for States Members of our Organizationâand some of the most important onesâto give material assistance to South Africa to survive and pursue its policy of extermination in Namibia and its policy of provocation against the neighbouring States. It is high time that our Organization brought about peace in Namibia  with scrupulous respect for the territorial integrity of that country  of which Walvis Bay is an integral part.287.	It is high time that the international community ensured compliance by the States that continue to sell arms to South Africa and to offer South Africa the material  economic and financial possibilities of obtaining the most sophisticated weaponsâwhich it subsequently uses against the independence of peoplesâwith the relevant United Nations decisions  particularly the decision regarding an embargo  because the failure of those Member States to comply with these decisions is used by the racist Pretoria regime in its permanent challenge to mankind.288.	But peace on earth  peace among peoples and among men  means first and foremost the independence of peoples and their dignity  their survival in an atmosphere of security  their freedom and equality.289.	So far as the people of South Africa itself are concerned  the year that is now coming to an end has been a nightmare  with the apartheid systemâat bayâincreasing its methods of harassment and refining its methods of repression. The strikes of schoolchildren have been drowned in blood; the workers' movements for the eradication of discriminatory practices have been savagely repressed  the slightest request for social justice and equality has given rise to arbitrary arrests and arrogant intimidation. The black majority in South Africa is demanding nothing less than an end to the unjustified system of apartheid in order to make it possible for everyone to enjoy equally the immense wealth of the country. The racist minority  constantly challenging the international community  rejects these elementary demands  represses the black majority and directs its vindictiveness against the neighbouring States  whose only crime is to welcome the many refugees obliged to flee the inhuman kingdom of apartheid.290.	As we can see  this yearâwhether in Namibia or in South Africaâthe apartheid system continues its insolent policy and seeks to create all sorts of difficulties for the front-line countries. That is why the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU rightly decided at its sixteenth ordinary session  held at Monrovia in July 1979  to establish the Committee on Assistance to Front-line States  composed of 19 members.  My country was chosen as Chairman of that Committee; we view that as a sign of the confidence that Africa as a whole places in us. The international community must contribute to the efforts made within the framework of that OAU initiative  to make it possible for the many countries that are victims of apartheid to give even the most elementary shelter to the refugees  to make available to them the food  medicine and clothing they need and to help the authorities in the receiving countries to strengthen their economies so that they can build the necessary social and health infrastructures. Thus  the OAU was well inspired when  at the thirty-fifth ordinary session of its Council of Ministers  held at Freetown from 18 to 28 June 1980  it made an appeal for contributions by States. That OAU appeal must be heeded  in order to demonstrate universal solidarity with the victims of apartheid.291.	We should not be silent or hoard the actions that have been taken or that will be taken. On the contrary  people should be made aware of these actions so that they may provide a stimulus for international solidarity. That is why my country decided  in response to the OAU request  to pledge a voluntary contribution of $100 000 for the actions of solidarity to be undertaken in southern Africa. That is a token contributionâbut it is a token that is well worth the candle292.	On the African continent  the year now coming to a close has seen the dangerous persistence of certain conflict situations which at one time we believed had been overcome. I have in mind the situations in the Horn of Africa  in Chad and in Western Sahara.293.	Even in the Comoros  despite the reassuring statements by France and the Government of the Comoros  there has been a delay in the reintegration of the Comorian island of Mayotte into the Comorian State. We continue to hope that the two Governments will speed up their negotiations in order that this important question may be settled once and for all.294.	With regard to the Horn of Africa  the initiatives taken by the OAU to convene all the parties in order to try to find a peaceful solution are most welcome. The efforts made as a result of the meeting held at Lagos from 18 to 20 August should be followed up so that harmony and trust between the fraternal countries of Ethiopia and Somalia may be re-established.295.	In Chad  the hopes engendered by the Lagos agreement of 21 August 1979 have been rapidly dashed; scarcely five months after the formation of the transition Government of national unity  the dialogue of mortar shells replaced that of the negotiating table.296.	When we witness the tragedy in Chad  we realize that every sacrifice must be made to save a people on the point of dying. That is why independent Africa  in a final initiative  entrusted the President of the Togolese Republic with the task of carrying out  with his counterparts from Benin  Congo and Guinea  peace efforts to ensure the scrupulous application of the cease-fire  in the framework of the Lagos agreementsâfor only the implementation of those agreements will make it possible for buffer neutral African forces to be moved into place. Will the current initiatives  within the framework of action by the Sub-Committee  make it possible for us not to despair. The international community must  in any case  have confidence in the Sub-Committee set up by the OAU  in order to avoid a useless internationalization of the conflict in Chad  which can only lead to an aggravation of East-West tensions and thereby constitute a serious threat to peace on the African continent and throughout the world.297.	In the Western Sahara  the obstinate refusal of one of the parties to recognize the obvious truth is at the origin of a war whose consequences the Sahraoui people have been alone in bearing. The wise conclusions of the OAU Ad Hoc Committee on Western Sahara  reaffirmed at the meeting held at Freetown  from 9 to 12 September  are the only basis for an equitable solution of this problem. Meanwhile  the Frente POLISARIO  the sole representative of the Sahraoui people  continues to receive wide international recognition  thus providing a lesson to the adherence of an all-or-nothing philosophy. My Government  prompted by a spirit of justice and the desire to seek peace on earth among peoples and nations  long ago recognized the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic and decided to establish diplomatic relations with it at the ambassadorial level. In that way  my Government demonstrates that when one is faced with blinding evidence  even hesitation can be interpreted as complicity.298.	In the Middle East  the Camp David agreements have  during the past year  aroused hope in some and curiosity in others. Those agreements  born of the complexity of the Middle East problem  have particularly moved the Togolese Government and people  which have constantly manifested their passion for peace on earth  peace among peoples and nations. It is obvious that the peace process is not helped in any way by Israel's obstinacy in its occupation of the Arab territories  its obstinacy in transferring the capital of the Hebrew State to Jerusalem and imposing conditions incompatible with any honourable peace in the region.299.	While the State of Israel quite properly claims its right to exist in the region and its right to independence in the framework of a specific territory  it must recognize that others  and particularly the Palestinians and their authentic representative  the PLO  are equally entitled to an independent and sovereign State in that part of the world.300.	It is up to the international community to make Israel grasp these facts  so that it will accept tolerance as the rule of the game. The international community must help Israel to understand and accept this inviolable fact.301.	My Government  faithful to the principle of justice and peace on earth  and constantly striving to bring about equitable peace among peoples and nations  would like to reaffirmâwhile recognizing Israel's right to existâits constant support for the PLO  the sole authentic representative of the Palestinian people  as well as the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to independence and to a State whose territorial integrity must be guaranteed. At the same time  we call on the parties concerned to choose the path of dialogue  the path of agreement. For it is only negotiation that counts in the search for peace among peoples and nations. The thunder of arms  no matter how deafening  has never settled any problem.302.	In Asia  the increased militarization of South Korea continues to be a serious obstacle to the peaceful reunification and independence of Korea and may well prove a serious threat to peace. That is why we should continue to support the declaration of 4 July 1972 on prohibiting all foreign military Ibices in South Korea and the efforts to transform the armistice agreement into a final peace agreement.303.	In Kampuchea and Afghanistan the untimely interventions that have prevented the peoples of those countries from freely expressing their political choices are events that threaten to destabilize not only the countries concerned but also all the other countries in the sub region. Our Organization should reaffirm the immutable principle of non-intervention and non-interference in the internal affairs of each and every State.304.	As we can see  1980 has not been free from the political crises that shake the world. These political crises have been complicated by unparalleled economic crises. The increase in the price of petroleum has brought about an almost exponential increase in the price of the manufactured products which are part of the daily needs of the poorest people on earth. How can we speak of social peace when billions of deprived people are not able to have access to the goods produced by mankind? How can we speak of peace among peoples and nations when scarcely 300 million people control almost the entire wealth of the planet and  as in the jungle  impose their laws on practically 4 billion deprived and illiterate people? Today the most serious danger which threatens peace on earth is not demographic growth  but rather the unequal way in which the goods produced by mankind are distributed. As long as we fail to cheek malnutrition  illiteracy and other scourges  peace on earth and among peopled and nations will be a Utopian vision.305.	While children are dying of hunger every day throughout the developing world  we have the impression that the major Powers are delighting in squandering the resources of humanity by further perfecting weapons of extermination by launching bombs in the sky and under the earth as if they were amusing themselves with fireworks displays. This is the height of human absurdity. While the major Powers spend time continuing their interminable conferences on disarmament  it is they alone that manufacture arms and hold the key to disarmament. The height of absurdity is that those major Powers are demanding the backing of the poor countries in their eternal disarmament and security conferences. The orchestra stalls are being organ-zed to amuse the gallery. But the poor countries have no munitions factories; those factories are to be found in the rich countries. Instead of disarming  the latter are organizing the theatre of continual disarmament and other conferences to make mankind believe that they wish to do something  and it is again the poor countries that are being duped. The poor countries are using their meagre resources to participate in those interminable conferences organized by the wealthy countries on disarmament and other mattersâconferences in which we know that the dice have been loaded for a long time.306.	We have the impression that the wealthy countries are revelling in their egoism and  from on high  are looking down on the vast majority of mankind wallowing in malnutrition  sickness and illiteracy. Since they cannot count on the wealthy  the poor are attempting some initial steps in solidarity.307.	The second extraordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of OAUâthe first such session devoted to economic mattersâwas held in April 1980 at Lagos and the communal efforts undertaken by 16 States of West Africaâthe Economic Community of West African Statesâare part of those initiatives and are events that deserve words of encouragement from the international community.308.	This is the bleak reality of our time. This year again there is not much light to be discerned on the horizon; however we should not despair of life. To obtain peace it must be won  and that is something which demands patience and perseverance.309.	Togo  for its part  under the leadership of its President. General Gnassingbe Eyadema  has decided to follow  on the road to the winning of this peace on earth  this peace among peoples and nations  an open policy which respects the immutable principles of the non-use of force  the peaceful settlement of disputes  the independence of States  non-interference in the internal affairs of other States and good neighbourliness  a policy based on a constant search for peace  active participation in events taking place on the African continent and the establishment of a new  fairer and more humanistic international economic order. In connection with respect for human rights and the need for an equitable distribution of goods  on 31 October 1979  President Eyadcnia  when signing what are known as the ""LOME II"" ACP-EEC agreements between the African  Caribbean and Pacific Countries and the European Economic Community  said:""Indeed  at the end of the twentieth century  which has meant the rapid evolution of science and technology  more than hall the world's population is living with the spectre of hunger  sickness and death. This group of people is being denied its most elementary light  the right to live  although that right has been granted to animals which are afforded protection. Do human rights mean simply the right to die of hunger  ignorance and sickness? What does freedom mean when one can neither read nor write?""No. It is high time that we replaced the theoretical notion of human rightsâregarded as an option to do what is not prohibited  even if we are incapable of doing itâwith a concrete right to the minimum means of living.""To put it plainly  the peoples of the third world wish to have access on an equal footing to the wealth that nature has endowed the world with and to which they believe they are entitled. They wish to have access to the fruits of world development which they consider they have also been involved in.'310.	This elementary right can be provided only in peace and concord. That is why safeguarding peace at all costs is a fundamental objective of my Government's policy. Only peace on earth and among peoples and nations can create conditions to make possible the harmonious economic development of nations. Thus  by its realism  Togo's foreign policy in all its aspects is made fully available to the service of peace for development  divorced from unconditional alliances and from any false neutralism. Those are the minimum conditions for establishing peace on earth  peace among peoples and peace among nations."
"133",6776,"THA",35,1980,"ï»¿My delegation takes pleasure in extending to Mr. Riidiger von Wechmar its sincere congratulations on his unanimous election to the presidency of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. In the name of the delegation of Thailand  which is honoured to serve as one of the Vice-Presidents of this Assembly  I should like to express our gratification at having a worthy representative of a great country  the Federal Republic of Germany  with which Thailand entertains close and cordial relations  in the Chair to guide our deliberations. At this juncture in the life of our Organization  when we are confronted by many intractable issues with grave implications for world peace  it is reassuring indeed to have such an experienced person conduct our proceedings. The unprecedented number of items on our agenda this year is a clear manifestation of the confidence that this Assembly has in his fine qualities  diplomatic skill and proven stamina. My delegation has no doubt at all that this confidence is well placed.312.	The delegation of Thailand has the honour also to convey its deep and sincere appreciation to Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim  President of the thirty-fourth session  for his invaluable contribution to the work of our Organization during his tenure of office. Not only did he distinguish himself at Headquarters in an especially busy year for the General Assembly  but he also took the trouble to visit many countries  including Thailand  in order to acquaint himself with some of the difficult issues facing the United Nations. His service to the international community has earned for himself  his country and Africa the admiration and gratitude of Governments and peoples around the world.313.	On behalf of the Government and people of Thailand  my delegation wishes to offer its warm felicitations to the delegation of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines on being admitted to membership in the United Nations. The world Organization has thus gained its one hundred and fifty- fourth Member  through the process of decolonization which recently brought about also the admission of Zimbabwe. My delegation reiterates its cordial welcome to that African State  which is participating for the first time in a regular session of the General Assembly. The United Nations has every reason to be proud of its successes in the field of decolonization  especially on the eve of the twentieth anniversary of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. With the admission of each newly independent State to the United Nations family  the world Organization reaps the fruits of its long and arduous labour  and humanity is the true beneficiary.314.	Thailand looks forward to another milestone when Namibia gains its sovereignty and full independence  with territorial integrity as well as the integrity of its natural resources  and takes its rightful place in the family of nations.315.	It is therefore regrettable that the situation in Namibia continues to be a source of great concern to the world and a threat to international peace and security. Namibia remains occupied by South Africa  which is systematically plundering its natural resources  in defiance of United Nations resolutions. The process of negotiated settlement  in accordance with the proposal approved by the Security Council  has reached an impasse because of the intransigence and duplicity of the Pretoria regime.316.	Thailand  which has for many years imposed a trade embargo on goods from South Africa  strongly deplores the efforts of that regime to consolidate its illegal occupation of Namibia and to exploit Namibia's riches with the help of foreign multinationals. The world must continue to condemn such actions  and to bring every kind of pressure to bear on the Pretoria regime in order to ensure the exercise by the Namibian people without further delay of its right to self-determination. South Africa must end its prolonged obstruction of the settlement process  as endorsed by the Security Council in its resolution 435 (1978)  and cease its aggressive activities against the neighbouring African States. South Africa must adopt the measures necessary to reduce tension in the area  including the abolition of its abhorrent system of racial discrimination and apartheid and recognition of the legitimate rights of the majority of its population.317.	Unless and until the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the relevant United Nations resolutions are scrupulously observed by Pretoria  increasing violence and conflict will be the order of the day. Unless and until the shackles of colonialism in Namibia are broken and the Namibian people is enabled to determine its own destiny free from external interference  subversion and coercion  the prospects for peace and stability in the region of southern Africa will not be bright. The time is now approaching when the world Organization must be prepared to tell Pretoria to comply with the Charter obligations  or else. The alternative would be continued defiance of the world Organization and prolonged obstruction of a peaceful settlement by South Africa  leading inexorably to a general conflagration in that part of the world.318.	Coming from a region of the world which is also beset by a serious threat to world peace arising from illegal foreign occupation and denial of a people's rights to self- determination and to return to its homeland  my delegation fully appreciates the plight of the Palestinian people. Not only must they be given urgent humanitarian assistance  but their inalienable rights must be assured  including their right to self-determination  national independence and to return to their homes and property. At the same time as the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people are recognized  including the right to statehood  the legitimate rights of the State of Israel to exist within secure and recognized boundaries must also be safeguarded. For its part  Israel must withdraw its presence from all Arab territories occupied since the 1967 war  rescind all unilateral acts pertaining to the occupied territories and in violation of the relevant United Nations resolutions and international law  and refrain from such acts in the future. Only with recognition of each other's legitimate rights can the Israeli and Palestinian peoples peacefully coexist and a just and lasting settlement become a reality in the Middle East. It is also essential to the free exercise by the Palestinians of their right to self- determination that all Israeli forces be withdrawn from the occupied territories and that the PLO  which is recognized by the General Assembly as the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  be given the appropriate role to which it is entitled in all Middle East peace negotiations.319.	My delegation regrets the unilateral action of Israel in annexing the eastern part of Jerusalem and proclaiming the city its capital. Israel's illegal action was taken almost immediately after the conclusion of the seventh emergency special session of the General Assembly on the question of Palestine  despite the unanimous pronounced opposition of the world body to the pending move. If there were any need for further evidence of world opinion  the subsequent meeting of the Security Council and its outcome should provide adequate proof on that score.320.	As the 15 November deadline for compliance by Israel with the emergency special session's resolution ES- 7/2 draws nearer with each passing day  my delegation hopes and prays that reason will light the way around many dark and perilous corners and that a turning point will emerge so that we may be led out of the present impasse.321.	The protracted crisis in Lebanon constitutes another tragedy that has struck the Middle East. All parties should henceforth refrain from interfering in the internal affairs of that violence-torn country and cease their warlike actions which have left the once prosperous land in utter ruin. My delegation hopes that a peaceful solution can be found to extricate it from the vicious circle of bloodshed and destruction.322.	Now a new crisis has appeared with the eruption of the fighting between Iran and Iraq. My delegation shares the hope that resolution 479 (1980)  unanimously adopted by the Security Council and calling for an immediate cease-fire  will be implemented  and together with the efforts of the Islamic Conference and with the co-operation and support of other countries  especially the major Powers  we shall succeed in ending the armed conflict between the two neighbouring and fellow Islamic States.323.	I now turn to South-East Asia. The situation in Kampuchea  which is not just a regional but a world problem  rightly remains one of the General Assembly's major preoccupations. This Assembly last year by an overwhelming majority adopted resolution 34/22  calling  inter alia  for a cessation of hostilities  the withdrawal of foreign forces and the free exercise of the right to self-determination by the Kampuchean people. That resolution has  regrettably  been rejected by the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and thus Kampuchea continues to be occupied by foreign forces.Moreover  in its campaign to legitimize its invasion and occupation of Kampuchea  Viet Nam has sought to draw attention away from the situation in Kampuchea  and to focus it on the situation on the Thai-Kampuchean border. At the same time  to lend credibility to this manoeuvre  Vietnamese forces in Kampuchea have stepped up their activities along the border and are also committing more frequent violations of Thailand's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The most blatant example occurred from 23 to 24 June 1980  when large units of Vietnamese forces staged well-co-ordinated attacks on two villages inside Thailand  as well as on refugee encampments along the border  causing many casualties among Thai defence forces  innocent villagers and Kampuchean refugees. The armed incursions also caused a total disruption of the international relief and cross-border feeding operations  which have helped to keep alive hundreds of thousands of Kampuchean civilians. The attackers were finally repulsed  leaving behind them over 70 bodies as well as seven of their comrades who were captured by Thai defence forces. Scores of weapons left by the invaders also offer irrefutable evidence of their hasty retreat. In the perpetration of such violations of Thailand's sovereignty  despite repeated promises to the contrary by Vietnamese leaders  their aims appear to be clear: they are to intimidate Thailand and its partners in ASEAN  force them to accept the situation in Kampuchea and compel the international agencies to recognize the Phnom Penh regime as the only channel for relief aid.324.	The ASEAN Foreign Ministers  at their meeting at Kuala Lumpur on 25 and 26 June 1980 rejected the various arguments which had been advanced to justify the continued occupation of Kampuchea and to accord recognition to the regime established in Phnom Penh by Vietnamese forces. The Foreign Ministers reiterated their stand that no regime set up by occupying foreign forces  howsoever it may be given the appearance of legitimacy  can satisfy the principles enunciated in the Charter of the United Nations. It is for this reason that my delegation and the other ASEAN delegations  together with the great majority of Member States of the United Nations  continue to support the credentials of Democratic Kampuchea at the United Nations. We strongly urge this Assembly to support the continued seating of Democratic Kampuchea at the Organization.325.	It is and will always be in Thailand's interest to work and continue to search for peace. Successive Thai Governments during the past decade have devoted the nation's resources and energy to economic and social development. Gains have been impressive by most standards and Thailand actively seeks regional stability to promote further progress. To attain that goal  peace is a prerequisite.326.	In this connection  Thailand welcomed the personal efforts of the Secretary-General and his visit to the region  undertaken in circumstances of considerable difficulty last July. The Secretary-General's initiative demonstrates his dedicated effort and his readiness to work on behalf of the world Organization for peace. His visit brought about a welcome reduction of tension in the area and enabled cross- border feeding operations to resume  thus ensuring the increased supply of food and rice seed for over 1 million Kampucheans in western Kampuchea. Thailand itself received the Foreign Minister of Viet Nam in May 1980 and remains prepared to continue a constructive dialogue here in New York or elsewhere.327.	On the humanitarian side  in response to the plight of the Khmer people  ravaged by hunger and disease  Thailand over the past year has co-operated closely with the Secretary-General  United Nations agencies  the International Committee of the Red Cross and non-governmental organizations. It has  without discrimination  facilitated the provision and transport of assistance through the border  as well as via Kompong  Som and Phnom Penh. Thailand led the call for a major humanitarian conference  held at Geneva in May this year  to seek additional support for the international relief programmes. The Government and people of Thailand are proud to play a role in providing needed facilities for both components of the international assistance programme  namely  cross-border and direct distribution  by virtue of Thailand's geographical location and humane policy. These two factors have  in turn  created for Thailand the enormous burden of caring for over 300 000 Indo-Chinese refugees and displaced persons  as well as coping with the problem of over 200 000 Thai villagers who have been displaced by the massive influx from the neighbouring countries.328.	Thanks to the contributions of donor countries as well as to the efforts by the United Nations and its Secretary- General  the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other organizations concerned  this burden has to some significant extent been alleviated. Nevertheless  the situation involves both short-term and long- term risks for the security and well-being of Thailand. Therefore  it has been and continues to be my Government's intention to lighten the burden by all available means  in keeping with the generally recognized humanitarian principles and the inalienable right of people to return safely to their homeland. Consequently  when the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees sought the co-operation of the Royal Thai Government in a voluntary repatriation programme for Kampuchean refugees in Thailand  such co-operation was readily extended. Viet Nam seized upon that as a pretext for launching armed attacks on Thailand on 23 and 24 June 1980  claiming that the resistance forces in Kampuchea were being supplied again under the cover of this international programme. However  with regard to over 100 000 people of Kampuchean origin who were repatriated from Viet Nam in the early part of last year  such a right was recognized and exercised. It has been subsequently alleged that the majority of them were not Kampucheans at all but of Vietnamese origin and were resettled in Kampuchea for the purpose of effecting a demographic change favourable to the occupying forces. Moreover  in the press release issued on 26 June 1980 by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees simultaneously here and at Geneva  it was clearly stated that:""In order to ensure that the voluntary character of their return was respected  and in conformity with the humanitarian mandate of the High Commissioner  the Royal Thai Government agreed that UNHCR would monitor the voluntary character of the repatriation.""The agreement... includes that movements would be observed at every stage by all those interested  including voluntary agencies and media representatives.""329.	As a result of that agreement  the repatriation movement commenced on 17 June 1980 and was disrupted by Vietnamese military actions on 23 and 24 June 1980. Altogether  fewer than 10 000 Kampucheans  the majority women and children  were repatriated under the programme.330.	In its quest for peace  Thailand looks to this session of the General Assembly for further constructive action. The invasion and occupation of one country by the military forces of another is a problem for the world community. The sovereignty and independence of Kampuchea and the people's right to self-determination are principles that must be upheld by the world community. It is essential for small nations like Thailand to adhere to these principles for their own survival and for world peace.331.	Thailand does not insist that the problems of Kampuchea  Indo-Chinese refugees or humanitarian relief be settled on the basis of the view of any one nation. It can accommodate the legitimate interests of others. It believes that true and lasting solutions to problems of such import can be achieved only when supported by the world community acting in keeping with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. A solution based on the dictated terms of one country by virtue of its illegal occupation of another is no solution  because it would carry forward the seeds of tension and future conflict.332.	Mindful of the mandate of the thirty-fourth session  Thailand has consulted with a wide range of Member States to develop further proposals on Kampuchea for the Assembly's consideration. We have sought to broaden the avenues that could lead to peace in South-East Asia. A comprehensive  constructive and flexible draft resolution has been submitted to the General Assembly.333.	Recognizing the urgent need to defuse tensions in the region of South-East Asia  Thailand and its partners of ASEAN  taking into account General Assembly resolution 34/22  have proposed the convening of an international conference on Kampuchea in early 1981 with the participation of all parties concerned to negotiate a peaceful settlement of the present conflict in Kampuchea  with a view to reaching an agreement on  inter alia: first  total withdrawal of foreign troops from Kampuchea within a specific time frame to be verified by the United Nations; secondly  measures by the United Nations to ensure law and order and the observance of the fundamental principles of human rights in Kampuchea; thirdly  measures by the United Nations to ensure non-interference by outside Powers in the internal affairs of Kampuchea; fourthly  United Nations-supervised free elections in Kampuchea; fifthly  guarantees against the introduction of any foreign forces in Kampuchea; sixthly  guarantees of respect for the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of Kampuchea; and  seventhly  guarantees that an independent and sovereign Kampuchea will not be a threat to its neighbours.334.	Pending a settlement  humanitarian relief to the civilian population of Kampuchea  including those who have sought refuge in Thailand  should be continued and every effort made to ensure that such assistance will reach those for whom it is intended on a non-discriminatory basis. To facilitate this humanitarian endeavour  a United Nations observer team should be stationed on the Thai side of the border in order to monitor the situation along the border and verify that only civilian Kampucheans obtain international relief aid. In this respect also  safe areas should be established under United Nations supervision in western Kampuchea for the uprooted civilian Kampucheans encamped near the border and those in Thailand who wish to return to their homeland.335.	In the effort to bring the Kampuchean conflict in all its aspects to the conference table  the Thai delegation joins with the other delegations of ASEAN in reaffirming its commitment to the Charter of the United Nations  the relevant United Nations resolutions  including General Assembly resolution 34/22  the joint statement of ASEAN and the European Economic Community on political issues  as well as in endorsing the final communique  issued on 8 September  of the New Delhi meeting of the heads of Government of the Asian and Pacific States members of the Commonwealth. At the latter meeting  the heads of Government expressed their conviction that to bring about durable peace and stability in South-East Asia there was an urgent need for a comprehensive political solution to the Kampuchean problem which would ensure the sovereignty  independence and neutrality of Kampuchea  as well as for the withdrawal of foreign forces from that country.336.	My Government also shares the conviction of the heads of Government of the Asian Commonwealth members that a comprehensive political solution to the Kampuchean question would contribute to the establishment of a zone of peace  freedom and neutrality in Southeast Asia  which would  in turn  contribute to the development of peaceful  friendly and harmonious relations in the region. By the same token  my delegation wishes to voice its support for the aim of small countries to promote a zone of peace which would ensure non-interference by external Powers in their internal affairs and the preservation from foreign encroachment of their sovereign independence and territorial integrity. Such a concept is indeed similar to the ASEAN proposal on the establishment of a zone of peace  freedom and neutrality in South-East Asia  consisting of sovereign and independent States willing to co-operate with each other on the basis of equality and mutual interest.337.	In this connection  the ""Question of peace  stability and co-operation in South-East Asia"" appears on the agenda of this Assembly session. My delegation was able to join in the consensus for its inscription at the request of its sponsors  including the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  because we believe that peace  stability and co-operation remain our firm goals for the welfare of our region. Indeed  to bring about durable peace and stability  and to enhance constructive co-operation in South-East Asia  the conflict in Kampuchea must be settled by peaceful means. That is why my delegation joins with others in proposing an international conference to negotiate such a settlement. So long as the Kampuchean problem remains unsolved  it will continue to disturb the tranquillity which is necessary for regional peace  to destabilize the region and to impede the growth of mutual trust and confidence which is indispensable for regional co-operation. Nevertheless  my delegation is prepared to participate in the forthcoming debate on this new item in a constructive and realistic manner.338.	Thailand does not seek hostility with Viet Nam. Unfortunately  Viet Nam has not shown the slightest interest in Khmer self-determination or in reconciling the views of all parties on the Kampuchean question. It has repeatedly disregarded the will of the international community. I call once again upon Viet Nam to begin to pay heed to the desires of the international community and engage in a constructive search for a solution to the Kampuchean problem.339.	The Kampuchean issue directly involves fundamental principles of the United Nations. I urge all Member States to assist in promoting a political solution based on United Nations principles and not on the rule of force.340.	Aggression against- and the occupation of Afghanistan by Soviet troops have clearly shocked the world. The international community was subsequently disappointed by the deplorable intransigence and continued refusal of the USSR to remove its troops back to its own territory. Continued foreign occupation of Afghanistan and ruthless suppression of Afghan patriots have created similar political and humanitarian problems for neighbouring countries and have caused the people of Afghanistan untold suffering and hardship. General Assembly resolution ES-6/2  which calls for the immediate  unconditional and total withdrawal of the foreign troops from Afghanistan and for the Afghan people to decide their own political future without outside interference  coercion or intimidation  remains  by and large  unimplemented. The efforts of the Islamic Conference to seek t comprehensive solution to the crisis have proved to be of no avail. The situation is fraught with the gravest dangers to international peace and stability  and the plight of the Afghan refugees will be aggravated by the approaching cold weather. My delegation has therefore joined with other delegations in the request for the inscription of this item on the agenda of this session. In so doing  my delegation reaffirms its unstinting support for resolution ES-6/2 and for the efforts of the Islamic Conference to bring about a peaceful settlement of the conflict in keeping with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.341.	It is noteworthy that the common denominator in the two situationsâin Afghanistan and Kampucheaâis the imposition of their will on small  independent and non- aligned States by foreign Powers through the use of force in contravention of the Charter of the United Nations and international law. Both situations have also threatened to escalate and have destabilized areas far beyond their local confines. The preservation of Afghanistan and of the right of the Afghans to self-determination  just as in the case of Kampuchea  are international problems which rightly belong to the world community.342.	While the rule of law has suffered setbacks during the past year with the situations in Kampuchea and Afghanistan  the successful conclusion of the ninth session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea appears as a bright spot in man's quest for peaceful and orderly change. Although the Conference has not reached the goal of a convention by the end of this year  my delegation sincerely hopes that its objective will be attained at the session to be convened in New York in March 1981. We are convinced that the new law of the sea has to provide the best possible assurance  in the light of the divergent interests of so many States  that stability and order will prevail in the use and management of ocean and sea-bed resources  which will bring enormous benefit for all mankind and promote  in particular  the economic development and growth of the poorer countries. It is significant and encouraging to note that  despite the divergences  a consensus on the myriad complex issues will soon emerge.343.	The developing countries of the world pinned similar hopes on the eleventh special session of the General Assembly. Consequently they were deeply disappointed at the lack of consensus  due to the intransigent few  on the procedures to be followed in the global round of negotiations on international economic co-operation for development  due to begin in January 1981.344.	The eleventh special session  convened after long preparations dating back to the thirty-second session  afforded Governments an opportunity jointly to assess if any progress had been made towards the establishment of a new international economic order. While all delegations came to the same conclusionâthat the progress  if any  had been either inadequate or largely negligibleâprescriptions as to how to proceed further still varied.345.	The delegation of Thailand  which took an active part in that session  truly regrets the failure of the Assembly to accomplish the objectives of the tasks entrusted to it. Nearly three full weeks were virtually wasted in efforts to work out an agreed procedure for the global negotiations which  needless to say  is not as important as what will go into the agenda itself. This  the agenda  was not touched on. And when  finally  a fairly reasonable and balanced procedural framework was put forward and accepted by the overwhelming majority of the Assembly  a mere handful of the developed countries refused to join the consensus  thus making failure of the entire session inevitable.346.	It is much against the wish of my delegation to clutter up the economic agenda of this session with matters which ought to have been resolved before it began  but I reaffirm the readiness of my country to contribute constructively to the resolution of all outstanding issues so that the global negotiations can be commenced in January 1981 as originally intended by all participants. Failure to do that would have far-reaching consequences. One of these would be the loss of the already diminishing opportunities for a sustained and constructive dialogue on the global level between developed and developing countries. I need not elaborate further on what this loss will mean in the present international setting  so fraught with tensions and insecurity all over the world.347.	The stark realities of the present-day world  with an ever-increasing number of countries joining the international community  more and more people to care for and the gap between the rich and the poor ever widening  are the causes of changes which are inevitable in themselves. Such changes carry a momentum of their own. Left to their devices  they can produce effects which are unpredictable. The Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order perceived as a means to give orderly and meaningful effect to such changes through a comprehensive and integrated approach  thereby attempting to ward off the adverse consequences which disorderly changes would bring. In this connection  my delegation is gratified to note that a consensus was reached on the text of the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade and hopes that the Strategy will be adopted at this session and implemented as of 1 January 1981.348.	With so many weighty political and economic issues facing the world  the only sensible choice before us is to strive towards the achievement of a restructured international society in which rationality  equity  equal partnership and commonality of interests constitute the guiding principles  and in which the world must be looked at as one. The United Nations  with the support of its membership  can assist us by providing the framework and the forum for the attainment of these objectives. However  the Member States themselves must first make the choice and transform it into a commitment. Can they look beyond narrow national interests to the challenging years ahead with a devoted sense of community  while upholding individual freedoms and the dignity of man?349.	This is the question before us as we enter the new decade of the 1980s  and it is similar to the question that faced the founding fathers of our Organization 35 years ago. We must therefore renew our determination to pursue more vigorously our noble aims and objectives  in the interest of peace and progress for all mankind."
"134",6893,"TTO",35,1980,"ï»¿I should like  first of all  to extend to Ambassador von Wechmar  on behalf of the Government and people of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago and on my own behalf  sincere congratulations and best wishes on his election to the presidency of this Assembly. His task is no easy one  for at this time the international community is faced with a number of extremely serious problems. My delegation is sure  however  that his diplomatic skill and understanding will greatly assist in guiding us in our search for solutions to those myriad problems 79.	I should also like at this time to express my profound gratitude to the outgoing President for the able manner in which he conducted the deliberations of not only the regular session of the Assembly but also the three special sessions during the year in which he held office. His patience and tact did much to ensure the best results in very difficult circumstances.80.	My delegation wishes to pay a tribute to the Secretary- General and his staff for their tireless efforts in the pursuit of peace and harmony among the nations of the international community. Through you  Sir  I should like to pledge the support of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago for his continuing efforts in that direction.81.	In closing these words of greeting  I warmly welcome Zimbabwe to its first regular session of the General Assembly  and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  the newest entrant to this family. The accession to membership of those two States has been the source of immense satisfaction to the Government of Trinidad and Tobago; in the one case because we have watched the struggle of the people of Zimbabwe  a struggle for freedom and justice  and have seen history record the triumph of the principle of self- determination over oppression and have seen the tragic loss of lives of citizens of Zimbabwe in the struggle vindicated; in the other  because Saint Vincent is a sister Caribbean country  with which the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago has close historical links  which we are confident will continue and be strengthened  as much through our regional integration movement as through our participation in this Organization and its agencies.82.	In that connection  there must and can be no further delay in the achievement of independence by the people of Belize. For too long have the aspirations of the people of Belize to self-determination and independence been obstructed by threats to the territorial integrity of their country. We  repeat that the administering Power and all those nations with a real capability to do so should take the measures within their competence to guarantee by all credible means strict respect for the territorial integrity of an independent Belize  so that that Caribbean country can take its rightful place among the family of nations at the thirty- sixth session of the General Assembly.83.	I indicated that the task of the President in presiding over the current session will not be an easy one  That is so because this Assembly is taking place at a time when nations are demonstrating more than ever before their inability to learn from the lessons of history. It is curious that the greatest tragedies of mankind  wars for colonial domination and world wars  tend to be regarded as the great landmarks of history. In our view  evidence of man's creative genius should truly be history's great landmarks. We have witnessed the extent of man's creative genius in changing swords into ploughsharesâin creating this body after destruction  as a means of ensuring greater co-operation among sovereign nation States. In the affairs of nations  necessity is the progenitor of creativity. The scourge of war  like the scourge of pestilence and disease  has therefore impelled man in his own self-interest to co-operate with his fellow man.84.	Members will forgive me if I say that the perception of my delegation is that we are standing on the brink of a crisis of unprecedented proportions. The fact is that in the face of this crisis we are squandering resources  squandering lives  squandering goodwill  and most distressing of all  squandering the opportunities that now exist: opportunities to build  to construct and to co-operate and so forestall the crisis or at least minimize its proportions.85.	Undoubtedly there exists a positive correlation between periods of progress  in the sense of social  economic and technological advancement  and periods of cooperation between nations. Such an analysis can only serve to underline the imperative need for universal solidarity in this decade and beyond. The United Nations provides a forum for such co-operation.86.	What is the present level of economic development in the third world? It is characterized by malnutrition  high unemployment  absence of safe water supplies  poor housing  high levels of illiteracy  short life expectancy: in short  an absence of most of the basic needs for survival. Such tangible evidence of suffering constitutes cold economic indicators which tell their own story.87.	Protectionist measures in developed countries have increased; the terms of trade of developing countries in general have deteriorated; official development assistance by developed countries as a percentage of GNP has declined; the economies of third world countries have become characterized by slow growth rates  high inflation  vast current account deficits and external debts that have reached alarming proportions. Yet the just call by the developing countries for a fundamental change in the existing world economic orderâa prerequisite for progress in the field of international economic co-operationâhas elicited increasingly negative responses from the developed nations.88.	Even the most optimistic among us will accept that the recently concluded eleventh special session of the General Assembly has failed. The two principal items on the agenda of that special session  first  the preparation of a new International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decadeâthe 1980sâand  secondly  agreement on procedure and the drawing up of an agenda for the launching of a new round of global negotiations on international economic co-operation  have dominated the attention of delegations in New York since the end of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly. These important issues have been the central preoccupation of third world countries over the past year. The failure of the eleventh special session is therefore a source of major distress  representing as it does the latest manifestation of the extreme reluctance of the developed countries to meet the justifiable requests of the developing world for restructuring the existing iniquitous system of international economic relations. My delegation laments that another opportunity has been squandered.89.	Another chapter in the long list of failures: the fifth session of UNCTAD  the United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development  held at Vienna  the Third General Conference of UNIDO  and the work of the Committee of the Whole  In addition  there has been the signal failure on the part of some developed countries to adhere to principles recognized by the overwhelming majority of the international community as being necessary to safeguard the common heritage of mankind.90.	It is the view of my delegation that a most fundamental contribution which can be made in this Organization towards satisfying the need for human solidarity in the 1980s and beyond lies in the opportunity to make available the benefits of scientific technological advance to developing countries on terms that will bridge rather than widen the gap between the industrialized North and the developing South.91.	On 6 May 1980  the third session of the United Nations Conference on an International Code of Conduct on the Transfer of Technology ended in failure  leaving unresolved the major outstanding issues. The Conference failed because many of its participants were not prepared to exercise the ""political will and flexibility"" which the General Assembly had urged on Member States in resolution 34/195. The major issues remained unresolved because those who could contribute to their solution have  in concert with the trans- nationals registered under their jurisdiction  refused to do so. Over three sessions of the Conference  the interests of transnationals have been supported and defended by those countries which continue to ignore and defy the will and interest of those many members of the international community. We all nevertheless recognize that the transfer and acquisition of technology on just and equitable terms are basic to the achievement of the New International Economic Order.92.	It is not only in the area of a code of conduct for the transfer of technology that the interests of transnationals have been obdurately advanced by those who support them. The entire panorama of their operations continues to reveal an over-all insensitivity to the interests and demands of the weaker and poorer peoples of the world. Indeed  at times  their operations threaten to consume not only the small States on which they feed  but also to destroy the real interest and goodwill of the States that offer them parental protection. Some of these transnationals continue to refuse to deal with small States whose sovereign resources they exploit. They continue to manipulate markets solely in their own interests. They stubbornly resist any change in their unacceptable traditional commercial practices and they refuse to respond to all initiatives which would restructure the existing pattern of international scientific and technological relations. All this  together with their absence of commitment to the over-all interest of the poorer countries  has tended to thwart the developmental objectives of third- world countries and  moreover  sometimes to subvert the course of justice.93.	The poorer and weaker countries of the world must resist this and seek together to devise mechanisms to eradicate the bases of these practices. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago is convinced of the positive and practical role that science and technology can and must play today if there are to be any better prospects for change in the international economic situation.94.	The Government of Trinidad and Tobago will continue to participate in every forum in which these issues are raised and will contribute in every way it can to redressing the existing imbalances  many of which derive from the traditional operations of transnationals. The Government shares the view of those countries of the Group of 77 that believe that legislation should be enacted on the national level in respect of the transfer of technology as one measure in the struggle to achieve a balanced and independent relationship with transnationals and those whose ultimate interests they serve. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago is in fact considering such legislative measures at this very moment.95.	The failure to make progress in this area is most significant because outdated and inappropriate technology in developing countries will continue to frustrate efforts at development even if rapid changes are effected in the three other important areas identified for the establishment of the New International Economic Order.96.	Those three major areas are themselves interdependent and closely related. First  it is necessary to have a comprehensive reform of the framework governing international trade so as to ensure that it facilitates and promotes the restructuring of the international division of labour in line with the growing industrial potential of developing countries and the shift in the comparative advantage of industry towards them. Here I need only mention the failure of the fifth session of UNCTAD and draw attention to the frustrations experienced by the developing countries on the Trade and Development Board when seeking to implement some of the resolutions adopted at Manila last year.97.	The second major area that has been identified for reform concerns the international monetary and financial system  in which there is urgent need for the evolution of a new global monetary and financial framework that is fully responsive to the needs of the developing world  In this regard the South-North Conference on the International Monetary System and the New International Order  which was held at Arusha from 30 June to 3 July of this year  provided an opportunity for both the North and the South to consider proposals for a radical restructuring of the international monetary system so as to secure more equitable participation by all States members of the international community and to support programmes of development and transformation in the third world 98.	My delegation is fully aware that fundamental transformation can take place only over a period of time  given the spirit of co-operation between the industrial countries and the third world. It is for that reason that my delegation lends its support to the urgent transitional measures within the framework of IMF which were suggested for immediate implementation pending the building of a new monetary order.99.	First  IMF should be equipped and prepared to finance third world deficits that are the result of serious and disciplined efforts at development and structural change. The conditions attached to such financing must reflect the sovereign right of States to choose their own social and economic models and developmental paths.100.	Secondly  access to a higher credit charge of IMF should be guided by unambiguous recognition that a large part of the third world deficits is due to factors for which third world countries are not responsible and over which they have no control.101.	Thirdly  the compensatory financing facility of IMF should be expanded  with low conditionality  to deal with external shock deficits of the third world. The facility should be related to the size of the externally induced deficit and not to the quota of a country in IMF.102.	Fourthly  the special drawing rights of IMF should be made the principal reserve asset  and the role of national currencies in international settlements should be effectively reduced. Finally  a mechanism of appeal and international arbitration independent of IMF should be set up to deal with disputes between the Fund and member countries seeking access to such funds.103.	The third major area in which change is needed is the field of economic co-operation among developing countries  based on the principle of collective self-reliance  which should constitute a dynamic and vital component of an effective global strategy.104.	Resolution 127 (V)  which was adopted by UNCTAD at Manila on 3 June 1979  urged the developed countries and the international organizations to""provide appropriate support and assistance to the process and activities of economic co-operation among developing countries  notably in fulfilment of the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and of UNCTAD  bearing in mind the Arusha Action Plan	"" 105.	Another opportunity has been lost since the assistance and support measures requested were not forthcoming from the developed countries when the developing countries introduced draft resolution TD/B/C.7/L.9  calling for those support measures  That leads me seriously to question whether developed countries support the principles and goals of economic co-operation among developing countries.106.	To deny assistance to and withhold benefits from countries which find themselves in dire need is one thing  but to take unilateral action based on totally spurious grounds in such a way as to deprive countries of their shared patrimony represents a level of violation of the rights of nations and peoples that is totally unacceptable. Yet that is the direction which international political affairs seem to have taken over the past year or so.107.	In respect of the law of the sea  my delegation is hopeful that the final working session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  in 1981  will find the industrialized countries demonstrating a spirit of compromise and accommodation  as did the Group of 77 at the session concluded recently. My delegation wishes  however  to express its deep regret that  notwithstanding the spirit of goodwill and understanding shown by the majority  one or two Governments have found it necessary to act in such a way as to abridge the rights of all mankind by purporting to authorize their nationals to explore and exploit the riches of the deep sea-bed outside any generally accepted international legal framework.108.	The Government of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago wishes to give notice that it considers the enactment of such unilateral legislation to be inadmissible under existing international law since it is a derogation of a peremptory norm of international lawânamely  that the sea-bed and the ocean floor beyond national jurisdiction are the common heritage of mankind. The Government of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago herewith registers in the strongest possible terms its protest at such enactments and declares that it does not recognize the competence of any one to exercise rights over the areas of the sea-bed on the basis of so-called traditional freedom of the high seas.109.	My delegation notes that the lessons of history have not been learnt. Individual acts of aggression the consequences of which  in terms of human suffering  were known  have been prosecuted in complete disregard of that suffering.110.	In the Middle East  the international community has witnessed the absence of any meaningful progress towards realizing the inalienable and imprescriptible right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and national independence. Recent events demonstrate a degree of intransigence and an unwillingness to recognize that fulfilment of the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian Arab people is central to the achievement of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East. My delegation reaffirms its firm support for the Security Council resolutions that have laid down an internationally acceptable framework for a just and honourable settlement and urges all parties to the conflict to resolve through peaceful means this issue which constitutes a threat to the peace and stability of the world and to accept the fact that the Palestine Liberation Organization must also have a role in any meaningful negotiations.111.	At this very moment and in defiance of the world community  in defiance of the relevant decisions and resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly and  moreover  in defiance of the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on Namibia   the racist regime of South Africa still maintains its illegal stranglehold on Namibia. We join the progressive forces of the world in intensifying our continuing efforts not only to ensure that Namibia is freed of the South African yoke but also to hasten the day of freedom itself for the majority of the people of South Africa. The evil of apartheid must be exorcised.112.	The international community and its constituent members  if they are to avoid a totally unmanageable and uncontrollable international situation with the attendant breakdown of those values on which international relations were founded  must look beyond the narrow and constricting confines of the all-consuming national interest  and seek to take in concert such action as will realize the broader demands of all peoples to live in peace with their neighbours  assured of their security from external aggression and confident that respect for their sovereignty  political independence and territorial integrity is genuinely safeguarded. Such are the responsibilities we all share  and such is the respect for internationally accepted principles which must be observed if this imperative need for human solidarity in the 1980s and beyond is ever to be realized.113.	Trinidad and Tobago has resisted all promptings from within its own national boundaries and from outside to interfere in the domestic affairs of other States. This does not mean  however  that Trinidad and Tobago is not mindful of the need to co-operate to the extent of its capabilities with its friends and neighbours  while at the same time guarding jealously its own sovereign independence.114.	Trinidad and Tobago  as a small developing country  dependent on limited reserves of a non-renewable source of energyâpetroleum and natural gasâhas sought to find ways and means through which the advantages that positively accrue to the people of Trinidad and Tobago as a result of the current favourable international market conditions for those resources can be shared in a beneficial way with the peoples in the Caribbean sub region. I say without any suggestion of self-congratulation that the effort which the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago makes in this regard in terms of the size of its economy and in the current absence of resource security  far exceeds the contributions being made by many industrialized countries which have pledged to commit 0.7 per cent of their gross national product as official development assistance and have consistently failed to attain this modest mark. When one considers that these same industrialized countries are pursuing proposals to coerce small developing countries like Trinidad and Tobago to accept ever-increasing burdens for the receipt of UNDP assistance through the adoption of new criteria for allocating indicative planning figures  in order to decrease their own already  in some cases  diminishing contributions  one questions whether the industrialized countries are really serious about making any meaningful contribution to third world countries.115.	I should like to emphasize here that my delegation strongly rejects these attempts and would hope that others would join with us in reiterating the universality of the UNDP programme and in opposing any cut-off point for such assistance.116.	Trinidad and Tobago has created an oil facility which is available to countries in the region that have been our traditional trading partners. This facility provides for the financing of the incremental cost of petroleum products  fertilizers and asphalt to States members of CARICOM  The financing of the incremental cost is applicable only where the products are supplied from Trinidad and Tobago and market prices as of 1 January 1979 are used as the base prices against which the incremental cost will be estimated  The facility  which became effective on 1 January 1980  is geared towards ameliorating balance of payments difficulties in the immediate future in the CARICOM countries by reducing the amount of foreign exchange to be disbursed in payment for petroleum products. To this end  the terms of the loan assistance are structured so as to maximize the net transfer of foreign exchange in the near term and  at the same time  to keep maximum debt repayment at a level which the beneficiary countries can be reasonably expected to service with the growth of their economies over the medium and longer term. A maturity of 15 years  therefore  has been proposed for the repayment of loans with grace periods of three years at an interest rate of 3 per cent in the case of the more developed countries of CARICOM  and in the case of the less developed countries of CARICOM at an annual interest rate of 2 per cent  with interest capitalized during the grace period in all cases.117.	Under the facility  financial assistance will be of a purely programme type and in this way it is expected that the speed and magnitude of the resource transfer will not be hindered by project preparation capability which is a major restraint to the disbursement of loan funds already available.118.	The international community is at the moment taking steps to establish a new communication and information order. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago recognizes that a free and responsible press is an essential feature of a democratic society. I wish  however  to reiterate that each Government and State has the right to determine its own national priorities based on acceptable international standards  from which there can be no derogation. It follows  therefore  that whenever attempts are made by national or transnational entities to subvert those priorities or derogate from those standards  such attempts must be vigorously resisted.119.	In conclusion  I should like to enjoin others to return to fundamental principles and to reconsider and reaffirm those principles of co-operation on which this Organization is based. I use the expression co-operation as the antithesis of conflict and discord  which are forces of destruction. I remain convinced that the hour is not too late  that in spite of the perceptible slow-down in effort over the last year  real progress can still be made. Indeed  we have made some progress in the past  small imperceptible steps towards our goal of a more just  more equitable  more humane international community. But the road ahead is long and fraught with many perils. We must continue to persevere."
"135",6938,"TUN",35,1980,"ï»¿Before telling you how pleased I am to address you from this rostrum  I should like to extend the congratulations of my country  Tunisia  to you  Mr. President  on your unanimous election as President of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. We know with what distinction you have for many years represented your country  the Federal Republic of Germany  and we are convinced that under your leadership the work of this session will be crowned with success.3.	We should also like to express our admiration and pride at the major achievements of your African predecessor  Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim of the United Republic of Tanzania  who presided over the work of the thirty-fourth session and the three special sessions with impartiality  skill and admirable effectiveness.4.	I must emphasize with what admiration and respect we in Tunisia follow the efforts of Mr. Kurt Waldheim  the Secretary-General  in the service of the Organization and the principles of the Charter. I had occasion in Tunisia to confer with him on the major problems facing the international community  and I admired the wisdom and dedication that he brought to bear in his search for a just and equitable solution to those problems.5.	I am grateful to him for having suggested  on the occasion of the thirty-fifth anniversary of the Organization  that I come and address the Assembly  thereby giving me an opportunity to discuss our approach to the major problems of the day  which constitute the back drop of the long agenda that has been assigned to the Assembly at this session.6.	Tunisia's interest in the work of the United Nations is not new. My President  the Supreme Commander  Habib Bourguiba  has on two occasions addressed the Assembly. The first time was in November 1956 ' just a few months after independence and only a few days after our admission to membership in the Organization. The second time was in May 1968  when he assessed the distance that the Organization had covered in moving towards universality  which made it possible for the Organization to make room for the new countries of Africa  Asia and Latin America  representing peoples which only recently had acquired freedom and dignity.7.	I should like today to offer to all peace-loving peoples of good will the greetings of President Habib Bourguiba  who continues to watch over Tunisia and guide us towards economic and social development in democracy and freedom.8.	I take special pleasure in addressing the Assembly  which  having now almost achieved universality truly represents  the entire world. It is not the least of the achievements of the United Nations that it has succeeded in surviving the past eventful 35 years. During this period the world has been transformed and has seen the emergence on the international scene of millions of people who until recently had been exploited by colonialism but who today are standing on their own feet  proud and determined to be recognized for what they are  men.9.	We would remind the many critics of the Organization that the problems of the day are world-wide and therefore complex  and require constant collective consideration  in a manner which only the United Nations makes possible. During the past 35 years the United Nations has gradually given collective effort a meaning  a scope and even a certain effectiveness never before known.10.	In spite of the present state of international relations and the crisis in various parts of the world  no one can deny that the basic tenets of the Charter  advocated and reaffirmed by the United Nations  continue to be our guiding light  because of their moral weight and realism  as we seek solutions to all the problems of the world.11.	That is why we want to see in the United Nations humanism in action. The Organization must pursue and speed up the forward march of mankind  in which we must be at the same time witnesses  guarantors and participants. It is the role of the United Nations to be the conscience of mankind  thereby justifying the hopes that untold millions of human beings have placed in it. That is an immense responsibility but one which is not beyond the capacity of nations and peoples which cherish freedom  justice and peace.12.	The past achievements of the Organization in the area of human rights encourage optimism. In less than one third of a century it has developed a unique system of protection which it constantly extends and improves. To this its creativity and sense of justice have rightly been fully and willingly devoted.13.	The Charter of the United Nations  the various Conventions against all forms of discrimination  racial and otherwise  the International Covenant on Economic  Social and Cultural Rights  the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid and the many declarations and principles attest to the productiveness and broad-mindedness of the Organization.14.	Now you are hard at work on a convention against torture. I wish to take this opportunity to express the firm and unreserved support of my country  which considers that torture is a disgrace in our time  especially since it avails itself of the most sophisticated and refined developments in medicine  psychology  chemistry and science in general. I trust that your work here will move rapidly ahead and that this convention will soon be opened for ratification by Member States and then become the instrument protecting human dignity which so many are anxiously awaiting.15.	Things are  of course  far from perfect in the area of human rights  but the efforts that have been made and the results achieved are heartening.16.	Perhaps we cannot say as much for the North-South dialogue  which was intended to bring about a new world order in all areas  primarily in the economic field. It was to be an order based on justice and equity  on a better balance  and therefore more in keeping with today's realities and better able to meet the needs of today's world and to bring about real solutions to the crisis and disorder reigning every-where  both in the North and in the South.17.	Turning  in particular  to the new international economic order  progress  such as it is  has been slow. That order had  however  been clearly defined in General Assembly texts. Its content  clear and precise  is based on what was to be a common philosophy  one of interdependence.18.	Recent developments in the North-South dialogue are  in our opinion  particularly dangerous and a source of concern to those who fear methods of confrontation and believe in the virtues of a meeting of the minds in finding just and satisfactory solutions to the many structural and other difficulties confronting the world.19.	Is it not a fact that the courageous attempts of the developing countries to convince the international community of the need to launch global negotiations on the more crucial problems have encountered procedural obstacles as unnecessary as they are harmful? Those responsible for the deadlock at the conclusion of the eleventh special session of the General Assembly seem to be resigned to the risk of causing the failure of an historic initiative  an opportunity that may be unique in reviving the dialogue after the many setbacks that we have all experienced.20.	I have stressed the North-South aspect of the problems of the world  because  in our opinion  that is the dimension which promises most for a satisfactory development of inter-national relations. As we focused all our efforts on these frustrating exchanges  we were more or less convinced that the problems between the East and the West had become somewhat less acute and that genuine detente was about to replace mere peaceful coexistence and to usher in an era of co-operation. Unfortunately  we have now been witnessing a new form of cold war  which gives priority to problems of security  defence and armaments to the detriment of peace and development. I would place the grave crisis in Afghanistan in this general context. Tunisia's position on the matter is well known. It is the same position that has been taken on so many occasions by Islamic countries  namely that foreign troops must be withdrawn from the territory of that country  which must remain independent and non-aligned. The same atmosphere fraught with threats of a return to the cold war has prevented large-scale measures being taken to reduce the arms race. A consequence of that race between the major Powers  which manufacture expensive sophisticated weapons  has been an increase in the transfer of weapons to countries of the third world  thereby aggravating the crises afflicting them which  as we have seen once again  can turn into real  open and fratricidal warfare.21.	Let there be no mistake about it. No country is completely protected from the effects of a crisis. The distressing events that we have been witnessingâand here I refer to the conflict between Iran and Iraq  in connection with which we have expressed our great concernâcause us to fear the effect of that crisis on the prices of a product of paramount importance and show us once again how the whole world can be disrupted by a crisis of any scope at all. No procedural argument  no desire to maintain the institutional status quo can be allowed to conceal the primary importance for all countries  developed and developing  of establishing a sound and equitable basis for harmonious and balanced growth  and that is particularly true of countries of the third world.22.	Notwithstanding obstacles and failures  the North- South dialogue must continue. Each side must show restraint and realism and try not to give the other side the impression that its fundamental interests are being threatened. At the same time  we must all recognize and try to correct our own errors. In the third world  every country must make an effort to build a more just and democratic society. Tunisia  for its part  is trying to ensure that economic  social  and political development advance together  because it has certainly not been proved that economic advancement must necessarily come before a free and democratic society.23.	It is of overriding importance for us to fight at one and the same time against underdevelopment and against the dictatorship  arbitrary action and authoritarianism it some-times produces.24.	The fight against underdevelopment clearly begins at home and the developing countries must first devote all their own means  and foremost among them their power  to that struggle. It has been said that power corrupts and that absolute power corrupts absolutely. In order to prevent that from happening  I consider that power  if it is to be just and legitimate  must be subject to moral standards  it must be controlled in many different ways by the people and it must be duly institutionalized. There is no legitimate power except within the limits of democracy. The true ""Prince""â and I refer to a responsible governmentâis not a government that acts in accordance with its own whim and passing circumstances. Any government worthy of the name and worthy of the responsibilities of a ""Prince"" does not exercise power for the sake of power  but exercises power within the strict limits of justice  law and freedom  in a word  within the limits of democracy. It is also important to be able to leave the political arena as soon as one's actions cease to serve the interests of the people and the future of the masses. Power belongs to the people  naturally  absolutely and imprescriptibly.25.	Our developing countries will not be able to overcome the problems of underdevelopment if they devote a sizeable portion of their means to armaments  which are costly and useless since they make them ever more dependent on the suppliers and since  as experience has proved  they are never or practically never used against imperialism  but against other third world countries which then must arm themselves  to the detriment of their developmental efforts.26.	Having made that point  I now wish to say to the industrialized world that it cannot at one and the same time claim to respect great valuesâdemocracy  freedom and human rightsâand attempt to defend its more exorbitant interests and intolerable privileges. How can certain Western countries reconcile those values with their tolerance for and even protection of the advocates of apartheid and zionism?27.	So many countries  so many political parties  so many companies and multinationals all get around United Nations measures and allow the racist hydra to prosper in South Africa and to survive at the price of inhuman opposition to millions of Africans who have committed no crime other than that of having black skin. That is something which exceeds our understanding.28.	The Zionist forces strive to extend their dominion by despoiling the Palestinian people  brazenly Judaizing Arab territories and  without due process  seizing the Holy City of Jerusalem  the city of peace  the sacred crossroads of all the revealed religions. Yet in spite of all those many acts  Zion-ism still finds its unreserved defenders  unbelievable though it may seem. But what is even harder to believe is that the same countries  the same interests and the same circles that support Israel in its annexationist and expansionist policy  assist the racist regime in South Africa in its pseudo-theory of apartheid and hold up the North-South dialogue thus preventing those peoples who cherish progress  peace and freedom from realizing their legitimate aspirations.29.	The problem of the independence of Namibia has long received the unanimous support of the international com-munity and yet there are some who still hesitate and procrastinate. That speaks volumes regarding the causes of the weakness of the Organization  where the commitment of the strongest is always conditioned by considerations of the most narrow interests. But the basic requirements are the same for our partners and for ourselves. While involved collectively in disputes with those partners  we spark off conflicts in our own ranks which undermine our cohesive- ness and wear away our credibility.30.	That is why we are deeply affected by the conflict that has just broken out in the heart of the Middle East between two fraternal neighbouring peoples which have had and indeed still have every reason to work together to help each other and to love each other.31.	The Security Council has expressed the deep concern which this conflict has aroused in the world and the Islamic Conference has brought us our first hope by offering our two brothers the path to conciliation and reconciliation.32.	We can only welcome that initiative and we praise the meritorious efforts of Mr. Zia-ul-Haq  the President of the Republic of Pakistan  and the efforts of Mr. Habib Chatti  the Secretary-General of the Islamic Conference  as they endeavour to go beyond the stage of confrontation and move towards a settlement on the basis of law and justice and on the basis of Islamic solidarity. We unreservedly support this mission of peace and we believe that its continuation represents for both Iran and Iraq  as well as for the international community  a chance for salvation.33.	The United Nations must bring its full weight to bear as it endeavours to ensure the success of this initiative which  in the spirit of the Charter  complements and strengthens the responsibilities incumbent upon the Security Council.34.	In a world where the interdependence of nations is becoming increasingly obvious  resort to narrow nationalism can only surprise us. The role of the United Nations is precisely to help us learn to live in freely assumed interdependenceâand I am referring to interdependence among nations  interdependence among peoples  and solidarity among men  too. To our eyes the United Nations is politics in the service of law  it is the institution in the service of man and it is people coming together in the service of an idea.35.	On behalf of Tunisia and its President  our Supreme Commander  Habib Bourguiba  may I say that our country will spare no effort to help bring about the realization of the principles underlying the United Nations. As in the past  Tunisia will continue to give the Organization its help and support in a spirit of solidarity and fraternity with all men of good will. Our faithfulness to the United Nations is but faithfulness to ourselves  to our martyrs  and to our people's struggle for emancipation. We know what we owe the United Nations  and we shall always be conscious of it.36.	We Tunisians know that we must work in Tunisia for the triumph of the ideals of the Organization. Our accomplishments under the leadership of President Bourguiba in the liberation of man and the emancipation of womenâin connection with which we wish to express our great pride that during the United Nations Decade for Women the work of the National Union of Tunisian Women was honoured by the award of the United Nations Human Rights Prize  which crowned the magnificent activities of President Bourguibaâas well as what we have done to fight hunger  malnutrition and sickness  to educate our girls and boys  to endow our country with democratic institutions  and to ensure that liberty and dignity shall not be vain words or mere slogans all give us reason for satisfaction. But we know that we still have much to do  and that what we have to do must be done in a world of peace and concord and  above all  in perfect harmony with the great communities to which we belongâthe Arab-Islamic community  the African community  the third world  of which we are an integral part  and  last but certainly by no means least  this human family that this Organization  our Organization  reflects so well.37.	In conclusion I wish to express anew Tunisia's full confidence in the United Nations  in its organs and in the Secretary-General to succeed in the difficult and untiring effort to promote peace in the world and understanding among men."
"136",6985,"TUR",35,1980,"ï»¿May I first express my congratulations to President von Wechmar on his election to the presidency of the thirty-fifth session. As a representative of a country which has traditional ties of friendship with the Federal Republic of Germany  it gives me great pleasure to say that this election is a tribute to that country and to its growing contribution to the safeguarding of peace and international co-operation. Personally  as a former colleague  I rejoice that this is also a recognition of Ambassador von Wechmar's exceptional diplomatic skill.2.	I wish also to express our appreciation to the outgoing President  Ambassador Salim of the United Republic of Tanzania  for the excellent and statesmanlike manner in which he presided over the work of the Assembly during the past year.3.	May I finally say  Mr. Vice-President  that I consider it to be a very happy coincidence that I address the Assembly while you are presiding. I hope this is a good omen for Turkish-Greek relations.4.	Let me welcome two new Members of our Organization: Zimbabwe and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. We extend to them our best wishes for progress and prosperity. We are certain that their contribution to the work of our Organization will be extremely valuable.5.	I speak from this rostrum only a few weeks after the Turkish armed forces took over the administration of the country on 12 September. That move came about as a response to the total paralysis of the political system and of its institutions and processes  and in response to a situation characterized by increasing violence  terrorism and anarchy  as well as by the imminence of civil war. The immediate aim now is to eradicate violence and at the same time to devise new constitutional  electoral and institutional arrangements which will enable a return to civilian rule at the earliest time under a democratic system that would best serve the needs and aspirations of the Turkish people.6.	In the meantime  the foreign policy of Turkey will remain unchanged. Turkey will continue its attachment to the principles embodied in the Charter of the United Nations and uphold all its treaty commitments. It will seek to develop its relations with the European Economic Community within the framework of an Association Agreement aimed at eventual full membership. Its relations with the Council of Europe will be guided by its dedication to democratic principles and its resolve to return to parliamentary rule. Its ties with the countries members of the Islamic community will be enhanced and it will endeavour to achieve further co-operation among them. It will strive for better relations with all neighbouring countries and pursue vigorously its efforts to settle pending issues with them peacefully.7.	As we hold the first regular session of the General Assembly in the 1980s  mankind feels deep anxiety over the present world situation  an anxiety compounded by new tensions and eruptions of armed conflict. World peace is becoming increasingly vulnerable as efforts towards a more balanced international order are stalled  the economic crisis deepens and the principles of the Charter of the United Nations are defied. These developments cast an ominous shadow over international peace and security.8.	In Europe my Government remains truly devoted to the process of detente. Yet we recognize that that process can only remain viable in a climate of mutual confidence and we regret that that climate has deteriorated seriously as a result of events taking place outside Europe.9.	It has indeed proved impossible to confine detente to one geographical area. Detente by its very nature is indivisible. All countries should therefore act in recognition of that fact and make their contribution to the removal of impediments to the relaxation of tension and restore the process to its previous vitality and dynamism. We should consistently be guided by the awareness that there is no alternative to detente as the basis of a stable peace. In that context we are convinced that the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe  held at Helsinki in 1975 should fulfil an important role in the process of detente and in the conduct of relations among European countries. We hope that the second review session of this Conference  to be held at Madrid in November  will constitute a useful step on the path towards the reinforcement of the process of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe.10.	At a time when our attention is focused on armed conflicts in several parts of the world  on the unabated arms race and on blatant violations of the Charter of the United Nations  disarmament can be seen as a Utopian objective. Yet we know that for the sake of future generations we have no choice but to persevere in the pursuit of general and complete disarmament. We shall not attain that goal in a foreseeable future  but we can strive nevertheless to achieve it gradually. For the decade of the 1980s our agenda should therefore read ""arms control"".11.	The United States and the Soviet Union bear special responsibilities in the field of nuclear disarmament. We were gratified by the statement they issued concerning forthcoming discussions at Geneva on the limitation of nuclear arms. We further believe that the SALT II agreement constitutes a significant stage and we urge its early ratification. We further hope that it will be complemented by SALT III negotiations.12.	We are disappointed by the considerable delay in the conclusion of a treaty on a complete nuclear-test ban. As long as that treaty is not completed  efforts aimed at ensuring the non-proliferation of nuclear arms will not carry the weight and credibility necessary to persuade all countries to accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.13.	The SALT process on the one hand  and a ban on all nuclear tests on the other  constitute the basic elements of progress towards a world free from fear of a nuclear holocaust. They constitute furthermore a necessary precondition of other efforts aiming at reducing arms of all kinds.14.	Detente has come to life in Europe. We sincerely hope that this example will be followed and that the first significant measures of disarmament will also be adopted and implemented on European soil. In this respect we detect some encouraging signs. We hope that the forthcoming negotiations on the stabilization and reduction of intermediate range nuclear missiles and their delivery vehicles will- pave the way for a real process of arms reduction in the continent.15.	Secondly  the convening of a disarmament conference in Europe  which will have the task of discussing various confidence-building measures among States  might create the necessary climate for further efforts in the field of disarmament.16.	These two developments will indeed complete the Vienna Talks on Mutual Reduction of Forces  Armaments and Associated Measures in Central Europe  which have in fact been stagnating for a long time. Turkey hopes that there will be a new impetus to the efforts made in all these fields and that the progress achieved on the European continent will encourage countries in other parts of the world to commit themselves to the disarmament process.17.	The Middle East conflict continues to threaten world peace and security. We are particularly alarmed by recent developments which reflect Israel's intransigence. Israel persists in its policy of establishing settlements in the occupied Arab territories in total disregard of repeated United Nations resolutions and of world public opinion. Recently it provoked widespread indignation by proclaiming Al Quds as the indivisible and eternal capital of Israel. This is an arbitrary and unilateral action which is totally incompatible with the principles of international law.18.	I need to emphasize that Turkey feels a very strong commitment to Al Quds Al Sharif on historical  spiritual and moral grounds. Al Quds has special significance to all the three monotheistic religions. It has been an Arab and Islamic city for centuries; it will have to remain so.19.	We note with satisfaction that since the adoption of Security Council resolution 478 (1980) all embassies located in Al Quds have moved out. The whole world has now been duly alerted to the potential clangers involved in the present course of Israeli policy.20.	As for the Middle East conflict itself  the core of which is the problem of Palestine  we have on several previous occasions  and most recently during the seventh emergency special session of the General Assembly  on Palestine  reiterated our well-known position.  A comprehensive  durable and just solution of the Middle East conflict should consist of the following elements: withdrawal of Israel from all the Arab territories it has occupied since 1967  including Al Quds; recognition and realization of the inalienable legitimate rights of the people of Palestine  including their right to establish an independent State; the participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]  the sole and legitimate representative of the people of Palestine  in all peace efforts on an equal footing with the other interested parties to the conflict; and recognition of the right of each State in the region to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries.21.	We should like to emphasize  once again  that Israel cannot attain security by denying to the Arab people of Palestine the right to create its own State. We certainly hope that the international consensus that is evolving towards the recognition of the legitimate national rights of the Arab people of Palestine will induce Israel to adopt a realistic and constructive attitude as regards a comprehensive  just and durable solution in the Middle East.22.	Another source of deep concern in the Middle East is the prevailing situation in Lebanon. The events of recent years  which have caused great suffering in that country  continue to jeopardize its territorial integrity and national unity. The situation in Lebanon is itself inextricably linked with the over-all conflict in the Middle East. Repeated attacks by Israel further aggravate the situation in Lebanon and constitute another serious impediment. We also believe that all parties concerned must co-operate in creating the conditions which would enable UNIFIL to carry out effectively its mandate in southern Lebanon.23.	We are distressed by the fighting between Iran and Iraq. Both are our neighbours  to which we are bound by traditional ties of friendship  and we can only feel alarmed at the serious situation which has developed in that most sensitive region of the world. It is with these considerations in mind that we support the goodwill mission undertaken on behalf of the Islamic Conference and the efforts of the Secretary-General.24.	In his inspiring address this morning  the President of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan  General Mohammed Zia-ul-Haq  reported that during his mission he was able to ascertain the views of the two countries in an atmosphere of mutual trust and confidence. We equally welcome resolution 479 (1980) recently adopted unanimously by the Security Council. We particularly note paragraph 3 of that resolution  which calls upon all other States to exercise the utmost restraint and to refrain from any act which may lead to a further escalation and widening of the conflict.25.	Turkey  as a forerunner in the liberation struggles against colonialism at the beginning of this century  continues to follow the prevailing situation in southern Africa with close interest and concern.26.	First of all  I should like to note with great satisfaction the historic accession to independence of Zimbabwe and its admission to membership in the United Nations after a long and valiant struggle by its people. This outcome represents a victory for diplomacy  to which the statesmanship of all the parties concerned contributed.27.	As a founding member of the United Nations Council for Namibia  we believe that the illegal occupation of Namibia by South Africa must be terminated. We also believe that Walvis Bay is an integral part of the Territory of Namibia. We fully support the people of Namibia in their just struggle to attain self-determination and genuine national independence under the guidance of their legitimate representative  the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO].28.	We hope that Namibia  following the example of Zimbabwe  will soon achieve genuine independence through the implementation of the United Nations plan on the basis of free and democratic elections to be held under the supervision of the United Nations in accordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions. We equally support the view that the international pressure on South Africa should be increased until a final solution of the question of Namibia is reached in accordance with the principles contained in the United Nations plan.29.	Having institutionalized the abhorrent policy of apartheid  the Government of South Africa continues to be undeterred by the repeated demands of the international community. South Africa persists in its oppressive measures and continues its policy of bantustanization. Those developments further aggravate the situation prevailing in southern Africa. We strongly condemn the policy of apartheid and advocate continued United Nations efforts to eliminate that policy. We are firmly convinced that further effective measures to that end should be adopted against South Africa.30.	During recent years important events have taken place in South-East Asia. The developments in Kampuchea  with their appalling and disastrous consequences  are a source of serious concern.31.	We believe that a political settlement of the crisis in Kampuchea should enable the people of Kampuchea to choose their own Government without outside intervention or coercion. The United Nations has already called for such a settlement and asked for the immediate withdrawal of all foreign troops from that country.32.	We should like to commend the efforts of the international agencies which are trying to alleviate the sufferings of the people of Kampuchea and those of the refugees. We favour the continuation of such humanitarian aid.33.	We observe with satisfaction that the countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations [ASEAN]  with which we have excellent relations in all fields  constitute a community which not only strengthens economic ties among its members but also makes a contribution as a factor of political stability in the region.34.	The events in Afghanistan  a country with which Turkey has traditionally enjoyed fraternal relations and wide co-operation  are a source of special and direct concern. We are deeply sensitive to the ongoing tragedy of the Afghan people as well as to the plight of the 1 million Afghan refugees.35.	A speedy political settlement in Afghanistan is imperativeâa settlement which will ensure the withdrawal of all foreign troops from that country  the cessation of all foreign interference in the affairs of that fiercely independent-minded people and the restoration of their right to self-government.36.	In line with those objectives  Turkey fully supported General Assembly resolution ES-6/2 adopted nine months ago  as well as the resolution adopted at the Eleventh Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers  held at Islamabad from 17 to 22 May 1980. Once again we call for their immediate implementation.37.	It is evident that the world economy is in a deep crisis. The serious slow-down in the average growth rate and un-abatable inflation are symptoms of enduring problems in the industrial countries. The world energy situation greatly compounds this crisis and no country can escape from its effects  irrespective of its level of development or the degree of its dependence on oil.38.	Oil price rises regularly follow periods of high inflation in the industrialized countries. Such rises bring about inevitable financial stability programmes with deflationary effects  which reinforce recessionary forces. The world economy is thus trapped in a vicious circle of continuous inflation and slow growth.39.	The non-oil-exporting developing countries are con-fronted with the worst of both worlds. Unpredictable oil price increases and occasional supply uncertainties are added to the steadily rising costs of the essential intermediary and capital goods they import from the industrial world. Notwithstanding partial and temporary recoveries  their terms of trade deteriorate. Their products either face pervasive protectionist practices or are compelled to compete in shrinking markets. Their piled-up debts in this contracting global economy are considered a serious constraint for the further transfer of resources  especially transfers of a non-concessionary nature.40.	The New International Economic Order  which has the aim of narrowing income differentials between rich and poor countries  appears under the present circumstances a remote prospect. This realization is in sombre contradiction with the urgency of the situation.41.	In view of the structural nature of the global growth and development problems  partial  parochial and conjectural measures are evidently insufficient. What we need are structural measures conducive to a short-term improvement in the world economy and commensurate with the challenge of the crisis.42.	The major problem is how to deal with huge deficits in balances of payments. At the national level  countries should unequivocally embark upon financial stability programmes  which will inevitably imply painful structural adjustments. At the international level concerted efforts should be deployed to back up national programmes and help to alleviate inherent social and economic strains.43.	Nevertheless  individual efforts supported by international assistance cannot be expected to remedy the global crisis. What is needed is to impart a new impetus to world economic growth by utilizing the idle productive capacities in the industrialized countries without increasing inflationary tendencies. We do not entertain any illusion as to the possibilities of raising adequate funds for massive transfers. We know that  in spite of the easy liquidity conditions  an international financial co-operation of the scale required  involving the participation of international banks  countries with surpluses and international monetary authorities  could not readily be organized. Yet the transfer of large- scale resources is imperative. New available resources should be allocated to the creation of viable production capacities in developing countries. For that purpose those countries need capital and sometimes intermediary inputs from developed countries  to which their final products should  at least in part  be exported. That would unavoidably necessitate further world-wide structural adjustments involving well-known difficulties. None the less  it is clear that in the long run those adjustments would serve the interests of both developed and developing countries.44.	Regarding the global negotiations  we take the view that procedural issues are of secondary significance and that they should not hinder the launching of the negotiating process. The life span of one year envisaged for those negotiations seems to us to be too short to bring about a radical change in the relevant international institutions. It is disappointing that there has been a tendency to reduce the problem to a futile debate on the competence of some specialized agencies.45.	In that connection  we support the compromise formula worked out by the Chairman of Working Group I of the eleventh special session and we sincerely hope that a consensus will be worked out at this session along those lines. We are concerned that lack of progress in launching global negotiations would inevitably produce serious repercussions and adversely affect the world economy as a whole.46.	On the other hand we welcome the agreement on the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade  as well as resolution S-11/4 concerning the least developed countries. I take great pleasure in paying a tribute to those who have actively contributed to those agreements.47.	Turning now to the question of Cyprus  I should like to express our satisfaction at the recent resumption of the international talks at Nicosia. May I take this opportunity to express our gratitude to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  for his untiring efforts to revive the intercommunal negotiating process on a common basis. As we have already stated on numerous occasions  my Government entirely concurs with the Secretary-General's view that a just and viable solution of the Cyprus problem can be achieved only through negotiations between the two communities in the island.48.	Therefore  we shall continue to lend our support to the Secretary-General's mission of good offices and to encourage the intercommunal talks with a view to achieving progress towards a final comprehensive solution.49.	In view of the resumption of the intercommunal talks on the substantive issues on 16 September  it would no doubt have been preferable not to include the question of Cyprus in the agenda of this session. However  we find it encouraging that the General Assembly has  at its 2nd meeting  concurred with the decision of the General Committee to defer the consideration of the allocation of the relevant item to an appropriate time after the conclusion of the general debate. We are of the opinion that all the interested parties  as well as the entire membership  will still have an opportunity to contribute significantly to the conduct of the intercommunal talks in a constructive manner  by avoiding an unproductive debate on this question this year.50.	The General Assembly must be familiar by now with all the aspects of the Cyprus problem. I need not therefore make a lengthy statement on the subject. However  I should like to reiterate briefly that  in the light of past experience  my Government's view on this issue is based on the principles of justice and equity  namely  on ensuring the fundamental legitimate rights of the Turkish Cypriot community that aspires to live side by side as equal partners with the Greek Cypriot community in the framework of an independent  sovereign  bi-communal and bi-zonal federal State which  we hope  will adopt a policy of non-alignment. The Turkish Government sincerely wishes to see this problem completely eliminated from our agenda in the context of such a solution. We believe that this would also pave the way to better relations and co-operation in the region. The realization of this objective no doubt requires goodwill  understanding and patience on the part of the two negotiating partners  namely  the Turkish and Greek communities of Cyprus.51.	We hope very much that the resumption of the inter-communal talks in Cyprus marks a turning point  and that this will at last enable the two communities to break with a tormented past  to reconcile their differences and to live in harmony in this beautiful Mediterranean island.52.	In recent years  the international community has witnessed an alarming escalation of violence. Terrorism has taken a toll of thousands of innocent victims and fundamental rights of individuals and States have been flouted. There seems to have been no community or region which has escaped this ordeal. International terrorism in our time is primarily directed against diplomatic and consular agents. For a number of years missions and diplomats of my country  as well as members of their families  have repeatedly been the targets of inhuman brutality. We fully support the initiative of the Nordic countries that led to the inscription on our agenda of a new item entitled ""Consideration of effective measures to enhance the protection  security and safety of diplomatic and consular missions and representatives"".53.	We strongly urge that the United Nations take firm and concrete measures in the course of the present session to counter the global threat against diplomatic and consular agents. All States should unequivocally condemn acts of terrorism wherever and whenever they occur  as an expression of solidarity and determined action. They must intensify measures taken at the national level  promote their bilateral and regional co-operation and exchange information concerning in particular the utilization of new techniques to combat terrorism.54.	Before I conclude my remarks I should like to recall Kemal Ataturk  whose legacy continues to inspire and guide us in Turkey. The founder and first President of the Turkish Republic stated that ""of the two conquerors in the history of mankind  the plough is surely destined to be the ultimate victor over the sword"". The Republic of Turkey  very much a creation of Ataturk  remains committed to this dictum."
"137",7047,"TZA",35,1980,"ï»¿Permit me  Sir  on my own personal behalf and on behalf of my delegation  to congratulate you most sincerely on your unanimous election to the presidency of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. Tanzania is particularly pleased to see an eminent representative of your great country occupying this post  for the Federal Republic of Germany and the United Republic of Tanzania have long historical links. You are aware  of course  that present relations between our two countries in diplomacy and development cooperation are flourishing. Your country's interest in the progress of the continent of Africa is also widely acknowledged. Your own high qualities as a skilled diplomat and statesman make you a most worthy choice for this esteemed post. My delegation welcomes your leadership of the current session of the General Assembly and pledges its fullest cooperation.106.	It gives me immense satisfaction now to pay a deserved tribute to your predecessor  Ambassador Salim Ahmed Salim  on his achievements. The confidence of my Government in his service  dedication and resourcefulness in the course of his entire career as its envoy was more than vindicated by his assumption  for the honour of his country  of the responsibilities of President of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly. We are proud of the dedication that he demonstrated during the one year term of office.107.	In addition  I take this opportunity  through you  Mr. President  first  once again to thank the General Assembly for electing him and then extending to him throughout his term of office all the cooperation and assistance that he needed. Secondly  I thank Ambassador Salim himself for the honour he has earned my country by his stewardship of the Assembly's affairs in the regular and special sessions. Thirdly  I thank the General Committee of the thirty-fourth session for its team spirit and cooperation with Ambassador Salim.108.	I should like to extend a very warm welcome to the delegation of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  whose country has just been admitted to membership in the United Nations. The United Nations must feel very proud of and enriched by this latest success in decolonization. We look forward to working very closely with the delegation of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines in the United Nations for the benefit of the peoples we represent and in the promotion of international understanding and cooperation.109.	Allow me also to take this opportunity to pay a well-deserved tribute to the secretary General. The smooth operation of the Secretariat is often taken for granted  although the truth is that a lot of arduous work  dedication and perseverance must be put into it  and the onus of ensuring that all goes well is borne by the man at the helm. We are pleased to record our great satisfaction that the secretary General has shouldered this responsibility with dedication and resourcefulness.110.	For the thirty-fifth time the Assembly has convened in regular session to assess the progress made by the United Nations in its noble mission to free mankind from the threat and yoke of insecurity  injustice and poverty. The yearly stocktaking exercise was intended to ensure  by taking appropriate action at each such session  that each succeeding year of the existence of the United Nations records progress that brings us closer than ever before to the aims of the Charter.111.	Although there can be no doubt that the United Nations has achieved much since it was foundedâfor example  in the field of decolonizationâthe overall world situation remains very disturbing. There prevails in almost every area of endeavour by the United Nations a sense of under achievement  great disappointment and sometimes near despair. In its quest for peace and security  in the numerous areas of international tension  for example  goodwill efforts and negotiations are stalemated  while the problems assume even more dangerous proportions. In disarmament  rhetoric seems to a disturbing extent to have replaced meaningful negotiations  leaving the arms race to escalate almost beyond reversal. In the economic field  the world is witnessing a dramatic crumbling of the entire world economic structure  thanks mainly to the stubborn refusal of reform by some of the beneficiaries of the old established unequal economic relations. As confrontation and contest spread from one field to another  tension mounts and peace  naturally  is placed in even greater jeopardy.112.	One of the developments which characterized the 1970s and will  I believe  dominate the 1980s is the fiercely critical re-examination of world economic relations following the proved ineffectiveness of traditional attempts at a solution  especially in the 1960s. This re-examination has resulted in the conclusion that nothing short of a complete overhaul of the world economic system will bring about an improvement in the economies of most of the developing countries  let alone international justice. That is why the Declaration and Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order of 1 May 1974 Resolutions 3201 (SVl) and 3202 (SVl) remains the number one agenda item in the evolution of present-day international relations.113.	But it is also becoming increasingly clear that the old international economic system is no longer appropriate even for its architects in the North  whose economies are characterized by slow growth  high unemployment  inflation and fluctuations in exchange rates. Even the so-called free trade is increasingly being flouted by some of the developed countries by a proliferation of protectionist measures.114.	The call for the establishment of a new international economic order is based on the genuine desire to establish a harmonious and mutually beneficial political and economic system in which all nations will be able to participate equitably  not only in the decision-making mechanisms on matters affecting all countries but also in the production and distribution of goods and services. And 1 should like to emphasize at this juncture that the developing countries are not asking for reparations for whatever pillage was committed in the past  though they are entitled to do so. We are asking for a new type of relationship among all nations based on genuine interdependence  in which mutuality of interests takes the place of conflict of interests in a world of shrinking resources. In the search for such an order with such a purpose  no country is uninvolved and no nation should be excluded. For the future belongs to all of us  developing or developed  capitalist or socialist.115.	Several working conferences have been held since the sixth special session of the General Assembly  which laid down the foundation and goals of this new structure of relationships among nations. Regrettably  little progress has been made in the implementation of the structural changes called for in the Declaration and Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order. Responsibility for the failure of the international community to reach agreement on structural changes in the international economic system falls squarely on certain major developed countries. In the report of the Independent Commission on International Development Issues  the Brandt Commission has given eloquent  succinct and authoritative testimony in these terms:.. in UNCTAD and elsewhere the Group of 77 faced an uphill task. At successive meetings they put forward proposals for international economic reform  but the North either did not like them or was not ready for them. The North has also argued that the South often makes inflexible demands which allow little room for negotiation. On the other hand  while some countries have made positive proposals  the North as a group has tended to react passively to those put forward by the South  rather than present a constructive position of its own."" 116.	These negative attitudes of some of the major industrialized countries of the North were again manifested at the recently concluded eleventh special session of the General Assembly  which was devoted to issues related to development and international economic cooperation. Their lack of political will prevented the Assembly from launching  at that session  the new round of global negotiations on international economic cooperation for development.117.	The selective approach to the issues to be dealt with during the global negotiations clearly demonstrates that some of the industrialized countries are interested in discussing in isolation only those issues which are of direct interest to them  in complete disregard of the interests of the international community as a whole. Their insistence that some of the issues concerned should be dealt with exclusively in certain international institutions  of which they have full command because of their weighted voting structures and the non-universality of those institutions  is a clear demonstration of their desire to maintain their privileged position. In all these cases some of the developed countries are rejecting the concept of an integrated approach to the problems facing the world economy in the fields of raw materials  energy  trade  development  money and finance  and they want to reduce the role of the central body in these negotiations to that of a helpless spectator.118.	My delegation is convinced that the new round of global negotiations on international economic cooperation for development will be meaningful only if they are conducted in a simultaneous  coherent and integrated fashion. These negotiations should result in a package agreement to be negotiated by the central body  which should receive maximum support and cooperation from all the specialized agencies. All the participating parties must be committed to the implementation of that agreement. We therefore appeal to those developed countries which have often made pleas for ""understanding and accommodation"" to review their position on this matter to enable the global negotiations to be launched as early as possible.119.	We accept that the primary responsibility for the development of our countries rests on our own shoulders. It is for this reason that the developing countries have initiated several projects and programmes for cooperation and mutual assistance among themselves in order to promote their individual and collective self-reliance. The developing countries are committed to the implementation of such policy measures as those elaborated in the Arusha Programme for Collective Self-Reliance and in other programmes adopted elsewhere. There have also been efforts to promote cooperation at regional levels. The Lagos Plan of Action for the Implementation of the Monrovia Strategy for Economic Development of Africa  which was adopted at the second extraordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity [OAU] in Lagos in April of this year  signifies the importance which African countries attach to cooperation among themselves in order to deal more effectively with their development problems.120.	But we are equally conscious of the fact that all countries  and particularly the developing ones  need an international political and economic environment which will both respond to and support their development efforts. All countries must therefore demonstrate their political will and commitment to implement the Strategy for the 1980s. The developed countries in particular must take the necessary measures to give concrete substance to their pleas for accommodation and cooperation.121.	In August this year an event took place at Geneva that is historic and must have a great influence in other areas of collective endeavour. The Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  which has taken over 10 years of difficult negotiations on a vast range of maritime issues  reached agreement on all the major problems before it. Like the negotiations on the new international economic order  that Conference involved numerous very sensitive interests of the participating States and  as in the former  a demand for departure from traditional patterns of world relations was made. The scepticism and sense of despair that preceded the breakthrough were as great as  if not greater than  those which prevail in negotiations elsewhere. The collapse of this Conference would inevitably have had demoralizing repercussions on all other negotiations apart from portending chaos at sea. Yet to all intents and purposes the law of the sea negotiations have succeeded  all the difficult problems involved notwithstanding.122.	This should serve as considerable encouragement to and an example for all those engaged in similar negotiations in the context of a new international economic order. For what has been proved is that where there is political will  fruitful negotiations are possible.123.	Expenditures on arms and armaments by most Powers no longer bear any relationship to their security requirements. What can we say of this kind of wasteful conduct when in this same world  across our borders  if not within our own countries  there are fellow human beings who live in conditions of misery and abject poverty?124.	The arms race has now pushed the world to the very brink of suicide. Two years ago the tenth special session of the General Assembly had to be convened to draw world attention to this fact. In August of this year the parties to the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons held their Second Review Conference at Geneva. At both meetings there was unanimity on one conclusion  namely  that what has so far been done in the field of disarmament is not commensurate with the urgent requirements in this field. We appeal to the great military Powers to summon up the resolve to begin to beat their swords into ploughshares.125.	My country is seriously concerned at the military build-up in the Indian Ocean zone. We have all along noted with concern and realized that that zone has been of great interest to the major military Powers and therefore a zone of rivalry  fraught with the danger of military conflict. In 1971 the Assembly declared the Indian Ocean a zone of peace; therefore the area should be spared great Power military presence and rivalry. Of late  under the pretext of developments around the area  there has been an unprecedented escalation in great Power rivalry and more bases have been openly established  in total disregard of the appeal made here for those Powers to exercise restraint. That is a very disturbing trend  and my delegation calls upon all those concerned scrupulously to respect the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace.126.	The Middle East situation is one of the most agonizing that the United Nations has had to deal with in its history. Peace has become exceedingly elusive  and as long as it is not accepted by all sides that the legitimate right of the Palestinian people to self-determination  including the right to establish an independent State of its own  is the cornerstone of peace in that area  there can be no prospect of peace.127.	The current Israeli activities in the area underscore that country's intransigence and have justly been condemned by the international community. The establishment of Israeli settlements in occupied Arab lands  the incarceration of Arab leaders  such as mayors  the recent illegal actions on the status of Jerusalem and the constant aggression against Lebanon  to mention only a few such activities  do not contribute to the quest for a just and enduring settlement of the conflict in the region.128.	The recent outbreak of hostilities between Iran and Iraq  which unfortunately still continues  is a source of great concern to my Government. The war between those two nonaligned and developing States has already caused tremendous devastation  both human and material. Its continuance is not only detrimental to the interests of the countries concerned but is also a source of serious danger to the security and stability of the region  with imponderable consequences for international peace and security. We solemnly appeal to both Iraq and Iran to put an immediate end to the fighting and to resolve their conflict by peaceful means.129.	In the island State of Cyprus  the sovereignty  territorial integrity and nonalignment of a nation is threatened by internal strife and foreign occupation. The United Nations  through the efforts of the secretary General in particular  has endeavoured to bring the two communities together to seek a common solution. We urge the two communities to take advantage of those good offices in the interest of their country and of regional peace  bearing in mind that the longer it takes to reach a solution  the more intractable the problem becomes.130.	Efforts for the reunification of Korea have not moved a step since 1972  when the two sides agreed on a common approach to the search for a settlement. The Korean people have a right to demand the reunification of their motherland peacefully and without foreign interference and to demand the withdrawal of all foreign troops  and they are correct in seeking to replace the armistice agreement with a peace treaty to be signed by the parties concerned.131.	Developments concerning IndoChina and Afghanistan continue to exacerbate international tension. We are convinced that the only solution lies in full respect for the sovereignty  territorial integrity and independence of the countries concerned. The true desire of those countries is to be nonaligned. That is not only their right  which we fully support  but also the best guarantee of peace in their areas.132.	As we enter the decade of the 1980s  Africa is living out the final chapter of decolonization. Zimbabwe is now free  and it is with a deep sense of pride that we welcome its presence among us here today.133.	But Zimbabwe has taught all of us a lesson that is very relevant to the situation now prevailing in Namibia.134.	South Africa  in the first place  continues to occupy that Territory illegally. Secondly  it has done everything possible to thwart the United Nations plan for settlement and to block the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). Despite the many and very serious efforts of the secretary General to ensure implementation of the settlement plan  South Africa has continued to employ delaying tactics  using every kind of pretext and excuse to frustrate those moves. Thirdly  South Africa has continued to use Namibia as a springboard from which to launch repeated acts of aggression against Angola and Zambia. Recently  the attacks against Angola have been particularly vicious and almost constant. Those acts of aggression have maimed thousands  and rendered just as many defenceless refugees. We condemn those senseless acts in the strongest possible terms. At the same time  we pledge our solidarity not only with the oppressed peoples in Namibia but also with the gallant people of Angola and Zambia  who have defied South Africa's intimidation and aggression.135.	If South Africa is genuinely interested in solving the Namibian problem peacefully  then the time is at hand. Zimbabwe seemed as intractable as Namibia now is. Yet with the cooperation of all parties  a solution has been achieved. Let South Africa commit itself to the implementation of the United Nations plan for genuine free and fair elections under United Nations supervision. My delegation does not accept South Africa's unwarranted charge that the secretary General has not acted impartially on the issue of Namibian decolonization. We challenge South Africa to give the secretary General the opportunity to demonstrate his impartiality further by enabling the implementation process to get under way immediately. In the meantime  I reiterate my country's continued support for the armed liberation struggle waged by SWAPO and the calls  in the face of South African intransigence  for comprehensive and mandatory sanctions against that regime.136.	You  Mr. President  represent a great country  the Federal Republic of Germany. With a population of about 25 000 ethnic Germans in Namibia  and also as one of the five Western countries  I am sure this question is of great interest and challenge to your country  to you and to them  for it is at their initiative that negotiations took place. I am convinced  therefore  that in our deliberations on this matter  as in all others before the Assembly at this session  your wisdom and experience will not let this opportunity for a peaceful settlement elude us.137.	Apart from Namibia  South Africa itself is at a crossroads. A revolution has already been ignited  and there is no way the apartheid regime there can stifle the fire of liberation and equality for all the peoples of South Africa. What is feared  however  is that in its desperation the racist minority regime will perpetrate more crimes in an attempt to prolong its existence. We believe that with the cooperation of the rest of the international community  by isolating the regime in all fields  the sons and daughters of that country will not take long to wrest their freedom and dignity. We appeal to all Members of the United Nations not to put obstacles in the way of these peoples' pursuit of this ideal  which the United Nations itself has always espoused.138.	Still on the question of liberation in Africa  the attention of the Assembly must be drawn to a problem which has already been the subject of numerous decisions by the OAU  the United Nations and the nonaligned movement. I am referring to the problem of Western Sahara. The people of that Territory are entitled to exercise their right to self-determination and independence. But a Member of the United Nations and of the OAU  namely Morocco  insists that Western Sahara be part of Morocco's territory. There certainly is no basis for Morocco's claim.139.	The majority of the African States have already accorded recognition to the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic. Talks have been allowed to go on with all concerned and interested parties in the Ad Hoc Committee of Heads of State of the OAU on Western Sahara. It has nevertheless to be made clear that the right of the people of Western Sahara to self-determination and independence is as unaffected as it is sacrosanct. The Assembly cannot but continue to reaffirm this right.140.	When the United Nations was established  it had relatively few Members  and the majority were the developed countries. The interests of the United Nations in world affairs then were almost identical with those of these Members. It was natural that the United Nations was accorded a very important role in the management of world affairs.141.	Now  we hear of talk that the Assembly consists of too many members to be efficient in its work and that  therefore  serious negotiations can only usefully take place in smaller forums elsewhere. And when the forums are mentioned to us  we cannot avoid concluding that these members want to continue to enjoy a privileged position in the community of nations.142.	This position of privilege is no longer acceptable. All of us have to learn to live with a democratized world system. So long as we continue to live in this same one world  we will have to learn to live with one another as equals and therefore obliged to share responsibility as well as rights. It is no longer possible for a small group of countries to take decisions on behalf of others without their consent and  at the same time  expect acceptance of those decisions by all. Neither the world nor the United Nations continues to be patterned to the purpose and interest of the few developed and industrialized nations.143.	Affairs of common interest in all fields of international intercourse must be dealt with in the United Nations. We maintain that the United Nations is the only hope for the peace  prosperity and dignity of mankind. That is why we also maintain that important decisions on world affairs need the stamp of legitimacy of the United Nations if these decisions are to be of lasting effect.144.	Since the launching of negotiations for the new international economic order  we have witnessed six years of dialogue aimed at averting confrontation. But the dialogue  necessary though it may have been  has fostered neglect and compounded the trend of accelerating economic adversity for the developing countries. Hunger  disease and deprivation have increased  not abated. There is yet the chance to come to grips with these problems and to strengthen the aspiration for the Realization of a peaceful world. It lies in the commencement of the global negotiations.145.	Neither rivalry nor isolation can destroy the essential unity of our planet or the dynamic interdependence of nations. We hope that the 1980s will attest to this truth  and that  inspired by the principles and goals of the United Nations  countries will translate it into practical institutional measures. I can assure you that Tanzania will play its part towards this end."
"138",7092,"UGA",35,1980,"ï»¿Eighteen years ago today the colonial flag was lowered in my country as we witnessed the momentous drama of the birth of a new nation. It is therefore with a great sense of history that I address this Assembly today on the occasion of the eighteenth anniversary of our national independence.118.	I wish to extend to Mr. von Wechmar my delegation's warmest congratulations on his unanimous election to the presidency of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. That is an honour bestowed on him personally as well as on his country  the Federal Republic of Germany  with which my own country is privileged to have very cordial and fruitful relations. We have full confidence that under this able leadership at this session the General Assembly will discharge its tasks with speed and wisdom. He can count on the full cooperation of my delegation.119.	I should like to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to his predecessor  Ambassador Salim Ahmed Salim of the United Republic of Tanzania. We are proud and appreciative of the exceptional statesmanship he demonstrated during an unusually busy year for the General Assembly  a year in which Ambassador Salim presided not only over the thirty-fourth regular session but also over two emergency special sessions and one special session. We wish him well as he continues to serve his country and the people of the world.120.	I wish also to pay a tribute to the Secretary General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  for his dedication to the work of the United Nations. Mr. Waldheim's report on the work of the organization over the past year bears impressive testimony to his tireless efforts  in spite of the difficulties that abound  to unite our world in a regime of international peace and security.121.	It is with very special joy that we join other delegations in welcoming to the ranks of this world body the newly independent nation of Zimbabwe. The independence of Zimbabwe is the fruit of a tenacious struggle waged by a very heroic people. We salute the people of Zimbabwe for this triumph. Their triumph will remain a source of inspiration for all who thirst for justice and peace the world over.122.	We welcome also to membership in the United Nations the Caribbean nation of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. We look forward to working together in our common search for a free and safer world.123.	The eleventh special session  devoted to international economic cooperation and development  ended in this; hall nearly four weeks ago. The failure of that session to resolve some of the most pressing issues concerning the present state of international economic relations still hovers over us and haunts us.124.	In 1974  during the sixth special session  we made a solemn commitment in this Assembly to work towards the creation of a new international economic order  an order in which we would ensure a more rational and equitable economic link between the countries of the North and the nations of the South.125.	The imperative need for this change had emerged from the reality of our postcolonial experience. We had fought so hard for political independence so that we could improve the material conditions of our people. Instead  we found our hands tied  and were unable to embark meaningfully on the tasks for which we had attained political independence. We found our hands tied in the web of an elaborate historical relationship: the colonial link gave birth to exploitation; exploitation produced underdevelopment; and that underdevelopment is the basic cause of our present poverty.126.	To this day we remain the producers of cheap raw materials for the industries of the North and the consumers of overpriced finished products from the industries of the North.127.	In order to break out of the present pattern of poverty  we must first break out of the chains of the present international economic system. Our demand for the New International Economic Order is therefore a demand for justice.128.	But  justice apart  this is also a matter of collective survival. Because of the historical relationship to which I have referred  our world has become very interdependent. The export industries of the North depend on the health of our economies for their survival. It is no longer possible for the economies of the developing countries to collapse without that collapse significantly injuring the economies of the industrialized nations. It is therefore in the interest of the industrialized nations to work with us in order to produce a more stable and secure economic order.129.	Negotiations on such issues as international monetary and financial institutions  raw materials  the transfer of resources  commodities and energy cannot be delayed much longer. We are most disappointed that the eleventh special session was unable to produce the procedures for a new round of global negotiations because of the obstinacy and insensitivity of some Western Powers. We appeal to the United States  the United Kingdom and the Federal Republic of Germany to rethink their position on this matter and to join us in a consensus later in this session.130.	Although the agreement reached during the special session on the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade [see A/35/464] falls short of the original expectations of the developing countries  it is nevertheless a positive development. Now we must work to ensure that the failure which bedevilled the International Development Strategy for both the First and Second Development Decades will not be the fate of the International Development Strategy for the Third Development Decade.131.	For us  in the African continent  the Lagos Plan of Action marks an important beginning. The Plan encompasses a continental development strategy which marks out the priorities for economic development between now and the year 2000.132.	We in Africa have no choice but to work for collective self-reliance. Only when we achieve that can we reduce our individual vulnerability to the whims of the present economic system.133.	As a least developed country  Uganda commends the special session for recognizing the problems peculiar to the least developed countries and for agreeing on a special programme for that group of countries. We look forward to speedy and successful implementation of that programme.134.	On the question of official development aid  it is clear that we need that aid in order to meet basic short-term needs. We therefore appeal to the developed countries to exercise greater political will for the purpose of achieving the target of contributing 0.7 per cent of their gross national product by 1985  and 1 per cent of their gross national product by 1990.135.	But I must sound a warning here. Although we need aid to deal with basic needs  aid cannot be a substitute for radical change in the structure of existing economic relations. Aid can play only a marginal role in our struggle for economic emancipation and prosperity.136.	This year we celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. Over the years that historical document has served as an important reference point for millions of colonial peoples struggling for self-determination. Inspired by it  many nations of Asia  the Caribbean and Africa  including my own country  have been able to attain their dream of national independence. This year should therefore be a time for celebration and rejoicing.137.	But our joy on this occasion is tempered by the sombre realization  as we look around  that there are still many vestiges of entrenched oppression in our present world. There are still areas where the goal of self-determination remains but a dream. We in Uganda will continue to support those peoples in their struggle until their dreams are converted into the reality of freedom.598138.	The recent victory of the people of Zimbabwe has once again demonstrated the fact that a people united in struggle for a just cause must and always will triumph  no matter how long it takes for that triumph to materialize.139.	The victory of the people of Zimbabwe should serve notice to others in the region that their own fortress of oppression is not invincible. They must accept the impending change  which is inevitable  or face the grim consequences of their folly.140.	For our part  the triumph of Zimbabwe inspires us to redouble our efforts in favour of the forces of liberation. The tide of freedom has now crossed the Limpopo. We shall not rest until that tide embraces the Cape of Good Hope.141.	We are very disturbed by the continued saga of South Africa's occupation of Namibia. That illegal occupation continues in clear defiance of the categorical decisions of the Security Council  the General Assembly and the International Court of Justice.142.	Instead of terminating its illegal occupation of that country the racist regime is working ever more frantically to entrench its presence in Namibia. Now it is organizing the puppet Turnhalle Alliance as a substitute for the true representative of the Namibian people. We in Africa are very familiar with the mockery of these so-called internal settlements. We were not deceived by similar gimmicks in the past; we shall not be hoodwinked by the Turnhalle farce either.143.	Any serious negotiations on the future of Namibia must be conducted with the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO]  the sole and authentic representative of the Namibian people.144.	We salute the people of Namibia under the leadership of SWAPO for the heroic resistance they are mounting against the occupying racist Power. We want to assure them of our steadfast support in their just struggle. SWAPO had displayed a remarkable spirit of compromise by accepting various initiatives for a negotiated settlement  including the present United Nations plan for elections. But South Africa has responded to those gestures by consolidating its intransigence.145.	Meanwhile  in South Africa itself apartheid continues to take its toll. The edifice of oppression is growing and becoming more vicious every day. In a futile attempt to stem the growing tide of resistance  the masters of apartheid have organized a new wave of repression. Increasingly we are witnessing the indiscriminate shooting of peaceful demonstrators and the torture and assassination of political detainees.146.	The uprising of the students  the strikes by the workers  the acts of sabotage and the increased activities of the guerrillas in urban centres  all testify to the fact that the struggle in South Africa had gained both in momentum and in quality.147.	There is no doubt that the racist regime in Pretoria is strengthened in its arrogance and intransigence by the collaboration it continues to receive from some Western countries.148.	It is no longer a secret that South Africa has now developed nuclear capability. It is inconceivable that South Africa  standing on its own  could have become a nuclear Power. Clearly  South Africa has acquired nuclear capability as a direct result of the well-known collaboration between some Western countries and the racist regime in the field of nuclear technology.149.	We all know that a desperate man is also a very dangerous person. There is no telling the purpose for which the racists will choose to deploy their newfound capability. The Western collaborators are responsible for this ominous development. They must  therefore  bear full responsibility for the adverse consequences it may bear for the African continent.150.	Year after year  in one resolution after another  we at the United Nations have continued to speak the language of reason and moderation. Yet one thing is clear. We have been talking the language of reason to fanatical racists who are impervious to the appeals of reason. It is now time therefore to turn the resolutions of the Security Council and this Assembly into action  because the impact of action is something the Pretoria regime cannot ignore.151.	It is now time for the Security Council to take specific enforcement measures  including the imposition of economic sanctions against South Africa under Chapter VII of the Charter. We have  however  noticed with great disappointment that some Western Powers in the Security Council are reluctant to impose economic sanctions against South Africa. Yet those same Powers have in the past been only too keen to invoke Chapter VII in other situations  the gravity of which could not possibly compare with the situation in South Africa. What we are witnessing here is yet another demonstration of international double standards. The people of Africa have suffered long enough as a result of the hypocrisy with which matters affecting our wellbeing are treated by the same Western Powers.152.	Uganda calls upon all members of the Security Council to put the need for international peace and security as well as the interests of the suffering peoples of southern Africa before any other parochial considerations. Now is the time to act and to act positively before it is too late.153.	The developments in the Middle East give cause for great concern to my delegation. The prospects for peace in that region have become more dim as the Israeli authorities have become more bold in their defiance of international opinion as well as in their persecution of Palestinian Arabs  a people whose only crime has been that it has stood resolutely for its right to be a free and independent nation.154.	We condemn most strongly the recent law passed by the Israeli parliament proclaiming the fiction of Jerusalem as the so-called eternal and indivisible capital of Israel. The cynicism of the Zionists knows no bounds. It is an act of supreme political and religious insensitivity. It is a deliberate ploy to change the religious and political character of Jerusalem  thereby presenting the world with a fait accompli.155.	We call upon the international community to reject that Zionist manoeuvre unanimously and unequivocally. In that connection  my delegation commends the Governments that have registered their disapproval of the Israeli action by closing their embassies in Jerusalem.156.	Like the racists in Pretoria  the Zionists have become very desperate because all the years of systematic terror  destruction and persecution have failed to break the will of the Palestinian people. Instead  the Zionists are now faced with massive and popular resistance the proportions of which neither their tanks nor their bulldozers can contain.157.	Faced with this political situation  the Israeli authorities have responded by deploying more repressive measures. During this year the world has been treated to the tragic drama of harassment by terrorists and the deportation of political leaders  detention and the torture of detainees  indiscriminate destruction of homes as a means of collective punishment and the continued expropriation of Palestinian land.158.	Like South Africa  Israel can afford to trample on the rights of the Palestinian people and disregard international opinion only because of the support provided by the imperialist Powers. It is clear to my delegation that in both the Middle East and southern Africa we are fighting objectively the same enemy  namely imperialism  which has chosen to prop up the oppressive systems in those two regions.159.	We pledge solidarity with the people of Palestine in its struggle  which is also an anti-imperialist struggle  under the leadership of its sole and legitimate representative  the PLO. Uganda will continue to support the right of the Palestinian people to have an independent sovereign State in its homeland. That element must constitute the centrepiece of any comprehensive peace formula for the Middle East.160.	Our concern for the self-determination and independence of peoples is a commitment of principle about which there can be neither equivocation nor compromise. It is therefore a matter of considerable embarrassment to my delegation that a fellow member of OAU continues to frustrate the people of Western Sahara in their rightful quest for self-determination. I refer here to Morocco's continued occupation of the territory of Western Sahara.161.	In spite of the unequivocal resolutions of OAU  the nonaligned countries and the General Assembly  as well as the clear opinion of the International Court of Justice  Morocco has persisted in its illegal occupation of Western Sahara. It is not yet too late for Morocco to correct its indiscretion and relieve Africa of this scandal. Once again  we appeal to Morocco to follow the brave and principled example of Mauritania  and withdraw from the territory of Western Sahara immediately.162.	Uganda will continue to support the struggle of the people of Western Sahara  under the leadership of POLISARIO for the complete liberation of its homeland. In that connection  Uganda  like the majority of States members of OAU  has already accorded full recognition to the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic.163.	Uganda also recognizes the right to self-determination of the people of East Timor and the people of Belize. It is our hope that  in this twentieth year of the adoption of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  the United Nations will not turn a blind eye to the plight of those peoples.164.	Uganda is committed to the principle and practice of nonalignment. We wish to determine our course of development freely and independently  without any interference from the big Powers. Over the last year  however  we have witnessed with alarm the acceleration of big Power rivalry. As this rivalry intensifies  the big Powers stalk the globe  seeking new areas to dominate. Uganda is therefore very concerned about the increasing big Power military presence in our region  including the Indian Ocean. Any conflict resulting from the tension c. sated "" Â»v this presence would affect us very seriously.165.	We want our region to be free from big Power military presence and we want the Indian Ocean to be a zone of peace. Uganda hopes that adequate preparations will be made for the Conference on the Indian Ocean  due to be held in 1981  at Colombo  on the implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace. Similarly  we call upon all countries to give serious consideration to the proposal by the President of Madagascar for a summit meeting of the countries in the Indian Ocean region to discuss this matter.166.	Today is the eighteenth anniversary of Uganda's national independence. I must seek the indulgence of the Assembly to make a few remarks concerning developments in my country over the last year.167.	Since the liberation of Uganda from the grip of the Fascist dictatorship we have experienced many difficulties  but we have also made some significant progress. During this past year the north-eastern region of the country has suffered from a serious famine caused by drought. This famine has claimed the lives of many people. However  through sustained local and international efforts  the situation has been brought under control. I wish to express the gratitude of the people and Government of Uganda to the Governments  United Nations agencies and other international agencies that have contributed generously to the relief efforts.168.	Unhappily  Uganda also continues to experience some difficulties along its borders. There have been periodic incursions into the country from across the borders  spearheaded by remnants of Amin's army. Although it has taken us some time to organize our security system  Uganda is determined to put an end to this nuisance and maintain security and stability.169.	As representatives are aware  since our liberation the affairs of my country have been managed by the Uganda National Liberation Front  a broad coalition representing all the major tendencies within our political spectrum.170.	As in every society  the existence of different political tendencies often gives rise to contradictions. Some of the contradictions have a positive impact on society  while others leave a negative mark. In Uganda we have learnt to accept our contradictions openly and honestly and we are determined to resolve them politically  through the democratic process.171.	We are proud of the democratic freedom which exists in our country today  only a year and a half after the overthrow of one of the most oppressive regimes in modern history. We have free and thriving mass media. The Ugandan people are able to organize politically in an atmosphere of complete freedom. We value these democratic gains and we intend to consolidate them further.172.	Uganda is preparing for general elections  to be held on 10 December 1980  which  as the Assembly knows  is also Human Rights Day.173.	The process of political rehabilitation will continue alongside the programme for economic reconstruction. Economic reconstruction is not possible without a democratic and stable polity. As we enter the nineteenth year of our independence we are determined to achieve both goals  and in place of the ruins of the Fascist dictatorship we shall rebuild a free and prosperous Uganda"
"139",7137,"UKR",35,1980,"ï»¿The Ukrainian delegation would like to join in addressing congratulations to Mr. von Wechmar on his election to the position of President of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. I am convinced that under his presidency the Assembly will deal successfully with the burning issues before it.111.	We note with satisfaction that the family of the United Nations has now become still bigger. After their successful struggle against racism  the people of Zimbabwe have won their independence. We also welcome Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to the United Nations.112.	In a few weeksâ time  on 24 October  it will be 35 years since the Charter entered into force. During that period mankind has lived through many trials and tribulations. In the course of the complex and at times controversial development of the historical process there have been  along with indisputable successes achieved by the forces of peace and progress in strengthening international security  repeated manifestations of the imperialist policy of diktat  the whip-ping up of tension  interference in the internal affairs of States and the unleashing of military conflicts. Yet  whatever the course developments followed  the most outstanding achievement of this period has been the demonstration of the fact that it is possible to break the tragic cycle in which peace is only a short breathing-space between world wars.113.	The 1970s have left their mark in world history. Without exaggeration it can be said that this past decade has been most productive in terms of the transition from confrontation to co-operation on terms of equality among States with different social and economic systems. During this period  as a result of efforts by countries in the socialist community and other peoples and States genuinely seeking to preserve peace  the policy of peaceful coexistence has been strengthened and has begun to take on real meaning. Moreover  the process of detente has gained momentum  and favourable conditions have been created for the solution of pressing problems.114.	Recently  however  the international situation has worsened. Leaders of the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO]  and of the United States in particular  have directed their foreign policy towards under-mining detente and ensuring military superiority over the socialist community.115.	The well-known NATO decision on a large-scale and long-term increase in military budgets and the plans to deploy in Western Europe new American nuclear missiles testify specifically to that. The United States has frozen the ratification of the SALT II Treaty and at the same time adopted a ""new nuclear strategy"" which makes the real danger of the unleashing of a thermonuclear war immeasurably greater  for it is based on the concept that a ""limited nuclear war"" is possible.116.	The partnership between those in militaristic and reactionary quarters in the West and Beijing  hegemonists who are seeking a further build-up of tension to achieve their chauvinistic great-Power designs has a negative impact on international relations.117.	Consequently we are compelled to state that the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly is taking place in a very complicated international situation.118.	The Government of the Ukrainian SSR feels that today  more than ever  the United Nations must concentrate its efforts on preventing and eliminating threats to peace  strengthening detente in the political  military and other fields and adopting concrete measures to limit the arms race and achieve disarmament.119.	As was emphasized in a statement on 30 August at Alma-Ata by Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev  General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  President of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR: ""For States and peoples today  no task is more pressing than to prevent the imperialist policy of positions of strength displacing detente  and the spiral of the arms race gaining greater and more highly dangerous speed"".120.	The Soviet Union and the socialist community have advanced a broad programme of measures to strengthen peace  end the arms race and achieve disarmament. Guided by the programme for the further struggle for peace and international co-operation and for the freedom and independence of peoples  which was adopted by the Twenty-fifth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  the USSR has put forward in the United Nations far- reaching proposals offering realistic approaches to a solution of the crucial problems of today. These initiatives have been supported and approved by the General Assembly.121.	The documents adopted at the meeting on 14 and 15 May of the Political Consultative Committee of the States Parties to the Warsaw Treaty  imbued with an awareness of the historic responsibility for the destinies of peace  contain  inter alia  a proposal for an early convening of a meeting at the highest level of leaders of States from all continents   The socialist countries are convinced that  despite the aggravation of the situation brought about by the actions of imperialist circles  there nevertheless do exist socio-political forces capable of preventing any slippage towards a new cold war  of ensuring normal peaceful coexistence among States with different social systems  and of averting the threat of a world thermonuclear conflict  and objective possibilities of doing all this. This conviction is shared by all the Soviet people and by the working people of the Ukrainian SSR who fully support the Leninist foreign policy line of the Soviet State.122.	In their desire to strengthen international security the socialist countries are stepping up their struggle for detente  for ending the arms race and for disarmament and we call upon other States to do likewise.123.	The proposal entitled ""Urgent measures for reducing the danger of war""  submitted by Andrei Gromyko  member of the Politburo of the Central Commit-tee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the USSR  serves to confirm the constructive approach to the main problems of the world today.124.	The Ukrainian delegation fully supports that proposal.125.	Urgent measures to be implemented include the prevention of the expansion of existing military alliances or the creation of new ones; the cessation  as of 1 January 1981  of the build-up of armed forces and conventional armaments by all States and primarily by the permanent members of the Security Council and the countries which have military agreements with them; the strengthening of security guarantees for non-nuclear States; and the renunciation by all nuclear Powers of all nuclear explosions for one year. All of this would certainly have a restraining effect on the growing danger of war  would contribute to reducing tension in inter-State relations and would serve as a good basis for reaching agreement on the most pressing problem of strengthening peace and international security.126.	The Soviet Union and the countries of the socialist community have submitted for negotiation  in particular in the General Assembly  several specific proposals covering a broad spectrum of measures for disarmament  some partial and some very radical. They are dealt with in detail in the USSR memorandum entitled ""Peace  disarmament and international security guarantees"" . The Ukrainian SSR believes that the speedy implementation of those proposals is a major task facing the Assembly at this session.127.	We attach primary importance to ending the nuclear arms race  which creates the greatest threat to universal peace and the very survival of civilization. Despite the tremendous complexity of the problem  we believe mankind can halt the unbridled build-up of nuclear potential. The Ukrainian SSR favours the immediate initiation of effective talks to end the production of all types of nuclear weapons  gradually to reduce their stockpiles and then to eliminate them completely.128.	Another pressing matter is completing the tripartite talks on the complete and general prohibition of nuclear- weapon tests. In the interests of reaching a mutually acceptable agreement on this issue  the Soviet Union has taken important steps to meet its partners in the talks halfway. Yet I must note with concern that the United States and the United Kingdom are clearly protracting the negotiations  often reneging on the proposals they themselves put forward.129.	The Ukrainian SSR believes that nuclear disarmament should be accompanied by the strengthening of political and international legal guarantees for the security of States  and this includes the drafting and conclusion of a world treaty on the non-use of force in international relations.130.	Alongside the most destructive type of arms- nuclear weaponsâchemical weapons  an extremely dangerous means of mass annihilation  have been in existence for many decades. Moreover  the United States has expanded production of chemical war agents while actively developing and testing new varieties of these lethal weapons. We strongly advocate an immediate ban on the development  production and stockpiling of such chemical weapons and the destruction of their stockpiles. The socialist countries  including the Ukrainian SSR  have made their contribution to drafting a relevant international convention. We appeal to all States to make an energetic effort to complete the drafting of this international legal instrument as soon as possible.131.	The Ukrainian SSR has consistently advocated banning the production of new types and systems of weapons of mass destruction. Of particular relevance today is the prevention of the development and deployment of the neutron weapon. The drafting of a convention banning radiological weapons must also be completed.132.	It has frequently been stated from this very rostrum that the arms race represents a heavy burden for mankind. While creating a threat to universal peace  it also consumes enormous material and intellectual resources that could more properly be used to raise the standard of well-being of peoples and overcome the economic backwardness of developing countries.133.	The problem of streamlining international co-operation to preserve the environment and nature on this planet has become particularly urgent today. The consideration at this session of the Soviet proposal [see A/35/194] for the inclusion of an item entitled ""Historical responsibility of States for the preservation of nature for present and future generations"" on the agenda of this session will certainly serve that objective. Our delegation believes that primary attention should be devoted to the nefarious consequences of the arms race for environmental protection.134.	The struggle for a peaceful future for peoples  for strengthening international security should be conducted in all directions.135.	The Ukrainian SSR attaches paramount importance to strengthening security in Europe. In recent years there have been extensive and strenuous efforts to implement agreements reached at the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe which was held at Helsinki in 1975. The USSR and countries of the socialist community are playing an active role here. The basic approach they take in European affairs and world politics as a whole is to continue and deepen detente  to flesh it out with effective measures in the field of military detente and to develop equal co-operation and strengthen security.136.	A specific example of that policy is the Soviet proposal to start talks on limiting medium-range nuclear missile arms in Europe simultaneously in organic relationship to the question of United States forward-based nuclear systems in the region.137.	Much remains to be done to ensure stable peace and security in Europe. It is important  in particular  that the forthcoming second review session of the Conference at Madrid be held in a constructive spirit and be crowned with positive results and that a conference be convened on military detente and disarmament in Europe.138.	Strengthening peace and security is in the interests of the peoples of all continents. As has frequently been noted at this session of the General Assembly  there are now several hotbeds of conflict that have emerged as a result of imperialist and militaristic actions. Their elimination would certainly be facilitated by the proposal submitted by the socialist countries on limiting and reducing the level of military presence and military activities in the relevant region  be it the Atlantic  Indian or Pacific Oceans  the Mediterranean Sea or the Persian Gulf.139.	Attempts are being made to step up tension in the Caribbean. We declare from this rostrum our solidarity with socialist Cuba  which continues to be subjected to pressure by United States imperialist circles.140.	Recently the situation in the Middle East has become still more explosive. The separate talks conducted on the basis of the Camp David accords cannot bring about a settlement of the conflict. Israel has been expanding the network of its settlements in occupied lands and in a recent brazen move it proclaimed Jerusalem to be its ""eternal capital""  a move quite properly condemned by the Security Council in its resolution 478 (1980).141.	At the seventh emergency special session on the question of Palestine  the General Assembly stressed that the key to a comprehensive settlement in the region lies in granting the Arab people of Palestine the right to self-determination up to and including the creation of their own State. Such a settlement would require the withdrawal of Israeli troops from all Arab territories occupied in 1967  including East Jerusalem  and ensuring the sovereignty and security of all the States of the region. All parties concerned should participate in the settlement  including the Arab people of Palestine  with the PLO as its sole and legitimate representative. Other problems of the region also require political settlement by peaceful means.142.	A tense situation has been created around Afghanistan  which pursues a policy of non-alignment. An undeclared war inspired and directed by the United States of America and China is being waged against that country. Attempts are being made to strangle the Afghan revolution and to turn Afghanistan into a staging area  threatening the Soviet Union and the peace-loving independent countries of the East. The Government of Afghanistan has put forward a proposal for a political settlement of the situation. Essentially it calls for a complete and guaranteed cessation of all forms of hostile activities against the Government and people of Afghanistan. It is now up to those who brought about the tense situation in that region to respond. As to the introduction of the so-called Afghan question in the agenda of this Assembly  we consider it to be gross interference in the internal affairs of the Afghan people.143.	The United States and China have recently been seeking to aggravate further the situation in South-East Asia. We fully support the programme for the normalization of the situation in the region submitted by Viet Nam  Laos and the People's Republic of Kampuchea.144.	The Ukrainian SSR advocates the peaceful reunification of Korea on a democratic basis without foreign interference and the withdrawal of foreign troops from South Korea. Recent events in South Korea confirm the urgency of that demand and make still more pressing implementation of General Assembly resolution 3390 A and B (XXX).145.	Attempts to revive the cold war are inseparably linked to a new offensive against human rights and to massive violations of the rights of working people in capitalist countries. The United States has not ratified the International Covenants on Human Rights  and it is in fact in the United States that those rights are most blatantly flouted. This year alone massive reprisals have been taken against participants in actions to defend the rights of black people in Miami and other cities of the United States. American arms are used to suppress human rights in Chile  Bolivia and El Salvador  and some United States allies are not lagging far behind. The Government of Great Britain has been taking punitive measures in Northern Ireland  accompanied by the use of torture and other inhumane treatment. With the connivance of the authorities  pro-Nazi forces and organizations are rearing their ugly heads in a number of Western European countries. Does that not constitute the flouting of the well-known principles of the Helsinki agreements  which representatives of capitalist countries defend in their speeches?146.	Human rights are grossly and extensively violated in the Arab territories occupied by Israel. South Africa persists in its infamous policy and practice of apartheid  while racist excesses continue in Namibia. All this is taking place with the obvious connivance of the leading imperialist Powers  whose co-operation with South Africa and Israel is in fact the main obstacle to ending those crimes against humanity.147.	Socialism ensures human rightsânot only in words but in deeds. In our Republic they are guaranteed by the provisions of the new Constitution of the Ukrainian SSR. My delegation can state with satisfaction that our Republic's reports regarding compliance with international conventions and the International Covenants on Human Rights have been recognized by the Committee on Human Rights and the Economic and Social Council as comprehensive and consistent with the requirements of international agreements.148.	Twenty years ago the General Assembly  acting on the initiative of the Soviet Union  adopted the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  an important instrument in the struggle against colonialism.149.	However  in order to ensure the complete elimination of the vestiges of that shameful system  to grant independence to the peoples of Namibia  Micronesia and other colonial Territories  and finally to eradicate apartheid and racial discrimination  it will be necessary to overcome the resistance of neo-colonialists and imperialists and to strengthen the unity of action of peoples fighting against colonialism in all its manifestations.150.	The working people of the Soviet Ukraine  a republic of 50 million inhabitants  along with all Soviet people  support .national liberation movements  contribute to the strengthening of the statehood of newly independent countries  and protect their sovereignty against the intrigues of imperialist mercenaries and the agents of monopolies.151.	The final collapse of colonialism and the attainment of full independence by the developing countries are closely linked to the struggle for economic liberation from imperial-ism and the sway of foreign monopolistic capital  primarily transnational corporations.152.	My delegation would emphasize that the current attempt of the United States to revive the cold war seriously undermines the prospects of economic co-operation among States. Today the United States and its allies are resorting to economic blockades  sanctions  trade embargoes and financial boycotts; they are freezing foreign assets and reneging on obligations entered into in respect of the development of relations in the economic  scientific and technological fields. Those actions are in violation of the Charter and international law  and they are in conflict with the progressive provisions of the Declaration and Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order and the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States.153.	The imperialist policy of the West is reflected in the deliberate procrastination in talks on restructuring international economic relations on a democratic and equitable basis and in the desire to side-track us from the truly urgent economic problems. That was once again demonstrated most vividly at the eleventh special session of the General Assembly  on economic problems.154.	The Ukrainian SSR is taking an active part in the foreign economic relations of the Soviet State  and it makes a tangible contribution to the development of the economic  scientific and technical co-operation of the USSR with fraternal socialist countries and developing countries. We consistently advocate extensive business-like relations with all interested States on an equal  non-discriminatory and mutually beneficial basis.155.	We are now completing our tenth five-year plan. The forthcoming Twenty-sixth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union will be marked by new achievements  and the Twenty-sixth Congress of the Ukrainian Communist Party will sum up the results achieved. During the current five-year period the economic potential of our society has grown immeasurably  and our social  political and ideological unity has become still stronger. A major stride forward has been taken in raising the living standards of our people and also in education and culture.156.	As V. Shcherbitsky  member of the Politbureau of the Central Committee and First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Ukraine  has emphasized  ""our objectives are clear  and they are nobleânamely  durable peace  security and mutually beneficial cooperationâand we shall persistently work for their realization"".157.	Our Government believes that the thirty-fifth session of the Assembly should become an important milestone in intensification of the struggle of peoples to reduce the danger of war  to eliminate tension  to preserve detente as the leading trend in international relations  and to strengthen peace and the security of peoples."
"140",7184,"URY",35,1980,"ï»¿Mr. President  allow me at the outset to extend to you my warm congratulations on your election to conduct the proceedings of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly  a difficult task that you will undoubtedly perform with the skill and brilliance that have characterized your long diplomatic career. I should also like to express our gratitude and warm appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim  for the splendid way in which he conducted the debates of the Assembly during his term of office.41.	We cannot fail to point out with great satisfaction that this is the first session of the General Assembly in which the independent State of Zimbabwe  which we welcome most warmly  is participating. As the delegations of my country have stated in every forum  we hope that after so many sacrifices and expectations  that new Republic will build itself up in peace and progress by carrying out a true national integration that will exemplify the principles of racial tolerance and solidarity that inspire the United Nations.42.	Similarly  we express our satisfaction at the admission of the new independent State of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  also a member of our regional group  to whom we extend a warm welcome.43.	We come to this thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly in a spirit of peace and confidence yet fully aware of the seriousness of the problems that the world is facing and of the great sense of responsibility that these problems demand from ail peoples  those still on the road to development as well as those that have already achieved their full development  the latter perhaps bearing for that very reason a greater share of that responsibility.44.	In the first place  I should like to point out that for my Government; a careful examination of current world problems allows us to perceive three fundamental points clearly.45.	First  the world is facing a general crisis  in which all social  political  economic and cultural factors are involved. That is the case whether or not we wish it to be so.46.	Secondly  embroiled in this overall crisis  the world has tried to correct some of its aspects piecemeal  by attacking them singly  as if they were unrelated and independent phenomena. That approach conceals and minimizes problems and leads to the failure of the solutions that are sought.47.	Thirdly  today it is possible clearly to perceive the true character of the enemy that we must face and the means to combat it. If the crisis is a general one  a general strategy is required to overcome it. The measures to be adopted in the various sectors must be integrated and coordinated.48.	As a logical consequence of this  we must admit that without an extensive imaginative effort in which the collective conscience of mankind finds the means sincerely and freely to motivate the constructive and collective political will of every State  contemporary problems will not be overcome without a cataclysm in which perhaps a great part of mankind will perish  but from which all the peoples of the earth will certainly suffer.49.	We are encouraged in our optimism by an unyielding faith in God  in the first place  and  secondly  in the fate of mankind  and by the many voices that have been raised to say as much  and in the simple fact that we are assembled here to have a dialogue. That optimism  however  does not dispel our concern. We are worried by the lack of political decisions by the developed industrial powers to take the decisive steps required to implement the many projects and resolutions that have been drawn up in recent decades  in the knowledge that they were of vital importance  as well as to heed the outcry of weak peoples who knock at their doors.50.	The recent report entitled The Global 2000 Report to the President in the preparation of which the entire scientific  technical  research and information potential of the United States has been tapped  contains in its 800 explosive pages enough material to make the world ponder  should other sources of inspiration be needed  on the urgent need to face those vital problems on a universal scale  once and for all  with seriousness and  above all  with responsibility. The report warns us bluntly and with many examples that unless nations take collectively and individually daring and imaginative steps the world must expect severe upheavals upon entering the twenty-first centuryâa prediction on which all the great minds of our time agree.51.	We should like to single out among the various fields of action some of the main subjects concerning which it seems to us that the necessary measures and steps to implement them must be taken forthwith  or which are crucial points that deserve special attention.52.	The political evolution of the world during the year that has elapsed since we first came to this rostrum at the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly6 has given us more than sufficient reason to reassert what we said then about the impossibility of isolating peoples  on the need to strengthen the necessary bonds that unite the international community and the role of universal solidarity as an imperative for world survival.53.	Peace is more than ever the primary goal of international law  because we now know that it is also the basic condition for survival. And peace will not be attained or maintained unless the vital and pressing problems of all the members of the international community  even the humblest  are solved and unless the riches on our planet are distributed fairly  unhampered by boundaries. There can be no peace without justice. There can be no justice without law. And the supremacy of law is the result of a balance in which there is great respect for certain fundamental spiritual values of coexistence  as well as the adaptation of the legal system to contemporary world realities.54.	On the long road to peace  general and complete disarmament is an ideal goal that is not only a means but also an end. The steps taken towards disarmament  however small  will make a powerful contribution to the strengthening of peace. That goal clearly presupposes an earlier spiritual disarmament  understanding and tolerance among all peoples  and the satisfaction of the legitimate aspirations of all. Whether an end or a means  the economic and environmental connotations of disarmament are such that my Government believes it to be incumbent on all peoples to fight tirelessly to achieve progress in that area. My country's meagre military potential does not inhibit it from placing all the moral weight that it possesses as a State and as a law-abiding nation at the service of that ideal  even denouncing the folly of squandering fantastic sums on death  while denying even minimal amounts for the environment and for development  which represent life..55. We know perfectly well that it will be very difficult to achieve spectacular overall solutions in matters related to the blindest and deepest passions of men. We are ready to agree realistically to a partial and gradual approach to positive solutions  but we emphatically reaffirm the need to condemn straightforwardly all forms of biological war  destruction or poisoning of ecosystems and all attempts to modify the climate as an instrument of aggression.56.	In that sense  the extension of the achievements of the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco) through the creation of nuclear free zones in other parts of the world such as the Middle East  southern Asia and Africa seems to us an effective means by which to move further ahead in that area.57.	Since the partition of Palestine  which the United Nations doubtless conceived as a means of bringing a Solomonic peace to that region  the Middle East has gradually become a powder keg charged with threats to world peace which increase as the years go by.58.	The attitude of friendship towards the people of Israel that my Government has traditionally shown is well known. It has been manifested throughout the years  in constant support of what could be considered the legitimate aspirations of the Jewish people. We do not hesitate today to reaffirm that friendship and our conviction that the State of Israel must secure just and lasting peace with its neighbours and respect for its existence within secure and recognized borders.59.	But the irreversible reality of Israel cannot blur another reality which is also irreversible and not incompatible with the first oneâthe existence of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people  which was once asked to sacrifice its national identity  in open defiance of the principle of self-determination  which is one of the fundamental pillars of the United Nations system. Thus  faithful to the traditional principles of our international policy  we support unreservedly the recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to settle in its own land and establish a free and independent State according to the decision adopted in the exercise of its sovereign will.60.	My country is convinced that the solution to this longstanding and painful problem can be found only by means of dialogue and negotiation  in which the Palestinian people have their own spokesmen. We therefore condemn violence and the adoption of unilateral measures which hinder the peaceful and lawful solution of the problem.61.	With regard to Lebanon  last year we reiterated the appeal which we had made for concrete and definitive solutions which would guarantee to this people whose culture and tradition are admirable its integrity and its right to live in peace.  At that time we thought that that appeal  supported by all peace-loving peoples  would be answered during the course of that year. It is a matter of profound regret that the tragedy of the Middle East has engulfed as one of its victims that small and gracious nation  which is linked to our own in so many ways.62.	Once again we make the same appeal  and we earnestly hope that Lebanon will recover its peace and stability.63.	Uruguay  which is tenacious and firm in defending the right to self-determination of peoples  has consistently supported the right of the people of Namibia to attain its independence  freely to determine the political system which it may wish to adopt and to choose its leaders without foreign pressures and within a climate of peace  under the guarantee of the temporary administration of the United Nations.64.	With respect to human rights  it is inevitable that  in view of the strong influence of law in my country  in the history of which regard for law is a constant which has brought us through every difficult phase and juncture  we consider real and deep respect for what are called human rights as a worldwide political phenomenon and a substantial step towards the implementation of a new international law  in which mankind is recognized as a valid subject of law. We believe  however  that  if we wish human rights to pass beyond the state of rhetoric and become tangible and active values in international life  they must not be used as an instrument for political struggle among States or groups with different social and economic philosophies.65.	It is very difficult for the supremacy of law to be safeguarded and to see the possibility of the consistent implementation of human rights as long as we continue to witness the paradox of countries and doctrines that in practice deny freedom  ignore the most elementary rights inherent in the dignity of man and violate all the principles that constitute the achievements of the modern world  and that also attempt to judge the behaviour of other States and social groups which have had to defend themselves from insidious and criminal subversive movements  very often inspired and financed by those same countries. Whether we like it or not  in the struggle against anarchy and organized crime there are  as a consequence of human fallibility  unfortunate but inevitable breaches of those sacred rights.66.	My country is making every possible effort to ensure the maintenance of those rights  despite the resolute internal struggle which it has been forced to undertake  and we are advancing daily towards the full normalization of democratic institutions. Unfortunately  in the domestic sphere of many States contempt for human rights has become normal practice  officially imposed by totalitarian systems  which condemn millions of men to live in spiritual and material conditions which are profoundly harmful to their natural dignity.67.	While this is taking place on the domestic level  at the international level we witness with profound concern the notorious increase of terrorism. Violence and crime have taken the place of dialogue and discussion as a means of political expression and seem to have become one of the characteristics of our time. Once again I wish to state on behalf of my Government that we shall support every collective measure which is submitted and adopted to fight the scourge of terrorism  which is not only in itself disgusting and shameful but also liable to encourage violence and the inevitable hardening of the attitude of institutional machinery and the social groups attacked  with inevitable damage to the respect for human rights which we all wish to secure.68.	My Government wishes to reiterate its fundamental opposition to the policy of apartheid and all forms of racism. This position is based on political and moral considerations which are part of a clear philosophy derived from our deepest cultural traditions. In that regard  our country will cast its vote for all instruments which condemn apartheid.69.	My Government believes that exchange of information is an essential part of modern life and that modern technical means must be fully utilized to facilitate not only the exchange of information but also communication among men and peoples and the dissemination of education and culture.70.	Nevertheless  we must bear in mind the danger that certain aspects of that modern technique may entail for freedom  institutional stability and the cultural identity of peoples. The availability of powerful modern means of spreading culture must be secured for every country and the community of nations must prevent their use to interfere in the internal affairs of States. It must also try to preserve the wealth of national diversity.71.	With regard to the law of the sea  the ninth session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  which was held this year  achieved meaningful progress in the unprecedented efforts on the part of the international community to work out a new legal order for the sea based on recognition of the sovereign rights and the jurisdiction of coastal States in seas adjacent to their coasts up to a limit of 200 miles and on the Continental Shelf  respect for jus communications  the orderly and peaceful use of maritime spaces  the rational exploitation of its resources  the protection and preservation of the marine environment  cooperation in the development of scientific research and the administration of the seabed and ocean floor beyond national jurisdiction by an international authority endowed with the appropriate power to organize and control all activities in the exploration and exploitation of the resources and to establish a production policy in that area  which is the common heritage of mankind  the resources of which can only be used under the protection of an international system  that is  a system established with the consent of the international community as representative of mankind.72.	The present stage of the negotiations enables us to predict that once generally accepted formulas on some still pending matters have been found and final adjustments to the texts have been made  the work of the Conference is to culminate in the adoption of a convention at Caracas in 1981. The peoples' expectations can no longer be delayed. The last stretch demands a final effort of good will  especially on the part of the industrialized Powers  in order to reach the goal whose attainment will be  without any doubt  a most important factor for the stability of international relations and the consolidation of world peace.73.	The Government of Uruguay cannot but point out once again that the principle of the common heritage of mankind is an imperative rule of international law which does not admit  consequently  of limited agreements or unilateral decisions that contravene it  such as the laws which some States have passed or intend to pass to authorize their nationals to carry out the exploitation of the resources of the international area. Such laws violate that principle and have no validity in the international community. Uruguay deplores such conduct and rejects any attempt to exert pressure on the Conference that such conduct might entail.74.	The new law of the sea  including both the customary law that has arisen from the generalized practice of States and the law that will be embodied in the convention  offers a great challenge  especially to the developing countries  in terms of their full assumption of responsibilities directly related to the wellbeing and advancement of their peoples  with the opening of new horizons for employment  study and research for youth and with the most active participation and cooperation for the establishment of a new international economic order. The United Nations and the specialized agencies concerned must be prepared as of now to offer developing countries the invaluable service of helping them fully to assume those responsibilities within the framework established by them in the pursuit of their national objectives.75.	Very soon we will compromise the tenth anniversary of the United Nations Conference on the Environment  held at Stockholm in 1972  which symbolized the awakening of the world's attention to this very serious problem of the accelerated destruction of the environment. The importance and seriousness of the problem  instead of decreasing during these eight years  has only grown. Just as in the economic sphere  the words of warning uttered by wise men and experts have not been heeded and the seeds they have sown have yielded only rhetorical fruit. The measures which have been recommended and even decided upon in many international forums are not being implemented and the expectations for the future  unless destructive trends are stopped and the process is reversed  cannot be favourable.76.	Nevertheless  there are certain grounds for optimism because the problem is coming to its climax and the persistent and efficient efforts of specialized international organizations and of the thinking elite in the preparation of projects and plans to correct the deterioration in all its complex aspects are gradually convincing Governments and those responsible for the leadership of peoples of the need to take radical and imaginative measures. On the other hand  the environmental problem has had a positive influence by revealing the essential oneness among men and among all the elements of nature.77.	The report of the Governing Council of UNEP on its eighth session shows that work has been done and is being done well. It is now up to the Governments to implement the recommendations.78.	We should like to point out two of the subjects discussed in Nairobi which we find particularly important.79.	The first one deals with the World Conservation Strategy  the result of three years of work by a select group of scientists of universal renown under the guidance of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources and with the endorsement of UNESCO  FAO and UNEP.80.	This remarkable document effectively reconciles conservation and development  presents a clear and sensible definition of priorities and convincingly indicates the urgent need to preserve the living resources of the planet on which  ultimately  the survival of mankind depends. All this comes together with adequate and pragmatic machinery which places at the disposal of Governments the necessary technical and legal tools to carry out in a practical and efficient manner a good conservation policy. Now we must go from words to action and allocate the necessary funds  negotiate bilateral and multilateral financial aid and at the same time offer UNEP and the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources the sustained support that will permit the practical and progressive adoption of their plans.81.	The second point we wish to emphasize is also related to the effective application of environmental policy  the need for which seems hot to have been fully grasped. We are referring to the world meeting on environmental law preparatory to the tenth session of the Governing Council of UNEP  which all States Members of the United Nations will attend. At this solemn meeting the tenth anniversary of the Stockholm Conference will be commemorated and an assessment will be made of all that has been achieved up to now and what remains to be done in such a delicate matter. With regard to those achievements  the elaboration and consolidation of an appropriate legal framework is fundamental for the effective finalization of a policy in which so far theoretical statements have not been lacking  but for which the adequate institutional and legal instruments to put it into practice do not yet exist. Uruguay is proud of the fact that it is planned to hold this important preparatory meeting in Montevideo  whose legal tradition is thus honoured by the holding of such a transcendental event in the field of law.82.	We have no reason to feel free from the worries which have been expressed in this forum for several consecutive years concerning the world economic situation. On the contrary  it continues to deteriorate and that deterioration is accelerating and becoming more acute. This is dangerous because the peoples' frustration is a seedbed of violence. We emphatically stated the same concern a short time ago at the eleventh special session of the General Assembly. The persistence of recession and inflation  the increase in unemployment  exchange instability  maladjustments in the balance of payments in industrialized countries  protectionist pressures and  to sum up  the whole negative syndrome in which the inability of those countries to adopt political decisions in keeping with the magnitude of the global crisis hinders the economic progress of developing countries.83.	The essential characteristic of the contemporary world economic system is the growing interdependence of all the peoples of the world  an interdependence which is in the process of accelerated intensification. It is obvious that we cannot find solutions in a policy of isolated blocs. Without the overall world economic approach that also calls for a long-term overall economic policy  it will be very difficult to overcome the serious problems of the present situation that overwhelm the peoples of the developing world  as well as those in developed countries. That collective and efficient approach requires an optimization of the allocation of productive resources. This also implies a redistribution and relocation of industries in accordance with the competitive capacity of each country  a general opening of the economies to secure an effective role for competition  and a strategy that will cover all the areas of development without excluding any key sector.84.	My country  like many other developing countries  is trying to apply those same principles at home  in an attempt to achieve production in those sectors in which it has a comparative advantage. The opening of our economies to the outside world would thus contribute to the sound development of the world economy through a rational distribution of productive activity  while respecting the comparative advantage of the various participants in the system. These principles are usually enunciated and defended in theory by the industrialized countries. Unfortunately  they do not put into practice what they advocate in theory  and apply protectionist policies that militate against the weaker countries and which  in the end  damage the world economy as a whole.85.	This situation has an adverse effect on countries which  like mine  face the typical problems of a small market economy. After many years of trying a development system based on a domestic market  which proved inadequate because it did not permit an optimum allocation of resources  we decided to base our development process on open economy principles as part of a more dynamic and competitive market  the international market.86.	Another point we wish to make relates to development of food and agricultural production. Consideration of this question cannot be separated from that of trade  in view of the detrimental effects of protectionist barriers on efficient food production in the developing countries. The world situation  in this respect  is frankly alarming; hence we endorse all measures that the international community may adopt in favour of a new world food order  which  in our view  is a precondition for any new international economic order.87.	In confronting this gigantic task  we feel legitimate concern over the growing trend towards protectionism on the part of the industrialized countries  which seriously limits and can cancel out the benefits of the option. The detrimental effects of this phenomenon cannot be underestimated. Where the developing countries prepare themselves to compete in international markets according to the laws of a market economy and their efforts are artificially rendered ineffective by protectionist measuresâwhich often take the form of nontariff barriers imposed on specious groundsâ the access of those countries to international markets is made impossible  and all the mechanisms which regulate those markets are largely distorted. All this is aggravated by the policies of subsidies and ""dumping""  which offset all comparative advantages enjoyed by the developing countries  especially in food production. Obviously  this policy runs counter to all the proposed incentives for food production in the world  and to recognition of the need to provide facilities to those countries so that they can achieve sustained development and thus alleviate dangerous international tensions.88.	Developing countries are still suffering acutely from the problems derived from the energy crisis ever since the marked increase in oil prices in 1973. Uruguay  which totally lacks this resource  is one of the Latin American countries that have suffered the most as a result of the serious impact of the oil price increase on its overall imports and on its industrialization process. Our deepest concern relates to the need to create machinery to ensure minimum supplies at reasonable prices  efficient use of this resource  the search for alternative sources and coordination of acceptable special financing. The overriding need to develop a coherent world energy policy based on a concept of inexorable solidarity among all countries and on their right to have an equitable share of the world's natural resources is one of the most urgent imperatives of this decadeâan imperative which must be supplemented by intensive research efforts in this field by those countries able to do so. Such efforts must be geared to finding alternative solutions for the day  all too near  when oil is exhausted. It is to be hoped that these concerns will be reflected at the United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy  to be held in August 1981 at Nairobi. Should that Conference fail to face this crucial subject realistically and pragmatically  a rude blow will be dealt to the expectations of mankind  which views this energy problem as one of the most serious and immediate threats to its present and future wellbeing.89.	We have observed with satisfaction the favourable attitude among developing countries towards energy cooperation that is being carried out at various levels. The members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries [OPEC] have established an ambitious programme to guarantee oil supplies to the developing world and have come up with a preferential system of prices and financing indexed to each country's degree of development. The same trend has been noticed at the regional level  too  a result of which is the historic agreement between Venezuela and Mexico to cooperate in this field with the Central American and Caribbean countries  as well as the proposal of the President of Mexico at the thirty-fourth session of the General Assemblyâa proposal warmly supported by my country.90.	It is vital to ensure the transition of the present-day economy  which is based on hydrocarbons  to an economy based essentially on new and renewable energy sources.91.	Uruguay attaches particular importance to the problems of science and technology  because the attainment of development on a sound basis is impossible without the establishment of an endogenous capacity in this Held. To that end  we hope that the resolutions of the United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development  held at Vienna last year  will be implemented.92.	My country has participated actively in discussions of the subject of economic and technical cooperation among developing countries  a fundamental component of the new international economic order inspired by the principles enshrined in the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States. We note with satisfaction the various efforts being made to implement the Arusha Programme for Collective Self-reliance  adopted by the Group of 77   and especially the first short-term and medium-term plan of action on global priorities for economic cooperation among developing countries. It has  already been decided to negotiate a global system of trade preferences in the Group of 77  as well as to identify practical agreements on marketing and operations that Governments may oversee directly. It is of great importance that the Group of 77 has this year  for the first time  included on its agenda the question of energy within the framework of economic cooperation among developing countries. It has been agreed that trade  various sources and forms of energy  raw materials  foodstuffs  technology and other related matters should be considered by the Group of 77 in a consistent and integrated way.93.	There is no doubt that the developing countries have ample means to establish new and valuable forms of horizontal cooperation  and when their vast resources begin to be mobilized there will ensue great transformations for the wellbeing of our countries and the world economy as a whole.94.	All of the measures relating to the various subjects we are considering must  we repeat  be included within the framework of a vigorous policy of international redistribution of labour  ensuring the transfer of technology to developing countries and consequently their industrialization. In that policy  attention to short-term problems that are immediately vital is as important and inescapable as complementary attention to long-term problems  because without solutions of that nature all the rest will be nothing but an ineffective palliative for permanent needs and will jeopardize the future of peoples.95.	We do not wish to end this statement without expressing our discouragement at the inability to achieve during the eleventh special session of the General Assembly the consensus necessary to approve ail the proposals submitted for its consideration. Unfortunately for all the countries of the world  that session has passed into history as a setback on the long  hard road the developing countries have set out upon towards the establishment of a new international economic order. Once again we have missed an excellent opportunity to show our peoples the important results that can be achieved through international cooperation. Even so  it is an important historic duty for the General Assembly at this session to continue with decisiveness the efforts that have been begun to initiate global negotiations planned for 12 January next  and to adopt the International Development Strategy for the 1980s.96.	Before closing I wish to express my Government's appreciation and recognition of the efforts of the Secretary General  assisted by his staff  in carrying out his important task by paying efficient and untiring attention to the many complex problemsâsome of them particularly delicateâ that he has had to face within the area of competence of the Organization.97.	I wish to reiterate our unwavering adherence to the purposes and principles of the Charter  with which the international policy of my country fully concurs  our faith in its permanent and ever contemporary applicability  and our hope that the serious threats to international peace and security which hover over the horizon like dark clouds and the various obstacles to the full development of harmonious and mutually respectful relations among all nations based on justice will be overcome through the joint efforts of all in this Organization and the tenacious and unceasing application of the means and instruments available to the Organization for the implementation of its lofty and noble objectives which are identical with those of civilization. Uruguay commits all its material resources and the rich patrimony of its spiritual forces to the confirmation of that faith and the realization of that hope."
"141",7231,"USA",35,1980,"ï»¿Mr. President  I congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. It is a recognition of your extraordinary diplomatic skills  but  more important  your election is a tribute to your country and to its contribution to international cooperation and understanding.52.	On behalf of the United States delegation to this Assembly  I come here today to express anew the United States commitment to the United Nations. I come also to express our hopes for its future at a moment when the world is deeply troubled by tension and uncertainty. Peace is threatened by smouldering regional conflicts and by assaults of the strong upon the weak. Nations large and small are buffeted by steeply rising oil prices and serious economic strains. Within many countries poverty and oppression form an explosive combination.53.	A few weeks ago I spoke to this Assembly about the international economy.  I stressed the obligation of nations to cooperate in facing world economic problems: payments imbalances  energy inflation  slowed growth in many developing countries  the spectres of environmental decay and even famine.54.	Our inability to reach a consensus on procedures for global negotiations is a pause in the process  not a failure in our objectives. I do not mean to say that the differences that have kept us from finding a formula for global negotiations can be glossed over. They are real. They are substantive. But we are prepared to use the span of this General Assembly to continue discussions that can lead to procedures  to an agenda and to a negotiating structure that will foster broad agreement among all the nations here represented.55.	Today I want to look beyond economic problems to the one condition that is a prerequisite for all material progress: peace. If we truly care about building a world in which peace and justice prevail  the world's nations  and this Organization  cannot ignore certain political and legal obligations alsoâobligations every bit as compelling as the economic obligations I spoke of earlier.56.	These responsibilities are not new. They are proclaimed in the Charter of the United Nations. But dangerous new circumstances require that we stress them anew  lest we betray the very purpose the United Nations is designed to serve.57.	Our first obligation is to refrain from aggression and to deal with it vigorously. Article 1 of the Charter of the United Nations provides for ""the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace"". Article 2 prohibits ""the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State"".58.	Accordingly  the United Nations must confront the continuing assault upon Afghanistan. I raise this issue not to set off a rhetorical exchange  not in the interest of polemics  but in the interest of peace.59.	Today  more than 1 million refugees attest to the human toll of the violence in Afghanistan. And more is at stake than the independence of one country. If this assault continues  the independence and integrity of every small defenceless nation will be called into question.60.	Last January  at an emergency special session  this Assembly condemned by a large majority the assault upon Afghanistan. We strongly believe that at the thirty-fifth session also the General Assembly must work under the Charter to reinforce the principles of the United Nations. We must work for a total withdrawal of Soviet troops and a political settlement. We must support the principles of non-intervention  self-determination and non-alignment for Afghanistan.61.	In Kampuchea as well  armed aggression continues. We welcome reports of some progress made under th4 leadership of the United Nations Secretary General and international organizations in relieving the conditions of deprivation and disease so prevalent a year ago. The threat of renewed starvation requires significant further contribution from the international community.62.	Despite some improvement in Kampuchea's desperate human situation  no progress whatsoever has been made towards securing the withdrawal of occupying Vietnamese forces and the restoration of self-determination to the Kampuchea people  as called for in last year's resolution on Kampuchea  sponsored by the nonaligned nations. We strongly support the basis for a settlement  including the concept of an international conference  contained in that resolution  which was passed by a large majority.63.	Above all  let us keep in mind two basic purposes for which this body exists: to oppose armed aggression and to assuage its consequences. No achievement could be more important to the future influence and effectiveness of the United Nations. No failure could be more damaging than a failure to deal firmly with these issues.64.	Our second obligation  proclaimed by our Charter  is to settle international disputes by peaceful means. Achieving this goal remains urgently important in two key regions: the Middle East and southern Africa.65.	In the Middle East  the United States is committed to a comprehensive peaceâan enduring peace based on the principles of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). We are determined to pursue to a successful conclusion the peace process begun at Camp David two years ago this month.  Already that process has achieved something once thought impossible: peace between Egypt and Israel. Now the negotiations are focused upon  a second goal: taking a significant first step towards resolving the Palestinian problem. The current autonomy talks have as their goal arriving at interim arrangements to establish full autonomy for the people of the West Bank and Gaza. After that  the process will proceed to negotiations which will determine the final status of those areas.66.	As we seek to resolve this conflict  we are committed to finding a solution to the Palestinian problem in all its aspects and  at the same time  to permanent security for the State of Israel. We have no illusions about the difficulties of this quest. We are dealing with a conflict of long duration and intense feelings. There can be no short cuts.67.	So today I call on all members of this Assembly to lend their support to these negotiations. Camp David has proved so far  and remains for the future  the most hopeful and productive avenue to peace in the Middle East. There is no alternative to negotiations except further conflict. Let us remember that differences are rivers to be crossed  not reasons to turn back.68.	That persistence can bear fruitâthat negotiations can yield peaceâhas been reaffirmed in recent months in southern Africa. Through arduous negotiations  the new nation of Zimbabwe has been born in peace. Today we have reason to celebrate not only this accomplishment  but also the way in which nations worked together to achieve it. And for the future  the Zimbabwe settlement offers hopeâand a modelâfor peaceful settlements in southern Africa and elsewhere.69.	The United States will continue its strong efforts to advance the United Nations plan for Namibia. There are no major substantive issues left to be resolved. I am convinced that the United Nations plan would be implemented fairly. All that remains is for South Africa to act in its own interest  in the interest of peace in the region  and in the interest of the Namibian people: to accept implementation of the United Nations settlement. If that does not happen soon  this chance for peace could be lost  and we would face a bitter future of protracted conflict and tragic human suffering.70.	The settlement in Zimbabwe can also provide a precedent for peaceful change in South Africa. We will continue to urge the Government of South Africa to abandon the repugnant policy of apartheid. We consider it urgent that talks among representative leaders begin on the issue of peaceful  orderly change in South Africaâwhile there is still time.71.	We must continue our search for peace and restoration of respect for international law in other parts of the world as well. In Lebanon  in Cyprus and elsewhere  we will lend our full support to the peace making and peacekeeping efforts of the United Nations.72.	And although the holding of American hostages in Iran is not an item on the agenda of this Assembly  it remains a matter of extreme urgency that this tragic impasse be resolvedâresolved in a way that strengthens peace and restores respect for international law. The continuing situation in Iran contributes to uncertainty about security and stability in Southwest Asia. The security of Iran itself and the stability of the area depend on a united  strong and independent Iran living at peace with its neighbours.73.	With the end of the former regime and the death of the late Shah  a chapter in Iran's history has closed. As a new chapter opens  we emphasize that we recognize the reality of the Iranian revolution  and we respect the right of the Iranian people to choose their own form of government without intervention of any kind. With the emergence of a new constitution and governmental structure and the gradual consolidation of authority  the Islamic Republic of Iran can assume its obligations and independent role in this community of nations.74.	An indispensable step will be the safe return to their families of the American hostages in Iran. Throughout the 324 days of their captivity  the Member States and institutions of the United Nations have expressed their concern for the hostages in numberless ways and channels. With their safe release  repeatedly called for by the Security Council and the International Court of Justice  Iran could end its isolation from those nations that live in accordance with international law  and sanctions would be terminated.75.	Today I urge the nation of Iran  its Parliament  and its people also  to consider the human face of the hostage problem. These innocent people and their families have experienced acute suffering. I ask this community of nations to join us in urging that their ordeal be brought to a safe  honourable and prompt end. We also know that in Iran  as in the United States  there are deep feelings as a result of grievances and suffering perceived in the past. We are prepared to do our part in resolving fairly the issues between us. The Iranian Parliament has announced that it will name a commission to deal with the hostage question. We hope that this positive step will bring the Government of Iran closer to a decision on release of the hostages.76.	The United States shares many common values with the people of Iran. When the safe return of all the hostages to their families is assured  we are prepared to deal on a basis of mutual respect and equality with all the outstanding issues and misunderstandings between Iran and the United States and to reach understandings on the principles which will govern our relationship.77.	As we look to the future  1 urge the United Nations  as soon as possible  to take firm and effective measures to counter the global menace of attacks upon diplomats and others. The danger it poses to civilized international life is growing; no institution of peace can afford to ignore it. For our part  the United States seeks peace with all nations. Whether it be with Iran or with the Soviet Union  we are eager to reduce tensions and to restore productive relations as soon as their actions allow.78.	In all cases our policies will reflect our commitment to non-interference in the internal affairs of other nations. As the President of the United States  Mr. Carter  has affirmed  we shall not interfere in Poland's affairs and we expect that others will also respect the right of the Polish nation to resolve its own problems in its own way.79.	Another obligation of nations is the control and limitation of arms. A period of heightened tension in the world makes this obligation more difficult to fulfil  but also more urgently important.80.	For that reason  let me underscore anew today the commitment of my Government to arms control  to practical measures that contribute to world peace and enhance international stability. President Carter voiced this basic commitment when lie was sworn in as President in January 1977. It remains equally valid today.81.	Let me give several concrete illustrations of that commitment. Some of the arms control efforts I shall mention involve active participation by the United Nations; others involve negotiations outside the United Nations framework. But all are of intense concern to the international community  for an unrestrained arms race would darken the horizon for all humanity.82.	First  it is President Carter's intention to move forward as speedily as possible towards ratification of the SALT II Treaty.  Accordingly  the President intends to consult with the leadership of the United States Senate soon after the election with a view to resuming the ratification process as soon as is feasible. We consider it of cardinal importance to ratify SALT II and to move forward with the SALT process. The Soviet Union  however  must recognize that for many Americans recent Soviet actions have called into question the Soviet Union's commitment to international peace and cooperation. Accordingly  we call upon the Soviet Union to act in ways that will enhance  not damage  the prospects for SALT II and for other arms control efforts.83.	Secondly  we are committed to the pursuit of meaningful and equal limitations on theatre nuclear forces in the framework of the SALT III negotiations. We are ready to begin talks with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union this week to discuss this subject and to seek agreement on the arrangements for beginning these talks promptly.84.	Thirdly  we are committed to seeking an effective and verifiable comprehensive test ban treaty. Substantial progress has been made towards this goal and we are determined to continue pursuing these efforts vigorously.85.	Fourthly  the United States is committed m the Vienna talks to achieving mutual and balanced force reductions and limitations to diminish the risks inherent in the massive presence of military forces in central Europe.86.	Fifthly  we are prepared to develop further the security aspects of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. If the international situation permits and if there is balanced progress in all areas  including the human rights area  at the second review session of the Conference  to be held at Madrid in November  we are prepared to consider a post Madrid European conference of the signatory States to the Final Act of the Conference on developing militarily significant confidence-building measures.87.	Sixthly  we support the effort of the newly expanded Committee on Disarmament to develop the provisions of an international convention on radiological weapons We also support its work towards a comprehensive ban on chemical weapons and we continue to pursue our bilateral negotiations with the Soviet Union on an effective prohibition against chemical weapons.88.	Finally  the further spread of nuclear weapons would constitute a serious threat to international peace and security. We firmly support efforts  therefore  to reduce the risk of nuclear proliferation. The Treaty on the Non Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is a cornerstone of those efforts; we strongly urge non-parties to embrace the Treaty  for it enhances the security of all nations  nuclear weapon and nonnuclear weapon States alike. At the second Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons there was unanimous agreement on the fundamental soundness of the Treaty and the desirability of universal adherence to it. For those nonnuclear weapon States that have not joined the Treaty  we attach particular importance to the goal of achieving comprehensive  full scope international safeguards coverage. We believe that acceptance of such coverage should become a condition of new nuclear supply commitments to such States. We shall continue to work for a world in which all nations can share in the peaceful use of nuclear energy without the danger of spreading nuclear weapons.89.	Before I leave this subject  let me emphasize our deep concern over another arms control matter. If arms control is to be successful  agreements must be fully honoured. Questions such as those raised by persistent reports that chemical weapons have been used in Afghanistan  Laos and Kampuchea cannot be ignored by the international community. To do so would undermine both arms control and international law. The United States  therefore  welcomes the emphasis placed by the Committee on Disarmament at its most recent session on the need for international efforts to determine the facts behind those reports. We believe that an impartial investigation into those reports could most appropriately be launched under the auspices of the United Nations.90.	Important as they are  the obligations I have mentioned by no means exhaust the responsibilities which rest upon us as nations  and as a community of nations  if we are to secure peace. By peace  I do not mean the fragile  artificial stability that comes with repression of a people by its Government; I mean the true stability of societies that are at peace with themselves because the rights of their citizens are protected and nurtured.91.	So let me close by underscoring another obligation of nations: our obligation to uphold human rights and to concern ourselves compassionately with fundamental human needs.92.	In the Universal Declaration of Human Rights the community of nations has nobly defined the concepts of human rights and human dignity  just as in the Charter of the United Nations we have outlined the precepts of peaceful cooperation.93.	The failure of nations to live up to those human rights obligations is a continuing tragedy  made painfully manifest in the waves of refugees now sweeping across the world.94.	Those suffering people present a dramatic challenge to the international community represented by This Assembly. Over the past five years the United States has welcomed more than 600 000 refugeesâfrom Africa  from Asia  from Europe  from the Middle Last and from the western hemisphere. In the past five months alone we have received more than 120 000 people driven from Cuba to our shoresâan influx which has presented extraordinary challenges to our resources.95.	In recognition of the human need implicit in this worldwide wave of refugees  President Carter has made known the intention of the United States to accept an additional 217 000 refugees over the next year.96.	Our country  of course  is only one of the many which have welcomed and helped refugees. More than 1 million Afghan refugees have fled to Pakistan; 400 000 Indo Chinese are in Thailand. More than 3 million are homeless in sub-Saharan Africa. Clearly this is a global problem; it requires a global response.97.	The refugee resettlement efforts agreed upon at Geneva last year [see A/35/12  para. 6] demand our energy and our generosity. We must strengthen the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.98.	The humanitarian programmes of the United Nations and of the other agencies require a renewed commitment from all of us to their support and to their strengthening. But ultimately this human tragedy can be dealt with only by removing its root causes: by overcoming poverty  by ending the abuse of human rights within nations and by establishing peace among nations so that no person need be forced to flee from home and country.99.	This is why my nation supports the growth of democracy and personal freedom in the Americas  in Africa and in every region of the world. Achieving these ultimate purposes remains a supreme challenge for the United Nations. Making progress towards them must be the work of this thirty fifth session of the General Assembly.100. Let us not ignore the facts. Ours is a moment of worldwide economic difficulty and a time of tension between great Powers. At such moments  peaceful cooperation becomes even more difficult than usual. At such moments  our obligations as members of this Assembly of nations take on new importance. At such times  when a cloud of troubling events darkens our aspirations to ultimate peace  we can light our path by adhering faithfully to our Charter  to the international law that binds us  to the standards of international conduct that protect us.101.	Let us hope that the light we generate by doing so will dispel the clouds of tension and discord that darken the world today.102.	The United States will do its part. We will live up to our obligations to oppose aggression  to build peace  to limit arms  to support human rights and to foster economic justice  for us and for other nations  these endeavours can immeasurably improve life on earth and build the just and lasting peace for which all our peoples yearn."
"142",7303,"VCT",35,1980,"ï»¿I wish to endorse the sentiments expressed by my Prime Minister on the day of the admission of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to this world body as its one hundred and fifty-fourth Member. I am convinced that the selection of Mr. von Wechmar  by the group of States to which he belongs  for recommendation to this Assembly as its President is an indication of its recognition of his proven skill and competence in guiding and directing the affairs of the Assembly. I have no doubt that Mr. von Wechmar deserves this expression of confidence and I should like to wish him a productive and satisfying term in office.214.	As the representative of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines who attended the 2198th meeting of the Security Council on 19 February  when our admission to this Assembly was unanimously recommended  I must here record my appreciation for that unanimity in favour of my country's admission to this world forum. We feel a sense of pride and satisfaction that the United Kingdom should have acted as our sponsor during that meeting. We feel pride because the United Kingdom and we ourselves have been capable of ending one relationship and beginning a new one as equals in the true spirit of the United Nations Charter  without rancour or bitterness resulting from our historical relationship and past differences and experiences.215.	I was moved by the solemnity of those proceedings and the ready response of all nations in accepting us as a Member. We were deeply touched by the warmth of the sentiments expressed on the day of our admission to the United Nations.216.	We are a small nation  but one with a clear view of what role we can play in world affairs. For financial reasons  there will always be obvious limitations to our ability to perform in the manner that may be desirable. This financial constraint notwithstanding  our position on issues will be made quite clear. Our intention will always be to assist this Organization in achieving and maintaining world peace  as well as economic and social justice. We will uphold respect for the democratic process and will of necessity be more closely drawn to those countries that share similar ideals. We will  as a Member of the Caribbean region  so direct our foreign trade  fiscal and foreign policies as to promote greater unity in all areas of development among the peoples of the region wherever there is a compatibility of interests and objectives.217.	We believe that economic relations between one country and another should rest on the basis of equality and mutual respect for the systems of each  recognizing as we do that it is the right of all peoples to determine the system of government they wish  as expressed by the will of the governed.218.	Our foreign policy will therefore develop as an integral part of the ideas of our people  expressed as the Government and people of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines conceive it  and that policy will pursue the ends which we want it to serve in world affairs.219.	The central concept of our foreign policy is that of assisting in the promotion of an international order based on the principle of the equality and sovereignty of all nations; the total eradication of imperialism and colonialism in all its forms; the rejection of all forms or doctrines of racialism; the desire for lasting peace  freedom and prosperity and the need for international cooperation in all fields of human endeavour.220.	Saint Vincent and the Grenadines will  as a consequence  build its foreign policy on the foundation of this concept. The safeguarding of our national interests will  a fortiori  be the primary aim of our country's foreign policy. We are conscious of the fact that we live in a changing world with concomitant shifts and realignments of relationships between Powers and groups of Powers. While  of necessity  aspects of our foreign policy will therefore be flexible  our concern will be to safeguard our independence and to strive for a better way of life for our people while assisting in the promotion of peace and order.221.	In an effort to prevent any erosion of our independence  we will not attach ourselves to any power bloc  Eastern  Western or nonaligned. We see ourselves as having an equal interest in creating  maintaining and safeguarding international peace as an essential condition of our own economic  social and industrial development. Our ties with the nations of the world will be forged through the signing of treaties of peace  friendship and cooperation. We have longstanding traditional ties with many countries. Where it serves our national interest we shall strengthen those ties and  where appropriate  forge new ones.222.	If Members  however  find us tardy in forging ties of new friendship  it is because we want to ensure that they are meaningful and lasting.223.	We believe that the principles of non-interference by one State in the internal affairs of another and of scrupulous respect for sovereignty  territorial integrity and political independence of all States are essential to peaceful coexistence. We condemn the use of force in international affairs. We believe that  if that principle is strictly observed  the tensions of the world would be reduced and conflicts avoided. We are therefore opposed to all forms of aggression and any direct military intervention by one country in another  whatever the pretext.224.	Saint Vincent and the Grenadines supports the United Nations stand on decolonization and hopes that Members of the United Nations will combine their influence to ensure the removal of those obstacles which are hindering Belize from becoming an independent country. Freedom and independence for the world cannot be complete so long as Belize and other countries are denied theirs. We therefore urge the United Nations to use its best endeavours to ensure that Belize becomes an independent nation at an early date.225.	Equally  I must reiterate that  as my Prime Minister said earlier  greater efforts should be made to ensure that Namibia be granted the right to self-determination by the holding of free and fair elections under the supervision of the United Nations at the earliest possible time.226.	We believe that the conscience of this world community must be further aroused and challenged  not only against South Africa  where racial discrimination is official State policy  but against the emergence of racialism in any form in other areas of the world. We believe that Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and other small States should  by their approach to international issues  act as a source of stable objectivity mirroring the concerned conscience of the United Nations.227.	We are of the view that the Organization of American States is a truly hemispheric institution that can further  through cooperative and collective endeavours  peace and stability with progress and prosperity for its members. Being the oldest international regional organization in the world  the Organization of American States has the experience and the knowhow to tackle the problems of economic  political and social cooperation of member States of the western hemisphere. We shall therefore seek membership in that organization at an early time.228.	We believe small States ought not to see themselves as being part of anything other than a fourth world. That is not out of a desire to advocate the creation of a new grouping; it is only consistent with the reality of our size  both in area and in population  and the vulnerability of our economies on a vast scale to the forces of nature. It is necessary for us first to perceive ourselves for what we are  without any illusion of grandeur. If that is done  it would therefore be easier for others to understand that we realize our capabilities  limitations  and the inhibiting factors to any meaningful development by us through our sole efforts. For even where efforts have successfully been made to move forward  they could be negated by the raw  brutal and uncontrollable forces of nature. Our problems  therefore  because of our small size  demand solutions. If such problems exist in larger countries of the third world  they do not have the same disastrous impact as when they occur in our fourth world countries. Cyclical disasters have a more immediate and far greater adverse wave effect on the economies of small States such as Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Our problems  it is true  are not uniqueâand yet  they are in a way unique. That uniqueness demands favourable consideration and urgent attention by those who possess the abilities to help.229.	When one recognizes the disparity of income between countries and the ever widening gap between rich and poor  it is evident that there is urgent need for a redistribution of wealth. Many countries have given assistance in the form of soft loans to poor countries  but the onerous conditions often imposed make it impossible at times for such loans to be taken up  and even when the conditions are met so much time may have elapsed as to cause a viable project to become nonviable. Worse still  even if the project may still be viable  because of the high rate of inflation there would be a tremendous escalation of costs which serves only to impose greater debt servicing responsibilities on the poor recipient countries. A new machinery is now needed by donor countries  consistent with the realities of the times in which we live. That machinery must substantially reduce the period in which disbursement is to commence and ensure that the necessary corrective measures are implemented at an earlier time and within the cost estimated. Without a restructuring of the lending machinery by donor countries and agencies  notwithstanding the awareness on the part of recipient countries that donors wish to ensure that their funds are properly spent and for the purpose intended  we in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines believe that the effect contemplated may not be achieved to the extent desirable to meet the needs of the recipient country as the urgency of the situation dictates.230.	A new and less cumbersome lending procedure must be devised  which reduces paperwork and which does not overtax the human resource capability of small States. We are therefore very seriously concerned about this ever widening gulf and disparity of incomes  now fuelled by rampant inflation  and we believe that the North South dialogue is a step in the right direction.231.	Saint Vincent and the Grenadines further believes that the report of the Independent Commission on International Development Issues  under the Chairmanship of Willy Brandt  merits careful studyâwhich  I know  has already begunâin this body  with a view to the implementation of some of the recommendations which will tend to reduce  if not eliminate  much of the suffering  conflict and confrontation which from time to time arise within the world community.232.	It is also of great significance that we have the benefit of another valued study: ""An examination of the world economic crisis"". That Commonwealth perspective concluded in a way which is worthy of quotation:""Change is inevitable. The issue  as we see it  is whether the structural changes and adjustments necessary to solve the current economic crisis and the problems of development will be accompanied by economic confusion and chaos  with each nation struggling in isolation to maximize its own gain  or whether they can be achieved in harmony on the basis of a global consensus for the mutual benefit of all nations.""233.	We hold the view that energy is the primary problem of the world. We therefore believe that every effort should be made to find an early solution as a matter of urgency to this problem of frequent  periodic price increases. The indexing of prices to inflation cannot be the answer. Each increase in the posted price of oil will itself be the catalyst that generates further inflation worldwide. Those increases are the cause of chronic balance of payment problems in developing and underdeveloped countries  where neither the export price of primary products nor wages have for the farmer or the labourer the purchasing power to cope with the attendant evils of inflation. In mini-States like Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  with an agricultural  export-oriented economy  a frightening scenario is being painted: the unfulfilled expectations of the young  the diminished hopes of the old.234.	We should therefore strive to achieve the following: first  the freezing of all oil prices  which are already too high; secondly  the taking of positive steps on a global scale to conserve in the use of oil and natural gas  to permit time to develop alternative sources of energy; thirdly  the stimulating of the development of the technology to exploit gas on the biomass principle as fully as possible and to provide assistance with loans to poor countries to finance such energy development; and fourthly  the assisting of poor and small countries to exploit the development of such energy resources as are available.235.	I am under no illusion that those objectives will be easy to achieve  but we can try. We must not be afraid to offend in so crucial a task. We believe that the present initiatives of Mexico and Venezuela  as well as Iraq  are first the land  in peace  and thereby foster greater contact and intercourse between their country and the host country. Aberrations of this sort must be strongly condemned  and those who are in a position to exert indicative steps of their awareness of the existing problems damage to our ecology  particularly from oil pollution. The existing problems of poor oil-importing countries. It is a commendable first step that should be emulated by others. It is a good beginning  but this must not be the end.236. We condemn violations of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961 by any country or its nationals who deliberately violate  to achieve an objective  the norms of respectable conduct in relations with diplomatic representatives of a sending country in a receiving country. The Convention was adopted to permit accredited representatives to perform their duties within the limits of the law of the land  in peace  and thereby foster greater contact and intercourse between their country and the host country  Aberrations of this sort must be strongly condemned  and those who are in a position to exert influence to bring to an end such violations should do so with responsible commitment.237. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines applauds the efforts being made to conclude a final convention on the law of the sea  which now seeks to resolve those issues which were not settled by the 1958 Geneva conventions. While those conventions resolved in a definitive manner matters such as the territorial sea  the high seas  fishing and conservation of living resources of the high seas  the continental shelf and the compulsory settlement of disputes  there are still major issues to be resolved which are of concern to our new nation-a nation spread over many miles of seas and comprising a large number of inhabited and uninhabited islands. Inhabitants have had a long history of use of and dependence on the resources of the sea. The Caribbean sea is our lifeline  as well as a potential source of wealth for several Territories within the region and  as specifically determined by us or agreed upon by convention  for us in our areas of sovereign jurisdiction.238. We accept and recognize the desirability and wisdom of the right of all States to innocent passage through territorial seas and transit passage through straits used for international shipping. However  in the case of warships  prior notice must be given before such passage through our territorial sea. In the absence of agreement to the contrary  we accept the median line as the dividing line between States whether it determines the limit of the territorial sea or of the economic zone. There can be no doubt that every effort should be made to ensure the promotion of trade even in spite of differences between countries by unrestricted passage through and the accessibility of ports and harbours of States to trading ships.239. With island States in such proximity as we are in the eastern Caribbean  particularly in the case of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines with many islands  islets  quays and rocks  it is important that an agreement be reached and an acceptable convention be concluded on these outstanding Issues. It IS clear now that  after many years  such a convention is in sight. After the resolution of myriad issues there is now a bright light at the end of the tunnel.240. We are concerned about environmental dangers and damage to our ecology  particularly from oil pollution. The channels between several of our islands are safe and convenient passages for many of the world's super tankers travelling to and from Caribbean destinations  North America  Europe and the Middle East. It is more than reasonable to assume that there is a high probability of oil spills  occurring through negligence on the part of crews in cleaning and disposing of oil and indifference to the consequences spills may have  or through substantial damage as a result of navigational errors leading to massive oil spillage from heavily laden tankers beyond our limited human and financial resource capability to deal with. 241. For countries such as ours  with a tourist oriented economy agricultural exports apart and a very limited industrial base  this could be a very serious tragedy  hamper in our foreign exchange earnings and worsening our unemployment situation. While we agree to transit passage of ships of all nations in the furtherance of international trade  we believe nevertheless that companies or nations should assume the responsibility of compensating for the economic harm done to a country  particularly a poor country  and the obligation of cleaning up the damage caused242.	Small States like Saint Vincent and the Grenadines cannot sit idly by until disaster strikes; we must anticipate the event  even though we hope it will never occur  and seek to ensure that this world Organization exerts its not inconsiderable influence to alleviate hardship caused through no fault of the affected country. The manner in which that objective could be achieved is for consideration. Nevertheless  I am satisfied that oil producing countries should be made to assume a part of such obligations. The rationale for that is obvious and needs no further amplification. I hope that this Assembly has already addressed itself to this problem and that prompt relief would be possible were such an event to occur.243.	What for a developed or large developing country may be a matter of no major concern  except for the impact of the damage per se on the ecology  or a small fourth world country like ours would assuredly be a major disaster. It must never be forgotten that  measured on the same scale  what is minor for a large country can be a catastrophe for a small one. Unless that is fully appreciated  the urgency of this appeal may be lost.244.	Having enunciated our position on several issues and our concern in certain areas where we perceive threats inimical to our national interests  may I reiterate to the thirty fifth session of the General Assembly that the one real and lasting safeguard for States  large or small  is respect for the authority of this Assembly.245.	While we are not dealing in geometric terms  since national interests are a continual challenge to reason  it is well that we remember the parts cannotâand  in terms of political reality  should notâbe greater than the whole  and should not conflict with or set themselves outside the whole.246.	This thirty fifth session of the General Assembly has several new and outstanding issues to be resolved. Among them are the many hot spots in the world that could be cooled if adversaries would show less fear and more understanding of the other's point of view and if each was prepared to appreciate that the words ""compromise"" and ""accommodation"" can be given real meaning in the conduct of discussions which could resolve disputes. Intransigence and the hard line are not necessarily an indication of strength  but often the products of fear and insecurity. But the best safeguards against fear and insecurity would be negotiated settlements which bear the stamp of the approval of the United Nations. It is wrong for any nation  large or small  to show open defiance of the resolutions of this world Organization  since by ignoring its authority  albeit only a persuasive authority  they thereby effectively seek to weaken its usefulness. The Assembly can be a most effective instrument; but it cannot be and will not be greater than all of us collectively have the will to make it. Each of us representatives possesses the perception by conscience to know right from wrong. Nevertheless  we are all subject to the policies of our Governments and must represent them or resign. But can we not in the light of our thinking strive to influence those decisions  if by so doing we would enhance respect for the integrity and credibility of this world Organization? To fail in this endeavour is not the problem; only to fail to try.247.	Do not think us naive; we are only concerned."
"143",7348,"VEN",35,1980,"ï»¿184. First of all  Sir  I should like to fulfil the pleasant duty of extending to you  on behalf of the delegation of Venezuela and on my own behalf  our sincere congratulations on your well-deserved election as President of this session of the General Assembly. Your outstanding performance as Permanent Representative of the Federal Republic of Germany  a country with which Venezuela has close links  your thorough knowledge of the United Nations and your great personal qualities are the best guarantee that this General Assembly will have wise and effective guidance.185.	I also wish to congratulate and express our gratitude to Mr. Salim  who presided over the thirty-fourth session of the Assembly  the two special emergency sessions  on Afghanistan and Palestine  and the eleventh special session of the Assembly  with the deftness and skill which have characterized his outstanding career as Permanent Representative of the United Republic of Tanzania.186.	The United Nations has played a decisive role in decolonization  a field in which  precisely  Mr. Salim has distinguished himself. The entry of two new States as Members of this world Organization once again highlights the role of the United Nations in this field. In this connexion  I am pleased to welcome the delegation of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and to reiterate our greetings to the delegation of Zimbabwe  which are joining us in the work of the General Assembly.187.	The thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly is taking place at a time of acute international confrontations  of anguish and threats of war  together with major challenges and unswerving aspirations to peace.188.	At the outset of the Third United Nations Development Decade  not only economic problems are besetting relations between nations but also  with increasing priority  political military problems have arisen in various parts of the world. Thus  since the last regular session  an atmosphere has been created such that often  and with a certain undertone of inevitability  one hears talk of the world witnessing the prologue of what will be the third world war. Such a situation compels us to stop and consider  first  the fundamental role of the United Nations itself and its ability to rise above the risks of an existence which internationally carries the sign of fear of war.189.	Our Organization was born of the concerted political will which  after the Second World War  decided to embody in a supreme international forum the shared aspirations for peace  freedom and justice.190.	The international community has found in the United Nations  despite the shortcomings of the Organization itself and of Member States  an instrument well suited to the continuous striving towards the high goals that were and continue to be the common aspiration of mankind.191.	It would therefore be irrational to disregard the merits of the United Nations. We praise them and. in a positive spirit  maintain that what is needed today is that the collective political will that brought about the birth of the United Nations be attuned to the specific requirements of the hour.192.	It is obvious that responsibility for present international tensions lies with the great Powers  which look upon the United Nations and the international scene with a self-centred attitude. Thus  for the great hegemonic Powers  peace becomes a mere balance of power.193.	The traditional international order is one that has as its weak underpinnings the common fear of the great Powers of the consequences of a nuclear war and the added fear of the other countries  which  while not being or aspiring to be front-rank Powers  know that the tragic and incalculable results of a third world war would not only affect the nations that started it  but would be devastatingly reflected in all the countries in the world.194.	The most negative forces of conservatism in the effort to preserve the present international status quo are the great Powers. This conservative attitude  which is projected in any review of the international situation in terms of their selfish hegemonic interests  is the backup position for the irrational wave of warring that is shaking the world.195.	I he United Nations must have the capacity for self-transformation so as to deprive the great Powers of their archaic privileges  which are a threat to the common good of mankind. We are convinced that for this Organization and for the world the hour of truth has come.196.	The crisis is structural and deep-rooted; it is felt worldwide. We have been brought to this by an intrinsically unjust international system: artificially induced consumption; waste of natural resources; irreversible environmental damage; monetary and financial chaos; economies in bondage; uncontrolled inflation; manipulation of human beings  not just in body but  what is worse  also in spirit: stockpiling of weapons of mass destruction that could in a flash transform this beautiful planet we were given as our dwelling place into cosmic dust; and while  on the one hand  needless luxuries and weapons are amassed at astronomical cost  on the other  two thirds of mankind suffer chronic hunger and subsist in subhuman conditions.197.	The United Nations has developed basic principles for harmonious coexistence  which speaks highly of its willingness to face bravely the challenges of this tragic time. Those principles include non-intervention  collective security  the self-determination of peoples  respect for human rights and permanent sovereignty over natural resourcesâ to mention only some.198.	But unfortunately  we must point out that these have often been ignored by the great Powers with deliberate selfishness  and no way has been found to control this attitude. Some attempts have even been made to justify it by invoking the principle of the reserved dominion of the State  a principle that was brought forth in history to protect the weak and afflicted  not to provide an aggressor's action with a cloak of honesty.199.	This hour of truth implies an appeal to reflexion: we are still able to sit down and discuss  rationally and without passion  the events that are inexorably bringing us to a collapse; we are in a position to measure the depth of the crisis and  through deliberate decisions  to correct the course of history. Crises are  in the last analysis  the consequence of human action  and human will can therefore bring about their positive solution.200.	In order to achieve such results  an essential condition must be met  a condition that the Government of Venezuela has made .a permanent norm of its policyâa fervent belief in justice and in solidarity. Any principle is but an empty shell unless it is permanently powered by this vital concept.201.	Our peoples believe in justice; they are aware that it can be achieved in this world; they know that a better mankind is possible if one fights for it. This vital aspiration will brook no opposition from principles interpreted at a whim  or from deadly weapons  which can do no more than contain the first onslaught by an endless multitude. Let us hope that this distressing reality of our era will be understood before it is too late.202.	Therefore  as has been repeatedly stated by President Luis Herrera Campins  Venezuela's foreign policy is based on international social justice and on solidarity. That is why he has affirmed his belief in a more just and more humane international law based on the development of the human person and of all men. and rooted in peace  justice and integral and harmonious developmentâa peace which is not only absence of war  a justice imbued with social feelings between the peoples of the earth  and an integral harmonious development which makes man the centre and all of its concern. At the same time  that international law would have solidarity as part of its substance  which implies the conviction that relations must have their foundations in the law and in the obligation of those who have the most towards those who have the least ânot as a gift or as a gracious concession  but as a rule of international legal norms inspired by social justice.203.	Those are the terms of the hour of truth. This is the moment when one clearly perceives that the new international order is not going to be achieved by short-term adjustments  which would only prolong and intensify the agony of the present order  but by a change in the vital conception of the world in which we live.204.	Latin America  Africa and Asia can and must act jointly in the United Nations with a clear policy aimed at achieving democratic management of the international community as an element of balance vis-Ã -vis the great Powers.205.	Our peoples are the major creditors of history. And since we have had a wretched experience with imperialism  colonialism and neo-colonialism. we are bound to act together so that we may achieve effective changes that will enable us to throw off the shackles of dependence which have often made our peoples mere pawns in the games played by the superpowers.206.	In their already lengthy struggle  the third world countries have had positive experience in concerting their efforts in their own internal processes  as well as in their bilateral and multilateral relations.207.	The achievements of the Group of 77 and the unity they have maintained in the North South dialogue  as well as the improvements they have gained in the specific terms of South South cooperation  constitute an encouraging example of what can be done in the immediate future.208.	Given the dangers and risks of the present international situation  we the developing countries cannot maintain a mere attitude of complaint or accusation. The certain possibility of democratic management of the international community compels us to be constantly united in our efforts.209.	In this context  the struggle against the international status quo will require of medium sized and small States clear objectives  creative capacity  political imagination  negotiating flexibility  realistic positions  bold constancy and a steadfastness of purpose.210.	Democratic management of the international community  based on the principle of the legal equality of States  as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations  must be a main goal in the struggle of our countries to ensure predominance of this principle. It is a goal to be achieved through a succession of partial gains.211.	The strategy of the major centres of hegemony will be directed at sowing the seeds of dejection  by presenting as illusory or as doomed to failure an effort which only an immature point of view could present as being susceptible of immediate achievement.212.	Democratic management of the international community can and should be of concern to all countries that cannot agree to important decisions relating to their own destiny being taken without their participation. In this connexion  recent events in Poland provide significant evidence which should give much food for thought in view of the factors they have brought to light.213.	The pre-war climate of uncertainty is rooted in the great Power rivalry for mastery of geopolitically important areas and for access to and control over strategic resources. The pre-war risk exists because of the senseless behaviour of the great blocs  which devise and carry out coven or overt forms of domination over peoples  blatantly seeking only to increase their actual power.214.	Without democratic management of the international community  the new international order will not be achieved. In the present international status quo which the majority of the developed countries want to maintain  the new order will be a difficult goal  and the global negotiations to attain it will continue to be fraught with problems.215.	Attempts are being made to divide and weaken the Group of 77. But the political maturity and serious mindedness of the Group must lead it to seek tenaciously a meaningful dialogue aimed at practical agreement and effective action. The strengthening of such a dialogue would bring us closer to our goals.216.	The Government of Venezuela is convinced of the need further to secure our horizontal relationships of economic and political solidarity among small and medium sized countries. Often  the policies and strategies followed by the developing countries were a reaction to the developed countries' attitudes and policies or  at least  the results of structurally asymmetrical relations between the centre and the periphery.217.	We do not deny the usefulness and value of such positions or the imperative need for them to be upheld and strengthened in the future. At the same time  far more meaningful efforts should be made to expand the South South links. I would go further and even venture to say that if we have not made more progress in the North South dialogue. It is because practical solidarity among developing countries has not been sufficiently strong218.	This is an underlying challenge which  so far  we have met with only piecemeal responses; yet. its vast possibilities are within our reach: ail we need is the will and the determination to arrive at an understanding among ourselves.219.	In the context of the international political situation  we must sadly recognize that there are examples of those who expect to be able to ensure the  albeit uncertain  survival of their regimes through docility to the dictates of the great hegemonic centres.220.	They are the ones who fall prey to the historical cynism of applauding the whittling down of the sovereignty of peoples  whenever it is carried out by the Power to which they have given a lien on their destiny  all the while pretending to be the prophets of a just and dignified future  whereas their own indignity and injustice  in a less hypocritical world  would strike them dumb with shame.221.	The great capitalist and socialist Powers should know that the developing countries are not prepared to acquiesce in mute resignation to a so-called realpolitik by which they seek only the international hardening of their attitudes.222.	We developing peoples are the great creditors of history and the best reserves for peace. Our effective responsibility and our serious international dynamism are more than ever needed today to lessen tensions  to ward off the risks of war and to instil new life into international organizations. The democratic management of the international community must become a reality and an effective guarantee for peace.223.	Five years after the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe  held at Helsinki  the real results  aside from occasional rhetoric and the demagoguery of bloc politics  could hardly have been more disappointing.224.	The second review session of that Conference is to take place at Madrid in November. If Governments continue to view summits like these as opportunities to assess their strength and to win Pyrrhic diplomatic victories with no positive impact on the life of peoples  we fear that  even though the signatories of the Act to be adopted at the Madrid session be equal to or greater in number than those of the Helsinki Final Act  there is little for Europe in particular and the world in general to expect from the Conference.225.	The international community wishes that Conference to meet without this balance of dread  a false balance of fear  as a backdrop for the talks. The international community knows that  since the Helsinki Act was signed  there has not been one moment without specific reports from all sides of a lack of compliance with what was agreed to there.226.	Furthermore  in the time between the Helsinki and Madrid Conferences  deplorable events have occurred as evidence of the intention of the great Powers to resist any significant change in the international order in which they enjoy a privileged status.227.	We  the genuinely peace-loving peoples  understand that part of the approach of the superpowers is their intention of creating docile sub Powers  which will acquire and maintain this essential trait because of their systems of political and military cooperation.228.	The developing world is familiar with that kind of procedure. It knows full well that anyone who becomes a party to warlike adventure and irresponsible violence is jetting out on a fratricidal road and ends up with his own sovereignty and that of others tarnished.229.	Since Helsinki such sorrowful and reprehensible events have occurred as the emergence of the tragic situation in Kampuchea and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Venezuela stated here  at the United Nations  on the occasion of the sixth emergency special session  its rejection of such aggression.  Today we ratify our condemnation. Afghanistan is still an occupied country and the repression unleashed by the invading army against the Afghan patriots  the type of weapons used and the inadmissible reasoning put forward to defend what is indefensible call for a consistent and unswerving denunciation by the entire third world. Our repudiation of such procedures  which are drawn from the most conventional imperialist geopolitics  is clear and trenchant.230.	As a result of events in Afghanistan there is a not insignificant crisis within the nonaligned movement. We shall support every effort to achieve adherence by the movement to the principles which brought it into the world.231.	Nonalignment is the guarantee for the complete self-determination of peoples and the sound foundation for absolute sovereignty  the self-respect of nations  mutual respect in relations among States  a balanced peace and the hope for an ever more just future  and not for the balance of fear of war and the growing degradation of the weakest peoples. Finally it is the guarantee that it is possible to achieve democratic management of the international community  a new world law and the new international economic order.232.	Bloc politicsâas we seeâleads only to a balance of terror and to limited conflicts and hotbeds of local wars  which ultimately causes direct harm to developing countries.233.	Venezuela pinpoints the position adopted by Zimbabwe as hopeful and positive in the context of the present African and international situation. The statement made by Prime Minister Mugabe when his country joined the United Nations  offers a clear definition of constructive and authentic nonalignment. The people of Zimbabwe proved that independence can be achieved and maintained without any alignment at all with the great hegemonic centres of world power; that internal and international leadership is enhanced when respect for one's own patriotic dignity is set as an effective containment wall against the interests of the superpowers  whose only wish is to acquire docile instruments; and that independence can be achieved and maintained without the doubtful help of foreign armies on one's own soil.234.	In Zimbabwe the people were able to choose their own destiny by the civic and peaceful means of the vote. The leadership of Prime Minister Mugabe is strengthened by popular opinion  as expressed in free elections  which showed the world which choices the people of Zimbabwe really wanted  and which were simply the effect of orchestrated propaganda.235.	On greeting the presence of Zimbabwe once again  we affirm in solidarity that African problems can be solved only by Africans. We say this because we want the problems of Latin America to be solved only by Latin Americans.236.	We have not allowed  nor are we prepared to allow  any attempts to be made to play irresponsibly with the future of the peoples of Latin America by the use of whatever influence anyone may have over them to increase the impact of ominous bloc policies through organized violence.237.	We support all genuinely Latin American proposals which  in this hour  which is crucial for our hemisphere  and especially for Central America and the Caribbeanâseek to overcome problems by civic and peaceful means.238.	This is an appropriate opportunity to reiterate most energetically our condemnation of terrorism as a form of struggle  whatever the political beliefs of those who engage in it and regardless of where it takes place. Criminal acts cannot be justified by any flag.239.	Venezuela's basic principles of solidarity and cooperation have been evident for years  especially in Central America and the Caribbean.240.	The recent Venezuelan Mexican programme for cooperation in energy and finance  signed by President Herrera Campins and President Lopez Portillo at San Jose  Costa Rica as part of the programme for the region implemented by Venezuela during the past five yearsâa programme which earned the praise of the international communityâproves that effective terms for cooperation are to be found in genuine forms of civilized life and not in fostering organized violence. It is through them that we shall make true headway in building the Latin American future of our peoples.241.	Venezuela believes that the Caribbean should be a zone of peace. The establishment of the Caribbean as a zone of peace would require the dismantling of the military operations bases and installations of those that are rivals for world supremacy  and would call for a stop to all interventionism  whether intraregional  extra regional  continental or insular. The establishment of the Caribbean as a zone of peace would also call for an immediate demonstration of cooperation aimed towards the solution of the grave economic  social and other problems of the area.242.	Speaking of the Caribbean  we wish to reaffirm here that  for historical  geographic  social  cultural and sentimental reasons  we consider Puerto Rico to be an integral part of the Latin American community and not otherwise. Our support for the right of Puerto Ricans to self-determination is the result of a deep democratic conviction and an expression of Latin American solidarity which has stood the test of years in a variety of circumstances.243.	At the recent Caracas meeting on the new international information order  a strategy harmful to the developing countries was in evidence. What is at stake is nothing other than the right to inform and to be informed. The two facets of this right to information have been manipulated  and attempts are still made to manipulate them.244.	Venezuela advocated at the Paris and Caracas meetings  and will advocate at the General Conference of UNESCO  now opening its twenty-first session at Belgrade  the concept of a new independent information order  one that is sovereign and that will serve as a guarantee of effective defence by developing peoples against sophisticated forms of domination.245.	Venezuela supports all actions designed to eradicate from the face of the earth racism in all its forms  especially the form which claims to set itself up as a system  as is the case in South Africa with apartheid.246.	Our support for the independence of Namibia  in accordance with United Nations decisions  is clear and unequivocal.247.	We view with concern the existing situation in the Middle East. Peace in that region of the world will not be possible as long as efforts continue to be made to impose sectarian policies which are contrary to the best spirit of the international community and which refuse to recognize the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.248.	Venezuela has supported United Nations resolutions which recognize both those rights and the right of the State of Israel to existence and security  resolutions which advocate comprehensive  peaceful  just and equitable solutions with the participation of all the parties to the conflict.249.	We fervently hope that peace will return to Lebanon  the tormented nation with which we are united by many ties of friendship and affection.250.	At the ninth session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  concluded in August this year  considerable progress was made. Basic questions were resolved through compromise formulas which had the support of the vast majority of the participants in the Conference. It is our hope that at the tenth session  to be held in April 1981  pending matters will be settled to the satisfaction of all States concerned. We are pleased that the lengthy process of laborious and complex negotiations may soon come to an end with the adoption of an international instrument to be called the Caracas Convention on the Law of the Sea.251.	At the present time  the global negotiations on economic cooperation are a matter of importance. The fact that three countriesâthe United States  the United Kingdom and the Federal Republic of Germanyâdid not join in the general consensus arrived at after long and arduous discussions prevented the eleventh special session of the General Assembly from setting the opening date of the global negotiations for next year as had been anticipated. Like all the other Members of the United Nations  Venezuela hopes that those three countries will reconsider their position and will join in the consensus as quickly as possible.252.	The General Assembly must complete  during the current session  the work which was not achieved with regard to procedures and the agenda. Venezuela and the other countries members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries affirmed  at their recent tri-ministerial meeting  their full support for the global negotiations. The international community must resolve to do everything in its power to achieve results that will be of benefit to all  and especially to the developing countries.253.	In many areas  and following various initiatives  the United Nations is working ceaselessly towards a new international order. There are many obstacles. Great difficulties will arise. The guarantee of progressive achievement for the benefit of mankind must be found in the clear political will of the majority of Member States.254.	Today  more than ever  peace is needed. The yearning for peace is sincerely shared by all peoples of the world. In this connexion  the President of Venezuela  Mr. Luis Herrera Campins  has stated that ""the desire for an international life free from armed conflicts is a meeting ground for all people of goodwill"".255. Peace is consolidated by justice. Peace requires freedom. Peace is the result of truth. In a memorable message  His Holiness Pope John Paul II rightly affirmed that ""truth is the strength of peace"".256. Let us be capable of responding to the challenges of the hour with truth  and with the effectiveness of practical goodness."
"144",7387,"VNM",35,1980,"ï»¿I should like at the outset to convey to Mr. von Wechmar my warmest congratulations on his unanimous election to the high office of President of the thirty fifth session of the General Assembly.56.	I wish also to pay a well-deserved tribute to Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim for the important contributions he made to the work of the United Nations during the past year in his capacity as President  first of the thirty-fourth session and then of two special sessions and one emergency special session of the General Assembly.57.	I should especially like sincerely to thank Secretary General Kurt Waldheim and his colleagues for their great efforts in the service of peace  stability and understanding in Southeast Asia.58.	My delegation welcomes Saint Vincent and the Grenadines on its admission to the United Nations.59.	Thirty-five years have passed since the founding of the United Nations  35 years during which the world  embarked on a new stage of development  was witness to the most profound changes in history.60.	Unprecedented scientific and technological discoveries have opened up to mankind the greatest opportunities to reach new heights in economic development in order to eliminate poverty and backwardness on earth and at the same time to enable man to enter into the era of the conquest of space and the harnessing of nature for the welfare of mankind.61.	But on the other hand the miraculous gifts of science and technology have also been used to develop the most sophisticated weapons  capable of destroying all the material and cultural achievements which man's genius has amassed over thousands of years. Each year hundreds of billions of dollars are wasted on the arms race for the development and manufacture of the means of mass destruction. Present stockpiles of nuclear weapons are four to five times greater than what would be needed to obliterate all life on earth. In the fever of this arms race  mankind went through long periods of cold war in the 1950s and 1960s and very often stood on the brink of a war of annihilation.62.	But the miracle is that  in a world full of means of destruction which threaten the very life of mankind  mankind has triumphed. The past 35 years make up the longest and most stable period of peace enjoyed by mankind in the twentieth century. For the first time in history  the principles of peaceful coexistence and of the settlement of international disputes by peaceful negotiations have a solid base in human society and have become universal principles which govern contemporary international relations.63.	This miracle has been achieved by mankind first and foremost as a result of the victorious struggle of the forces of peace and democracy and thanks above all to the Soviet Red Army which  by defeating fascism in the Second World War  seriously weakened the most bellicose forces. It is also the result of the awakening of mankind to the danger of a new war of annihilation  to its determination to check it and to the earnest aspirations of hundreds of millions of men and women for the maintenance of peace. The fact that peace has been defended in such a solid and durable way is the result of the growing strength of the socialist countries and their policy of peace. It is also the result of the development over the past three decades of the movement for national liberation and independence which  through liberation wars  brought about the collapse of the colonial systemâa source of human and material resources for the warmongersâand the weakening of the most bellicose forces. The struggle of the peoples of the world for peace and democracy has also contributed greatly to the thwarting of plans for war.64.	Nevertheless  at the present time  the bellicose imperialist circles are stepping up their collusion with international reactionary forces in order to push States into another arms race  to revive the cold war and to sabotage international peace and detente. The expansionists and hegemonists  who cherish the idea of bringing about confrontation between peoples and of throwing the peoples of the world into great chaos  shout at the top of their voices that a third world war is inevitable. This is why mankind must remain vigilant. However  the chances of preventing war and preserving peace are greater now than they were before the Second World War and better than they were in the 1950s and 1960s. The days when imperialism  relying on its supremacy in material resources and arms  made use of war as a means of dominating peoples are past  especially after the defeat of the American aggression against Viet Nam. More than ever before  our peoples have a real opportunity to prevent world war  to preserve international peace and security and to bring about peaceful coexistence among countries with different social regimes.65.	Indeed the trend of the development of history is irreversible. One of the primary tasks of our peoples is to struggle against the attempt of imperialism and international reactionary forces to reverse the course of history.66.	The Vietnamese people for its part is totally committed to contribute to the struggle waged by mankind for international peace and security. We fully support the initiatives put forward by the socialist and the nonaligned countries aimed at easing tensions in the world  at curbing the arms race and at achieving general and complete disarmament and peaceful coexistence  in particular the initiative put forward for consideration at this session by Mr. Andrei Gromyko  the Soviet Minister for Foreign Affairs [6th meeting]  concerning certain urgent measures to reduce the danger of war. We believe that all international disputes should be settled peacefully through negotiations based on the principles of equality and mutual interest. Only thus can the peace that has been achieved by the peoples of the world over the last 35 years be transformed into a solid and lasting peace.67.	During those 35 years  while the peoples of the world had the great fortune to experience the longest period of peace this century  the Vietnamese  who had fought with the Allies against fascism and militarism during the Second World War  were the only people who did not enjoy one day of peace.68.	In their senseless desire to crush our people's will for independence and freedom  the colonialist and imperialist forces took it in turn to impose the longest and bloodiest colonial wars in history upon the Vietnamese people and the other peoples of the IndoChinese Peninsula.69.	And since 1975  the reactionary leaders of our northern neighbour  in collusion with imperialism  have carried out a policy of total hostility against the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. They have unleashed a war of aggression against Viet Nam. They have blatantly interfered in the internal affairs of the peoples of lndo-China. They are now threatening to unleash another war against our people.70.	Everyone knows that there was a time when imperialism accused Viet Nam of being a tool for Chinese and Soviet expansionism and it cooked up the Gulf of Tonkin incident in order to justify its criminal war of aggression against the Vietnamese people. In the same way  in order to cover up their policy of expansion and aggression  the authorities of the only Asian country to possess nuclear weapons claim today that they are fighting Viet Nam because it is a tool for Soviet expansion in Southeast Asia.71.	The truth is that in the last 25 years Southeast Asia has been one of the most unstable regions in the world. It was the only region where the sound of warfare was never silenced. Indeed  after the Second World War  many countries in Southeast Asia fell victim to colonial wars. Then came the bloody war of aggression waged by the American imperialists against Viet Nam  Laos and Kampuchea. It was also during the last 35 years that the leaders of the most heavily populated country in the world made use of their nationals and of local rebel groupings of self-styled ultra revolutionaries to interfere in the internal affairs of the countries of Southeast Asia  thus giving rise to civil wars and lasting rebellions that threaten the peaceful life of the peoples of those countries and pit the countries of the region against one another. They have continually made territorial claims  concerning both land and sea  upon almost all the neighbouring countries. With reference merely to the China Sea  which they would like to transform into a Chinese lake  they occupied the Vietnamese archipelago of Hoang Sa by force in 1974; they claim sovereignty over our archipelago of Truong Sa; and they mark out their southern maritime territorial limits as including the whole of the continental shelves and exclusive economic zones of Viet Nam  Malaysia  Indonesia and the Philippines.72.	After the defeat of the United States in Viet Nam  the hegemonists from the north unleashed a bloody war against Viet Nam on its northern border on the one hand  and through the Pol Pot regime on its southwest side on the other. They intended thus to catch Viet Nam in a two pronged attack  while gravely threatening the independence and security of Laos. But the uprising of the people of Kampuchea  in coordination with the counterattack in self-defence of the Vietnamese people  overthrew the genocidal regime of the Pol PotIeng Sary clique and thus dealt a severe blow to the dark schemes of the hegemonists.73.	The hegemonists in the north  unable to resign themselves to this defeat  have been feverishly carrying out threats of war and subversion  gravely menacing the security  sovereignty and territorial integrity of Viet Nam  Laos and Kampuchea. At the same time  through dark intrigue  they are putting pressure on other countries to urge them to impose an economic blockade and to carry out a campaign of slander at the international level against the three countries of IndoChina  which they hope to subjugate.74.	Taking advantage of the fact that the Lao People's Democratic Republic is sparsely populated and landlocked  they carry out coercion and intimidation and subversive activities  inciting the reactionary forces in a western neighbour of Laos to provoke border conflicts  which they use as a pretext for blocking supply routes and applying an economic blockade  with the aim of stifling the Lao People's Democratic Republic and sowing discord between it and the other countries of IndoChina.75.	They have systematically turned down all proposals aimed at ending the confrontation and restoring peace on the Sino-Viet Nam border  which would normalize relations between the two countries.76.	They have twice rejected our proposal to resume the third round of negotiations between Viet Nam and China which they had pledged to enter into in the second half of 1980.77.	They have repeatedly threatened to teach Viet Nam a second lesson. Such action is an insolent challenge to the independent and sovereign States of the world. It is a manifestation of big nation hegemonism claiming the right to teach another country a lesson just as the United States claims the role of international policeman in any part of the world which it considers to be of vital interest to it.78.	It is common knowledge that over the past 35 years  the people of the three IndoChinese countries have made great sacrifices in the struggle for independence against bloody aggression by colonialism  imperialism and expansionism. But with a view to covering up their criminal acts  the aggressors have always resorted to such labels as ""fighting aggression""  ""defence of the right to self-determination""  ""defence of human rights""  to oppose the people of the three IndoChinese countries. Today  while claiming to be the champions of human rights in the world  they do not hesitate to come out in defence of the genocidal Pol Pot clique  the worst violators of human rights in this century  to oppose the people of Kampuchea and other IndoChinese countries  just as they did in support of the racist regime in South Africa  the Fascists in Chile and the Israeli aggressors.79.	Looking back at the situation in Southeast Asia over the past 35 years  one finds it crystal clear that the lack of peace and security in this region stems from the policies of aggression and intervention of the imperialist forces and of the hegemonism of a country which styles itself as the centre of the world. The peoples of Viet Nam  Laos and Kampuchea  as well as other peoples in Southeast Asia  have been the victims. By launching a relentless and victorious struggle against colonialism  neo-colonialism and expansionism  the peoples of Viet Nam  Laos and Kampuchea have successfully defended their national independence and  at the same time  contributed to the cause of peace and stability in Southeast Asia and the world at large.80.	Following repeated failures in their attempts to revive the genocidal Pol Pot regime in Kampuchea  the international reactionary forces still hope they can reverse the course of history in that country. They have intensified their collusion with imperialism and  by using reactionary elements in a neighbouring country west of Kampuchea  they have sought to supply the armed remnants of the Pol Pot clique and other reactionary Khmer elements and have them launch attacks against the people of Kampuchea  creating an extremely tense and explosive situation on the border between Thailand and Kampuchea. In order to divert public opinion from their criminal actions  they have launched a new anti-Vietnamese campaign.81.	For some time now  Viet Nam  Laos and Kampuchea have been the constant object of the policies of aggression and domination of the imperialist countries and expansionist forces in the North which  in implementation of their aggressive plan  have always considered the three Indo Chinese countries to be a single battlefield. At the same time  they have tried to sow discord among the three countries  to fan the flames of hatred among their peoples  and to pit them against one another. However  in order to defend their independence and freedom  the peoples of Viet Nam  Laos and Kampuchea have always stood closely together in their struggle against the common enemy. That solidarity in combat has vital significance for the national interests of each people.82.	It is in this spirit that on three occasions not too long ago the armed forces of Viet Nam have fought side by side with the peoples of Laos and Kampuchea in defence of the independence of each country and in their struggle against colonialism and imperialism  and now they are standing together in the fight against the hegemonists in the North. Everybody knows that already on two occasions  at the end of their struggle against the French colonialists and against the American imperialists  the Vietnamese army withdrew to Viet Nam respecting the national rights of Laos and Kampuchea.83.	The Vietnamese armed forces now in Laos and Kampuchea are there under the terms of the Treaty of peace  friendship and cooperation signed between Viet Nam and Laos   on the one hand  and between Viet Nam and Kampuchea   on the other. We must together defend the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of each country as well as the life and peaceful work of the respective populations. The presence of those troops threatens no one. In the past 35 years  in their common struggle at the side of the peoples of Laos and Kampuchea  the Vietnamese armed forces have never been outside the territories of the three countries. It is particularly ironic that those who are raising a hue and cry against the presence of the Vietnamese troops in Kampuchea are the very people who waged a war of aggression against Viet Nam  Laos and Kampuchea and committed monstrous crimes against those three peoples.84.	At the height of its war of aggression against Viet Nam  the United States sent more than 500 000 troops there and poured over 15 million tons of bombs on the Vietnamese  Lao and Kampuchean peoples. History still records the fact that China dominated Viet Nam for 1 000 years  from the first to the tenth century and invaded Viet Nam 10 times since the tenth century. Throughout history  Laos and Kampuchea have always been victims of aggression from Thailand. In particular  during the past 40 years  Thailand has on two occasions invaded Kampuchea and Laos. Throughout history  Viet Nam never committed aggression against Thailand. Thailand  on the other hand  invaded Viet Nam on three occasions during the last three centuries.85.	Those who are the loudest in opposing the presence of the Vietnamese troops are also those who did their utmost to support United States aggression against the Vietnamese  Lao and Kampuchean peoples and who have kept silent on the Israeli aggression against the Arab peoples.86.	The United States  who invented the legend of the so-called ""use of chemical weapons in Afghanistan  Kampuchea and Laos""  is the very country which dropped hundreds of thousands of tons of poisonous chemicals on our countryâan average of 6 pounds for each person in South Viet Namâwhich caused death and destruction among our people  and had a serious effect on the American veterans of the Viet Nam war.87.	These historical facts clearly prove that Viet Nam and the IndoChinese countries have never committed acts of aggression against any country and have always been victims of foreign aggression. Thailand itself has publicly admitted that its security is not at stake  and that is why it refuses to sign a treaty of nonaggression between Viet Nam and Thailand  and to establish a demilitarized zone between Kampuchea and Thailand. The fact that the international reactionary forces and imperialism make much of the so called Viet Nam threat to Thailand and create tension along the Kampuchea Thai border is nothing but a scheme to cover up the aggression from the northern expansionists against the IndoChinese peoples with the smokescreen of a confrontation between IndoChina and the countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations [ASEAN]. Pitting peoples of different countries against each other  inciting them to fight each other  instigating extremist groups to create disturbances in the world are the usual methods to which international reactionaries resort in order to realize their reactionary global strategy designed  so they say  to establish their own internal order over the great world chaos  thus achieving the world hegemony they seek.88.	This reactionary strategy of the expansionists is completely at variance with the interests of the Chinese people  a nation which has endured untold suffering caused by the oppression and exploitation of its own leaders and foreign aggressors  a nation which has an age-old civilization and a glorious tradition of struggle  and which was always eager to live in peace and harmony with the peoples of the world. Whatever the circumstances  the Vietnamese people will always treasure the traditional friendship between the Vietnamese people and the Chinese people.89.	The fundamental task today in restoring peace and stability in Southeast Asia is to halt the policy of aggression  intervention and threats of war by the expansionists  in collusion with imperialism  against the national independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Southeast Asian countries.90.	The key to the so-called Kampuchea issue lies in an end to the hostile policy carried out against Kampuchea  Laos and Viet Nam by the international reactionary forces. The presence of the Vietnamese troops in Kampuchea is aimed at combating such threats of expansionism and is in response to the request of the People's Revolutionary Council of Kampuchea. The Vietnamese armed forces will be withdrawn from Kampuchea once such threats no longer exist and the People's Revolutionary Council of Kampuchea so requests.91.	The whole world has seen the true face of the Pol Pot clique  a gang of criminals who have no place whatsoever in Kampuchea. But its supporters are trying their best to put the blame on the presence of the Vietnamese troops  using that presence as a pretext to have the clique hold on to its seat in the United Nations  so that they can continue to use it as an instrument against the Kampuchean people and to undermine peace and stability in Southeast Asia.92.	Now that everybody has come to know the Pol Pot clique as a gang of genocidal criminals who have killed 3 million Kampucheans; now that public opinion has come to realize that the overthrow of the Pol Pot clique has created for the Kampuchean people a chance to rekindle their lives from the ashes; now that life has returned to the Kampuchean land after the nightmare of genocide  no rationale can ever justify any action to legalize the actions of the genocidal Pol Pot clique against the resurrection of the Kampuchean people.93.	Whatever the excuse offered  one truth is undeniable: the People's Revolutionary Council of Kampuchea is the only genuine and authentic representative of the Kampuchean people because it symbolizes their will to rid themselves of the genocidal regime and thus enables the Kampuchean nation to live again. Kampuchea's seat in this hall should be returned to the People's Revolutionary Council of Kampuchea.94.	There are differences of opinion between the ASEAN and the IndoChinese countries over the Kampuchea issue. The views of the ASEAN countries cannot be imposed upon the IndoChinese countries by anyone  and the Indo Chinese countries have no intention of imposing their views on the ASEAN countries. We regret that the proposals of the ASEAN countries presented at this session of the General Assembly show that they have not given up their intention to interfere in the internal affairs of Kampuchea and the other IndoChinese countries and to blatantly violate their sovereignty. These proposals do not settle the fundamental question of the removal of the Chinese threat to the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of the three Indo Chinese countries and to peace and security in Southeast Asia.95.	The ASEAN and IndoChinese countries should temporarily put aside all differences and jointly make Southeast Asia a zone of peace  stability and cooperation. This is in the common interests of all Southeast Asian countries. We hold that if the ASEAN countries continue to impose their view of the so-called Kampuchean issue on the Indo Chinese countries as they have done  they will not help solve the worsening situation in Southeast Asia. The Indo Chinese countries respect the security of the ASEAN countries and expect the ASEAN countries to reciprocate. The Southeast Asian countriesâabove all the IndoChinese and ASEAN countriesâshould join hands in building a new relationship on the basis of mutual understanding  respect for one another's interests  and peaceful coexistence aimed at making Southeast Asia a zone of peace and stability  thus contributing to the defence of peace and security throughout the world.96.	Motivated by this reality  we appeal once again to the ASEAN countries to respond positively to the proposals in the statement of the Conference of the Foreign Ministers of Laos  Kampuchea and Viet Nam  issued at Vientiane on 18 July 1980 and  first and foremost  they should respond positively to the proposal of the People's Republic of Kampuchea on the establishment of a demilitarized zone between Kampuchea and Thailand. We are prepared to enter immediately into discussions with the ASEAN countries on the establishment of a zone of peace and stability in Southeast Asia on the basis of the Kuala Lumpur Declaration   the Kuantan Principle and the Vientiane statement. We are also prepared to discuss the issues with the countries concerned and settle the disputes in the China Sea  with a view to turning that region into one of peace and cooperation between the coastal States  on the basis of respect for one another's rights over their territorial waters  continental shelves and exclusive economic zones  as well as respect for international sea and air routes.97.	We should like to inform the General Assembly that through the good offices of the Secretary General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  a meeting is expected to be held within a few days between the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Viet Nam and Thailand at United Nations Headquarters. We hope that that meeting will offer favourable opportunities to restore peace and stability in Southeast Asia.98.	At the same time  we have informed the Secretary General of the following points which have been agreed upon by the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the People's Revolutionary Council of Kampuchea: the presence of Vietnamese armed forces in Kampuchea is aimed at countering the Chinese threat against Kampuchea and Viet Nam and they are there at the request of the People's Revolutionary Council of Kampuchea. When this threat no longer exists and the People's Revolutionary Council so requests  the Vietnamese armed forces will be withdrawn from Kampuchea. The tension along the Kampuchean Thai border is a threat to peace in that region. The creation of a demilitarized zone on both sides of the Kampuchean Thai border is the best way to ensure peace  security and stability in the border areas of Kampuchea and Thailand. Through the good offices of the Secretary General  Kampuchea and Thailand will negotiate in order to solve the explosive situation on the Kampuchean Thai border on the basis of respect for the interests of both sides. Based on the situation of peace  security and stability along the Kampuchean Thai border  the Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the People's Revolutionary Council of Kampuchea will discuss and decide on Viet Nam's withdrawal of part of its armed forces from Kampuchea.99.	With the dramatic growth of peace forces over the past 35 years  the awakening of oppressed and dependent nations constitutes an historic event which has drastically upset the international order that imperialism wants to impose on mankind. Determined to live no longer in poverty and backwardness under imperialist oppression and exploitation  the peoples have risen up to wrest back their right to be masters of their own destiny. The colonial system  which weighed so heavily on mankind for over three centuries  has collapsed in a period of only three decades. The birth of a series of new States and their increasingly active participation in international political affairs have created conditions for the gradual emergence of a new type of international relationship among independent  equal and sovereign States.100.	Having gone through an age-old history of struggles against much stronger enemies in defence of its national independence  the Vietnamese people has consistently stood by the Asian  African and Latin American peoples in their struggle for peace  national independence  democracy  welfare and social progress.101.	At the present moment  owing to American imperialism's policy of playing the China card  the situation in Asia is becoming extremely tense and peace and security there are seriously threatened.102.	We highly value the initiatives of the Soviet Union  the constructive propositions of India  which spring from its foreign policy of peace and nonalignment  and also the efforts made by other countries to strengthen peace and security in Asia. We support the legitimate aspirations of the countries which border on the Indian Ocean and wish to transform it into a zone of peace and who demand that the United States of America put an end to its military activities there  cease enlarging existing military bases  particularly Diego Garcia  and refrain from establishing new bases in that region. In this respect  we support the initiative of the Democratic Republic of Madagascar in seeking to convene a summit conference of countries concerned with the question of peace in the Indian Ocean. Viet Nam is ready to participate in such a conference. We are pleased that a Conference on the Indian Ocean will be convened at Colombo in 1981. We demand that the United States renounce its attempts to annex the Micronesian islands  withdraw its troops from South Korea and end its collusion with the expansionists who wish to perpetuate the division of Korea  and desist from its policy of aggression  intervention and subversion against the peoples of Afghanistan  Iran and the countries of the Indian subcontinent.103.	The Vietnamese people is determined to strengthen its solidarity with the people and the Government of Afghanistan in their struggle to safeguard the gains of their revolution  their independence and their national sovereignty. We highly value the wide-ranging aid accorded by the Soviet Union to the Afghan people and Government to help them stand up to the attempts at aggression and acts of intervention and subversion on the part of the forces of imperialism and international reaction.104.	American imperialism and international reactionary circles  acting in close collusion  are the greatest accomplices of the Zionist Israelis in their policy of aggression against the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Arab peoples  thus perpetuating the explosive situation in the Middle East. The Vietnamese people extends its total support to the struggle of the Palestinian people  whose sole authentic representative is the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]  for the recovery of its fundamental national rights  including the right to create an independent and sovereign State  and to confound the attempts of the American imperialists to impose a separate peace treaty between Egypt and Israel. We support the struggle of the Arab peoples for the recovery of all the territories illegally occupied by the Israeli aggressors  and we demand that Israel renounce its attempt to occupy once and for all the city of Jerusalem  the holy and inviolable land of the Arab peoples.105.	In the last 35 years the African continent has undergone the most profound changes in its history. The map of that continent has radically changed. The African peoples have thrown off the yoke of slavery and  together with their brothers and sisters in Asia and Latin America  are in the process of building a new life. The Vietnamese people warmly welcomes the most recent victory of the African peoplesâthe accession to independence of the Republic of Zimbabwe and its admission to the United Nations. At the same time  we staunchly support the struggle waged by the peoples of Namibia and South Africa  under the direction respectively of SWAPO and the African National Congress  against the barbaric domination imposed by colonialism and by the policy of apartheid carried out by the South African racists and for their right to true self-determination and independence. The victories of the people of Zimbabwe and of other southern African peoples cannot be dissociated from the support of the frontline countries  the OAU and the peoples of the world. We firmly support the fraternal peoples of Angola and Mozambique in their struggle to safeguard their independence  their sovereignty and their territorial integrity against the manoeuvres and acts of aggression of the South African colonialists. The struggle waged by the people and the Government of the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic  under the leadership of the POLISARIO"" Front  for the realization of their fundamental national rights  has always had the sympathy and warm support of the Vietnamese people.106.	As in other regions of the world  the policy of aggression  intervention and threat of the use of force on the part of imperialism  in collusion with international reaction  constitutes the most dangerous threat to national independence  peace and stability in Central America and in the Caribbean region.107.	The Vietnamese people remain at the side of the fraternal Cuban people in their struggle against the hostile policy  the economic blockade and the military threats of American imperialism and international reaction. We demand that the United States of America restore to Cuba the naval base of Guantanamo  which it occupies illegally.108.	We are delighted with the important achievements of the peoples and the Governments of Nicaragua and Grenada in strengthening their national independence and rebuilding their countries. Equally  we staunchly support the struggle of the people of Panama to exercise total sovereignty over the Canal Zone; that of the people of Jamaica against imperialistic attempts at subversion and intervention; that of the Chilean people against the Pinochet Fascist junta; and that of the peoples of Puerto Rico and Belize against imperialist domination and for their right to self-determination and independence.109.	In particular  the Vietnamese people would like to express its solidarity with the struggle of the people and the Revolutionary Democratic Front of El Salvador against the Fascist regime of the military clique in power and against the threat of imperialist intervention  and for their right to live in freedom and independence and to decide their own destiny.110.	The independence of the peoples of Asia  Africa and Latin America will not be strengthened if these peoples  having thrown off the yoke of colonialism  do not regain their right to be masters of their own natural resources. It is regrettable that  because of the intransigent policy of the imperialist countries negotiations on world economic questions have not so far produced any tangible result. The Vietnamese people is determined to make its contribution to the struggle of the peoples in the developing countries to do away with all forms of colonialist and neo-colonialist exploitation  to achieve sovereignty over their natural resources and to eliminate all forms of discrimination and all inequality  in order to promote a new type of just and equitable international economic relations.111.	In this year of the thirty-fifth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations and the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  we are happy to note that despite all the manoeuvres by imperialism and reactionary international forces to reverse the course of history  the forces of peace  national independence  democracy  social progress and socialism continue to develop. The nonaligned movement  which embraces the majority of developing countries  is now stronger than ever and has become an indispensable factor in the struggle by the peoples of the world for peace  security and international cooperation. Its voice and its role in the international arena grow ever greater. Many difficulties and obstacles still await us. However  we are setting out with confidence into the 1980s. The Vietnamese people will spare no effort to make its contribution to the common cause of the peoples of the world."
"145",7496,"YEM",35,1980,"ï»¿Mr. President  on behalf of the delegation of the Yemen Arab Republic and on my own behalf  I should like to express to you our satisfaction at your unanimous election to the presidency of this important session. I wish you every success in the conduct of the proceedings of the General Assembly  so that our efforts uphold the principles and help to achieve the objectives of the Charter of the United Nations. I have no doubt that you will place your long diplomatic experience at the service of just causes  so that we may find solutions to urgent problems on the agenda of this session. The delegation of the Yemen Arab Republic will do everything in its power to co-operate with you so that this objective may be achieved and our task successfully carried out.123.	I should also like to congratulate your predecessor  Mr. Salim  on his successful conduct of the work of the thirty-fourth session and to express my appreciation of his tireless efforts in guiding the work not only of that session but of the special sessions towards important and positive resolutions.124.	I must not forget to pay a tribute here to the Secretary-General through whose efforts the Organization has become more effective. I wish to express my appreciation of his efforts in serving the cause of international peace and eliminating sources of tension in so many parts of the world in accordance with the objectives of our noble Organization. I should also like to express my gratitude for his report on the work of the Organization and the international situation over the past year  in which he evaluates with understanding and objectivity the existing crisis and conflicts in the world.125.	It also gives me great pleasure to extend my warmest congratulations to the Governments and delegations of Zimbabwe and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines on their entry into the United Nations now that their peoples have won their independence and recovered their liberty. I am happy to welcome their delegations. Their membership in the Organization is a victory for all the peoples  which like the peoples of Namibia and Palestine  are fighting to establish their right to self-determination. I have no doubt that those two new Members  through their participation  will enhance the effectiveness of the Organization and play a larger part in the maintenance of international peace and security and world stability.126.	The thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly is being held in a tense and unstable international situation in which rivalries are affecting peace and detente. We had hoped that detente would be well established by the end of the last decade and would be spreading so as to benefit not only the major Powers which took the initiative in creating itâthis being one of the characteristics of international relationsâbut the whole world  and in particular the peoples suffering under the yoke of imperialism and colonialism  from exploitation of their natural resources and international rivalries and polarization. We had hoped that they might enjoy the peace and stability which are so necessary for a new order of international relations  marked by democracy and equality  free from exploitation  tension  the arms race and instability.127.	The present international situation is having an adverse effect not only on international relations but also on stability  development and progress throughout the world  and in particular the third world.128.	I wish to recall here that it is the duty of the international community to make major and intensive efforts to ameliorate that situation. For this international community  the United Nations  was created to put an end to everything of which the causes and effects might constitute impediments to peace and security anywhere in the world  as peace is one and indivisible and represents the aspirations of all States and peoples of the world  particularly those peoples which have not been able to enjoy its full benefits since achieving independence and liberty. These are the peoples of the third world  in particular the peoples of the Middle East and the Palestinians  who have suffered from imperialist plots from the beginning of this century right up to the present day.129.	Having struggled in all the Arab countries against colonialism in all its forms  the Arab people has been compelled to continue this struggle against the intruding Zionist  racist and colonialist entity  which was created and has been fostered and strengthened by colonialist and imperialist countries so that that region should continue to suffer from chronic instability  division and warfare. Moreover  the State of Israel was created by a decision of the Organization  which Israel today rejects and whose resolutions it scorns. Israel continues its actions against the Palestinian Arab people  including expulsion  the confiscation of goods and the promulgation of racist laws.130.	Israel expanded through aggression against certain Arab countries in 1967  following which it occupied the whole of Palestine and some Arab territories. Through that aggression the Zionist racist State won new positions of strength and has been able to impose the law of the jungle and of piracy  with the assistance  support and blessing of a super-Power which continues to this day to maintain its unjust attitude on the side of that aggression and against the Palestinian people  its right to self-determination  to return to its country and to establish an independent and sovereign State under the leadership of its militant vanguard  the PLO  which is its sole authentic representative. We supported that organization  just as we supported the rule of law and justice  and the rights of the Palestinian people during the seventh special emergency session of the Assembly  devoted to the Palestinian question.131.	The stronger international support becomes for the cause of the Palestinians and the greater the sympathy for their struggle under the leadership of the PLO and for the struggle of the Arab peoples to free their occupied territories  the more the arrogance and aggressiveness of Israel increases and  at the same time  the more imperialist military  economic and diplomatic support is demonstrated for this shameful conduct. We are witnessing here a struggle between good and evil  between justice and injustice. The United Nations  which was created after the world had suffered from the scourge of war and conflicts  must put an end to such conduct in order to safeguard its very existence  its objectives and international peace in the interests of all the peoples of the world.132.	Israel's arrogance and its unabashed and irresponsible defiance of United Nations resolutions do not give cause for optimism to our generation or  for that matter  future generations. Israel is intoxicated by the temporary victory it has won thanks to the treacherous bargain struck at Camp David  which has not served the cause of peace in the region but  on the contrary  the cause of the Israeli aggressive and expansionist strategy and the aims of the super-Power that supports it. That deal is contrary to the national aspiration of the Palestinian people and its struggle and to the right of the Arab people to free their territories occupied since 1967. Since that deal was concluded  Israel has continued to establish settlements throughout the occupied Arab lands  particularly op Palestinian land  and even in the very heart of Palestine  the Holy City of Jerusalem. Israel plotted to assassinate the mayors of towns in the occupied West Bank who had refused  as had their people  to accept the ""autonomy"" conspiracy and the oppression and terrorism  which increased after the Camp David deal  which was condemned by all the Arab peoples and Governments  including the people and the Government of the Arab Republic of Yemen.133.	Israel was not content with committing those acts  which have been condemned as repugnant to the conscience of mankind  all religious and human rights; that illegal entity persisted in that attitude and decided to annex Jerusalem and proclaim it its permanent and unified capital. I should like to take this opportunity  on behalf of my Government  to express appreciation and gratitude to the States Members of this international Organization which have supported Arab rights and refused to recognize that Zionist decision  which demonstrates its expansionist policy and is contrary to the fundamental principles of international law. We are also gratified by the fact that certain States have responded positively to resolution 478 (1980)  in which the Security Council decided that that Israeli action was illegal  by withdrawing their diplomatic missions from Jerusalem in order to demonstrate their disapproval of such action and rejection of the policy of annexation  exploitation and occupation.134.	Israel's actions have not been confined to acts of piracy against its principal victims  the Palestinian people on its own territory and in its own homeland even; it has also extended its acts of aggression to within the borders of an independent State  a State Member of the United Nations  Lebanon. Its attacks against Lebanon and its people and against the Palestine refugee camps  whether by air  land or sea  have become a matter of routine and meet no obstacle  as is known by the international forces responsible for maintaining peace in southern Lebanon and containing Israeli violations. That aggression applies the Zionist and imperialist plot by armed intermediary groups chosen to facilitate the Israeli conspiracy by exporting war and tension to Lebanon.135.	I should like to reaffirm before the General Assembly that there can be no peace in the Middle East on the basis of exploitation  oppression  terror  the denial of rights and occupation. Peace must be based on recognition of the national rights of the Palestinan people and their aspiration to the liberation of their country  return to their homeland and the creation of an independent and sovereign State  without any conditions or restrictions that would infringe those rights  or the rights of the PLO  their sole authentic representative. The settlements policy and all actions aimed at changing the demographic composition of the Palestinian territory must also be ended. Israel must withdraw from all Arab lands occupied after the 1967 aggression.136.	We must also recognize that the Camp David approach is not one which will lead to peace and stability in the area; rather  it is a continuation of the plot against the Palestinian people. All the Arab peoples support General Assembly resolution 33/75 and the resolutions adopted at the seventh emergency special session  which was devoted to the rights of the Palestinian people.137.	Yemen supports its brother Arab countries with regard to all positions and policies affecting peace and stability in our region. That is why we are following with a great deal of distress what is happening between Iraq and Iran. We support all efforts on the part of the United Nations and the Islamic Conference to halt hostilities so that peace and stability may be restored to the area.138.	We are pleased by the positive role played by the Government of Iraq in responding favourably to Security Council resolution 479 (1980) calling for a cease-fire  and we consider it to be a step forward towards a just solution.139.	We support all the good offices undertaken by a large number of State Members of the United Nations and we call upon all States  particularly the great Powers  not to interfere in this conflict  so that international peace may be safeguarded.140.	The Arab Republic of Yemen is following the situation with great interest and concern  because we are close to the theatre of these events  whether it is the Arabian Gulf  the Red Sea or the Indian Ocean and are thus directly affected by what happens there. We denounce any attempt to make this region a focal point of conflict and tension and we demand that the region of the Red Sea be declared a zone of peace  with neither foreign bases nor a foreign presence; the responsibility for protecting the region of the Arabian Gulf rests solely with its people  who are capable of preventing any outside interference in the region.141.	Since regional and international peace are intimately linked  Yemen reiterates its position that the Indian Ocean should be declared a zone of peace  free from foreign presence in any form whatsoever.142.	I believe that the present situation is such that General Assembly resolution 2832 (XXVI) on the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace should be applied in the interest of all the peoples of the region  and in the interest of international peace and security.143.	The struggle against racism and colonialism has just won a new victory with the independence of Zimbabwe  which has succeeded in throwing off the yoke of imperialism and racism. But the United Nations and all peace-loving and justice-loving forces in the world must continue the struggle  for the events in Zimbabwe augur well for the future of Namibia  which is now oppressed by South Africa. We are sure that the peoples of that region will succeed in winning their right to total independence.144.	The racist regime of South Africa continues to occupy and oppress the peoples of South West Africaâ Namibia. This constitutes defiance not only of the logic of our times  during which numerous imperialist colonies have been eliminated  but also of the Organization  the Charter  and United Nations resolutions. The colonialist  racist nature of that occupation means that the responsibility of the people of Namibia  under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO]  its sole legitimate representative  is a very special one; the national struggle will continue until the racist  imperialist occupation is eliminated; that occupation is  unfortunately  encouraged and sustained by certain States in the service of their strategic aims and ambitions and at the expense of the justice and stability sought by this struggling people who seek to rid the African continent of this last vestige of colonialism and racism.145.	Yemen calls for the implementation of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) and other resolutions adopted 20 years ago. After the adoption of that resolution on the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples  dozens of third world countries attained their independence.146.	The peoples of the third world understand that  in their struggle for liberty and political independence  the attainment of that independence is not the end of the road. Political independence must be accompanied by economic independence. Thus  since the 1960s  these peoples have held conferences in the United Nations so as to put into concrete form their demand for the establishment of a new international economic order.147.	All statistical and scientific indicators point to the importance of this  not only in the interest of the developing countries  but also in the interest of progress and economic development throughout the world. The system now prevailing in international economic relations does not prevent increasing imbalances in the balance of payments  a factor of great influence on the development of the third world. The balance-of-payments deficit of non-oil-exporting developing countries has amounted this year to $70 billion. This means that the developing countries face a catastrophic situation.148.	In this connection we should like to express our regret at the failure of the Assembly at the eleventh special session devoted to international economic co-operation for development.149.	Several years have gone by since the General Assembly  at its sixth special session  adopted the Declaration and Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New Inter-national Economic Order. Efforts have been made in the course of the North- South dialogue  at various levels and both within the United Nations framework and outside it  in order to arrive at an agreement on a basis for the new international economic order  but it has become clear that the hard and unjust line taken by the majority of developed countries has caused these efforts to fail.150.	Today the non-aligned movement is the expression of the awakening of the third world and its determination not to follow the course charted by the great Powers. It is also the expression of the conviction that the third world countries have a role to play in international affairs  which are no longer the exclusive province of the great Powers.151.	My country  a founder-member and participant in the activities of the non-aligned movement  is optimistic about the movement's future. We believe that a better future is in store for it and that its effectiveness will increase as long as its expresses the aspirations and interests of the developing countries and peoples  which continue to be victims of the great Power rivalry and of imperialist exploitation.152.	This international movement  very limited at the beginning  has expanded and continues to expand. This demonstrates the importance of the movement as a link between countries which  although geographically distant  have a common will and common interests: above all  that peace should prevail throughout the world  that the causes of tension and war be eliminated and that international relations be marked by stability  understanding and mutual co-operation.153.	My country has committed itself to these policies and supports the decisions of the movement  particularly those concerning the right of peoples to self-determination and expressing opposition to imperialism  colonialism and Zionist racism. My country shows this commitment in the sixth principle of its revolution of 26 September 1962.154.	In connection with hotbeds of tension in the world  we should like to say that solutions to outstanding problems which are a threat to international peace and security must be found. The problem of Afghanistan is one of the most important. We support all efforts to find a solution to this problem through all appropriate means  so as to enable the Afghan people to progress and to develop in accordance with their own will  in their own way  and without any outside influence or interference.155.	Among the obligations and responsibilities of the Organization and the whole of mankind  is the need to put an end to the arms race and to bring about full disarmament to enable humanity to live in peace.156.	Disarmament  in our view  means the eradication of poverty  underdevelopment  inequality and international tension in order to hasten the advent of an era of prosperity for the whole of mankind.157.	It is a scandal that arms expenditures should amount to tens of billions of dollars while millions of human beings are suffering from hunger in various parts of the world because of natural calamities and also from man-made catastrophes.158.	The arms race has not merely created an atmosphere of despair as to a better future for mankind  which is nowhere near being realized. The arms race is an obstacle in the path of international relations marked by detente and co-operation and its ill effects transcend the frontiers of the great Powers and reach the developing countries which have recently become independent; it cannot but add to the burden caused by the already grave economic and financial situation.159.	All this reflects the climate of mistrust which prevails in international relations and the effects of the rivalries among great Powers on small countries which must perforce rely on the great Powers in one way or another in the arming  organization and training of their armies  not to mention the impact on their own capacity to take economic and political decisions free from foreign influence and pressure.160.	My country supports efforts to achieve disarmament and to put an end to armaments and to nuclear tests. We hope the great Powers will succeed in the near future in reaching an agreement on ratifying the SALT II Treaty as a demonstration of their attachment to peace  their aversion to war  respect for man and their desire not to destroy mankind.161.	Like the majority of the international community  my country has adopted a position as to the need to put an end to sources of tension which persist between the two parts of Korea. We should find the necessary and logical elements which would make possible negotiations between the two Governments as a first stage towards the reunification of this divided people.162.	My country affirms its position that action leading to the reunification of Korea should be based on democratic means  free from any foreign intervention or influence  whatever form it may take and from whatever source. This action must also be peaceful and all democratic and nationalist forces of both sides must participate.163.	We have no doubt that by putting an end to the division of Korea we shall bring about a climate favourable to peace and security not only on the Korean peninsula  but also in the South-East Asian region and throughout the world.164.	We also repeat our position with regard to the question of Cyprus  a position reflected in our support for the following points: the responsibility of the United Nations with regard to the maintenance of peace and security in that divided country; the importance of the fact that Cyprus should remain a neutral and united State; the need through negotiations  under the aegis of the United Nations  to succeed in putting an end to the abnormal situation which now prevails in Cyprus. 165. The proliferation of hotbeds of tension throughout the world demands that we exert a great deal of effort to support the Organization  which has undertaken positive action in the past. We hope that at this session  responding to the international situation  the Assembly will succeed in adopting positive resolutions  particularly against those countries which flout the decisions of the Organization. In this connection  we are thinking particularly of Israel. We must prevent it from continuing its activities in international organizations so as to prevail upon it to respect the Charter and United Nations resolutions  and we will spare no effort to support the United Nations within the framework of respect for the principles of the Charter."
"146",7543,"YUG",35,1980,"ï»¿I wish to congratulate Ambassador von Wechmar on his election to the presidency of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly.

That showed that Tito  his ideas and his achievements do not belong to Yugoslavia alone but to all mankind. This is a source of pride and adds to our obligation to follow his path.229.	We are gathered here to examine the situation in the world and to see what should be done to improve it.230.	The problems and challenges are so pressing that we need more than ever before a high degree of political realism and shared responsibility if we wish to survive on our turbulent planet. We have to face the fact that the vast majority of mankind refuses to reconcile itself to the existing situation  which is more and more intolerable.231.	We are entering an era in which people and nations insist on the right to take an active part in shaping world development. Numerous contradictions have piled up in our world: the question of war or peace in various parts of the globe; poverty and hunger; privileges and exploitation; problems of development and the dangerous arms race; and various forms of domination. But there is also resistance to such a state of affairs.232.	Today we can communicate only in the language of equality and independence. Solutions that do not take into account the interests of all are not acceptable any longer. That is the only basis on which the new international relations can be built.233.	The policy of nonalignment is a quintessential expression of the aspirations of peoples to full independence  freedom  and a life worthy of human beings. Almost two thirds of the membership of this Assembly have found in the principles and objectives of the policy of non-alignment the broadest common denominator in their striving to build a new international order.234.	Nonalignment offers a vision and a concept of the world in which we shall live tomorrow. Today few would deny the great contribution that nonalignment has made to mankind. In this respect may I recall the words of President Tito at the Sixth Conference of the nonaligned countries. During the past two decades. President Tito emphasized  we have reaffirmed the original principles and objectives of nonalignment as permanent values: we have resolutely fought for peace  security and freedom in the world: we have made a substantial contribution to the successful outcome of the anticolonial revolution: we have opposed the policy of force and foreign interference in all their forms: we have codified the principles of active and peaceful coexistence  and resolutely advocated their implementation; we have initiated long-term actions for the establishment of the New International Economic Order; and we have contributed to the goal of the universality of the United Nations and to the strengthening of its role.235.	The policy of nonalignment has asserted itself as a vital and independent factor of stability and positive changes in the world. We note with satisfaction that it is gaining ever wider acceptance  in the name of political realism.236.	Experience has long taught us that the existence of a balance based on fear and the absence of global conflict between the great Powers is hot likely to secure lasting peace. On the contrary  it often gives rise to further rivalries  obstructs the emancipation of peoples and prevents them from freely choosing their own way of life. All this engenders local wars and conflicts in various parts of the globe in which thousands of lives are lost daily  immeasurable suffering is inflicted on people  and tremendous material damage is done.237.	The past year has shown that the only possible solutions to existing crises  and the only realistic answers to the major issues  are those based on the aspirations of nations to live and work in freedom  aspirations which are firmly rooted in the Charter of the United Nations.238.	The victory of the people of Zimbabwe  attained after a long and arduous liberation struggle  confirms that there is no power that can thwart the determination of a people to achieve its freedom and become the master of its own destiny. This victory is one of the greatest contributions that the peoples of southern Africa have made to the liquidation of colonialism  racial discrimination and apartheid.239.	The colonialist and racist policy of South Africa is untenable and unacceptable from the political  social and humanitarian standpoint. It is inconceivable that a certain number of States continue to cooperate with the racist regime in Pretoria while the latter flouts the decisions of the United Nations  launches aggressive attacks against neighbouring countries and perpetrates brutal acts of violence against the oppressed people of Namibia.240.	It should be recalled that the United Nationsâand that means every Member Stateâis directly responsible for the liberation of Namibia. From that stems our obligation to adopt at the present session decisions calling upon the Security Council to ensure the full implementation of its resolution 435 (1978). and to apply all possible measures at our disposal  including the provisions of Chapter VII of the Charter  thus supporting the just struggle of the people of Namibia headed by SWAPO.241.	At this critical juncture we must demonstrate our readiness to bring to an end the era of colonialism  one of the most shameful pages in human history.242.	Let us turn to another global crisis. In the Middle East  by its permanent aggression and usurpation of the rights of Arab peoples  by the annexation of Jerusalem  as well as by constant attacks on the independence of Lebanon  Israel persistently violates the principles of the Charter and the decisions of the United Nations.243.	No one with a sense of political realism can any longer deny that the Palestinian question is at the core of the Middle East crisis and that the PLO is the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. Without its equal participation there can be no just  lasting and comprehensive solution of the crisis. It is our duty to secure for the Palestinian people its basic rights to self-determination and to the establishment of a State of its own  as well as its right to make sovereign decisions about its destiny. This calls  in the first place  for the withdrawal of Israeli troops from all the Arab territories occupied in 1967.244.	In recent times the world has witnessed a growing tendency towards the use of force in international relations. Sovereignty  territorial integrity and the right to free national and social development have constantly been jeopardized.245.	We consider that the only way out of this situation would be a return to consistent implementation of the norms of international life  from which force  pressure and interference must be resolutely excluded. Our approach to all the crises in the world is guided by those ideas.246.	One such crisis has been developing in Southeast Asia. There is a serious threat of its escalation into a conflict of wider proportions. We wish to reiterate that  in our opinion  a way out of this danger would be through an urgent search for a political solution. That of course implies the withdrawal of foreign troops and the creation of conditions that will enable the people of Kampuchea to decide on its socio-political system and to re-establish the independent and nonaligned status of its country.247.	We also view with anxiety the developments in the region of Southwest Asia  the Gulf and the Indian Ocean. They warn us that rivalries aimed at extending spheres of influence threaten to turn that region into an arena of constant instability and new global conflict.248.	We wish all disputes to be solved by peaceful means  and in this regard we are ready to exert maximum efforts within the framework of the United Nations. We believe that in the case of the Afghanistan crisis  which is fraught with great danger  a political solution will be sought too. That means that a solution should include the withdrawal of foreign troops  ensuring normal relations and strengthening the independence and security of all the countries in the region.249.	With regard to the Korean question  we welcome the position of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea calling for the solution of that question by peaceful means  without foreign interference  and the readiness of that Government to resume the dialogue on unification is a constructive contribution which is in keeping with the legitimate aspirations and the right of the Korean people to be united.250.	With respect to the crisis in Western Sahara  we wish to emphasize that that is  to our mind  a colonial question which can be solved justly only on the basis of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples and the relevant United Nations resolutions. This implies the realization of the right of the people of Western Sahara to self-determination. Therefore  we welcome the efforts exerted within the OAU aimed at finding a peaceful solution to this problem.251.	In our view  prolonging the Cyprus crisis perpetuates a constant hotbed of conflict and instability in the eastern Mediterranean. The resumption of intercommunal talks is  we believe  the right way to reach a solution acceptable to both parties. The framework for this was laid down in General Assembly resolution 3212 (XXIX) and in numerous documents adopted at conferences of the nonaligned countries which show that a lasting and just solution can be based only on the withdrawal of foreign troops and the preservation of the independence  territorial integrity  sovereignty and nonaligned status of Cyprus.252.	Bearing in mind the dangers arising from a continuous multiplication of global crises  we attach particular attention to the initiative of the nonaligned countries in elaborating a declaration on the inadmissibility of intervention and interference in the internal affairs of States."" We believe that its adoption by the General Assembly would contribute to more responsible behaviour by States in their mutual relations and would reduce the danger of intervention.253.	Let us bear this responsibility together and act in a spirit of constructive cooperation and mutual confidence. Ideological differences or differences in our socio-political systems should not  we are deeply convinced  be an obstacle to the consistent application of active and peaceful coexistence as the basic characteristic of international relations and the common responsibility for the future of the world in which we live. In this regard we wish to stress the responsibility of all countries  including the nonaligned  strictly to observe the principles of international behaviour enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.254.	At this point I should like to express our deep regret and serious concern over the armed conflict between Iraq and Iran. We sincerely hope that those two countries  which belong to the nonaligned movement  will find a peaceful solution to the conflict on the basis of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the policy of non-alignment.255.	I should particularly like to emphasize our conviction that the policy of nonalignment is a universal concept whose spirit and basic values can also be successfully applied to intra-European relations and cooperation.256.	The maintenance of a bloc approach to the decisions of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe  held at Helsinki in 1975  would amount to a lasting endorsement of the division of Europe  with grave consequences for the whole world. Therefore  we feel that the time has come when the bloc concept of detente  which to a certain extent is prevalent in Europe  must increasingly evolve into genuine all European detente. We feel that the neutral and nonaligned countries of Europe can play a significant role in the strengthening of this process. We hope that the review session at Madrid of the Helsinki Conference will successfully overcome all obstacles.257.	Europe cannot keep peace for itself alone and close its eyes to what is happening in the rest of the world. It cannot ensure its own economic progress without contributing to the solution of the economic problems of the world. It cannot successfully control armaments on its own soil  if it does not contribute to the process of general and complete disarmament. There can be no lasting relaxation of tensions in Europe in the absence of solutions to crises on other continents.258.	I should like to lay particular stress on the fact that the arms race serves to strengthen various forms of monopoly and domination. There is no need to point out that such practices constantly threaten the vital interests of the independence  security and development of the developing and nonaligned countries.259.	Preparations for two important conferences in the next few years are before the General Assembly of the United Nations: first  the new special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament  scheduled for 1982; and  secondly  the international conference to be held by 1983  under the auspices of the United Nations  aimed at finding a political solution to the question of unhindered realization of the nuclear energy programmes of all countries for peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Yugoslavia is of the opinion that all States should actively contribute to the success of those conferences.260.	International economic relations are going through a deep crisis and the developing countries are its first victims. The existing system of old privileges is a source of a number of major disruptions in the world economy and of inequality in political relations which cause chronic instability in the world. We also believe that new realities make it imperative for international economic relations to be organized on the basis of equality  interdependence and mutual interests.261.	Precisely for that reason we attach exceptional importance to the recently concluded eleventh special session of the General Assembly devoted to problems of economic development. Regrettably  the special session did not adopt a decision on the launching of global negotiations owing to the absence of political will on the part of some of the most developed countries. However  we have avoided complete failure and thus have preserved hope for tomorrow.262.	In saying that  we bear in mind the fact that the consensus reached on the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade is a significant admission of the interdependence of the world and opens avenues for international cooperation.263.	We also consider the adoption of resolutions on assistance to the least developed countries to be a positive result of the special session. That constitutes a step forward by the international community in dealing with this important question. We hope that this regular session will successfully complete the unfinished work of the eleventh special session and thereby give expression to new needs and realities.264.	The overall work of the special session  both by what it has done and by what it has not done  has dramatically shown the close interconnexion of the political and economic dimensions of international relations. No one can dispute that any longer; unfortunately  not all behave in a way that confirms their acceptance of that fact. The historic merit of the nonaligned countries is that they have generated awareness of this linkage. Our next step should be directed towards overcoming the major paradox of our time: the simultaneous existence of interdependence and the division of the world economy. Only the New International Economic Order can bridge that chasm.265.	We see in its establishment a way for the developing countries to embark on the road of accelerated economic development  which is a prerequisite for the emancipation of peoples and developing countries from subordination. This is also a precondition for general stability in the world.266.	We attach great importance to human rights  which we consider a serious international issue to which our Organization should devote due attention. It seems to us that the treatment of this problem in the United Nations so far has reflected  despite certain shortcomings and digressions  a dynamic process of enrichment of the content of human rights and of the ways of protecting them.267.	This positive evolution is primarily reflected in an ever-increasing awareness that  in solving this complex question  one must proceed from the fact that people and nations cannot be free socially and politically unless they are free economically and nationally.268.	Proceeding from these principles  we attach particular importance to the realization of the rights of all nations and national minorities and ethnic  religious and other groups. In our view  the position of national minorities is not only an important internal issue for a country; it is also of vital importance for strengthening cooperation  good neighbourly relations and peace and security in various parts of the world.269.	We believe that the adoption of the draft declaration on the rights of persons belonging to national  ethnic  religious and linguistic minorities  which is before the Commission on Human Rights  would make a significant contribution to the promotion and protection of the rights of national minorities  as an important aspect of the realization of human rights in general.270.	This year marks the thirty-fifth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. Throughout this period  the United Nations has been an active participant in the positive transformation of international relations  a scene of great effort and an arena of struggle for a better and more just world.271.	We cannot  however  turn a blind eye to the fact that the United Nations has been restricted in solving crucial problems.272.	We wish the United Nations to be a forum for an enlightened exchange of ideas and for effective negotiations on the most important international issues. This makes it incumbent upon the United Nations to reflect aspirations for the democratization of international relations.273.	Let us not betray the hopes that we have aroused by our work so far. If we want a new world in which peace  security and prosperity for all will be a constant and stable condition  we must realize that this world will not come about by itself.274. Yugoslavia will continue to contribute to the realization of these noble aims. In this it will be constantly guided  as it has always been  by the principles and objectives of the policy of nonalignment."
"147",7609,"ZMB",35,1980,"ï»¿I wish to join those who spoke before me in congratulating Ambassador von Wechmar on his election to the high office of President of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. His country  the Federal Republic of Germany  and my own  Zambia  enjoy cordial bilateral relations and my delegation pledges to him our cooperation. We are convinced that he will use his diplomatic skill and acumen to steer the deliberations of this session to a successful conclusion.251.	I should like also to pay a fitting tribute to his predecessor  Ambassador Salim Ahmed Salim of the sister republic of Tanzania. A man of great eminence and integrity  he presided over the work of the thirty-fourth regular session  the two emergency sessions and one special session in the most commendable manner which was a source of pride to Africa.252.	I wish also to pay a similar tribute to our esteemed Secretary General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  for his tireless efforts for the furtherance of the objectives of the United Nations. In his report on the work of the Organization  the Secretary General has provided a frank  succinct  thought-provoking and sobering analysis of the global situation. My delegation sincerely commends him for thoroughly and objectively articulating the challenges that we shall continue to face in this decade.253.	Let me also express my delegation's congratulations to Saint Vincent and the Grenadines on its admission last week as the one hundred and fifty-fourth Member of the United Nations. This signifies a triumph for the people of that country and we are pleased about its achievement. Its admission  like that of Zimbabwe last month  brings us closer to the fulfilment of the principle of universality of the membership of the United Nations.254.	I wish on this occasion to reiterate the great pleasure and satisfaction of my delegation at the attainment of independence by Zimbabwe and its admission to the United Nations at the eleventh special session which discussed economic matters.255.	A crisis of immense proportions hovers over the world economic situation. The issues at stake impinge on the welfare of mankind as a whole because we live in a world of interdependence. The underpinnings of interdependence in our contemporary era require little elaboration  as they have been amply demonstrated recently in various United Nations reports  the report of the Brandt Commission and the report of the Commonwealth Group of Experts.256.	What the world needs is a new realism which is based on equity and justice for all. It must be recognized that it is justice  equity and interdependence which are at stake as we institute a new system of international economic relations. What is required is to change the old order. What is required is to introduce order where disorder now reigns. In the present situation of disorder in the world economy  no country is shielded and there can be no meaningful development or progress.257.	In Zambia's view  the time has come for all countries to realize the benefits which can accrue from international cooperation in this age of interdependence.258.	The battle to realize the goals of the New International Economic Order is one which the international community must not lose. Indeed  for many it is a matter of either ending poverty or facing extinction. The food shortage problem  for example  means that millions will perish if no relief is forthcoming.259.	The issues on our world economic agenda are interlinked. As we approach the United Nations conference on global negotiations for international economic co-operation for development; it is imperative that a simultaneous  coherent and integrated approach to all issues under negotiation in this universal forum be ensured. If that principle was respected  there would be no need for a diversionary debate aimed at entrenching the old order by attempts to rely on institutions which should themselves be subject to change.260.	The international community should look to the future and avoid placing unnecessary emphasis on obstacles. Lessons learned from the eleventh special session should provide bridges of hope where progress was made. It is time to consolidate  to negotiate further and to marshal all pragmatic tools which could lead to agreement. The agenda is for the survival of all mankind.261.	The consensus reached on the new International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade during the eleventh special session represents the barest minimum for the majority of developing countries. The litmus test of commitment lies in the full and effective imp' mentation of the policy measures and the attainment of the aims and objectives enshrined in the Strategy. The past two decades provide us with examples of unfulfilled commitment and aspirations.262.	Zambia's position with regard to the Third United Nations Conference; on the Law of the Sea has been made known at past sessions  including the meetings recently held at Geneva. It is our hope that all delegations will work in a cooperative and constructive spirit at the forthcoming session  with a view to reaching agreement on those vital issues which remain unresolved.263.	Zambia continues to attach great importance to the policy of nonalignment. We consider that the principles and objectives of nonalignment are as relevant as ever in the present turbulent international situation and that they represent the aspirations of the vast majority of the peoples of the world. In our view  nonalignment is the best guarantee of the independence and sovereignty of small and weak States.264.	It is against that background that Zambia views with serious concern the present situation around the Indian Ocean and in the Gulf area. We deeply deplore the increased big Power rivalry in that part of the world  which threatens the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of a number of countries.265.	In the last year  for example  we have witnessed intensified great Power rivalry  which has virtually made the Indian Ocean a zone of conflict instead of a zone of peace. Seeds of discord have been sown and the peace and security of the countries and people in the area have been greatly impaired.266.	My delegation calls upon all States  particularly the big Powers  to respect fully the aspirations of the people of the Indian Ocean region and to cooperate with the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean in its efforts to bring about the realization of the aims and objectives of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace.267.	We call for an urgent resolution of the crisis in Afghanistan. In that regard  it is imperative that all foreign troops be withdrawn and that the principles of non-intervention and non-interference in the internal affairs of States be scrupulously respected by all foreign Powers. Indeed  the situation in Afghanistan should not be used by one or the other great Power to increase its military presence on the pretext of a perceived threat to its so-called strategic interests in the area. No foreign interests can be more important than those of the people in the area directly concerned.268.	On Korea  my delegation wishes to reiterate its view that peace and stability will continue to elude us if reunification is not achieved. Furthermore  it is my delegation's view that reunification efforts have been greatly hampered by the presence of foreign troops in South Korea. We therefore call for the withdrawal of foreign troops from South Korea in order that the chances for reunification may be enhanced.269.	Similarly  with regard to the situation in Kampuchea  Zambia hopes that an amicable political solution can be found soon. Such a solution must  above all  reflect the true wishes and aspirations of the people concerned  who have suffered far too long.270.	Regarding Cyprus  my delegation will continue to follow closely the intercommunal talks being held under the aegis of the United Nations Secretary General. We hope genuine progress will be registered during those talks  with a view to finding a just and durable solution which  above all  will guarantee the independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and nonalignment of Cyprus.271.	With regard to Western Sahara  we in Zambia hope that an early solution will be found. I wish therefore once again to call upon Morocco to respect fully the inalienable rights of the people of Western Sahara and to allow them freely to determine their own destiny. Zambia strongly supports the POLISARIO Front and we have also recognized the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic.272.	Morocco's intransigence over Western Sahara is reminiscent of the intransigence of Guatemala over Belize. I wish similarly to express Zambia's full support for the Government and people of Belize in their efforts to secure their independence and to safeguard their sovereignty and territorial integrity. My delegation calls upon Guatemala to cooperate in the long drawn-out negotiations on the question of Belize  in the spirit of the relevant United Nations resolutions.273.	One of the perennial citadels of conflict in our time is the Middle East. The seventh emergency special session  on Palestine  which was held from 22 to 29 July this year  reiterated the view that Israel's policies and practices constitute the major obstacle to durable peace and security in the Middle East. Israeli intransigence serves only to hinder progress towards the ideals of peace and security in the region. That behaviour is reflected in the relentless Israeli campaign of consolidating its colonization of the occupied Arab territories through the establishment of Jewish settlements.274.	Israel has further defied the international community's counsel not to change the religious status of Jerusalem and it has chosen to declare the city of Jerusalem its capital  an act intended to compromise the traditional status of Jerusalem as the seat of world Christianity  Judaism and Islam. In that regard  my delegation condemns the Israeli authorities for their action to change the status of Jerusalem and calls upon the General Assembly at its current session to declare such action null and void.275.	Zambia is also concerned about Israel's persistent military activities directed against Lebanon. Such military forays have been pursued to the extent of embroiling UNI FIL  the personnel of which have  in the process  been murdered in cold blood. We condemn that military adventurism of Israel and call upon Israel to heed the warning that such activities make the prospects for peace and security in the Middle East all the more remote.276.	My delegation is gravely concerned about Israel's adamant opposition to the participation of the PLO in the Middle East negotiations. There can be no settlement of the question of Palestine without the participation of the PLO on a basis of equality.277.	The Middle East problem in all its aspects can be resolved only if the question of Palestine is addressed realistically. Israel must reconcile itself to the imperative need to restore the inalienable rights of the Palestinians to self-determination  including the right to a national homeland. In addition  Israel must withdraw from all occupied Arab territories.278.	I turn now to the situation in southern Africa. On 18 April 1980 the gallant people of Zimbabwe achieved their independence. That victory  like the independence of Mozambique and Angola  contributed to the extension of the frontiers of peace and security in the region.279.	As we express our joy at the extension of the frontiers of peace in southern Africa as a result of Zimbabwe's achievement of genuine independence  Zambia is only too aware of the challenge that South Africa's illegal occupation of Namibia poses to the United Nations system. The international community can ill afford to be oblivious to the underlying reasons why South Africa  through its delaying tactics  continues to defy the United Nations with impunity over the question of Namibia. My delegation is disturbed by South Africa's intransigence because it goes beyond South Africa's own capacity. South Africa gets its inspiration and resilience to do whatever it deems fit in Namibia precisely because of the sustained generous support it receives from certain Western Powers. These Powers  like South Africa  are now busy depleting the abundant natural resources of Namibia while the illegal occupation holds.280.	There is in Namibia today a build-up of South African military forces  whose objective is further to suppress the people's will in their demands for their inalienable right to independence. As a result  there have been mass arrests  detention  torture  imprisonment and murder of innocent Namibians.281.	It is regrettable that the situation in Namibia has taken a turn for the worse. The illegal South African regime has intensified its manoeuvres aimed at consolidating a puppet regime in Namibia. The so-called Legislative Assembly and Council of Ministers have been established at the same time as negotiations for the establishment of a popular government through universally recognized elections have been going on.282.	The build-up of arms of destruction and the increased militarization of Namibia by the South African authorities with the support of certain Western countries has had very adverse consequences on peace and stability in the region of southern Africa. South Africa has stepped up its unprovoked acts of aggression against the independent African States of Angola and Zambia. Our people continue to be killed and maimed and their property continues to be wantonly destroyed by South Africa  all because of their support for the cause of liberating Namibia  to which the United Nations is committed. The international community should take seriously the persistent South African acts of aggression against Zambia and Angola.283.	The South African acts of aggression are part of an overall South African strategy to undermine the support of the frontline States for SWAPO  which is fighting to free Namibia from the clutches of the Pretoria regime. This same strategy is being pursued by South Africa to remove international demands on the United Nations. The people of Namibia cannot be expected to surrender their birth right. The international community has a duty to support their legitimate struggle. Namibia is indeed a unique case in the decolonization process in that the United Nations has assumed direct responsibility for that Territory. South Africa's continued occupation is therefore a challenge to us all.284.	It is a matter of public record that SWAPO has made all the necessary concessions in the protracted negotiations to give effect to Security Council resolutions 385 (1976) and 435 (1978). That UNTAG has not yet moved into Namibia and that the implementation process of the United Nations plan on Namibia has not yet begun is directly due to the negative attitude of South Africa. The South African regime continues to stall in this process. Time and again it has come up with flimsy pretexts to prevent the implementation of this plan. The tactics of South Africa have included unwarranted attacks on the United Nations itself.285.	South Africa must be forced to stop engaging in deceitful manoeuvres and duplicity over Namibia. How can we  for example  reconcile the installations of the Turnhalle quislings with the attempts to implement the United Nations plan under Security Council resolution 435 (1978)?286.	We in Zambia will continue to cooperate with the secretary General in his efforts to implement the United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia within the framework of resolution 435 (1978). The secretary General  whose integrity and impartiality cannot be questioned  has done his utmost to carry out the mandate entrusted to him by the Security Council. For the plan to succeed and for the independence of Namibia to be achieved on this basis  it is quite evident that more pressure should be brought to bear on South Africa to ensure its cooperation.287.	The five Western Powers which initiated the plan for the settlement of the Namibian question and which enjoy special relations with racist South Africa must acknowledge the challenge posed by South Africa's intransigence and demonstrate a willingness to use all their influence to put pressure on South Africa to cooperate. We are not convinced that they have used every available leverage on South Africa.288.	Failure to implement the United Nations plan on Namibia will obviously leave the people of the Territory with no other choice but to intensify their armed struggle. In any event  such a failure will also make it inevitable for States Members of the United Nations to press ahead with their legitimate demand for enforcement action against South Africa under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations. Thus the stage will have been set for confrontation and further loss of life in Namibia at a time when we should be emulating the happy solution to the problem of Zimbabwe.289.	The situation in Namibia is but an extension of the apartheid system in South Africa itself. The Pretoria regime is constantly consolidating its military position in order to sustain its anachronistic domestic policy of apartheid. All calls by the international community on South Africa to desist from the policy of apartheid have continuously been scorned.290.	It is in South Africa's interest to know that the winds of freedom will continue to gather force in South Africa itself until the complete eradication of the apartheid system. Events from Sharpeville in 1960 to Soweto in 1976 and beyond clearly demonstrate that the struggle in South Africa has become irreversible.291.	The struggle continues to gain momentum. This intensification of the struggle has taken the form of public strikes by workers and school boycotts by students  and there have been other manifestations. The recent blowing up of the oil plants of the South African Oil  Coal and Gas Corporation  Ltd. (SASOL) serves to confirm the nature of the struggle of the oppressed people of South Africa and the degree it has reached.292.	The abolition of so-called petty apartheid is not the answer  nor can the attempts of the South African regime to win over the so-called Coloured community and isolate the blacks succeed. There is urgent need for meaningful change in South Africa. Change in South Africa must involve the complete eradication of apartheid. It is in the interest of all South African whites to create conditions conducive to racial harmony.293.	The oppressed people of South Africa  like those of Namibia  are fighting against a system of Government which institutionalizes racism. They are fighting to bring about a system of Government which will work for the betterment of all people irrespective of their colour and enable all people to contribute to the development of their country in all spheres of human activity.294.	Whereas the international community has been urging South Africa to abandon the policy of apartheid t h rough peaceful means  the Pretoria regime has always chosen to resort to war. This has been intensified in recent years by its acquisition of nuclear capability  which South Africa is using in the manufacture of nuclear weapons with the complicity of certain Western countries. Recent South African military attacks against the frontline States of Zambia and Angola attest to South Africa's insatiable appetite for war in the area. This state of affairs must be halted. The international community must put an end to it.295.	It is against that background that Zambia appeals to Western Powers to withdraw the support which they give to the racist South African regime so that South Africa can come to grips with the realities and accept the need to allow the people of South Africa the right to participate on an equal footing in the making of decisions that affect their everyday life. We call upon the Security Council to move forward by closing all existing loopholes in the mandatory arms embargo against South Africa and making it more comprehensive. We appeal to all States strictly to abide by the embargo and thereby desist from contributing to South Africa's military arsenal.296.	There are many other pressing international problems which  for the sake of brevity  I have not delved into. The arms race continues to escalate at an alarming rate and consumes more than $500 billion per annum. The plight of refugees has similarly reached alarming and disconcerting proportions  as millions of innocent men  women and children continue to flee their homes and countries only to languish in harsh economic and social conditions. Indeed  millions of the world's people still live in conditions of abject poverty  afflicted by hunger  ignorance and disease. The human rights situation in the world remains generally bleak.297.	Ours is therefore still very much a miserable and perilous world. There are grave threats to international peace and security. The ideal world envisaged in the Charter of the United Nations remains far off. We have a long way to go  and the problems that confront us are monumental.298.	This year we are marking the thirty-fifth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. This must necessarily be an occasion for renewed commitment by us all to the ideals of the United Nations. In Zambia's view  no other forum is better suited than the United Nations to tackle the many and complex problems that continue to trouble international relations. No other forum is better suited than the United Nations to fulfil the hopes and aspirations of the millions of the world's citizenry.299.	I wish therefore in conclusion to reaffirm Zambia's abiding faith in the United Nations as an indispensable instrument for realizing the noble principles and objectives enshrined in the Charter. It is Zambia's hope that all States will in this decade of the 1980s generate the necessary political will to strengthen and support the United Nations in its commitment to freedom  justice  peace and economic and social development for all countries and peoples."
"148",7641,"ZWE",35,1980,"ï»¿On behalf of the President of the Republic of Zimbabwe  His Excellency Comrade Canaan Banana  the Prime Minister  the Honourable Comrade Robert Mugabe and the people of Zimbabwe  I salute all here and wish to convey to all the greetings and good wishes of the people of Zimbabwe. I am grateful for this opportunity to address this great Assembly of the world. I am overwhelmed by the occasion and the realization that I take my place today in this thirty-fifth regular session of the General Assembly for the first time as leader of a delegation from the duly constituted sovereign Government of Zimbabwe.159.	On behalf of my country and delegation and on my own behalf  I wish to congratulate Ambassador von Wechmar and his country upon his election to the very distinguished office of President of this body. I have no doubt in my mind that he will discharge his duties diligently and with the efficiency that has characterized his official performances and has led this entire body and his sponsors to acclaim him their choice as President of the General Assembly at its thirty-fifth session.160.	My country and I share his strong beliefs as indicated in his opening speech regarding his positive bias for equality of mankind and peaceful coexistence among and between nations and his faith in the United Nations ability and potential to find solutions to problems that are brought before it. I wish him personally and the federal Republic of Germany a successful term of office in the presidency of the thirty-fifth session.161.	I take this opportunity  too  to express my country's and my own appreciation and gratitude to my brother  colleague and personal friend  the Honourable Ndugu Salim Ahmed Salim of the United Republic of Tanzania  for the very high standard he has set for the office of President of the General Assembly during his term of office. The fair but firm manner  relentless initiative and zeal to achieve global equality  peace and tranquillity which characterized his term of office have made for his country and for the United Nationsâ numerous friends and given hope to oppressed peoples  the starving nations and those in ill health that one day solutions to their problems will be found. Ndugu Salim Ahmed Salim  my country is proud of your leadership. The front-line States of southern Africa are proud of your leadership. The O AU is proud of your leadership. The non-aligned nations were impressed by your leadership  as was the United Nations. This has already been expressed by many a representative.162.	My delegation and I extend our sincere compliments  respect and appreciation to the Secretary-General of the United Nations for his distinguished service to mankind and for his total impartiality in the discharge of his duties. I should like to thank the Secretary-General for sparing his highly demanded time to attend the Zimbabwe independence celebrations in my country in April of this year  during which time he was familiarized with our reconstruction and resettlement priorities.163.	I should like to welcome and congratulate our brother State  the Islands of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  through its Prime Minister  the Honourable Mr. Cato  upon its momentous admission to the United Nations on 16 September. We congratulate it further on the attainment of its independence and wish it well in the pursuance of its State and international obligations. In welcoming our brothers from Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  I should like to reiterate  on behalf of my country which also is a new member of this body  that we have tremendous respect for the Members of the United Nations. We adhere to the principles and objectives of the Charter of the United Nations  and we shall try to the best of our ability to work for the realization of those objectives.164.	As everyone is aware  our struggle for liberation was a long and costly one. During the long years of armed confrontation  thousands of lives were lost. Our people in the rural areas suffered untold hardships. Many were uprooted from their homes  and their normal life was disrupted. About a quarter of a million Zimbabweans left the country and created refugee situations in neighbouring countries  notably Botswana  Mozambique and Zambia. Over half a million people were herded by enemy forces into so-called ""protected villages"" similar to the ""hamlets"" of the Vietnamese war. These protected villages became riddled with starvation and disease. Many more people took refuge in our cities and towns  where they created shanty conditions. The economy of the country  which was placed on a war footing by the illegal regime which spent 1.3 million Zimbabwe dollars per day on the war  was disrupted. In addition  our economy was geared to serving the needs of the white minority and foreign interests  to the virtual exclusion of the African majority. This poses enormous problems of reconstruction on  rehabilitation  resettlement  economic restructuring and equitable redistribution of our national wealth.165.	In the process of reconstruction  resettlement and economic restructuring  we are determined to correct this colonial and war legacy. We have advanced our intention to build a non-racial society and we intend to offer economic opportunities to all Zimbabweans on the basis of equality. My Prime Minister has stated on several occasions that we are resolved to build an egalitarian and socialist society in Zimbabwe  taking into consideration the objective economic conditions of a capitalist economy that has existed for 90 years during the colonial era.166.	With the support of the nations represented in this Assembly  we are determined to succeed in our reconstruction and resettlement efforts. We seek assistance from those who have helped us in the past. We seek assistance from those who might have doubted our true intentions and who by now-must surely be in no doubt that the ZANU"" Government wants to build a non-racial society based on democratic principles  the rule of law and the will of the majority. I am sure many Member States have already read the report of the Secretary-General of the United Nations  pursuant to Security Council resolution 460 (1979)  which highlights some of my country's reconstruction and resettlement priorities. I should like to thank Mr. Kurt Waldheim  on behalf of my Government and the people of Zimbabwe  for so ably outlining our reconstruction problems in search of financial and material assistance.167.	I feel honoured in addressing this Assembly because it has been with the moral  political  diplomatic and material support of the members of this great body that we have attained our independence. They have supported a noble and mighty cause  a cause of greatness  and that support has enabled us to end 15 years of unilateral declaration of independence and 90 years of foreign domination  racism and economic exploitation. It is only fitting  therefore  that I pay a tribute to at least some of the nations or regions which have participated in our noble cause.168.	First of all  there is our special relationship with the United Kingdom. As the former colonial Power  Britain has a relationship with us which was originally imposed on us but which  happily  has become one of mutual benefit. The United Kingdom has now become the single largest donor to our country  although  as my Prime Minister has pointed out several times  the magnitude of that aid falls far short of what we had expected. We have not forgotten that it was through the good offices of the present British Government that the Lancaster House agreement was cached  culminating in our electoral victory and independence.169.	Britain has sponsored our country's association with the European Economic Community [EEC]  and that gesture is greatly appreciated. While Zimbabwe values the bilateral relations which exist and which will be developed  it is very much aware of the benefits to be gained from association with the EEC. It is hoped that relations between the African  Caribbean and Pacific Group and the EEC will progress to the stage where we can participate as equal partners  not only as a source of raw materials and recipients of aid.170. Zimbabwe  perhaps by accident father than by design  has become a substantial manufacturer of primary and intermediate goods  and even of some finished products. Because of the diversity of its agricultural and mineral products  Zimbabwe aspires to becomeâand has a good chance of becomingâalso a manufacturer of some significance of finished articles. We have no desire to remain a mere exporter of primary products but are anxious to cooperate with Europe and share some of our abundant resources in return for capital goods and technology because that would enable us to process our goods into finished products. We have an industrial infrastructure sufficient to warrant international trade and international markets if our economy is to improve and keep pace with population and society pressures. We believe the EEC is aware of this desire on the part of Zimbabwe and of other developing nations.171.	The present United States Administration has played no mean part in contributing to the birth of Zimbabwe through its diplomatic endeavours  and I wish to thank it most sincerely  as well as the black and progressive white solidarity groups. While we sincerely thank the United States Government for its financial contributions to the development and reconstruction of our country since independence  we realize that the amount of aid which has been committed is much less than we had been led to expect once a solution to our liberation struggle had been found. We are aware that there is an economic recession in the United States of America  but we are also aware that some of the reluctance to help us emanates from some misinformed and pessimistic forces which are influential in the legislative process of this country; It is our intention to throw more light on our Government's policies for the benefit of such forces.172.	I am aware of Canada's sound reputation in Africa  where it is admired for its ""no strings attached"" aid to the continent  and my Government looks forward to a closer and even more fruitful relationship with Canada.173.	We wish to thank the working class in particular and the people in general of the Federal Republic of Germany and other Western European nations for their overall material  political  moral and diplomatic support through their humanitarian and solidarity groups and certain ideologically compatible organizations. We further wish to thank all relevant non-governmental organizations and religious bodies in the Federal Republic of Germany and other Western European nations for helping us convince their respective Governments of the correctness of the cause of our liberation struggle in Zimbabwe. We are pleased to note that after our independence the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany became one of the first countries to offer financial assistance through soft loans totalling $17 million. Since the Federal Republic of Germany is known to be a country that follows up its promises with concrete action  we look forward to a warm and lasting relationship. We are aware of Germany's reputation for technical achievement and hope that we can benefit from a transfer of technology from it. 174. We wish to extend our deepest thanks and gratitude to the Governments and peoples of socialist countries for their unwavering support of the just cause of the people of Zimbabwe during the liberation struggle. That support was translated into all forms  but particularly into material and technological forms. We shall maintain and strengthen our links with these our friends in need and in deed. Among the socialist countries some deserve special mention  in particular the People's Republic of China  the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  Yugoslavia and Romania. Our ideological compatibility with those nations is a legacy of socialism which binds us together in a one-class brotherhood and must be jealously protected  enhanced and maintained.175.	Our long association with the Scandinavian countries is well known  and so is the degree of their invaluable support to our cause during the struggle. We wish to thank the Scandinavian Governments and peoples of Sweden  Denmark and Norway for their genuine and sincere support. We hope to continue these ties to the mutual benefit of ourselves and the countries involved.176.	With regard to American States  my people are truly aware of the moral support of those progressive groups in Central and South America which have contributed unflinchingly to the liberation struggle of Zimbabwe. Their brotherly endeavours on our behalf are even more appreciated when we realize that they have fought in the past and even today are themselves fighting a number of insidious and oppressive regimes in their own region. My Government has friendly contacts with a number of legitimate Governments in the area: namely Guyana  Nicaragua  Brazil  Jamaica  Cuba and Grenada among others. Let it be noted that we will not tolerate contact with reactionary and oppressive regimes in the continent. With poverty  racial prejudice and social and economic injustice endemic in those areas  my country will continue to identify with the oppressed through international bodies and diplomatic-channels until they are truly liberated.177.	It is not easy to express the gratitude  appreciation and thanks of my Government and our people to the OAU  the Co-ordinating Committee for Liberation Movements in Africa of the OAU and the front-line States. Their consistency and the enormousness of the sacrifices which they and their people made in so many domains on our behalf defy words. There is no doubt that the victory of the people of Zimbabwe against colonialism  oppression  racism and exploitation of man by man is also the victory of Africa against the same forces. We salute the friendship and support that we received from the front-line States of Angola  Botswana  Mozambique  Tanzania and Zambia as well as from the Governments of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and socialist Ethiopia. Those Slates gave us the most valuable assistance during our liberation struggle and continue to afford us assistance as we embark on a new era as an independent and sovereign State. As the Assembly will be aware  Zimbabwe was admitted as the newest Member of the OAU  and I am glad to note that the closest consultation and co-operation exist between the United Nations and the OAU. That happy state of affairs will undoubtedly be of the greatest benefit to Africa and the world. Few aspects of political life or of economic and technological development can be confined to one part of the world. Therefore  it is to be hoped that the United Nations and the specialized agencies will continue to work together in all fields where there is a common interest.178.	The OAU is the corner-stone of Zimbabwe's activities on the continent of Africa. Within the framework of the OAU we are determined to develop the best of relations with those of our neighbours who encounter the same conditions and problems as we do and who share a similar outlook on developments affecting our region.179.	It is my Government's desire to bring about the closest co-operation with fellow front-line States and with others in the region  like Lesotho  Swaziland and Malawi  in order to achieve rapid national and regional development. I state that belief in the importance of regional co-operation with all due deference  because it has been reached over the relatively short period since we gained our independence and it has been confirmed by other leaders of countries close to us who are more experienced than we are. Until quite recently  most countries in the southern part of Africa have been developing independently of each other. In consequence  communications and trade have been developing along separate lines; the fight against poverty  famine and disease has also been developing along separate lines  without much regard for the interests of other countries that might be similarly affected. There has  of course  been little alternative. Zimbabwe was politically and economically isolated until we became independent  and there are still countries which are physically separated from each other because they are embedded in apartheid South Africa. Nevertheless  it is imperative that we should pool our resources and start to think about working through common institutions. In this direction  my country is encouraged by the Southern Africa Development Co-ordination Conference  which held a summit conference at Lusaka last April and a ministerial meeting in Zimbabwe at the beginning of September. In that respect  some very concrete results are expected in the way of regional development 180.	I do not have to remind the Assembly that  through initiatives such as that  Zimbabwe's dependence on ports in and supply routes through South Africa can in the long run be reduced. At the moment  however  although my Government has severed diplomatic relations with South Africa. Zimbabwe's dependence on those routes is absolute  in spite of new routes that are becoming available to the Indian Ocean ports in Mozambique. The altitude of Zimbabwe is that we align ourselves whole-heartedly with those who wish to see an end to the oppressive system of apartheid that has been erected in South Africa. We shall support those forces which have been formed for the purpose of combining the efforts of those who are working to promote change in South Africa. We believe it is our revolutionary duty to render unflinching support to our oppressed class brothers and sisters in South Africa.181.	We shall therefore fight vigorously within the framework of the OAU to end apartheid; we pledge our assistance to the legitimate liberation movements of South Africa  the African National Congress and the Pan Africanist Congress  in their just struggle to end apartheid and create a non-racial society in that troubled country. Apartheid in South Africa is a threat to the stability of the southern Africa region  as well as to the stability of all Africa. It is  indeed  a threat to world peace. There can never be compromise between apartheid and the aspirations of the oppressed peoples of South Africa and independent Africa  just as there cannot be true and satisfying independence for Zimbabwe until there is real independence for the oppressed peoples of South Africa. Confrontation of unimaginable magnitude is in store for the minority racist whites in South Africa who want to preserve the evil social system in that country. We believe the light against apartheid is just  and that victory over apartheid is certain  just as it was in Mozambique  Angola and Zimbabwe  and therefore the struggle must continue until all Africa is liberated.182.	On the Namibian question. Zimbabwe firmly supports the stand of the United Nations on Namibia and commends the wise and determined efforts of the Secretary-General to bring that country to independence. Once again  we deplore the delaying tactics of the South African regime on that issue. We salute the efforts of SWAPO  the authentic representative of the Namibian people  to liberate Namibia and we pledge our militant solidarity with the people of Namibia. In the same spirit of co-operation with the United Nations  Zimbabwe is ready and willing to do everything possible to facilitate the application of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) to settle the Namibian conflict.183.	Although the struggles for independence are more evident in South Africa and Namibia  there are other areas on the continent where the people are oppressed and are denied the most fundamental of human rights. My Government supports the principle of self-determination and applies that support in every case where it is apparent that u people has been placed under alien domination. For that reason  we recognize the justice of the struggle by the people of the Democratic Sahraoui Arab Republic under their authentic and revolutionary leadership  the POLISARIO Front; similarly  we support the PLO in its efforts to gain recognition for the right of the Palestinians to an independent existence. We believe that  in the same way that Israel has fought for its existence as a nation  Israel should itself recognize the rights of others. We condemn unreservedly the transfer of the capital of Israel to the ancient city of Jerusalem.184.	We wish to express our solidarity with the people of East Timor and their liberation forces of the FRETILIN independence movement which are waging a just struggle for self-determination. Similarly  we wish the people of Latin America well  in their efforts at securing truly popular governments  social and economic independence and advancement  as they have not failed to support us in our hour of need  they should know that our support is always there. I am proud to inform the Assembly that a number of liberation movements from Central and South America were represented at our independence celebrations and that the ties of solidarity continue to develop.185.	We need not over-emphasize the fact that the existence of oppressive systems is a constant threat to international peace and security. We are therefore resolved that freedom and social and economic progress should come to all peoples and countries. The denial of this freedom  andPrevalence of racial discrimination and apartheid are the seeds from which grow the tension  conflicts  instability that are threatening our international community today.186.	Regarding super-Power rivalry  so far as Zimbabwe is concerned  we  in common with a large number of other countries  strongly oppose any foreign interference by any country in the affairs of another as a violation of our Charter. We are convinced that it is not by military alliances  pacts and the stockpiling of armaments that world peace and security can be attained. We are in no camp and in no military alliance and we will strive to uphold our honourable principles of goodwill  co-operation  mutual respect and the betterment of all people. We are greatly concerned by the growing number of refugees in the world  particularly when they leave their own countries because of foreign domination and oppression.187.	Naturally  we welcome the breakthrough on the law of the sea recently reported by the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea and we hope that the Convention will permit harmonious relationships among and between nations that exploit the deep sea-bed. Naturally  we also support the concept of disarmament by the two super-Powers and their associates. We urge those nations that are spending billions of dollars on developing and merchandising weapons of mass destruction to review their policies and change them.188.	It is our strong belief that the billions of dollars spent on offensive weapons should be diverted to economic development projectsâwhich have a direct bearing on the improvement of the quality of human lifeârather than devoted to preparing for the destruction of human life.189.	The Government of Zimbabwe is totally opposed to those who want to spread the danger of confrontation in a nuclear war to the Indian Ocean by establishing bases and introducing vessels carrying nuclear weapons into the area. We believe the Indian Ocean should be left as a nuclear-free zone and a zone of peace.190.	I cannot conclude my speech without congratulating this great Assembly for its insight and commitment to the establishment of a New International Economic Order that led to the holding of the eleventh special session  devoted to economic issues  which has just ended. It would definitely be a misapprehension for any country to think that it can survive in isolation  no matter how privileged it is economically. As a country returning from economic isolation  we cannot over-emphasize this point.191.	The grim truth of today's economy is that if one part of the world goes down economically  it drags others with it. Thus  it is not a question of the prosperous helping those who are less or not prosperous  merely out of the generosity of their hearts. It is evidence of enlightened self-interest to realize that if some parts of the world suffer economically  those areas will have an adverse effect on the whole international economy  dragging even the prosperous nations with them.192.	In conclusion  permit me to repeat that we are committed to the noble principles and purposes of this body and that we will be guided by those principles and purposes in all our deliberations. We look forward to enthusiastic participation in the activities of the United Nations and its agencies."
