"1",30,"AFG",55,2000,"On my way to theAssembly Hall  I was informed by the Supreme StateCouncil of the Islamic State of Afghanistan that in aself-evident act of aggression hundreds of Pakistanimilitary personnel — army  plain-clothes personnel andarmed Taliban — are reported to have been positionedin the Shah Salim pass dividing the Pakistan bordertown of Chitral from north-eastern Afghanistan  boundfor an attack on Badakhshan province.On behalf of my delegation  I take thisopportunity to congratulate you  Sir  on yourassumption of the major task of presiding over theimportant millennium session of the General Assembly.I would also like to congratulate the Minister forForeign Affairs of Namibia  Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  onhis excellent leadership of the fifty-fourth session ofthe General Assembly  which set the stage for theMillennium Summit.Three years ago  I stood before the Assembly andstated from this very rostrum that  as the crisis inAfghanistan continued to unfold  we had to ask  andanswer  important questions. At the time  I spoke of thedark and ominous movement known as the Taliban which  backed by cross-border troops  had invadedAfghanistan. This year  at its millennium session  theGeneral Assembly indeed has to answer majorquestions. One among many is the silence the worldhas chosen to keep in dealing with the Taliban and theirPakistani supporters. With the spread of Talibanism which has led to the abject misery of the Afghannation  massive insurgency and turmoil in the regionand beyond  is it not high time that the internationalcommunity put a stop to the Pakistani-operated Talibanprocessing machine? Certainly  mere rhetoric andinadequate reactions are not enough. It is with thisview that I should like to focus my statement entirelyon the situation in Afghanistan and its devastatingregional and international implications  within thegiven time limit.4A question arises: what has been the result of theTalibanization of the occupied parts of Afghanistan? Inan age of information and globalization  it has been areign of terror imposed by a religious police  abuse inthe name of religion  the elimination of all freedomsand civil liberties  massive violations of human rights degrading and tormenting treatment of men andwomen  trafficking of women and girls  the forcedseparation of women from their menfolk  the randomand deliberate round-up of individuals based on theirethnic and religious origins  the practice of scorchedearth policy  the torching and total obliteration offarmlands  orchards and other means of livelihood  thecontamination of water resources  the forcible dispatchof children and adults to the battlefields  the removal ofall but rudimentary religious education — for malestudents only — with the closure of all schools forfemales  the deliberate denial of access to humanitarianaid  the intensification of battles  an exacerbation of thesituation  widespread terrorism and the destruction ofthe historical heritage and artefacts of Afghanistan inorder to alienate the Afghan nation from its ancestryand historical identity.The objective of the Pakistani militaryintelligence establishment  known as Inter-ServicesIntelligence (ISI)  through the imposition of the socalled Islamic Emirate of the Taliban  has been tocreate instability in Central and South Asia by meansof terrorism. This “Islamic Emirate” has institutedMullah Omar  the militia's leader  as the undisputedAmir-ul-Mo'mineen  meaning “Commander of thefaithful” not only in Afghanistan  but in theorythroughout the Muslim world.The process the Pakistani military intelligencehas chosen for the realization of its objective is totransform the Afghan nation into an exhausted devastated  illiterate  ignorant and destitute nationstruggling hard for mere survival. Pakistan wants toturn Afghanistan into its false front to mask illicitactivities of narcotics trafficking  terrorism and othercrimes  as well as religious extremism  by establishingcentres and bases for such activities. Attempting to actas the champion of the Muslim world  Pakistancontinues to carry out these activities under the nameof Islam. It is therefore not a matter of astonishmentthat such activities have led to the defamation of boththe noble religion of Islam and the image of Muslimsthroughout the world.In short  the Afghan nation has become the directvictim of the diabolic dreams of the Pakistanimilitary's hegemonic interests in the region. Thesediabolic dreams are pursued by the Pakistani militaryintelligence  ISI  an evil and extremist institution while the implied risk and perilous consequences forthe very survival of Pakistan as a State in the future areoverlooked.As the world is gradually awakening to thecreeping Taliban threat  it is a matter of dismay thatsome “civilized” nations  on certain occasions  havepreferred to deal with the reclusive and defiant Taliban an entity which has failed to meet the minimumstandard of being considered civilized  while havingchampioned terrorism  human rights violations andcrimes against humanity. It is no surprise that onlyPakistan's military junta has continuously given its fullblessing to the movement.At least until early May of this year  the officialposition of Pakistan  from what its diplomats andofficials strangely claimed  was that it maintainedcontacts with both parties to the conflict. However Pakistan's News Network International (NNI) newsagency reported on 25 May 2000 that General PervezMusharraf claimed that Pakistan's pro-Taliban policywas “in accordance with Pakistan's national interest.”Advocating that Pashtoons should be on the side ofPakistan  the General was quoted as saying  “We have anational security interest  both demographic andgeographic.” He further stated that in the realization ofthis security interest  “Pashtoons should be on our sideand they”  meaning Pashtoons  “are represented byTaliban.”The world must know that in a flagrant violationof recognized international norms and principles and inclear contempt of the United Nations Charter  the rulerof the Pakistani military junta  under the outrageouspretext of national security interest  has claimed theright to impose a certain ethnic group through theinvocation of an ethnically provocative mandate at thecost of the sovereignty and political independence ofAfghanistan  a Member of the United Nations and prior to that  of the League of Nations  long beforePakistan was even born.It is important to remember that terrorist trainingcamps operating from the Taliban-held territories ofAfghanistan  including those established by theinfamous Osama bin Laden  whose dismantling has5been repeatedly called for by the United Nations andthe entire international community  have beenestablished by Pakistan's military intelligence throughthe Taliban mercenaries and other extremist networks.They continue to utilize these territories as a ground fortraining  sheltering  planning and dispatching elementsseeking to commit hostile acts against countries of theregion and beyond. This is done under the guise ofIslam  but  in fact  it is mainly in pursuit of Pakistanihegemonistic objectives directed towards Afghanistanand the Central Asian Republics. Recent events andactivities by extremist groups in Kyrgyzstan andUzbekistan are manifest examples of the spillover ofthe Pakistan/Taliban-supported agenda in the region.The Islamic State of Afghanistan believes it ishigh time that the Security Council  in accordance withrelevant resolutions  undertook appropriateenforcement measures against Pakistan  which is theprime source of sponsorship of these activities.The Security Council  in its unanimously adoptedresolution 1267 of 15 October 1999  explicitlydemanded that the Taliban mercenaries refrain fromsheltering  supporting and training terrorists andplanning terrorist acts from Afghan soil against othercountries and that it extradite to the requesting Statesthose indicted for committing international acts ofterrorism.The recent upsurge of terrorist activities inCentral Asian countries and beyond  emanating fromthe Taliban-occupied parts of Afghanistan  requiresdrastic measures by the Security Council against themilitia and its Pakistani supporters. The considerationof the imposition of further targeted sanctions and theexpansion of the scope of resolution 1267 (1999) which must include the end of terrorist activities in allforms and manifestations in the Taliban-held parts ofAfghanistan  could adequately  among other things serve the cause of peace and security in the region.Here I would like to welcome the proposal by theRepublic of Uzbekistan for convening an internationalconference  at the earliest possible time  to debate theevil phenomenon of terrorism.In spite of the current devastating drought inAfghanistan — the most severe in 30 years —Afghanistan remains the leading producer of narcotics.The production of illicit drugs  and their trafficking bythe Taliban and the politico-military mafia of Pakistan account for considerable revenue  which is used tofinance the prolonged war in Afghanistan. This leads toconsiderable transnational organized crime  whileadding to the number of addicts  both at home andabroad.Among the many deliberate violations andinstances of absolute disregard for internationalhumanitarian law and the numerous crimes againsthumanity committed by the Taliban and their outsidesupporters in the year 2000  one could mention thefollowing cases: the cold-blooded killing on 11 May of198 young Uzbek and Hazara men imprisoned ashostages in Taliban jails; the brutal killing on 5 Augustof the United Nations mine-clearance employeesaffiliated with the Organization for Mine Clearance andAfghan Rehabilitation; the deliberate denial of accessto humanitarian aid that  according to the EuropeanUnion  in the light of the devastating droughtconstituted a breach of international humanitarian law;the forced blood-drawing and organ removal ofinnocent civilians along the Tagab-Nijrab route inAugust; the forced deportation of the civilianpopulations of the city of Aibak on 31 July 2000; theclosing down in August  as part of the ongoing fouryear campaign by the Taliban to keep women fromworking  of all bakeries run by the United NationsWorld Food Programme in which widows were paid tomake bread that was then sold at a subsidized price toother widows  who number at least 25 000 in Kabulalone; the indiscriminate aerial bombardment ofcivilian neighbourhoods at Taloqan on 15 August; andthe forcible displacement of hundreds of thousands ofpeople throughout the north due to renewed Talibanmilitary onslaughts.We believe that the commission of those heinouscrimes by the Taliban militia was largely attributable tothe lack of adequate response by the Security Counciland the international community to bring to justice theperpetrators and others involved in incidents atBamyan in 1997  at Mazar-e-Sharif and Bamyan in1998  in the north of Kabul in 1999  and in the killingsof Iranian diplomats  a journalist and the militaryadviser to the United Nations Special Mission toAfghanistan (UNSMA) in 1998.It is significant to note that the Taliban continueto deprive women of their fundamental rights including the right to education  which affects over100 000 female students in Kabul alone. Women arestill barred from employment by the Taliban. While thepredictable results will speak for themselves  present6and future female generations of Afghanistan will beilliterate. The cultural and social impact of thatcriminal act on the country's future generations will beenormous.Pakistani military intervention in Afghanistan is afact well known to the international community. Thehundreds of Pakistani prisoners captured while fightingalongside the Taliban and now in the custody of theGovernment; the mortal remains of hundreds ofPakistanis in the battlefields and the documents andidentification cards obtained from their pockets; theintercepted radio transmissions; and the massivelogistical support and the overt supply of largequantities of military hardware and ammunition  allprove the direct involvement of Pakistani armypersonnel in Afghanistan. In fact  Brigadier GeneralRustam of Pakistan's armed forces  who is currentlystationed in Afghanistan's Kunduz province commands the Pakistani-Taliban-bin Laden operationsin the north. He has been assisted by two of binLaden's henchmen  Abu Wara and Hubab. All of themwere involved in the recent occupation of Taloqan andin the atrocities committed against the civilianpopulation. It is important to mention that theNovember/December issue of Foreign Affairsmagazine has estimated the total number of Pakistanishaving fought in Afghanistan since 1994 to be inexcess of 80 000.A breakdown of Pakistani nationals fighting inAfghanistan include the following: Pakistani armedcontingents  including units from the North-WestFrontier Corps and different commando units  haveactively participated in battles on various occasions;Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) officers involved in theplanning and command and control of both intelligenceoperations and logistical support; ex-commissionedofficers in charge of tactical operations  artillerysupport and logistics; frontier militia units;paramilitary members of extremist terrorist groupsaffiliated with the ISI  such as the Sipah-e-Sahaaba  theSepah-e-Tayeba  the Harakat-ul-Ansar and so on; andthe so-called volunteers from Pakistani madrassas  orreligious schools.Other categories of foreign fighters inAfghanistan include Osama bin Laden's al-Qaedagroup and its affiliated units from around the PersianGulf  the Middle East and Africa  and extremist groupsfrom Central Asia  South Asia and the Far East. Inaddition  thousands of Afghan refugees who wereeducated and trained in Pakistani religious schools aredispatched to the battlefronts of Afghanistan. Finally there are conscripted and forcibly recruited personsfrom around Afghanistan who are deployed as canonfodder.In this context  the Islamic State of Afghanistanappeals to the Security Council to mandate the UnitedNations Special Mission to Afghanistan to dispatch aninvestigation team to Afghanistan to verify and reportto the Security Council on the presence of Pakistaniarmed men and Arab fighters who are workingshoulder-to-shoulder with the Taliban mercenaries.This would break the silence that has thus farencouraged further Pakistani intervention inAfghanistan.I should like to remind the Assembly that onlythose Afghans conscripted and forcibly recruited willbe immune from prosecution by the Islamic State ofAfghanistan for war crimes  crimes against humanityand genocide. The rest shall be subject to indictment.One must conclude that the failure of the Jeddahindirect negotiations in particular  and of other peaceinitiatives at large  derive from the sad reality thatpeace has no place in the Taliban agenda.While striving for the realization of noble humanvalues and principles — the institution of a democraticsystem  the observance of human rights  includingthose of women and girls  civil liberties andelections — the Islamic State of Afghanistan reiteratesits firm position to strive to reach a peaceful settlementof the conflict and hereby declares its full readiness forthe formation of a broad-based  multi-ethnic and fullyrepresentative Government through a workablemechanism such as the traditional grand assembly  orloya jirgah  or any other representative forum under theauspices of the United Nations. Meanwhile  as long asPakistan continues to directly and massively intervenein the internal affairs of Afghanistan  the Islamic Stateof Afghanistan considers the task of defending theterritorial integrity  national unity and politicalindependence of Afghanistan its immediate priority.The Islamic State of Afghanistan has highexpectations that the United Nations and theinternational community will exert pressure onPakistan to immediately cease its intervention inAfghanistan and to withdraw all its military personneland armed nationals from Afghanistan; that theSecurity Council will address the question of foreign7intervention  the existence of terrorist networks inAfghanistan and the effective implementation ofrelevant Security Council resolutions; that theOrganization of the Islamic Conference will clarify itsview of the Taliban's words and deeds — spoken andcarried out in the name of Islam — which we believedistort  and are contrary to  the true spirit of Islam  itstenets and injunctions; that the United Nations DrugControl Programme will assist the Islamic State ofAfghanistan in the fight against the production andtrafficking of illicit drugs; that the United Nations andthe international community will step up their effortsfor an early and peaceful settlement of the Afghanconflict; and that the international community willprovide humanitarian assistance to the war-stricken anddrought-hit civilian population of Afghanistan. Here Ishould like to mention that the current drought  themost severe in 30 years  will have tremendoushumanitarian repercussions.We remain thankful for the statements made bythe heads of delegation at the Millennium Summit andin the General Assembly expressing their legitimateconcerns over the dangers emanating from thePakistani Taliban-occupied territories of Afghanistan.We deeply appreciate and support theindefatigable efforts of Mr. Francesc Vendrell  theSecretary-General's Special Representative forAfghanistan and head of the United Nations SpecialMission to Afghanistan (UNSMA)  who has left nostone unturned  and no party to the conflict or countriesconcerned out of communication  in finding a peacefulsolution to the Afghan conflict.I should like to conclude by stating that theUnited Nations cannot embark on the new millenniumwithout appropriately addressing the issues enshrinedin its Charter  among others  the question of noninterference. Neither can this international bodyadvocate globalization in its true sense whenTalibanization is threatening regional stability in ourpart of the world. Certainly the Pakistani military juntawill remain the prime actor in this dreadful andimmense tragedy in Asia.Like many others afflicted with the Talibanplague  we wonder how far the evil threat ofTalibanism will spread  how many more souls it willbury and how many new borders it must cross beforethe conscience of the international community isawakened  not just to consider but to adopt immediateand drastic preventive measures."
"2",69,"AGO",55,2000,"Allow me to begin bycongratulating you  Sir  on behalf of my Governmentand on my own behalf  on your assumption of thepresidency of the fifty-fifth session of the GeneralAssembly.I also wish to congratulate  in particular  theoutgoing President  Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  theMinister for Foreign Affairs of Namibia  for the wiseand dynamic manner in which he carried out hismandate. I would also like to express our appreciationto Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his unselfishefforts to make the United Nations an increasinglyeffective instrument  capable of dealing with thedemands of our times and finding and implementingsolutions for the most pressing problems of the world.Just a few days ago  during the MillenniumSummit  the leaders of the world defined the prioritiesof the United Nations for the twenty-first century andexpressed the need to adapt its structure for thedemands and challenges of the future. During thatevent of transcendental importance for the lives of thepeople of this planet  the indispensable andirreplaceable character of the United Nations ininternational relations was reaffirmed. Member Statesreiterated their promise to maintain and preserve theUnited Nations as a privileged mechanism forinternational dialogue and cooperation in the name ofpeace and well-being of all peoples.Indeed  given the role of the United Nations asguarantor of peace and well-being of the peoples  it isurgent that we begin the implementation of actionsaimed at adapting its internal structure to new worldrealities. This will permit the Organization to dealrapidly and effectively with the main problems of theworld and avoid having its members resort to solutionsoutside the established framework of its mainorgans  namely  the General Assembly and theSecurity Council.In recent years  the United Nations sought through world summits  to find global solutions withbroad international consensus for the many misfortunesthat afflict humanity  such as local wars  degradation ofthe environment  violations of human rights andinadequate social development  among others. Variousplans of action were outlined. However  the problems12they sought to attenuate or resolve persist. Many haveeven become worse.A revision of the mechanism for implementingdecisions is needed  through a revitalization andstrengthening of the United Nations system particularly that of its principal bodies  such as theSecurity Council. From our point of view  that bodyrequires greater internal democracy  and itscomposition should reflect the current membership inthe Organization and its geographic diversity. We thinkthat  in this way  its decision-making would be fasterand its performance in the area of peacekeeping andinternational security more effective.The persistence of a climate of insecurity andinstability in a number of regions of the world cannotbe attributed solely to internal causes; it also stemsfrom weakness in the international security system. Areflection of this are the deficiencies that still exist  forexample  in the early warning system and in thepeacekeeping operations mechanisms. These have notalways corresponded to the desired objectives  eitherbecause the peacekeeping missions sometimes are notsent in a timely manner  or because at times  they arenot provided with adequate human  material andfinancial resources. Sometimes this is due to theambiguity in the mission mandate itself.We recognize that the effectiveness of action inthe area of peace and international security does notdepend only on United Nations activities. There has tobe renewed commitment on the part of each and everyState. On this matter  I would like to applaud the recentpublication of the Brahimi report.It is our understanding that the adoption ofmeasures at the national  regional and internationallevels should be made part of this commitment in orderto eliminate the sources of financing for local wars. Inthe particular case of the African continent  thecontinent most affected by the scourge of war  theillicit trade in diamonds has been the primary source ofsupport for wars incited by some rebel groups with theobjective of overturning democratically electedregimes. Some new initiatives have been launched withthe aim of reducing access of these conflictdiamonds to the international market. My Governmentsupports these initiatives and will provide anycooperation necessary for their implementation.Another serious issue affecting internationalsecurity is the circulation and transfer of small armsthat flow to areas of conflict by way of rebel groups.This takes place with the connivance of certainGovernments and networks of transnational organizedcrime. The lack of international legal instrumentscapable of controlling transactions of these arms isstimulating the creation of actual arms markets  aboveall in Africa. This is leading to an increased number ofconflicts and making their resolution even moredifficult. According to United Nations data  the effectsof these arms on civil populations are shocking. Theyhave already resulted in more deaths than the twoworld wars combined. In fact  the issue of conflictdiamonds and the proliferation of small arms assumesspecial importance for Angola. It is through the sale ofillegally mined diamonds that the rebels led by JonasSavimbi reconstituted their war machine  with whichthey then undertook a large-scale military campaignaimed at taking power. That war campaign led to aprocession of death and destruction  and it is theprincipal reason for the economic instability in Angola.This scenario is repeating itself in other regions ofAfrica and the world. For this reason  a solution isurgently required.The economic and social development andsubsequent eradication of poverty  full respect forhuman rights  democracy and good governance canonly be achieved in absolute conditions of peace andstability. It is in this context that my Governmentestablished  as a priority  the restoration of definitivepeace in Angola. As a result of its efforts to attain thisobjective  the general situation in Angola hassignificantly improved. It is for this reason that todaywe are more confident than ever of a future of peace development and prosperity.Indeed  the war has ceased to have the sameintensity as it did several years ago  and the conflictitself is moving progressively towards an end. Thepolitical and military measures undertaken by theGovernment have significantly reduced the ability ofthe rebels to wage war. These measures have alsoallowed the Government to resume control over nearlythe entire country.More than 12 000 rebel military personnel haveabandoned their arms and joined the efforts ofreconstruction and national reconciliation. Those whopersist in waging war have less and less space  andtheir activities are limited today to isolated armedattacks against civilian targets  the objective being todestroy and loot the people's property.13The military measures undertaken by theGovernment represent a necessary and legitimaterecourse designed to stop the violence unleashed by therebels of UNITA  which put in jeopardy the veryexistence of the Angolan democratic system. However despite the fact that the ongoing measures aimed at thetotal control of our national borders and the eliminationof the remaining pockets of criminal armed groups arehaving a positive impact in the search for peace  theydo not constitute our only option for the resolution ofarmed conflict.Simultaneously  we will continue to implementother actions aimed at guaranteeing the totalimplementation of the Lusaka Protocol  which for uscontinues to be a valid basis for the resolution of theAngolan problem. In this context  we reiterate ourreadiness to continue to integrate in our society allthose who choose to abandon the option of war.The international community  and the UnitedNations in particular  still has an active role to play inthe process of restoring peace in Angola  through thecontinued implementation and strengthening ofsanctions against the rebels led by Jonas Savimbi.The recent nomination by the Secretary-Generalof the members of the mechanism to monitor theapplication of sanctions against the UNITA rebels  inaccordance with Security Council resolution 1295(2000)  will contribute to greater internationalvigilance regarding possible violations. It will denybases of support to the armed rebellion in Angola. Wehope that all Members of the United Nations willextend their cooperation to that body.The significant improvement of the situation inAngola  however  has not brought an immediate end tothe effects of war on the lives of the people. Thehumanitarian situation continues to be critical  and forthat reason we appeal to the international community toincrease its assistance to the needy populations.The positive evolution of the situation is notlimited to the politico-military field; it has also carriedover into the macroeconomic sector. Angola continueson the path of economic reforms which have earned theconfidence of international financial institutions. Thisprogress translated to the recent signature of anagreement with the International Monetary Fundrelating to the implementation of a monitoredprogramme.We hope that the international community willcontribute substantially through the investment ofcapital during the recovery phase of the Angolaneconomy in supporting stability and growth. Angolaadopted legislation to protect foreign investment byproviding incentives and guarantees.The international situation continues to becharacterized by violence and tension in various partsof the world; they constitute a serious threat to peaceand stability. Angola is seriously concerned by thecontinuation of the conflict in the Democratic Republicof the Congo in view of the grave repercussions forstability and development in the central region ofAfrica. The situation in that neighbouring country which shares more than 2 000 kilometres of commonborder with Angola  remains quite volatile andcomplex. It runs the risk of a serious worsening ifappropriate measures are not taken.The resolution of the Congolese conflict mustcome about  fundamentally  through theimplementation of the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement. Inspite of its shortcomings  which perhaps call for a newreading  it continues to be the only basis acceptable toall the parties involved. It respects the sovereignty andterritorial integrity of the Democratic Republic of theCongo. Invading forces should withdraw completelyfrom Congolese territory and cease immediately theirsupport for the destabilization of that country.These conditions  in addition to the inter-Congolese dialogue  founded on a realistic baseincluding the unequivocal recognition of the authorityof the Government in Kinshasa  will be crucial for thesuccess of the peace process. Angola reiterates itscommitment to continue to make the necessary efforts together with the mediator  President Frederick Chilubaof Zambia  and other parties to the Lusaka Agreement until a way out of the conflict is found.In Sierra Leone  the prosecution of hostilitiescontinues to delay the pacification of the country.Angola supports regional initiatives aimed atreactivating the peace process and condemns theattacks against United Nations personnel and forces.We support steps aimed at bringing to internationaljustice the principal parties responsible for theatrocities committed against the people of that country.In Somalia  the progress reached at the nationalconference led to the re-establishment of some nationalinstitutions and moved the country closer to peace.14Angola encourages the continuation of these effortsand hopes that in the near future Somalia may be ableto reassume  de facto  its rightful place in theinternational community.In the Horn of Africa  the conflict betweenEthiopia and Eritrea has undergone some positivemovement following the signing of the Cessation ofHostilities Agreement in Algiers. We hope that the twoparties honour their commitments under the accord andcreate conditions for the establishment of good-neighbourly relations and cooperation.Similarly  we continue to be optimistic regardingthe resolution of the conflict in Western Sahara throughthe implementation of the United Nations peace plan.Angola is following with particular attention thesituation in Zimbabwe  our fraternal country  andsupports the efforts of the Government of that countryto find a just and fair solution to the land problem thatwas inherited from the colonial period. In this context we share and fully support the position expressed bythe Southern African Development Community(SADC) and the Non-Aligned Movement on landreform in Zimbabwe.In the Middle East  the question of Palestineconstitutes the fundamental cause of conflict in theregion. Angola reaffirms its support for the right of thePalestinian people to self-determination. The resolutionof this conflict must encompass a political compromisebetween the parties involved and the effectiveimplementation of relevant Security Councilresolutions and other understandings reached.Less than a year ago  the people of East Timorfinally succeeded in exercising their right to self-determination. Angola feels pleased and compensatedby this historic accomplishment  since it was one of thecountries that fought in the United Nations and otherinternational forums for the right of the Timoresepeople to freely choose their own destiny.The international community  and the UnitedNations in particular  which is responsible for themanagement of the transition period  cannot permit thecurrent climate of violence  provoked by the militiaswith the objective of impeding the independence of theterritory  to impose itself over the will of a people thathas already suffered for decades the scourge ofcolonialism and foreign domination. Angola stronglycondemns these acts of violence  which have resultedin great loss of life  destruction and chaos. Angolaappeals to the Security Council to take appropriatesteps to ensure its immediate cessation.In the past two years  the world economy hasregistered a clear recovery since the crisis that shookAsia. The industrial economies and the so-calledemerging markets are becoming stronger and achievingconsiderable rates of growth. However  the presentworld economic order continues to be marked by sharpdistortions between North and South. While the Northenjoys unprecedented prosperity  the South continuesto suffer poverty and social injustice. Contributing tothese ills are restrictive economic measures imposedunilaterally. The embargo imposed against Cuba is oneexample  its principal victims are the mostvulnerable strata of its population. We will continue tosupport the lifting of the embargo.The international goal of reducing by one half  bythe year 2015  the percentage of the world populationliving in extreme poverty will require strenuous efforts above all by the wealthiest countries and internationalfinancial institutions. In particular  it will be necessaryto relieve the burden of external debt  whose servicepayments alone absorb a large part of the financialresources of developing countries.At the same time  steps will be necessary toattenuate the negative impact of globalization. Despitethe fact that it has strengthened the spirit of communityin international economic relations  globalization hasbenefited wealthy countries more than underdevelopedcountries. The structural adjustment programmes underway in many developing countries should take accountof real necessities and specifics  because many of themeasures imposed by the international financialinstitutions have caused serious difficulties  above allof a social nature.To conclude my remarks  I would like to callattention to the need to pay more attention to theeconomic situation of the African continent. Thisshould be done in such a way as to facilitate itsintegration into the world market  particularly throughthe transfer of technology and increasing productiveinvestment."
"3",116,"ALB",55,2000,"Allow me to congratulateyou  Sir  on your election as President of the GeneralAssembly  and to express my strong conviction that under your guidance  the work of this session will beconducted successfully. I would also like to take thisopportunity to express my great appreciation for thework carried out by your predecessor  Mr. Theo-BenGurirab  and for his competent guidance of theprevious session.At the start of the new millennium  Albania  as asovereign and peace-loving country  is committed tomaking its modest contribution  in the activities of thecommunity of countries Members of the UnitedNations  to greater peace  stability  security andeconomic prosperity. It has tried to do so by creatinginternal political and economic stability  as well as bypursuing a foreign policy aimed at achievingconstructive cooperation with the countries of South-Eastern Europe and beyond. Since last year's session Albania has been taking further steps towardsconsolidating its democratic institutions andconstitutional order  strengthening and liberalizing itseconomy and consolidating and ensuring respect forhuman rights. Because of the efficient measuresundertaken by the Albanian Government  and thanks tothe help provided by our partners  Albania isrecovering from the consequences of last year'sconflict in Kosovo.Albania has become an open and safe country forforeign investment. The policies of the AlbanianGovernment to privatize strategic sectors and absorbforeign capital are bearing fruit. The strengthening ofsecurity and public order  as well as the fight againstorganized crime  have reached satisfactory levels thatare appreciated not only within my country  butelsewhere. The abrogation of the death penalty and theestablishment of the office of Ombudsman have furtherraised the level of protection of and respect for humanrights in Albania.Albania is currently on the eve of local elections which will be of fundamental importance for the futuredevelopment of the country  not because of theresults so much as because of the way in which theelections will be conducted. For this reason  theAlbanian Government  in close cooperation withspecialized international institutions  such as theOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe the Council of Europe  the United NationsDevelopment Programme and others  has made everyeffort to ensure that these elections are fair  free anddemocratic.Albania has clearly expressed its intention to playa primary and constructive role in the commonattempts to transform the Balkans into a developed andstable region  clearly aiming at European integration.The policy of good-neighbourliness is not simply arequirement of geography but  above all  an eloquentexpression of goodwill and mutual interest in the8protection of democratic institutions  fundamentalfreedoms  stability and prosperity in the region.Consequently  the Albanian Government has proceededtowards the creation of stable relations of mutualcooperation with Balkan countries  considering that tobe a primary strategy for future European integration.Relations with these countries have beeninstitutionalized not only bilaterally  but alsomultilaterally. Albania has placed at the core of theserelations common economic  political and securityinterests  as well as respect for human freedoms andrights  including those of national minorities living inthe territory of the Republic of Albania. It has tried tomake inter-Balkan relations follow the model ofexisting relations among European Union membercountries  with the free movement of people  goods andcapital.More than a year after the bloody conflict inKosovo that endangered peace and stability in theregion  the Albanian Government is of the opinion thatthe situation in Kosovo has improved significantlysince the beginning of the implementation of SecurityCouncil resolution 1244 (1999)  the deployment ofthe Kosovo Force (KFOR) and the establishment of theUnited Nations administration. Hundreds of thousandsof refugees have returned home  houses destroyed bythe war have been rebuilt  the reconstruction of theeconomy and of the common administrationinstitutions has begun and the political situation andorder in the country have improved significantly.The current situation in Kosovo contradicts thesceptical and nihilistic opinions  expressed here andthere  against the North Atlantic Treaty Organization(NATO) military intervention in Kosovo and againstthe establishment of the United Nations administrationthere. Our memories of what happened in Kosovo ayear ago will not fade  but will make us moreconscious of the catastrophic consequences that thechauvinistic policy of a totalitarian regime can bring toan innocent civilian population.In order to make a contribution to the founding ofa democratic society in Kosovo in which human andnational rights are fully respected  we have establishedvery close relations with the United Nations InterimAdministration Mission in Kosovo  KFOR and theirrepresentatives. Albanians  even more than otherpeople in the region  wish for and will welcome thedemocratization of Serbia  because  historically  theyhave suffered more than others from Serbiannationalism. Often  however  wishes do not match upwith reality  and we have to be realistic.Following very attentively the preparations forlocal elections in Kosovo  the Albanian Governmentexpresses its conviction that the political forces inKosovo will conduct their pre-electoral campaign inaccordance with democratic principles and values without acts of political violence. We would also liketo express our sincere will for the full participation ofthe Serb community and of the other minorities inKosovo in this electoral process because  as we havepreviously stated  we support a multi-ethnic andmulticultural Kosovo.I would like to take this opportunity to appeal tothe entire international community to apply strongerpressure against the Milosević regime in order to forcehim to release all 7 000 Albanian political prisonersand hostages being kept in the Serb prisons  to helpbring the criminals who caused the massacres againstthe Kosovar population before the United NationsTribunal for war crimes in the former Yugoslavia  tostrengthen the international police presence and towork on strengthening judicial bodies in order to detectany kind of crime in Kosovo and combat it.I would also like to reiterate that the realizationof United Nations goals for the fulfilment of thepromises to start the reconstruction of the Kosovareconomy is of special importance. It should beincluded in regional cooperation projects  especially inthe framework of the Stability Pact for South-EasternEurope.Although the Balkan political scenery haschanged  and the countries of the region are engaged ina process of cooperation  there still exists a source oftension and conflict in the region  a source that hasconsequences for the countries of the region andbeyond. It is Milosević's regime. He was not satisfiedby the catastrophic 10-year-long conflicts that hepersonally set off in the former Yugoslavia; now he isdestroying Serbia itself  as well as the remainingYugoslavia.Next week  presidential and parliamentaryelections will be held in Serbia. The current situationthere indicates that very little chance exists for them tobe free and fair. The recent amendments to theYugoslav Constitution  the brutal violence against theopposition and the student movement and the9censorship and closing down of independent media areexplicit facts proving that Milosević may transformthese elections into a tool for illegally maintainingpower.Like all the rest of the international community the Albanian Government looks forward to genuinedemocratic forces coming into power in Serbia  forcesthat possess new visions for the future of their countryand of the whole region.Taking advantage of this opportunity  I would liketo thank Mr. Kouchner  the Special Representative ofthe Secretary-General  for the positive developments inKosovo and for all that he and his staff are doing tostabilize Kosovo and to establish democraticinstitutions there.As a neighbouring country  Albania closelyfollows developments in Montenegro. It condemnsMilosević's attempts to destabilize that Republic and toundermine the democratic and integrative processesthat are being undertaken by the legitimateMontenegrin leadership. Following the good-neighbourliness principle of its foreign policy  theAlbanian Government has recently developedintensively its cooperation with Montenegro. Currentrelations have reached the highest level ever known having been extended to areas of mutual interest  suchas political  economic and trade cooperation  the freemovement of people and so forth. It is our intention tofurther extend and strengthen these relations in thefuture.The countries in our region are involved in analready irreversible process: Euro-Atlantic integration.Not only the Balkans  but also Western Europe  is nowaware of the danger stemming from a divided Europe of the danger stemming from a Balkan region that isnot integrated into the European Union. The regionalconflicts of the last decade are more than sufficient tounderstand this tendency. Stability in the Balkans is notonly in the interest of its countries  but also in theinterest of the European Union itself. An economicallydeveloped and democratically consolidated Balkanscannot exist without a Europeanized Balkans. TheEuropean integration of the Balkans and itsdevelopment consist of an inseparable unity. It is of noimportance whether a country tries to protect itsdemocratic institutions  laws  public order or respecthuman rights; it can never attain the desired success ifit is not economically developed.We are conscious that European integration is notan easy process; on the contrary  it is a long anddifficult path. Before being integrated into theEuropean Union  all the countries of our region shouldfirst be integrated among themselves  and existingsocieties in the Balkans should demonstrate and reflectthe best features of European civilization. In order toachieve this  we should first combat and overcomeextreme nationalistic concepts  mentalities andpolicies  because Europeanization meanscooperation  tolerance and integration.The end of the conflict in Kosovo marked aturning point for the future of the Balkans. TheStability Pact for South-Eastern Europe was the bestresponse to the crisis in the region. Our countries  likethe European Union member countries  consider thisinitiative an instrument and a bridge for the integrationof South-Eastern Europe into the European structures.The Albanian Government regards the implementationof the Stability Pact as one of its main priorities.Albania is highly appreciated by its internationalpartners for the engagement and the responsibility ithas shown in drafting the feasibility studies for theStability Pact projects. We hope that the strongpolitical will expressed in Sarajevo last year at the endof the Kosovo conflict will be vigorously followed bythe will to finalize financial support for the rapidimplementation of the Stability Pact projects.Albania's achievements in its domestic andforeign policy in the year 2000 have only one goal: itsfurther integration within Euro-Atlantic structures. TheAlbanian people have a clear European orientation  andthat is why all Albanian Governments of the last 10years have enjoyed their total support for theirEuropean integration policy. The present AlbanianGovernment  representing and expressing the will ofthe people  has continuously fulfilled all the requiredconditions during the last year  aiming at reaching ahigher level of relations with the European Union. Wehope that in the near future the institutions of theEuropean Union will approve the status report that theAlbanian Government presented at Brussels severalmonths ago. This approval will pave the way for thebeginning of negotiations to reach Albania'sassociation and stability agreement with the EuropeanUnion. Albania's acceptance in the World TradeOrganization in July this year was also an encouragingand very optimistic event in this respect.10The Albanian Government has welcomed theinitiative of President Chirac to organize  on behalf ofthe European Union  a regional summit in Zagreb inNovember this year. It is another affirmation ofcommon efforts to further advance the democratizationand integration processes in the region and theconsolidation of security and stability there.The new century has started. We should keep onfacing old problems  along with our new challenges.Some of those may be local crises  organized crime traffic in human beings  terrorism  arms control and soforth  all of which require practical and well-orientedcooperation. Bitter experiences in various regions ofthe world  such as the Balkans  Africa  South-East Asiaand so forth  made the role of such organizations as theUnited Nations  the Organization for Security andCooperation in Europe and others more evident. On theother hand  the world has entered the era ofglobalization. Despite its positive side  globalization isunavoidably accompanied by effects that may bringnegative consequences  especially to small and poorcountries. In order to avoid these consequences  it isnecessary to compile and to implement globalstrategies  and the United Nations can easily do that.Only a week has passed since one of the mostdistinguished events for the international community the Millennium Summit. It was a unique meeting of allthe leaders of the world  where they affirmed theirgoodwill to cooperate in facing the challenges of thenew millennium and in strengthening the UnitedNations. The Albanian Government hails the results ofthe Summit and expresses its conviction that all UnitedNations Member countries should unite all their forcesfor the fulfilment of the commitments embodied in thefinal Declaration of the Summit. Following is what theSecretary-General  Kofi Annan  wrote in his report:We must do more than talk about ourfuture  however. We must start to create it.(A/54/2000  para. 17)It is time to take concrete steps in this direction."
"4",139,"AND",55,2000,"Andorra willbecome  through the Western European and OthersGroup (WEOG) rotation scheme  a member of theEconomic and Social Council (ECOSOC) of the UnitedNations at the beginning of 2001  for a period of threeyears. This is a great responsibility and a particularchallenge for a small country that has only been aMember of the United Nations since 1993.My Minister of External Relations  Mr. AlbertPintat  would have loved to have been here today toexpress to Members Andorra's commitment to thegoals of the United Nations and specially ourobligations in ECOSOC. He would have praised theBrahimi report and its new thoughts on peacekeepingoperations  which my country supports. When helearned that he would be unable to lead this year'sdelegation to the United Nations  owing to unavoidableofficial functions in Europe  he asked me  in the lightof our forthcoming membership in ECOSOC  tocontribute to this general debate of the year 2000 withsome free reflections — if possible innovative ones —on what globalization might mean for a small State.This is a daunting task since everything seems to havebeen said about the subject  but I shall try to dutifullycarry out my Minister's instructions.First  however  let me convey to President HarriHolkeri Albert Pintat's congratulations for his electionas President of the fifty-fifth session of the GeneralAssembly  while thanking his predecessor  Theo-BenGurirab  for a difficult job well done.When I was a student here in the United Statesmany years ago  I took a course in photography. I hadtaken from my family's house in Andorra a negative —it was one of the older glass negatives — and there inthe university photography lab I set it up fordeveloping. I remember that moment when I peeredinto the developer tray and saw  slowly forming on thewhite photographic paper  an image  the image of mygreat grandmother. It was a shock  there in New Haven to see this face from a long distant past  from longbefore I was born  come slowly into clarity. A lostimage from a lost past.If I had the time  and Members the inclination  Icould tell them about my great-grandmother  aformidable woman who never left the Valley ofAndorra  high up in the mountains of the Pyrenees. Icould tell them what her face  strong and hard as thestone of the mountains  says about the history of mycountry. In the photograph  she is dressed all in black and looks away from the camera  down at the rockyground. Behind her  one can see the stones of the16family farm  high up in the mountains above SaintJulia  one of the seven parishes that make up thePrincipality of Andorra.Her Andorra is very different from the countrytoday. Dirt paths have become asphalt roads and stone-strewn fields are now covered with shops  houses andhotels. The remarkable Romanesque churches that arethe pride of my country  churches that date back to thefoundation of the Principality in the late thirteenthcentury and that loomed over the villages for almost amillennium  are now hemmed in by concretebuildings — stores  apartments  houses  the samebuildings you might find in parts of Rio de Janeiro Beijing or New York.Yes  so much has changed since my grandfather'shand snapped this picture. My great-grandmotherwould recognize only the church towers and the stonesof the mountains. And what was so specific about herworld — the stories  the cooking  the fabric of dailylife — well  that has disappeared.In the space of 70 years  Andorra has changedfrom being a poor and remote place to a prosperouscountry  with over 10 million tourists a year  who comefor skiing in the winter and hiking in the summer. Weare now a commercial hub. If you look for a countrytransformed by globalization  you might look toAndorra.Andorra is a country that has survived independent and uninvaded  since 1278. It is one of theoldest and one of the smallest democracies in theworld. A historian might argue that this remarkable factis due to its isolation and poverty  or because forcenturies the outside world was neatly balanced by itsco-Princes — the Bishop of Urgell to the south  and tothe north the Count of Foix  later the French King andsince 1805 the head of the French State.Unsurprisingly  I might attribute the remarkable recordof peace to the cautious character of the Andorranpeople. Or rather — and less partially — I think thatbecause it is a small country  where parishes have beenable to readily communicate with one another at theCasa de la Vall  the House of the Valleys communication never broke down.The Millennium Summit of the United Nationshad as its theme globalization. As a summit  it wasaptly named  since I would say that globalization is thestory of the second millennium — indeed perhaps it isthe story of human culture. I am a politician  not ahistorian  but we all know the effect on both Europeand the Middle East wrought by the Crusades of theeleventh and twelfth centuries  or the transformation ofindigenous and European cultures brought about by the“discovery” of the New World  or the effect of theslave trade of the seventeenth and eighteenth centurieson both Africa and the Americas. These violentencounters formed the world even as they broughtdeath and destruction. They also sparked ourimaginations. The Globe was the name ofShakespeare's playhouse in sixteenth-century London a joke he liked to work into many of his plays. I like tothink of the United Nations as the new Globe  a theatrein which we are the players or — if we have theimagination — the dramatists for the story of ourfragile planet.But the globalization we are now facing is of adifferent nature. As Kofi Annan suggested in hisopening introduction to the Millennium conference  thestarting point for this millennium can be summed up inone word: “globalization” — the melting away ofnational boundaries as the world becomes oneeconomy  one common space  one village.It is an idyllic view  the view of the world as avillage. Of course  the Secretary-General is all tooaware of the negative effects of the process. In thesame introduction  he cautions:“Globalization offers great opportunities  but atpresent its benefits are very unevenly distributedwhile its costs are borne by all.“Thus the central challenge we face today isto ensure that globalization becomes a positiveforce for all the world's people.” (A/54/2000 paras. 13 and 14)We all know the protests that have taken place and will take place  against this same word “globalization”. Let us listen  for instance  to one of theinterested groups  chosen at random  the InternationalForum on Globalization (IFG)  which understands theterm as referring to a “globalized economic systemdominated by supranational corporate trade andbanking institutions that are not accountable todemocratic processes or national Governments”. TheIFG accuses“the GATT  WTO  Maastricht  NAFTA  combinedwith structural adjustment policies of the IMFand the World Bank  to be direct stimulants to the17processes that weaken democracy  create a worldorder that is under the control of transnationalcorporations  and that devastate the naturalworld”.According to the IFG  globalization brings thediminishment of powers of local and indigenouscommunities  States and even nations  destroys bothsmall-scale agriculture and the earth's remainingwilderness  and brings a worldwide homogenization ofdiverse local and indigenous cultures. To counter itseffects  the IFG advocates the revitalization of localcommunities by promoting maximum self-reliance  therecognition of rights of indigenous peoples and theabandonment of the paradigm of unlimited economicgrowth.When I listen to these words  I cannot help buthear a lament  a lament for a lost and simpler world:the world of my great-grandmother. And I am remindedof that greatest of all laments for lost culture  the workthat indeed informs the thinking behind the activistswho struggle against the forces of globalization —Claude Lévi-Strauss and his masterpiece  TristesTropiques  his elegy for the people of the Amazonbasin  which even as he captured it on paper wasdisappearing into our modern world.I understand the sadness for the lost world  theworld of the past that is always slipping away from us that exists in the black-and-white negative of ourmemory. And so here I elegize  before this Assembly all that has disappeared  not simply in Andorra but inthe world  all that has been forgotten  paved over bythe forces of travel  of tourism  of telephone television  cinema and the Internet.These technologies link the world; they narrowits distances and threaten to dilute the cultures of theglobe into a flat monoculture. And I ask my listenersnow: what new discoveries await us? We cannotimagine them  but they will come  and sooner than wethink  in this terrifying and beautiful globe of ours.And yet  and yet ... The IFG manifesto was notposted on a church door in Wittenburg  printed in anew technology that sparked another revolution  theReformation of the sixteenth century. No  it wasdownloaded from a web site on the Internet. ThisWeb — in which ideas  images  voices travel across ourglobe in a flash — is a remarkable invention thatcollapses both time and space.In the same way  I now realize that my image ofmy great-grandmother came from a negative  from acamera — a technology that perhaps more than anyother  besides the computer  has transformed andquickened the pace of our world.This is to make a very simple point: not simplythat this manifesto is presented in the very technologyof globalization  but that nostalgia for a local economymight be a product of globalization itself.My great-grandmother had a good life  but a hardone  with terrible cold in the winter and constant work.Would she have chosen this life  if she could have hadanother? If she had known another? And more to thepoint  would she have been allowed to choose?We need to remember that people themselveshave embraced change. Real people who are notcontent to live — physically or imaginatively — intheir places of birth  but  filled with a desire to bettertheir lives or to see the world  they reach out and try tograsp change  if only to know what they have lost.Lévi-Strauss could not bring himself to recognizethat people he observed  deep in the Amazon rainforests  might want to leave their paradise — notbecause they were driven out by modernity  themodernity that Lévi-Strauss himself made so much of but because they wanted to better their lives  toembrace the world  to feel for themselves the painfulpulse of gain and loss.We need only leave this Hall and walk throughany street in the city to recognize this. People from allacross the world  people of all races  walking up anddown  alone or in conversation  happy or unhappy homesick or embracing the dreams this city seems toproffer. In the streets  we see restaurants that offerwonderful meals from all around the world  and fusionrestaurants: French-Senegalese  American-Thai. Orfusion children. In the streets of New York or Paris orHong Kong or Andorra la Vella  the people arechanging  colours are shifting. What brave new worldis being born around us?In saying this  I do not want to contradict theconcerns of the anti-globalists  to in any way deny theirrecognition of the dangers of change. We ignore at ourperil practical questions that turn around internationalfinance  international corporations  the widening gulfbetween have and have-not countries  the dangers tothe environment.18These are practical matters to be seen to. Toparaphrase Annan  we need mechanisms to equalize thebenefits of globalization  to make life a positive thingfor all peoples. By this I do not mean the quest forsuperfluous material goods  but shelter and health andprotection from disease. And I would add  simply  thatbefore and during my tenure here as Ambassador  theUnited Nations hosted a series of summits orconferences designed to address these veryproblems — Rio  Istanbul  Copenhagen  Beijing Rome  just to name a few. The world conferenceagainst racism  racial discrimination  xenophobia andrelated intolerance  the world summit for children andRio + 10 are to come. There is a substantial body ofwork in place to address the stresses of globalization.What we need to do now is continue to work towardsour goals.In conclusion  I would like to consider apresupposition of both global optimists and pessimists:the notion that globalization has replaced nationalism.Again  to quote Kofi Annan  globalization means “themelting away of national boundaries as the worldbecomes one economy  one common space  onevillage”.Similarly  the report published in The New YorkTimes concerning the protests against globalizationstated that “speakers do not oppose globalization perse  because  in their view  the era of nation-States iscoming to its inevitable end”.Are globalization and nationalism opposed? Onthe surface  they would appear to be. So much ofglobalization — economies that transcend borders communication networks that shrink the world —seems to render an earlier model of the nation-Stateobsolete.And yet  whether it be the ethnic conflicts inRwanda or in the Balkans  issues of immigration in thedeveloped world or conflict in East Timor  we knowthat the question of the border  of the passport  remainsincreasingly important. Despite our interconnectedness nationalism has not withered away. I fear the rise of anationalism no longer linked to true patriotism  that isto the love of a place. I pray that the world does notsuccumb to an unthinking nationalism that would existsimply to exclude or to feed the ambitions ofunscrupulous politicians. We need a democraticnationalism forged out of a concern for the rights ofindividuals. That is not nationalism as it worked outfrom the eighteenth to the twentieth centuries — anationalism linked to the struggle to control markets  tothe scramble for loot — but a new nationalism that isnot predicated on identity  on cultural sameness  anationalism that is linked to a world economy that is nolonger restricted by national borders  a democratic orcivic nationalism  a global nationalism.This would be a new nationalism  I must add  inwhich Andorra and other small countries are nothistorical anachronisms  but are emblematic of thiscivic nationalism  predicated as it must be on thedemocratic will of the people. In this sense  Andorra'squiet patriotism  its 700 years of peace andcommunication  can modestly serve as a kind ofhistorical model.Countries need to rethink what it means to be anation in order to participate effectively in the life ofthis our globe  in order to become what we must be andto a certain extent already are: united nations. In itsvery name  in its very mission  the United Nationsanticipated the globalization that is so rapidlyoccurring. Born out of a global threat posed by war andlater by nuclear war  forged from the most terrible ofnational struggles  the United Nations is an activistforum for issues that are global  not in the sense thatthey transcend any individual nation  but in the sensethat they are of concern to all nations.The International Criminal Court  whose statutewill soon be ratified by Andorra  a country which hadthe honour of contributing to it by composing the firstparagraphs of the preamble  is a good example of anentity that respects borders but that places humanrights above all. Crimes against humanity must bepunished  and shall be.This new nationalism  while it recognizesborders  asserts that the rights of citizens to liberty andpeace are primary. Hence  the United Nations  even asit respects national borders  needs to recognize that itcan and should become proactive in the protection ofthose rights in the case of civil conflict. So too  thegreat global threat of AIDS and other infectiousdiseases demands a response from each nation and arecognition that these threats can never be adequatelydealt with alone  but only by working globally throughthe United Nations. In short  we need not only theUnited Nations  but  as many have said  we need unitednations.19I began this speech with the image of my great-grandmother looking down at the stony ground of hercountry. I would end it  symbolically at least  withanother image: our image. Someday  our great-grandchildren may discover our image  perhaps evenour image here in this place. Perhaps they willreproduce it through a technology so strange  soremarkable  we cannot even imagine it. But let us hopethat they live in the brave new world I have spoken oftoday. And let us hope that they see us as an image ofpositive change. We who have lived through suchchange cannot turn away from it. With our feet on theground of this great globe of ours  we need to lookforward. We need to grasp change. We need to reachout."
"5",184,"ARE",55,2000,"I have the honour to convey to you  on behalfof the United Arab Emirates  our sincerecongratulations and regards on your election to thepresidency of the fifty-fifth session of the GeneralAssembly. We are confident that your experience ininternational affairs will contribute to the success ofthis session's proceedings. We also thank yourpredecessor  His Excellency the Minister for ForeignAffairs of Namibia  for the efficient manner in which16he directed the work of the previous session. I wouldalso like to express our appreciation to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his prudent leadership and forthe efforts he exerts to strengthen the role of the UnitedNations in maintaining peace  security and stability inthe world.The convening of the Millennium Summit a fewdays ago in this world forum was a clear embodimentof the political will of the leaders of the world to dealeffectively with the problems and challenges that facethe international community  such as the proliferationof proscribed weapons  armed conflicts and increasingpoverty and debt  as well as other attendanttransnational issues  such as drugs  organized crime international terrorism  environmental pollution persistent violations of human rights and the disparitiesresulting from globalization and informationtechnology.The consequences of these prevailing conditionshave  more than ever before  reinforced our awarenessof the importance of adhering to the principlesembodied in the Charter of the United Nations and ofconsolidating the rule of international law through thepeaceful settlement of disputes  respect for theprinciple of equality and the right to self-determination  as well as of strengthening the spirit ofcooperation and tolerance among the different cultures beliefs and legacies of the various civilizations  forachieving the desired security  stability and humandevelopment.The United Arab Emirates reiterates its welcomeof the border treaties concluded between the Kingdomof Saudi Arabia and both the State of Kuwait and theRepublic of Yemen  as an important political andhistoric event that will promote confidence-buildingmeasures and good neighbourly relations. At the sametime  we call upon the Islamic Republic of Iran tofollow the example of those fraternal States and torespond to our peaceful initiatives that call for eitherentering into direct and serious bilateral negotiationsaimed at finding a peaceful solution for ending Iran'soccupation of our three islands Greater Tunb  LesserTunb and Abu Musa  or agreeing to submit the disputeto the International Court of Justice.In this context  we would like to reaffirm that allactions and measures taken unilaterally by the IslamicRepublic of Iran on those three islands and itscontinued construction of military and civilianinstallations on them  are illegal measures considerednull and void  and do not establish or entail any legalrights  regardless of the duration of the occupation. Infact  they represent a violation of the territorialsovereignty of the United Arab Emirates andcontravene the principles and purposes of the Chartersof both the United Nations and the Organization of theIslamic Conference  as well as declared Iranianpeaceful intentions in the region.More than a year has elapsed since the GulfCooperation Council entrusted a tripartite MinisterialCommittee  composed of the Kingdom of SaudiArabia  the Sultanate of Oman and the State of Qatar with developing a mechanism for direct negotiationsbetween the United Arab Emirates and the IslamicRepublic of Iran. Iran has not yet responded to any ofthe endeavours of that Committee  thus preventing thereinforcement of the foundations of peace and securityin the Arab Gulf region.Despite the fact that almost ten years haveelapsed since the end of the second Gulf War  the ArabGulf region is still experiencing the negative effects ofthat War. Consequently  it is imperative that politicaland diplomatic efforts continue in order to find apeaceful solution that would lead to ending the humansuffering of the Iraqi people. At the same time  weinvite the Iraqi Government to cooperate by completelyfulfilling its obligations  particularly those relating tothe release of Kuwaiti and other countries' prisoners ofwar or detainees and to the restitution of Kuwaitiproperty  in implementation of the resolutions of theSecurity Council. In this regard  we would like tounderline the importance of respecting the nationalsovereignty  territorial integrity and politicalindependence of both Iraq and Kuwait  as well asrefraining from the threat or use of force  in order toensure the entrenchment of security and stability in theregion.The Middle East peace process recently witnessedimportant developments during which major effortswere exerted with the objective of arriving at equitableand fair solutions based on the resolutions ofinternational legitimacy and the principle of land forpeace. Yet  despite all those efforts and all the flexibleand constructive proposals put forward by thePalestinian side for finding a comprehensive and justsolution to the Palestine issue in all its aspects  theIsraeli Government persisted in its positions ofprocrastination  delay and stalling  and in failing to17abide by the agreements it had concluded with thePalestinian side.Thus  in affirming our position of solidarity withthe fraternal Palestinian people and their leadership represented by the Palestinian Authority  we renew ourcall to the co-sponsors of the peace process — inparticular the United States of America — and theother active States to continue exerting political anddiplomatic efforts that support and promotenegotiations between the Palestinian and Israeli sides with the aim of finding a just and comprehensivesettlement of the Palestine issue. In particular thissettlement should resolve the issues of Al-Quds Al-Sharif and the refugees  on the basis of SecurityCouncil resolutions  especially resolutions 242 (1967)and 338 (1973). This should enable the Palestinianpeople to exercise their legitimate and inalienablerights to return to their homeland and to establish theirown independent State  with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as itscapital.Also in this context we reaffirm our unceasingsupport of the position of sisterly Syria in its efforts toregain its Golan territory up to the line of 4 June 1967.We call on the international community to demand thatIsrael resume negotiations on the Syrian track on thebasis of relevant United Nations resolutions  in theinterest of attaining peace  stability and growth for allthe States and peoples of the region.The United Arab Emirates  in welcoming onceagain fraternal Lebanon's regaining of its territory expresses support for Lebanon's efforts to complete theextension of its sovereignty over all of its national soil.In the same vein  we support the demands ofsisterly Libya that the economic sanctions imposed onit be lifted  particularly since it has implementedrelevant Security Council resolutions.We also express our satisfaction at the outcome ofthe recent Somali reconciliation conference in Djiboutiand invite all Somali factions to reinforce nationalunity for the sake of restoring peace  stability andsustainable development to Somalia and the rest of theregion of the Horn of Africa.The growing number of problems resulting fromthe continuation of wars  disputes and ethnic cleansingin some parts of the African continent  the Balkans South Asia  Afghanistan and other places is a source ofconstant concern for the international community.Consequently  we support all regional and internationalefforts aimed at dealing with these issues by peacefulmeans  and we emphasize that just and lastingresolution of these issues cannot be attained until theparties concerned demonstrate the necessary politicalwill to achieve national reconciliation and demonstratetheir commitment to implement relevant SecurityCouncil resolutions.Despite international unanimity  shown in theDisarmament Conference and other internationalforums  regarding the need to limit the spread ofweapons of mass destruction  particularly nuclearweapons  progress in this field remains slow  which is amatter of concern to us. We are particularly concernedat this time as some States are striving to outdo eachother in stockpiling certain classes of these weapons  inparticular nuclear arms and ballistic missiles  as ameans of settling their territorial disputes. Since suchactions escalate conflicts and disrupt the strategicsecurity balance  at both the regional and internationallevels  we call upon the States concerned to reviewtheir policies in this respect and to promote theestablishment of zones that are free of weapons of massdestruction  including nuclear weapons  especially inthe Middle East  the Arab Gulf and the Indian Ocean.We also urge the international community to demandonce again that the Israeli Government accede to theTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weaponsand agree to subject its nuclear facilities toInternational Atomic Energy Agency safeguards.Despite the multidimensional changes that theworld economy is witnessing as a result of thederegulation of markets  globalization and moderntechnology  the economic and social gap between thedeveloped and developing States still exists and isgrowing — thereby exacerbating poverty andunemployment  environmental degradation and debtaccumulation. Thus  the convening of the MillenniumSummit and the Summit's Declaration highlight thegreat importance our countries attach to these issues.This makes it incumbent on all of us to workassiduously on carrying out the commitments andundertakings contained therein regarding the creationof an environment favourable to development elimination of poverty and free access for the exportsof the least developed countries to the markets ofindustrialized countries. I confirm the determination ofthe United Arab Emirates to support this plan and to18work towards narrowing the gap between the rich andthe poor.The United Arab Emirates continues its sustainedefforts in support of economic- and social-developmentprojects in many countries of the world  particularly inAfrica and Asia  be it through direct participation infinancing such projects or by supporting internationaland regional efforts to attain those goals.Finally  the ever-increasing burden of economic social and human development  which is the firstsafeguard of the political stability that we desire demands that mechanisms for regional andinternational cooperation  foremost among which is theUnited Nations  be created. Hence  we call forcontinued efforts to carry out the structural reform anddevelopment of the world Organization  in particularthe Security Council and the General Assembly  so thatthe Organization can keep pace with the rapid changesin international relations."
"6",231,"ARG",55,2000,"Inthis  my first statement  allow me to congratulate Mr.Holkeri on his election to the presidency of the GeneralAssembly. I believe that this is a timely opportunity toemphasize the great friendship that unites theArgentine Republic and Finland.I also express my gratitude to Mr. Theo-BenGurirab of Namibia  another country that is a friend toArgentina  for the constructive way in which hepresided over the Assembly's work at the last session.We also offer a cordial welcome to Tuvalu uponits entry into the United Nations and extend ourfriendship and cooperation to its people.This debate is taking place after a very productiveexchange of opinions at the highest level during theMillennium Summit  which we hope will mark together with the final Declaration  the beginning of anew era leading to a more equitable world and a moreeffective Organization  in accordance with objectivesset out by the Secretary-General in his report entitled“We the peoples”. For my country  this is also anopportunity to set out before the General Assembly theprinciples and objectives of our foreign policy.The Government of President Fernando de laRúa  who took office on 10 December 1999  hasdrafted a foreign policy on the basis of the mandate itreceived from the Argentine people. This policy aimsat strengthening our integration with neighbouringcountries  intensifying the hemispheric dialogue andpromoting economic development  social progress  freetrade and a ban on weapons of mass destruction.Argentina is determined to participate on theinternational scene jointly to build a peaceful andstable world based on the values of representativedemocracy  the rule of law  the protection andpromotion of human rights  respect for theenvironment  economic liberalization  social progress international cooperation and the maintenance ofinternational peace and security  pursuant to thepurposes and principles of the Charter. Today  as wasstated at the Millennium Summit  these aspirations areshared by the vast majority of Members of thisOrganization.On the basis of its ongoing interests  theGovernment has set as a priority objective its politicaland economic integration with the other Statesmembers of the Southern Common Market(MERCOSUR) — Brazil  Paraguay and Uruguay —and associate members Chile and Bolivia. We haveagreed with these countries to consolidateMERCOSUR by adopting the measures necessary topromote greater integration on the basis of balance andequity. We have made significant progress towards theexpansion of our markets since the signing of theTreaty of Asuncin in 1991. This was the fruit of thedetermination of the member countries to implement anopen trade policy in their economic programmes.25The creation of MERCOSUR was a politicaldecision transcending the economic sphere.MERCOSUR provides a political forum within whichtrust  cooperation and the pursuit of full integration inall areas foster the increasing complementarity andconvergence of our interests. Bolivia and Chile havebound themselves to MERCOSUR as associatemembers in the context of the Free Trade Area and wetrust that they will become full members in the nearfuture.As a consequence of the broadening political andeconomic dimensions of our integration project  we arealso witnessing the convergence of approaches todefence and security in our region. This contributes toa continental perspective based on confidence andcooperation. We and our neighbours have madeprogress towards the creation of the jointMERCOSUR  Bolivian and Chilean zone of peace.Argentina is part of a nuclear-free Latin Americareflecting the peaceful and cooperative securitynecessary to harmonious development.At the same time  as a member of the Rio Group which has now grown to include Costa Rica  theDominican Republic  El Salvador  Guatemala Honduras and Nicaragua  Argentina has pursued itshigh-level political consultations and cooperation inorder to maintain peace  strengthen representativedemocracy and promote sustainable development in theregion. It is our firm intention that our countries shallenjoy greater participation in the global economy. Atthe recent summit convened in Brasilia tocommemorate the 500th anniversary of the discoveryof Brazil  the Presidents of all the South Americancountries reaffirmed the spirit of understanding andharmony that marks its relations on the basis of theseprinciples and objectives.The consolidation of democratic stability in LatinAmerica continues to be a central policy of theArgentine Government. We do not interfere in thedomestic affairs of others and we respect internationallaw. We promote the consolidation of democraticprocesses on the basis of our deep conviction that free regular and transparent elections and a plurality ofpolitical parties are essential instruments for affirmingand guaranteeing the institutional nature of democracy.My country also reaffirms its commitment toeradicating poverty  inequity and social exclusion andto ensuring equal opportunity throughout the region.We shall continue to pursue our joint action in theregional and global campaign against drug trafficking terrorism  corruption  the illegal trade in arms andorganized crime.The Argentine Republic has a natural interest inthe South Atlantic that is reflected in our participationin the zone of peace and cooperation of the SouthAtlantic  comprised of 21 African and three LatinAmerican countries. At the fifth ministerial meetingheld in Buenos Aires in October 1998  a plan of actionwas adopted to implement our shared objectives in thepeaceful settlement of disputes  economic cooperation development  the conservation of fishery resources  thefight against drug trafficking and the protection of theenvironment.My country is in favour of free trade in order toachieve development and the eradication of poverty.The Argentine Government believes that protectionismnot only generates the deflection of trade and theclosure of markets  but also constitutes a form ofdiscrimination. Argentina urges the entire internationalcommunity to commit itself seriously to eliminatingdistortions of trade and will continue to fight for theseobjectives. In this regard  we believe that progress isbeing made in negotiations on the free trade agreementof the Americas to create a hemispheric free trade areaby the year 2005.In the World Trade Organization  our country hasprovided new impetus to the efforts to launch a newround to broaden trade liberalization  particularly inagriculture.Argentina also continues to support negotiationsto develop political and economic association betweenMERCOSUR and the European Union  including  inthis framework  the gradual liberalization ofagricultural trade and services.We are constantly seeking new ways to integrateourselves with the world. The realities of technologicalchange and continual innovation require developingcountries to adapt to a scheme of internationaleconomic integration based on a new paradigm ofproduction. The challenge is to ensure the access of theleast developed countries to this process of constanttechnological change and innovation. There can be nodoubt that the international community — in particularthe United Nations — must cooperate to promote thetransfer of technology from developed to developingcountries with sufficient flexibility and breadth so that26technological innovations reach those countries withfewer resources.In his report “We the peoples”  the SecretaryGeneral quite rightly attaches great importance to thistask. Without the adequate dissemination of and accessto the new technologies of the digital revolution  wewill see the gap between rich and poor widen.Individual States and the international community as awhole must therefore find solutions that guaranteegreater fairness in the use of digital information.Argentina remains fully committed to theinternational community's efforts to protect theenvironment from the negative impact of humanactivities. In this regard we reaffirm our commitment tothe principles of sustainable development agreed uponin 1992 at the United Nations Conference onEnvironment and Development — principles that werereflected in the Rio Declaration on the environmentand in Agenda 21. Equally  we would like to stress theimportance of making adequate preparation — duringthis very fifty-fifth General Assembly — for theconference to be held in 2002 to review theimplementation of Agenda 21.Moreover  we feel it is necessary to consolidatethe international legal regimes in the field ofenvironmental protection. In this context  and bearingin mind the devastating consequences of atmosphericwarming on the global ecosystem and on human life we attach special importance to the entry into force  assoon as possible  of the Kyoto Protocol to theFramework Convention on Climate Change.The twenty-first century was preceded by aprolonged strategic and ideological confrontation which has given way to a moment in history in whichrepresentative democracy  human rights and openeconomies are shared values. At the same time  we arefacing a more complex world that has yet to engender astable international order. The explosion of seriousintra-State conflicts — as we have seen in the Balkansor in Africa — are signs of the emergence of a newstage in conflicts — a stage in which  regrettably conflicts are based on ethnic  cultural and religiousdifferences.The Republic of Argentina aspires to contributeto achieving multilateral consensus aimed at reducingand neutralizing risks to peace and at facilitating thedevelopment of nations. We believe that if thisconsensus were based on greater democratization ininternational relations this would increase the efficacyand the functioning of the international system.Since it is impossible for individual States to facethese threats alone  it is necessary to adopt cooperativesecurity policies to eliminate the potential risk ofconflicts and to strengthen the stability and security oflegal regimes. It is essential that we face in a unitedfashion the immediate and underlying causes ofconflicts  which often arise because of the lack ofeconomic opportunities and because of socialinequalities.The Members of the United Nations face thechallenge of finding a response to questions raised byrecent international crises  including the internationalhumanitarian crises. My country believes that theprinciple of non-intervention must be duly respectedbecause it is the pillar underpinning relations betweenindependent States. At the same time  we cannotconceal our concern at the explosion of violenceagainst ethnic  racial or religious minorities.In particular we are concerned about the situationof vulnerable groups  such as refugees and internallydisplaced persons  and about the situation of childrenin armed conflicts. Consequently we believe that theinternational community cannot remain indifferent andmust provide an adequate response to humanitariancrises.We must emphasize the role that can be played byinternational tribunals to create awareness thatimpunity will not be tolerated. The InternationalCriminal Court and the tribunals for Rwanda  theformer Yugoslavia and Sierra Leone  which have beencreated  constitute important instruments of deterrence.In addition to the internal reforms that theSecretary-General has initiated with singular successwithin his sphere of competence  the United Nationsmust give priority to more democratic consensusbuilding in the decision-making processes of the mainand subsidiary organs of the system. This needs to bedone in a fashion that does not hamper the speed andeffectively with which solutions are found to the dailyproblems facing the Organization.Maintenance of international peace and securityis a primary responsibility of the Security Council which must be strengthened. If these responsibilitiesare not fully shouldered  no other activity of the United27Nations can be carried out with any certainty ofsuccess.Since the inception of multilateral diplomacy Argentina has defended the principle of the sovereignequality of States. It is therefore not surprising that ourcountry maintains that the reform of the SecurityCouncil must be arrived at via consensus  and thisconsensus must not entail new discrimination privileges or exclusions.The vast majority of the internationalcommunity — seeking to ensure respect for the valuesof democracy and universality — believes that a newSecurity Council will have to allow for greaterparticipation by all. This cannot be achieved if newpermanent seats — like those established in 1945 —are established. Reform of the Council must allow allStates a greater opportunity to participate in theCouncil  which must not be monopolized by only a fewcountries. For this reason  Argentina supportsexclusively an increase in the number of nonpermanent members and the introduction of restrictionson the right of the veto  without losing sight of theultimate objective of eliminating it altogether. Wesupport the adoption of rules of procedure thatguarantee transparency and the possibility of theparticipation of all Member States in this organ.Our support for the peaceful settlement ofdisputes continues to be a fundamental feature of ourforeign policy. President de la Rúa reiterated theArgentine commitment to continue participating inpeacekeeping operations established by the SecurityCouncil. The most recent conflicts have shown howimportant efficient training of the forces participatingin these missions is. Experience acquired by Argentinain 42 years of participating in these missions isreflected in the creation of the joint Argentine centrefor training for peacekeeping operations. It has beenoperating since 1995  with the participation ofpersonnel from other Member States. We alsoestablished the centre for training of security forces forforeign missions. Argentina  which is currentlyinvolved in nine peacekeeping operations  places at thedisposal of the United Nations its military and policetraining centres. We also support the initiatives tostrengthen the rapid deployment capacity of theOrganization  and we would support restructuringefforts aimed at optimizing the planning and supportfor peacekeeping operations both at Headquarters andin the field.My country was pleased to receive theconclusions and recommendations recently issued bythe Panel on United Nations Peace Operations andcontained in the Brahimi report. These provide avaluable basis for building international consensusaimed at strengthening the capacity of the Organizationto prevent conflicts and to maintain and re-establishpeace. Argentina  which is part of the Bureau of theSpecial Committee for Peacekeeping Operations supports the conducting  as soon as possible  of adetailed analysis of the recommendations contained inthe Brahimi report — including its possible financialimplications — with a view to achieving its earlyimplementation.My Government is particularly concerned aboutthe problems related to the security and protection ofthose who participate in peacekeeping operations andhumanitarian missions. The personnel of the UnitedNations and associated personnel  as well as thepersonnel of other agencies that provide humanitarianassistance  are facing increasingly risks situations  aswe have seen recently in the tragic events that haveoccurred around the world. Consequently  Argentina which is a party to the 1994 Convention on the Safetyof United Nations and Associated Personnel  has urgedan improvement in the security situation of UnitedNations personnel via the adoption of practical andlegal measures  including financial-planning andimplementation measures for these operations.In this context we should also reiterate the duty ofthe international community to provide assistance tothose countries facing emergency situations  whicharise as a result either of natural disasters or of armedconflicts. In this area a significant role can be playedby the “White Helmets” initiative  which involves theestablishment of bodies of specialized volunteersorganized by the Members of the United Nations toprovide humanitarian assistance to peoples who arevictims of extreme emergencies and also to mitigate theserious problems that affect these people.We should also mention the issue of AIDS whichparticularly affects the poorest areas of the world.More than 34 million people suffer from this illnesstoday. The virus has spread dramatically. In particular more than two thirds of the victims are in sub-SaharanAfrica. This pandemic is aggravating poverty. Theillness and death of so many workers is drainingalready weakened economies. The impact of thisphenomenon on the future of the affected regions will28probably mean greater marginalization and willundermine the foundations of stability  security andpeace. The international community and thisOrganization and its specialized agencies mustcontribute urgently all available resources to the fightagainst this disease.I would like to refer in particular to thesovereignty dispute between my country and theUnited Kingdom regarding the Malvinas  SouthGeorgia and South Sandwich Islands as well as thesurrounding seas.The recovery of the full exercise of sovereigntyover this part of our national territory  respecting theinterests of the inhabitants and international law  is aprecept enshrined in the Constitution of Argentina.This item is on the agenda of the Organization  whichin numerous resolutions has requested theGovernments of Argentina and the United Kingdom torenew negotiations to find a just and definitive solutionto the sovereignty controversy  thus putting an end to acolonial situation imposed by force in 1833.Today  in accordance with that request  Argentinareiterates once again its complete willingness to renewbilateral negotiations with the United Kingdom toresolve this question. We reiterate our support for themission of good offices with which the GeneralAssembly charged the Secretary-General to assist theparties in achieving this objective.The world stage in the post-cold-war era is thescene of ethnic conflicts  civil wars  massive violationsof human rights and fundamental freedoms  illegaltraffic in arms and other threats. At the same  time weare seeing the unprecedented spread of representativedemocracy and economic and technologicalmodernization.Against this backdrop  our main task is to reachagreements that will enable us to face these challengesand seize these opportunities in the best way possible.Equipping the United Nations for the challengesof the new millennium is the great task awaiting us. AllMember States must undertake to fulfil thiscommitment if our efforts are to be crowned withsuccess. Argentina is committed to this task and willcontinue making its contribution.On 31 December next  my country will end itsterm as a member of the Security Council. During itstwo-year term  Argentina has done its utmost tocontribute constructively to decision-making andconsensus-building on all items on the Council'sagenda.On the basis of our potential and bearing in mindthe features of the current international situation Argentina intends  in the twenty-first century  tocontinue to play an active part in the consolidation ofpeace and international security and in the developmentof peoples."
"7",256,"ARM",55,2000,"Allow me to join mycolleagues in congratulating you  Sir  on your electionto the presidency of the General Assembly. I amconfident that this fifty-fifth session will be mosteffective and successful under your guidance. I wouldalso like to express our appreciation to yourpredecessor  Mr. Gurirab  for his skilful leadership  andI welcome Tuvalu to the United Nations as a newMember.Here in this great city just two weeks ago  anunprecedented number of heads of State gathered andoutlined the challenges facing the world in the newmillennium  together with their nations' achievementsand their visions for the future. It is true that themyriad views expressed differed in perspective  focus attitude and outlook  but it is also true that the leadersof the world left the Summit having renewed theircommon commitment to universal values andprinciples and to a more peaceful and prosperousworld. All these were clearly reflected in the Secretary-General's report and the Millennium Declaration which provide us with a blueprint for a commonagenda in the years to come.This is a global agenda to meet global goals  but as is often said  all politics is local and everythingbegins at home. Therefore  in the final analysis  it iseach individual State that must take up theresponsibility in its own country and region to make adifference that will have a cumulative impact on thequality of the world in which we all live. Armenia iscognizant of its own responsibility and is committed todoing its part to enhance regional peace and securityand to elevate the quality of life of everyone involved.The Secretary-General's millennium reportgroups our global challenges under three bluntheadings: freedom from want  freedom from fear andthe freedom of future generations to sustain their liveson this planet.Globalization is expected to drive economicdevelopment around the world in order to allow futuregenerations to sustain their lives and to make possiblethe kind of economic self-sufficiency we all want forour peoples. The major task of Governments aroundthe world today is the pursuit of sound policies andappropriate structural adjustments to meet thechallenges that globalization presents and to takeadvantage of the opportunities it offers without fallingvictim to the hazards it threatens.At the same time  the revolution incommunication and information technologies hasopened up the global market to new players.Information technology and the Internet have becomethe moving engines for economic growth and  at thesame time  if used appropriately  its great equalizers.They hold the promise of unlimited progress and alloweven small and landlocked countries to take advantageof global access in almost every area of their lives.Armenia is fully cognizant of this and has madeinformation technology development the axis of itseconomic growth. We have already taken concretesteps towards bolstering the development ofinformation technology and telecommunications and together with foreign investors  have begun preliminarywork towards an information technology industrialpark on the outskirts of the capital.At the same time  well aware that Armenia'seducational system must be up to matching this call forinfusing the existing intellectual capacity and talentwith new skills  we will ensure that educationcurriculums include computer literacy and Internetfamiliarity. By 2005  all our schools will havecomputer capabilities with unlimited Internet access.Freedom from want and freedom from fear gohand in hand. Without a free  democratic  open systemat home and peace and security in our neighbourhood it is not possible to achieve economic prosperity.During the nine years since the establishment ofArmenia's independence  we have made great strides inanchoring democratic values  the rule of law andrespect for human rights in our society. This year  withArmenia's membership in the Council of Europe  theseprocesses will become irreversible. The responsibilitiesassociated with membership will strengthen andreinforce all that has been achieved to date.Economic prosperity also hinges on regionalstability. At the same time  long-term peace  securityand prosperity in our region depend on its equitableeconomic development and the development ofmultifaceted economic arrangements among countriesand regional organizations. It is apparent that the newenvironment of coexistence requires new approachesfrom international organizations. Regional andsubregional integration has become politically andeconomically expedient. This is especially true in theCaucasus  which is emerging as a region for competingpolitical and economic interests. We look at oursecurity not only in a bilateral  but also in the broaderregional European context. We are convinced that  inthe long run  our national security must be anchored inregional stability.We are confident that economic cooperation willhelp us transcend political problems and facilitate theresolution of political issues. A stable and democraticCaucasus is a work in progress. Still  the promise ofdemocracy in the region must not shroud the fragilityof the emergent equilibrium. We recognize andwelcome the constructive role that the United Nationsand other international organizations — such as theOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe(OSCE)  the Council of Europe  the Black SeaEconomic Cooperation and the Commonwealth ofIndependent States — can and must play to consolidatethis regional equilibrium. Armenia intends to expandits cooperation within those organizations and moreactively to participate in various regional institutions.These diverse bodies  however  must not  by theuneven or inconsistent application of their principles exacerbate existing regional disparities. Armenia isconfident that the Caucasus is in need of a regionalsystem for stability and security and we stand ready towork towards its formation. We were the first topropose  last year at the OSCE Istanbul Summit  thebeginning of a process towards comprehensive regionalsecurity leading to a stability pact for the region.Armenia has adopted and will abide by its policy ofcomplementarity  conducting relations with allcountries which have political or economic interests inthe Caucasus. This approach has worked quiteeffectively over the past several years and we believethat it has contributed to the reduction of polarizationand tension in the region.However  the region continues to remainadversely affected by the lack of formal relationsbetween Armenia and our neighbour  Turkey. AlthoughArmenia  from day one of its independence  opted forthe normalization of relations and the establishment ofdiplomatic ties  Turkey insisted and continues to insiston certain conditions related to Nagorny Karabakh andthe recognition of the Armenian genocide.Ten days ago at the Summit  from this podiumPresident Kocharian addressed this issue and extendeda hand to our neighbour in order that we might togetherfind a way to live with the truth of the past withoutjeopardizing the promise of the future. Unfortunately Turkey's response indicated that it continues to let thefear of history limit its freedom to act. However  thereis no national history in a vacuum. France andGermany  England and France  the United States andJapan  in order to transcend their histories of conflict war and hatred  had to transcend the past together.Indeed  many nations have founded their spiritual andmoral resurrection on exorcising their guilt  on thesearch for validation through truth  on facing their ownpast squarely. Redemption and reconciliation withouttruth will remain forever elusive.The Millennium Summit Declaration addressed atopic that is very important in relation to Armenians'right to freedom from fear. The MillenniumDeclaration provided for the right to self-determinationof peoples who remain under colonial domination andforeign occupation. In Nagorny Karabakh  there wasboth colonial domination by the Soviets and foreignoccupation by Azerbaijan  which was illegally andunjustly given jurisdiction over the Armenian region in1923. For a people whose compatriots lay just over theborder  but out of reach  such a divisive act and theensuing double layer of subjugation was untenable.During the decades of Soviet rule and then after thecollapse of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  theArmenians of Nagorny Karabakh resorted todemanding their right to self-determination  the refusalof which led to military conflict  refugees and loss oflife.During the last six years  the military phase of theconflict has ceased  and Armenia remains committed toa lasting resolution that will provide for peace andsecurity for Nagorny Karabakh  with a continuousgeographical link with Armenia. We will continue towork intensely with the co-chairs of the Minsk Groupand wish to underscore their contribution tomaintaining the ceasefire regime. With equal fervour we are ready to maintain direct contacts withAzerbaijan in order to search for compromise.However  we think that direct negotiations betweenAzerbaijan and Nagorny Karabakh would be moreproductive  as it is the people of Karabakh who willultimately determine their own destiny and future.12In his report the Secretary-General rightly statedthat today more wars are being fought within Statesthan between them. Yet no attempt is being made toaddress this new challenge in a more effective meaningful and realistic way.Each conflict must ultimately be addressed on itsown terms  and through the actions and theaccommodations of its own peoples and its politicalleaders. What the international community can do isprovide not only the support and the potentialincentives for this process of transformation  but alsothe intellectual  conceptual models for exploringappropriate and suitable arrangements for theresolution of seemingly intractable conflicts. Webelieve that in designing appropriate frameworkswithin which hostile parties can find a commonlanguage  reassurances may be designed in a flexiblemanner which must be specifically geared toaddressing particular types of conflicts. If I may beallowed a truism  we should think along the lines of“form follows function”. The function of the probablesolutions that must emerge  as well as the broad outlineof an eventual peace agreement  must rely  we believe on devices or principles that are tailor-made  highlyspecific and perhaps even unique. Without that kind ofcustomization  we believe that generic  standard-issueformulas will not be well-suited to the resolution of theconflict in which we find ourselves at this momentdeeply involved  and whose long-term outcome is ofgreat concern to us.For us  peace in Nagorny Karabakh represents  ofcourse  the promise of transforming a situation ofhostility and confrontation with our neighbour Azerbaijan  into one of cooperation and mutuallyreinforced security. We would like to think of the daywhen Karabakh is transformed from being a chasmseparating our countries into a bridge built for thebenefit of all the populations concerned.The political document adopted by theMillennium Summit sets the guidelines for thedevelopment of the United Nations in the comingyears. Armenia is confident that this Organization given its outstanding role and track record  has thecapacity to address the new challenges in a mostsatisfactory manner. The vast experience accumulatedover the last five decades can be successfully appliedto secure peace and stability all over the world.However  in response to today's new challengesand new demands  United Nations reforms must becarried through to strengthen this dynamicorganization. With the proposed expansion of theSecurity Council  that strategic body will become morerepresentative  and its decisions will be endowed withgreater authority.May the twenty-first century be the one that seesall nations united in shared goals and collective action."
"8",289,"ATG",55,2000,"Let me first ofall congratulate Mr. Holkeri on his unanimous electionto the mantle of the leadership of the world's foremostinternational body. He is presiding in this  the last yearof the present century  following the profoundcommitments manifested at the Millennium Summit.We look forward in eager anticipation to theimplementation of the Summit pledges  as small Statesare becoming more and more disillusioned with theactual manifestations and the selectivity of the UnitedNations.I should like to offer congratulations to hispredecessor  who  as we know  comes from a recentlyindependent country — a country which had to strugglein order to be entrusted with the management of itsown affairs. In him  we saw a genuine attempt to movetowards some equilibrium in this body. As such  mycountry applauds his efforts  but we are still awaitingthe day when small countries will receive the respectdue to sovereign States.This year we will be making a deliberately shortstatement  in the hope that the Assembly willconcentrate on the myriad of problems with which weare plagued.Small States do not equate with small problems.In reality  the reverse is often the norm  particularlywhen the State in question is still on the periphery —the periphery of the dominant industrial entities. In thecase of my country  peripheral existence emerged in thepost-Colombian era when  along with other Caribbeancountries  we became colonies of exploitation  asopposed to colonies of settlement. Mercantilismdemanded our production of agricultural commodities whether indigo  cotton or sugar cane; it was amonoculture  designed solely and purposely for thebetterment of the mother country  at the expense of thecolonies.6But no doubt the question is being asked as towhy I am raising that issue here. It is precisely becausethe lingering reality is that we are sometimes movedto ask ourselves if we are still victims of the “RobinsonCrusoe” mentality. To be a colony ofexploitation meant that the entity was an area ofunderdevelopment — an underdevelopment whichmeant that we were to remain in that state in perpetuityif we were to fulfil the precise conditions forexploitation.Throughout history  smaller entities have been  asit were  invisible. We do not have small problems. Howcould that be the case when nuclear waste is still beingtrans-shipped through our waters  despite numerousand repeated protests  pleas and entreaties? We have aproblem with the World Trade Organization (WTO) which rules in favour of the interests of multinationalenterprises and the countries benefiting from theoperations of those enterprises. The Windward Islandproducers of bananas were at a total disadvantage  asthey could not afford to pay the cost of adequaterepresentation before the WTO. In 1896  the silver-throated orator  William Jennings Bryan  stood up inCalifornia and asked whether mankind should becrucified upon a cross of gold. Today  we must ask ifWindward Island humanity is to be snuffed out on abed of yellow fruit  thereby sending a ripple effectthroughout the Caribbean  culminating in deprivation degradation  depression and the severest forms ofdehumanization.At the Millennium Summit round table  muchtime was spent talking about globalization  without thefundamental reality of that globalization — so-calledfree trade — being dealt with. In modern history  therehas never been free trade. It has been advocated encouraged and even preached about. John Bright andRichard Cobden have been acclaimed for their “gospelof free trade”  but it has never been a reality. In thenineteenth century  it was propelled by the industrialand maritime countries which stood to benefit from it.In the twentieth century  it has emanated from thedominant States  and the statistics demonstrate that ithas wrought havoc on most of the developing world.This has primarily been the result of selfishnessand the unwillingness to listen to and accept theconcerns of those who suffer most from it. Yes  webenefit from the expanded use of the Internet  thegreater access to education and the ability to travelabroad more frequently. But we have been hurt byextraordinary pressures to control our economicadvancement  whether by the influence ofmultinational enterprises or by maritime activity  whichdeplete our resources and pollute our environment.Instead of our nutritional level improving  the statisticsagain show that poverty has spread  and the sick inpoor countries cannot access the medicines needed toimprove the health of their societies. If we are to haveglobalization  let us recognize its imperfections andaddress them meaningfully. Let us not preach  “do as Isay but not as I do”.Globalization does not have a human face. Wecontinue to hear about the opportunities for thedeveloping countries  but we are still waiting for thebenefits to be made manifest. While we wait  we wouldlike to remind this body that we remain disappointedthat the International Criminal Court will not bedealing with illegal trafficking in narcotics or withillegal trade in arms and terrorism. Let us be heard. Letus be seen. We do not have small problems.At the Millennium Summit  my Prime Minister Lester Bryant Bird  clearly demonstrated how theworld's economic and political agenda is devised anddirected by a few of its most powerful Governments.He stated that Antigua and Barbuda  as well as severalother small countries “have experienced the most blatant disregard forthe rules of international law  rules that have beenspelled out by the General Assembly and upheldby the International Court of Justice.” (A/55/PV.3)The principle now is “might is right”. The PrimeMinister pointed out that all of this is being done by theOrganization for Economic Cooperation andDevelopment (OECD)  which believes that its Stateswill lose capital to other States because of their morecompetitive tax regimes. They have gone further bydubbing tax incentives “harmful tax competition” andlinking it most unfairly with money-launderingactivities  even when there is no evidence for thecharge. My country has voluntarily agreed to contributemore for peacekeeping even with our strappedfinances  as we accept our role as a contributor to thewelfare of the globe. We would likewise hope that thedominant be fair to us.I can go on and on with our difficulties and ourvictimization primarily due to our pusillanimousnature. For the first time in several years we have notelaborated on natural disasters. By now all members of7the United Nations should know of our plight. Wewould however wish to speak on a decolonizationissue.Antigua and Barbuda has followed closely thequestion of Western Sahara  and even though we do nothave an international intelligence system  we arecalling for an implementation of the referendum  as thesignals for renewed violence  if the United Nationsdoes not carry out its pledge  are quite clear. We do notwish to see  once again  the carnage witnessed in EastTimor.The conflict  as it has been underlined throughresolutions of the United Nations  the Organization ofAfrican Unity  and the Movement of Non-AlignedStates  must be resolved through the exercise of theSaharawi people of their right to self-determination.The international community has for decades adoptedthis legal framework as a basis for a just and durablesolution to the conflict. We believe that the referendumcan be organized before next year  and we are callingfor such. We do not wish another situation with theoutbreak of violence.Let me sum up with a few things that Antigua andBarbuda would like to see at the United Nations. Wewould like to press for the end of “selective”multilateralism and move towards the incorporation of“genuine” multilateralism. We desire to have a reformprocess expanded beyond the Secretariat and practisedamong all countries of the Organization. Reformshould not connote expansion  it should meanrestructuring. The principle of rotation on the majordecision-making bodies  particularly the Economic andSocial Council (ECOSOC)  should become a reality.And may I repeat: the principle of rotation shouldbecome a reality. The concept of globalization shouldbe viewed in its entirety  and a study should be done onits effects on developing countries. The gross nationalproduct should not be used as the sole criterion forgraduating a State from concessionary loans  and thevulnerability index  on which Antigua and Barbuda isranked very high  should be taken into consideration.The principle of “the equality of sovereign States”should be used to guard against the marginalization ofStates within the United Nations system. The countriesthat have pledged to contribute 0.7 per cent of theirofficial development assistance (ODA) should carryout their commitment in this regard. There should besome form of equity in regard to geographic groupingswithin the United Nations. While we understand thereasons why the existing groups were created  the timehas come for a more equitable arrangement. Thenations comprising the United Nations should becometruly united.Antigua and Barbuda will continue to fulfil itsobligations to its citizens and to this body. Werecognize the benefits that we accrue from ourinvolvement in this parliament of parliaments. We havebenefited and will continue to benefit from theprogrammes of the various bodies and agencies of thisbody. We are  however  confident that we havecontributed towards global progress  and we remainready to continue our contribution to the UnitedNations."
"9",336,"AUS",55,2000,"I join my colleagues incongratulating the President on his election asPresident of the General Assembly for its fifty-fifthsession and you  Madam Vice-President  on yourelection to your position.I am also delighted to welcome Tuvalu as the189th Member of the United Nations. Australia haslong-standing and very friendly relations with Tuvalu and we have worked closely together as members ofthe South Pacific Forum and the Commonwealth. Weare pleased that Tuvalu is now a Member of the UnitedNations  and look forward to new opportunities to worktogether for the United Nations common goals of peaceand development.We meet today just after the largest number ofheads of State and Government in history gathered forthe Millennium Summit. While the Summit touched onthe multitude of problems facing the world at the startof a new century  a theme common to many speecheswas the need for the United Nations to reform so as tomeet the challenges of the era: the challenges ofsecuring peace  of fighting poverty and of empoweringand liberating oppressed peoples.I want to respond to those calls for reform in myremarks to the Assembly today.Without continuing commitment to reform  theUnited Nations — like any organization — cannotexpect to keep up with rapid change in thecontemporary international environment. In theabsence of change and adaptation  the Organizationwill wither as the nations of the world bypass it infavour of institutions and mechanisms that are morerelevant to their needs.Australians believe that the most fundamentaltask of the Organization — and the very reason for itscreation at the end of the Second World War — is themaintenance of international peace and security. Inrecent years we have seen the United Nations performat both ends of the spectrum of relevance andeffectiveness: at a low point in addressing problems inKosovo and Rwanda  and at a high point in theresolution of the conflict in East Timor.I am a strong advocate of an active role for theUnited Nations in the restoration and preservation ofinternational peace and security  especially in situationswhere there may be imminent danger of humanitariancatastrophe. Appropriate action by the United Nationsin these circumstances does more than perhapsanything else to demonstrate the continuing relevanceof the Organization to an often sceptical internationalpublic.Today I want to focus attention on four aspects ofreform within the United Nations system: reform of theSecurity Council; electoral group reconfiguration;reform of peacekeeping; and reform of the humanrights treaty committee system. It is our view thatprogress in each of these areas must be achieved toenable the United Nations to deliver results and ensureits relevance and effectiveness.Reform and expansion of the Security Council isdriven by two fundamental  interrelated imperatives:the need to restore the representative nature of theCouncil by reconfiguring its composition to reflect thesize and diversity of contemporary United Nationsmembership  and the need to enhance the Council'scredibility  authority and legitimacy.The Australian Government's view has long beenthat expansion in both categories of membership is26needed to restore balance and equity to the compositionof the Council. New permanent seats should beassumed by the under-represented developing regionsof the world. New permanent seats should also beallocated to the major industrialized Powers best ableto contribute to the maintenance of international peaceand security. Equally importantly  other Members ofthe United Nations should be given the opportunity tocontribute directly to the work of the Council throughperiodic participation as elected members. Expansionof the non-permanent membership would enhance therepresentative nature of the Council  enabling it to actgenuinely on behalf of the whole membership.Australia has long voiced concerns about the vetoand continues to argue that there must be limitations onits use. Of course  all permanent members of theCouncil  old and new  must remain accountable fortheir performance  and to this end any newarrangements for the Council should be reviewed after10 or 15 years.Regrettably  discussion on Security Councilreform has failed to reach agreement on a package ofreforms in the six years since the Open-ended WorkingGroup was established. The impasse is disappointing and I hope that this session will give new impetus tothe reform effort. It is clear from statements at theMillennium Summit  and during this debate  that thereis strong support for reform. Renewed commitment andflexibility are needed from all sides.In the recent debate about United Nations reform one key element has largely been missing. I refer to theUnited Nations electoral groups. The electoral groupswere established to ensure that there was fair andequitable representation on United Nations bodies  sothat all Members who wanted to make a contribution toUnited Nations decision-making would have anopportunity to do so. Now that three decades havepassed since the formalization of the present groups  itis time that we focused on their relevance to presentand future geopolitical realities.The current group system reflects the geopoliticsof the 1960s. Since that time  more than 60 nationshave joined the United Nations  leading to significantdisparities between the size of groupings and aninadequate level of representation for some subregions.In addition  the original rationale for the configurationof the electoral groups has eroded  creating dissonancein the way many Member States organize themselvespolitically and electorally.The previous realignment of groups in 1963 was along and difficult process  impelled by significantchanges to the United Nations system after the entry ofmany newly independent States from Africa and Asia. Irecognize that group reconfiguration is no easy matter and accept that change now will be similarly complex.For that very reason  we should delay no longer incommencing a serious debate of these issues. Whilethere are many possible configurations for revisedelectoral groupings  and many sensitivities aroundaltering the status quo  the dramatic global changessince the current system came into force have createdhistorical anomalies that cry out to be redressed.Australia looks forward to working with others toachieve that goal.As part of the Australian Government'scommitment to a strong and relevant United Nations we recently completed a review of the United Nationshuman rights committee system  with the objective ofimproving its effectiveness. The review proceededfrom our Government's commitment to theinternational promotion and protection of human rights and a firm belief that the United Nations has a centralrole to play.Australia has a proud human rights record  andwe take our international rights and obligationsseriously. We are party to both human rights Covenantsand to the four conventions. Within Australia  whichhas a strong civil society  human rights are protected bya range of key civil and political mechanisms including a strong democratic tradition  ourConstitution  an independent judiciary  a free press andwide-ranging anti-discrimination legislation.Internationally  Australia is a strong proponent of theuniversal application of human rights standards and iscommitted to continued support for internationalhuman rights protection.We are concerned that the committees establishedto monitor international compliance with human rightstreaties are beginning to lose credibility andeffectiveness because of the way they operate. It is alsoimportant that the international protection system workefficiently and effectively so that democratic countries such as Australia  which have a proud record ofextending generous humanitarian assistance cancontinue to have the confidence and support of their27own domestic constituencies for such humanitarianprotection.Australia's review found that the committeesneed to adopt a more consistent approach to their roleand understand the pitfalls of simply accepting withoutanalysis the submissions put before them by non-governmental organizations. It is important thatadequate recognition be given to the role and views ofGovernments which are democratically elected andwhich take their treaty commitments and reportingobligations seriously. The committees also need to bemore balanced and strategic about targeting key humanrights offenders and avoid unfairly focusing theircriticism on countries with good human rights records.For some years now Australia  together with anumber of other countries  including Canada  NewZealand and Norway  has been advocating reform ofthe treaty committees. Most recently  the AustralianMission to the United Nations in Geneva hosted ameeting of about 20 countries to discuss treatycommittee reform. The United Nations itself has alsorecognized the need for reform of the treaty committeesystem  and Australia has been fully supportive ofthese international reform efforts.Australia now intends to broaden such efforts byspearheading a high-level diplomatic initiative togarner broad support for reforms to improve thefunctioning of the committees and professionalize theiroperations. Reforms could include the provision ofadequate resources to the human rights treatycommittees  improvements in their working methods standardized rules of procedure when consideringStates' reports and better consultation between thecommittees themselves to coordinate reportingtimetables and to facilitate cooperative work on reformissues.But Australia does not have a monopoly on goodideas  and we want to work closely with UnitedNations officials and with like-minded countries tomake the treaty committee system work moreeffectively for the good of all Member States and forthe protection of human rights.We will therefore be talking widely with others todevelop concrete proposals for reform. We will raisethese issues in the General Assembly  at theCommission on Human Rights and in other appropriatemeetings. We also think that the regular meetings ofStates parties to the six human rights treaties shoulddiscuss reform issues and provide guidance to therespective committees on their working methods.Australia wants to maximize the effectiveness ofthe treaty bodies. We will not shy away from ourresponsibilities  but will press for the reforms that areneeded to make the system work well and achieve itsobjectives. If reform does not occur  the committeesystem will increasingly be ignored and maderedundant. That would be a setback for the cause ofhuman rights.I now turn to the matter of peacekeeping and themaintenance of international security. Australia has along and honourable tradition as a participant in UnitedNations peacekeeping operations  most recently in EastTimor  and I believe that the strength of ourcommitment is reflected in the recent appointment bythe Secretary-General of Australian Major-General TimFord as his Military Adviser. The experience of the1990s has clearly shown that the ability of the UnitedNations to meet an expanding and increasinglycomplex range of peacekeeping demands is understrain. The decade witnessed some important successesin peacekeeping  notably in East Timor  but also somesmaller and frankly rather unheralded operations. Italso saw some tragic failures  the costs of which wereoften measured in human lives.I commend the Secretary-General's commitmentto blunt scrutiny and review of the United Nationsperformance  including the reports on Srebrenica andRwanda. We particularly commend his initiative inconvening the Brahimi Panel on United Nations PeaceOperations. The Brahimi report (A/55/305) is alandmark document  setting out a blueprint formodernizing the United Nations peacekeeping andrelated functions. We must move expeditiously toconsider its recommendations.Let me highlight briefly five points that  inAustralia's view  are among the most significantlessons of recent experiences.First  military intervention must be used only as alast resort. All efforts must be made to find peacefulsolutions. In this context  we welcome the Brahimireport's emphasis on preventive action and peace-building.Secondly  when the United Nations is deployed there must be a peace to keep. There are real dangers insending troops indefinitely into harm's way in the28absence of a clear peace plan and reasonable prospectsof achieving it. Disputing parties must be committed topeace and must be held accountable for their actions.Thirdly  peace operations must have a mandatefrom the Security Council that is appropriate to the jobthey are being asked to do. If the environment ishostile  they must be appropriately equipped and ableto project credible force.Fourthly  deployment must take place quicklyonce a decision is taken by the Security Council.Delays can lead to the further deterioration of asituation and can cost lives. The Brahimi report offers anumber of useful ideas to speed deployment whichmerit careful consideration.Fifthly  United Nations peace operations musthave a clear exit strategy. This is linked in particular tothe clarity of Council mandates: as the Brahimi reportrightly stresses  mandates must be clear  credible andachievable. It is also linked to the efficacy ofaccompanying peace processes and peace-buildingefforts.We welcome the attention given to these issues inthe Brahimi report. We also support the point that theUnited Nations must be given the resources it needs tocarry out the demands that we make of it. There is noquestion that the Department of PeacekeepingOperations needs to be strengthened and reformed.Ultimately  it is our responsibility  as Member States to support a stronger and more effective United Nationspeacekeeping capacity. This includes placing thefinancing of peacekeeping on a surer footing andpaying our assessed contributions in full and on time.I cannot conclude without referring to thequestion of East Timor. When I addressed thisAssembly one year ago East Timor was in the throes ofthe most appalling violence at the hands of a brutal andlawless militia. Since then important progress has beenmade in restoring security and building the foundationsof an independent East Timor. Australia pays tribute tothe men and women of the International Force in EastTimor and of the United Nations TransitionalAdministration in East Timor for their commitmentand  in too many cases  their sacrifice.East Timor faces a long and difficult path topeace and prosperity. Australia is playing a major rolein the territory's reconstruction through the UnitedNations and other organizations  as well as bilaterally.We are committed for the long term to helping the EastTimorese build their emerging nation not only for thebenefit of the East Timorese  but in the interests ofstability and security in our region.Regrettably  the pro-integration militia continueto pose a significant threat to security and stability.Intimidation and violence against Timorese refugeesand humanitarian aid personnel in the camps on theEast-West Timor border must be halted. The killing ofworkers of the Office of the United Nations HighCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) earlier thismonth deserves the world's strongest condemnation.Australia reiterates its call on Indonesia to fulfil itsresponsibility to provide effective security in WestTimor  including by bringing to an end militia activity bringing to justice those responsible for crimes creating the necessary conditions for the return ofUNHCR and resolving the refugee situation. We urgethe Indonesian authorities to take all possible steps inthis direction  including cooperating with the proposedSecurity Council mission.If the United Nations is to remain relevant andcredible  it must work on its strengths and maintain astrong commitment to a continuing programme ofreform and renewal. The challenges that face theOrganization are formidable  but not insurmountable.The need for change is clear and urgent  but I believethat it is not beyond the ingenuity and good will of ourgeneration to emulate our predecessors in grasping thereform nettle.At the Millennium Summit the world's leadershighlighted the need for the United Nations to meet thechallenges of the new century. Let us heed their call and work together with renewed determination andcommitment to make this Organization mo"
"10",383,"AUT",55,2000,"First of all  letme say how satisfied I am about this week's decision ofour 14 European Union (EU) partners to lift themeasures implemented on 31 January against Austria.This is a victory for reason  and it is also a victory forEurope. In the last seven and a half months — a verydifficult time  I must say — the United Nations hasstood by us. Austria treasures this support. The UnitedNations has had confidence in our firm commitment touniversal standards and values. The report of the “threewise men”  Martti Ahtisaari  Marcelino Oreja andJochen Frowein  comes to the same conclusion. Austriawill continue its role as an active  reliable andconstructive Member State of the United Nations.Austria expects to resume fully its formal andinformal work within the European Union. This isabsolutely crucial in view of the important projects thatlie ahead of us: first  the reform of the institutions ofthe European Union and  secondly  the enlargement ofthe Union  a matter of great importance and a historicresponsibility. An enlarged Union will bolsterEuropean stability and prosperity. Its benefits willreach beyond Europe. Austria  as a country in the heartof Europe  will fully support and  in its own interest accelerate the process of enlargement.Since this fifty-fifth session of the GeneralAssembly coincides with the turn of the millennium we ought to undertake a broader examination of today'sworld. We ought to design policies of a long-termnature. All too often we have to cope withcontradictions when engaging in day-to-day politicsand when rapidly responding to crises on the one handand addressing sustainable societal development on theother. A great number of our decisions taken todayhave important implications for future policy options.Generations to come will have to bear the cost  andthey will enjoy the benefits of our policies.It is in this context that I wish to pay tribute tothe Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for hisclairvoyance and leadership. His millennium reportembraces a balanced analysis of the challenges theinternational community faces today  and it offersconcrete  accomplishable and far-sightedrecommendations. Austria welcomes this road map forthe future course of United Nations activities and willfollow its guidelines.Furthermore  Austria supports the timelyinitiative of the Secretary-General to mandate acomprehensive review of peacekeeping operations inall their aspects. Since the environment for complexpeace operations has become more challenging thanever before  Austria  as a major troop contributor welcomes the report and the recommendations drawn17up by a group of experts under the leadership ofMr. Brahimi. We are ready to support theirimplementation.As Chairperson-in-Office of the Organization forSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)  I wish tooutline a number of major achievements of the OSCEduring this year. The OSCE serves as the primaryforum for early warning  conflict prevention  crisismanagement and post-conflict rehabilitation in myregion. This year we are celebrating the twenty-fifthanniversary of the Helsinki Final Act. This trulyhistoric document initiated the Helsinki Process  fromwhich we still draw valid lessons for our commonefforts to achieve “freedom from fear”  to use this vividnotion from the report of the Secretary-General(A/54/2000  para. 65). Security and stability throughcooperation and the effective protection of humanrights within each country have a direct bearing oninternational peace and security. The fundamentalsignificance of democracy  human rights and strongcivil societies has been affirmed in the Charter onEuropean Security adopted by the OSCE participatingStates last year in Istanbul.The OSCE has proved to be a flexible institution adapting itself to the far-reaching changes in thepolitical landscape of Europe after the fall of the IronCurtain. Over the past decade  it has evolved into avibrant organization with a network of as many as 20field operations.Not only in South-Eastern Europe and CentralAsia  on which I will elaborate later  but also in otherparts of the OSCE area  we have been able to achieveconcrete results in our continuing efforts for peace andstability. As to conflict prevention  I would like tomention the successful observation mission of theOSCE at the border between Georgia and the ChechenRepublic of the Russian Federation. We can alsoregister some positive developments concerning thepolitical resolution of “frozen conflicts” in Georgia andin Moldova — conflicts which are often outside thespotlight of broader public attention but neverthelesshave a highly destabilizing impact on the region andbeyond. Through my frequent travels as Chairperson-in-Office  I wish to enhance the political awarenessregarding these unresolved or potential conflicts andsecurity risks. The conflict situation in Chechnyaremains unresolved and a matter of great concern.Let me mention an achievement in theinstitutional field. An important step in enhancing thecivilian crisis management capability of the OSCE wasset with the establishment of the Rapid ExpertAssistance and Cooperation Teams (REACT)  aprogramme which should speed up the deployment ofhighly trained civilian experts to the field.What are the specific challenges the OSCE iscurrently facing in the prevention  settlement andmanagement of conflicts? In South-Eastern Europe thework of the Organization focuses in particular on thestrengthening of democracy  post-crisis rehabilitation the rule of law and civil society. The promotion of freeand fair elections plays a key role in achieving thesegoals. The OSCE is tasked with organizing localelections in Kosovo at the end of October this year and only two weeks thereafter  of general elections inBosnia and Herzegovina. In Kosovo  the OSCE hasbeen involved in the complex task of civil and voterregistration  which resulted in more than 1 millionregistrations. I note with regret that the Kosovo Serbsdid not participate in the registration process and thatBelgrade would not allow the registration of KosovoSerbs in Serbia. The OSCE  however  will continue itsefforts to bring about active participation of theKosovo Serbs in democratic political life. We will notlose sight of our common goal of a pluri-ethnicKosovo.Kosovo is an excellent example of the newquality of the cooperation between the United Nationsand the OSCE as a distinct component within theoverall framework of the United Nations InterimAdministration.A central goal of Austria's chairmanship of theOSCE is to give equal attention to current  and oftenlong-standing  conflicts as well as to potential securityrisks. In the pursuit of this policy  we support theexplicit goal of the OSCE to create a common securityspace. This implies a strong focus on the Caucasusregion and on Central Asia. The OSCE effectivelycontributes to the alleviation of the suffering of thecivilian population in this region  the promotion ofpolitical dialogue between warring parties and themonitoring of post-conflict arrangements throughobserver missions.Conflict prevention is key to the work of theOSCE in Central Asia. During my most recent visit tothe region  I obtained a first-hand impression of its18security problems. In addition to the destabilizingeffects of the precarious situation in Afghanistan  theCentral Asian region faces manifold transnationalthreats  such as terrorism  organized crime  illegal armsand drug trafficking and the degradation of theenvironment  as well as violent extremism andreligious fundamentalism.The OSCE is well placed to support the CentralAsian States in their common efforts to deal effectivelywith these multiple challenges to their security. It actsas a political catalyst supporting the efforts of other specialized international actors. The internationalconference  jointly prepared by the OSCEChairmanship and the United Nations Office for DrugControl and Crime Prevention  on the issues of drugs organized crime and terrorism  to be held in Tashkenton 19 and 20 October is only one example.I cannot but re-emphasize the importance of thehuman dimension in the work of the OSCE. In thecourse of this year we have focused our work on anumber of abhorrent facets of civil unrest  such aschildren in armed conflict  the proliferation of smallarms and the trafficking in human beings  particularlywomen and girls. It is in this context that I would liketo highlight the recent adoption of a comprehensiveAction Plan for Gender Issues  which will guide theOSCE in its commitment to advance equality betweenwomen and men and to protect the human rights ofwomen and girls in the region.If we analyse the profound changes that haveoccurred in the recent past  we note that the individualcitizen has gained in prominence not only as an actor inour democratic societies  with growing responsibilitiesin relation to the social  environmental and economicsustainability of our development  but as a victim ofnew threats to security.It is noteworthy that the United Nations  theGroup of Eight and the OSCE have increasingly movedaction against terrorism  drug abuse and crime to thetop of their agendas. I am pleased to point out that thenegotiations on a Convention against TransnationalOrganized Crime  which were held at United NationsHeadquarters in Vienna over the past two years  led toa successful outcome in the course of this summer. Weare confident that the three additional protocols — ontrafficking in and smuggling of persons as well as ontrafficking in firearms — will be concluded this fall.Austria  in any case  will strive for a rapid entry intoforce and implementation of these important legalinstruments. We are pleased that the United NationsCentre for International Crime Prevention will serve asthe secretariat for the Conference of the Parties. I stressthat my country is ready to join forces with ourpartners in the developing world to counter organizedcrime in all its facets.Thanks to the human development reports of theUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP)  ourunderstanding of development has shifted from macro-economic statistics to a more human-centred concept defining development as a process of broadening thespectrum of choice  both of the individual human beingand of society at large. I am pleased that the HumanDevelopment Report 2000 underlines theinterrelatedness between human development andhuman rights. In short  the Report concludes thathuman development is an essential precondition for therealization of human rights. Human rights  in turn  arean essential prerequisite for comprehensive humandevelopment.If  however  we accept that most challenges tohuman security have a human rights dimension  wemay wish to take a new and more operational look atthe promotion and protection of human rights. How canwe make our human rights regimes more effective inour societies? The Secretary-General has shown us thepath to follow  saying:“it is the poison of ignorance  all too frequently that lies at the heart of human rights violations knowledge provides an antidote”. (Press releaseSG/SM/6829  10 December 1998)Ultimately  it will be citizens themselves who  throughbetter knowledge  become the owners of their humanrights.It is in this context that I would like to point outthe initiative taken by all women Ministers for ForeignAffairs present at the opening of the fifty-fifth sessionof the General Assembly. We jointly launched anappeal to our fellow leaders in order to energize ourcommon fight against the global scourge of HIV/AIDS a scourge which increasingly affects women and girls.Our efforts to counter the HIV/AIDS pandemic must bemultifaceted. They must encompass access to adequatemedical care  drugs and social protection; they mustencompass information and services available to girlsand women to help them understand their sexual andreproductive rights in order to protect themselves from19unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitteddiseases  including HIV/AIDS. This should becombined with the education of young men to respectwomen's self-determination and to share responsibilitywith women in matters of health  sexuality andreproduction.The United Nations Decade for Human RightsEducation  spanning the period 1995-2005  wasunanimously adopted by this Assembly at its forty-ninth session. We have reached its mid-term and mighttherefore wish to give it new momentum. We clearlycame to understand that human rights education andlearning serve as strategies for development on the onehand and as preventive tools for human security on theother.Following an initiative taken by Austria in theframework of the “Human Security Network” ofForeign Ministers  an International Workshop onHuman Security and Human Rights Education wasconvened in Graz  Austria  early this year. Expertsfrom all continents called for human rights educationand learning as a common endeavour of governmental intergovernmental and non-governmental institutions.They concluded that human rights education should gobeyond formal education so as to encompass all formsof learning and different modes of socialization.Innovative human rights education must beparticipatory and operational  creative andempowering. It must address all levels of society. Allcitizens  in particular all persons in positions ofleadership  must regard human rights standards as ayardstick when making decisions.In this context  I applaud the initiatives taken inAfrica  South Asia  Latin America and Europe to havemunicipalities proclaim themselves “Human RightsCities”. I am pleased to announce from this rostrumthat the city of Graz will be the first “Human RightsCity” in Europe.While we affirm the universality of our humanrights  human rights education and learning will haveto be rooted in the rich cultural plurality of the world.In the diversity of learning processes we will bettercomprehend the common humanity we all share.Why  it will be asked  do I raise the issue ofhuman rights education and learning at the GeneralAssembly of the United Nations? It is because I amconvinced that in this strategic triangle with humansecurity and human development  human rights are ofprofoundly political significance for the direction wetake in our development.As the acquisition of any political culture takestime  our efforts must be long-term and comprehensive.At the same time  there is a sense of urgency. This iswhy I appeal to the Assembly to give our efforts in thisarea a new momentum and new energy and direction.Lately civil society has pleaded for more politicalleadership in this field. We should be ready to respondand to develop new structures of partnership with civilsociety and with the institutions already active in thefield at national  regional and international levels.The global house of human rights must be builtevery day. It must be built by everyone and it must beowned by everyone. Only then will it be a house ofprosperity  a house of freedom and a house of peace."
"11",408,"AZE",55,2000,"Mr.President  allow me first of all to congratulate yousincerely on your election to the presidency of the4fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly and toexpress my confidence that under your skilfulleadership the Assembly will cope successfully with allthe issues before it.I would also like to commend the President of theprevious session  Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  on hisremarkable contribution to the success of the fifty-fourth session as well as to the preparations for theMillennium Summit.I would like to take this opportunity tocongratulate a new Member of our Organization Tuvalu  and to wish it a successful start in the work ofthe current session.Two weeks ago  we all witnessed a uniquehistoric event: the Millennium Summit of the UnitedNations  in which about 150 Heads of State orGovernment took part. Remarkable ideas and proposalswere voiced and a Summit Declaration was adopted.The time that we have to fulfil the commitments madeby our leaders at the Millennium Summit has alreadybegun to elapse.The twentieth century is coming to an end.Humankind will recall this century as an epoch ofoutstanding contrasts: scientific-technological andspiritual-intellectual progress  the bloodshed of twoworld wars  the collapse of empires  the emergence ofnew sovereign States  the cold war and collectiveefforts for the sake of peace and stability. What will theworld be like in the approaching century?The end of the confrontation of two systems andthe prevalence of ideas about democracy and the freemarket should contribute to the formation of a world inwhich the interests of all States are taken into accountand a genuine and equal partnership is established.However  an analysis of the development of theinternational environment leads us to the bitterconclusion that stereotypes of rivalry are still alive. Weare living through a very difficult period  when a singlewrong step could destabilize  the situation and tragically  lead to a return to the past. We have a longway to go to build a just and secure world order. It canbe achieved only by the joint efforts of all States  largeand small  rich and poor  developed and developing.The year 2001 has been declared the UnitedNations Year of Dialogue among Civilizations. We areconvinced that we should not let this opportunity slipby  and should use this dialogue to consider togetherthe prospects for resolving the complex problemsfacing humankind.The year 2001 will also stand out because ofanother remarkable event: the special session of theGeneral Assembly to review the outcome of the WorldSummit for Children  which will be held nextSeptember. I believe that I do not need to underline itssignificance. As a member of the Executive Board ofthe United Nations Children's Fund  my country isactively participating in the preparations for thisimportant event.The fact that both of these events are being heldat the juncture of two millenniums is highly symbolicand should contribute to the achievement of aqualitatively new level of interaction among Statesaimed at global progress.Globalization is the main feature of the currentstage of the development of the world economy. It is acomplex and objective process. Countries areconcerned about the prospects of this phenomenon.While opening up new possibilities for developingeconomies  ensuring sustainable development andimproving the welfare of peoples  globalization couldalso have tangible negative consequences for Stateswith economies in transition and for developingcountries.In this regard  I would like to underline that theUnited Nations must make fuller use of its capacities as well as those of its specialized agencies  to assistStates in anticipating and ensuring the early preventionof the possible negative consequences of globalizationand the increasing interdependency of States. TheUnited Nations is called upon to continue to play a keyand effective role in strengthening internationaleconomic cooperation and advising States on all majorissues of global development.Azerbaijan is making its own contribution to thedevelopment of the process of globalization. Located atthe point where Europe and Asia meet  with adiversified economy and rich in natural resources including hydrocarbons  my country serves as aneffective link in the development of East-West andNorth-South cooperation. Azerbaijan is activelyparticipating in projects for the development andtransportation to international markets of thehydrocarbon resources of the Caspian Sea  as well as inthe project to restore the Great Silk Road  all of whichare of global importance.5Azerbaijan  together with a number of the GreatSilk Road countries  is currently working on a newlandmark project  SILKSAT  to provide the countries ofthe Great Silk Road with a global satellitetelecommunications system  in addition to existingcommunication lines. These projects are crucial toenhancing trade and industrial ties among theparticipating countries  developing their economies andmaking them interactive and strengthening theirintegration into the global world economy.However  external threats  internal problems outside pressures and involvement in the struggle forspheres of influence are depriving these young andfragile democracies of the opportunity freely to carryout policies that would respond to the interests andexpectations of their people  to strengthen and improvetheir statehood and to engage in peaceful development.Since their very inception  they have been forced tofight a difficult battle for independence  sovereigntyand territorial integrity.As the victims of aggression  seizure of theirterritory  “ethnic cleansing”  aggressive separatism andterrorism  these States rightly expect the UnitedNations to take the most effective action to create a justand secure world and to protect the principles of theUnited Nations Charter. Unfortunately  the southernCaucasus has become a region where all of theseproblems  threats and risks have their explicitmanifestation.The main destabilizing factor of the situation inthe southern Caucasus has been the aggression ofArmenia against Azerbaijan  which has broughtincalculable tragedy to millions of people. As a resultof the aggression  Armenian armed forces haveoccupied 20 per cent of the territory of Azerbaijan carried out “ethnic cleansing” and ousted 1 millionAzerbaijanis from their homes. In this connection  theUnited Nations Security Council adopted fourresolutions which unequivocally reconfirmed thesovereignty  territorial integrity and inviolability of theborders of the Republic of Azerbaijan  and called forthe immediate and unconditional withdrawal ofArmenian armed forces from all of the occupiedterritories of Azerbaijan. However  from 1993 to date those Security Council resolutions have remained adead letter.Since 1992  the Organization for Security andCooperation in Europe (OSCE) has been engaged inbrokering a settlement of the conflict between Armeniaand Azerbaijan  but its activities have not beensuccessful. Bilateral discussions between the Presidentsof Azerbaijan and Armenia are continuing  but they too  have failed to produce results. The two countrieshave observed a ceasefire for the last six years  but it isnot a solution to the problem.We call on the United Nations to take allnecessary measures to implement the Security Councilresolutions. Peace and security in the region cannot beachieved without a settlement of the conflict betweenArmenia and Azerbaijan  as well as other regionalconflicts  and the removal of external pressure including foreign military presence. Bringing politicalintegrity and neutrality to the southern Caucasus wouldmake possible the establishment of a normalrelationship among the States of the region and ensuretheir harmonious integration into the world economicsystem.We would like to express our gratitude to theorganizations of the United Nations system and todonor countries for their assistance to Azerbaijanirefugees and displaced persons  who have been livingin great distress for over eight years. Of criticalimportance to us is the continuation of and increase inthe humanitarian assistance being provided to themuntil they can return to their homes.The United Nations is the key forum forcoordinating inter-State relations. The need to makesignificant efforts to enhance the Organization'seffectiveness is not in doubt. In recent years  under theleadership of the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  aserious evaluation of the resources and capacities of theUnited Nations  as well as of the Organization'sactivities in the post-cold-war decade  has been made.We had never before heard such self-criticism as thatexpressed in the reports on tragedies in Srebrenica Bosnia and Herzegovina and Rwanda. In this generalcontext  we commend and support the Secretary-General's efforts to reform the United Nations.The United Nations bears great responsibility forthe fate of the world  and we place our hopes in it.Serious and rational reforms should increase theeffectiveness of the Organization and  first andforemost  of the Security Council. Given the Council'sspecial significance  the question of adopting reformdecisions by two thirds of the Member States has been6affirmed by a consensus resolution of the GeneralAssembly. Azerbaijan fully supports such an approach.We also believe that the representation of theStates of Asia  Africa and Latin America in theSecurity Council should be in keeping with modernpolitical realities. We have already expressed  andtoday we reconfirm  our support for the election ofGermany and Japan as permanent members of theSecurity Council. At the same time  I would like topoint out that one additional non-permanent seat shouldbe allocated to the Group of Eastern European Statesbecause of the unprecedented doubling in themembership of the Group. Otherwise  each country ofthe Eastern European Group could only be elected anon-permanent member of the Council once every 38years.We have studied with great interest the Brahimireport on strengthening United Nations peacekeepingcapacities. We would not like the ideas andrecommendations contained in that remarkable reportto remain a dead letter.We also hope that the International CriminalCourt will become an effective organ to bring tojustice  on behalf of the international community  thosewho have committed war crimes  genocide  crimesagainst humanity and the crime of aggression. Shouldthe Court become hostage to the interests of variousgroups of States and to the practice of double standardsrather than being guided by international legal normsequal for all  perpetrators will go unpunished.Azerbaijan is interested in taking an active part incombating international terrorism  organized crime andillegal drug trafficking. The fight against thoseproblems  which are growing in scale  can be effectiveonly with the concerted efforts of all countries at boththe regional and the global levels.In this connection  I would like to draw attentionto a proposal made by the group of States that includesGeorgia  Ukraine  Uzbekistan  Azerbaijan and Moldova(GUUAM) on the establishment of an internationalanti-terrorism centre.Speaking of GUUAM in a wider context  I wouldlike to stress that the meeting of the GUUAM heads ofState during the Millennium Summit could becharacterized as a landmark in the history of the group.The New York memorandum adopted at the meetingconfirms the orientation of the GUUAM States towardsfurther developing mutually beneficial andmultifaceted cooperation in various spheres.There is yet another urgent issue whose resolutioncannot be postponed. I am speaking of the difficultfinancial situation of our Organization that has arisenas a result of delays by Member States in making theircontributions to the regular and peacekeeping budgets.Member States should fulfil their financial obligationsto the Organization in full  on time and without anyconditions.At the same time  our delegation believes that thetime has come to reconsider the current scale ofassessments for both the regular and the peacekeepingbudgets. We are ready to cooperate constructively withother delegations on this matter. We believe that theprinciple of a State's capacity to pay should be thebasis for the future reform of the scale of assessments.Our Organization is designed to play a leadingrole in overcoming obstacles to global peace andprogress. I would like to underscore our collectiveresponsibility for peace and security on our planet  andto express my confidence that the results of theMillennium Summit and the entire fifty-fifth session ofthe General Assembly will become a reliable basis forachieving a more stable and peaceful twenty-firstcentury."

The UnitedNations  and each country in particular  mustimplement the appropriate strategies to translate therecommendations into concrete actions that canimprove the future of our populations and peoples — inparticular the most disadvantaged.At one of the meetings of the MillenniumSummit  which concluded on 8 September 2000  theMinister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation ofBurundi  speaking on behalf of the head of State stated:“The Burundian people are in the process ofturning a page in their history. The agreement on peaceand national reconciliation was signed on 28 August inArusha  Tanzania  before the eyes of the entire world which hailed the occasion. This was a qualitative leap12forward towards a better future for the Burundianpeople.” (A/55/PV.7)Later the Minister said  however:“Everything has not yet been resolved ... thegreatest remaining challenge is ending the war without which the implementation of theagreement is practically impossible.” (ibid.)The end to the war was to have been negotiatedyesterday  20 September  at a meeting scheduled inNairobi between the Government and the rebels  andbefore the heads of State of the region. The Presidentof the Republic himself represented the Government.The heads of State of the region and  of course  themediator were also there. The three political partiesthat had not signed the 28 August peace agreementwere also there  and they signed the agreement. Thusthe maximum number of parties have now acceptedthis agreement.As for the rebels  only one movement  the FNL was represented by its leader. The head of the othermovement — the CNDD-FDD  which is the moreimportant group — did not make the trip. The twomovements refused to negotiate anything or to meetwith the Government delegation. Rather  theycontented themselves with repeating theirpreconditions and pleading that they had to consulttheir rank and file before making any commitments.Thus the meeting was a failure. The hopes of theBurundi people of seeing the violence come to an endwere dashed. The implementation of the peaceagreement has been called into question. Thesignatories to the agreement on peace and nationalreconciliation — negotiated two years ago — are nowaccused of being traitors and men of straw  and arebeing asked to return to the negotiating table. Thosetaking part in the rebel uprising go so far as to call intoquestion the good faith of the leaders who sponsoredthe negotiations and the signing of the peaceagreement.Before denouncing the 28 August peaceagreement  the rebel uprising had hidden itself behind aseries of preconditions for the ceasefire negotiations.The two principal preconditions were as follows.The first precondition was the dismantling of theregroupment camps. This precondition has beenmeaningless since 31 July 2000  because theGovernment had committed itself to dismantling thecamps by that date  and it kept this promise  as theUnited Nations has confirmed on the basis of reportsfrom its agencies working in the field in Burundi. Thefacilitator  Mr. Nelson Mandela  himself publiclyreaffirmed these reports during the signing of the peaceagreement on 28 August.The second precondition related to the release ofpolitical prisoners — an issue that has been the sourceof a great deal of disagreement between the negotiatingparties. But since then  thanks to the compromise thatthe parties have reached  contained in article 15 andpoint 20 of the second protocol to the peace agreement the current Government can create an independentcommission to look into  inter alia  the issues of prisonconditions and political prisoners.That is why it has just asked the Secretary-General to send to Burundi a team of experts incriminal law to inquire freely into the existence or nonexistence of political prisoners in Burundi. It is nolonger possible to deal with this question outside of thepeace agreement unless one wants to imperil the entirepeace process. The Government and the people ofBurundi were very grateful for the opportunity theyhad to explain to the Facilitator during his two visits toBurundi how delicate the problem was.Burundians suffer enormously from war; theywant finally to breathe the air of peace. Deadly  wantonambushes against people travelling on the roads attacks on innocent people in the hills and in thedisplaced persons camps  theft of livestock  destructionof houses  crops  social infrastructure and so on — allof this must stop so that  finally  our country can regainits peace and tranquillity.Setting conditions to halt violence is cruel  andthe international community must condemn thisattitude and those responsible for it. Given theintransigence of the rebels  the Government of Burundicalls upon the region and the international communityto implement the provisions of article 2 of the peaceagreement  which states that if the armed groups of thenon-signatory parties reject the invitation made in theagreement to suspend hostilities and to startnegotiations for a ceasefire  the guarantors of theagreement  particularly the Governments ofneighbouring States  and the internationalorganizations will take “the necessary steps to stop 13demobilize  disarm and  where appropriate  arrest detain and repatriate the members of these armedgroups and  furthermore  take all appropriate stepsagainst any party which encourages and supports suchactivities”.In the absence of a ceasefire not only do theinnocent continue to die  but also the refugees anddisplaced persons cannot return home; assistance torebuild the country cannot begin; and even thetransitional institutions established cannot functionproperly. Why is the international community silentwhen two armed movements are holding hostage anentire people that had pinned so many hopes on thepeace agreement which has now been signed by 19 outof 19 parties — in other words  all of the negotiators?The Government  as it has often repeated  isprepared to negotiate directly with the rebels and toconclude the ceasefire agreement as soon as possible. Itwill also continue to explain the peace agreement to thepeople so that they will support its contents and itsprogramme. It is also continuing consultations in orderto arrive at compromise solutions regarding thereservations expressed by certain parties about theagreement and other questions that are still pending.We would be deluding ourselves if we said thatBurundi will attain peace and security without afavourable environment in the subregion and in Africain general. Unfortunately  nothing leads one yet to hopethat peace will be established in the Great Lakes regionany time soon. The Lusaka agreements signed inAugust 1999 still offer a few glimmers of hope beforeactually entering into force. However  they are animportant basis for the resolution of the conflict in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo. The summit thattook place  again in Lusaka  on 14 and 15 August 2000unfortunately ended in failure  even though it was onemore chance to establish the basis for peace. However a lost opportunity should not discourage us. We wouldlike here to say that we very much support PresidentFrederick Chiluba of the Republic of Zambia for histireless efforts to find a solution to the question of theCongo  and we encourage him to persevere.Contrary to the allegations made by the head ofthe delegation of the Democratic Republic of theCongo from this rostrum on 16 September  I wish toreaffirm that the only interest of my country  Burundi is to maintain security over our borders. We have noother ambitions  political or economic  with regard toany neighbouring country. And we hope that the sameapplies to our neighbouring countries  in particularthose who give refuge to and assist the Burundianrebels.Each country  and the subregion in general  mustfocus on problems of development. The ideology ofgenocide  which is undermining the entire Great Lakesregion  and the many armed rebellions by those whochampion that ideology  will be overcome only throughthe concerted and determined efforts of all States of theGreat Lakes region  with the active support of theinternational community.In this context  the conference on peace  securityand development for the Great Lakes countries envisaged for several years now  can be successful onlyif each country of the region makes a meaningful effortto improve their domestic policies.By holding the Millennium Summit  the UnitedNations chose a very opportune moment to discuss thegreat challenges that await us in the coming century:peace  security and disarmament  on the one hand  anddevelopment and the eradication of poverty  on theother.As is so well summarized by the SecretaryGeneral in his report  we must live free from fear andfree from want. Although these two goals are the veryessence of our Organization  it must be stated that unfortunately  we are still wide of the mark. Fratricidalwars continue to break out in various parts of the worldand it takes too long to put the fires out. Conflictsbreak out on the borders of neighbouring countries  andentire communities are forced into exile. Given themultitude of these conflicts and their complexity  theinternational community has only a mixed record ofsuccess. Like other heads of delegations that havepreceded me  I am inclined to wonder why ourOrganization does not do better in preventing andresolving conflicts and in peacekeeping.On this subject  we very much support theimplementation of the valuable recommendations in theBrahimi report  which was the outcome of an in-depthstudy at the request of Mr. Kofi Annan on the activitiesof the United Nations in the area of peace. We welcomethe steps already taken by the Secretary-General toprepare a detailed plan for the implementation of theserecommendations.14If our Organization were to engage in some selfquestioning  we would probably find that one of theprimary causes for failure lies in the very functioningof the United Nations. The Security Council decides oneverything  and it decides too slowly. In the face ofurgent situations  there is too much procrastination dueto political expediency which is very ofteninsufficiently understood by the internationalcommunity.Over the last fifty years  it is the same peoplewho decide the fate of humanity while safeguarding theinterests of some States as a matter of priority. Peoplewho seek urgent assistance thus have the impressionthat they are being held hostage or are being abandonedto their fate because international solidarity  so keenlyawaited  does not materialize. My delegation therefore  reiterates the hope that we will re-think thefunctioning  composition and attributes of the SecurityCouncil in order to revitalize it and to adapt it to thisongoing state of change.The question of the equitable representation of allregions of the world on the Security Council and thequestion of increasing the number of members  bothpermanent and non-permanent  deserve our attention.They are in tune with the imperatives of democracyand legitimacy in making decisions in this highlyimportant Organization — the United Nations. Onlysuch a reform can restore the confidence of all MemberStates in reviving the force of law in internationalaffairs  because today  weak nations are confronting basically  the law of force.In order to do this the establishment of theInternational Criminal Court  the Statute of which wasadopted in Rome in 1998  will  I am sure  be a usefultool to combat impunity.Although sanctions fall exclusively within thecompetence of the Security Council  from 31 July 1996until January 1999  Burundi lived under a regime ofeconomic sanctions imposed by neighbouringcountries  which was in violation of the United NationsCharter because it was not an initiative of the SecurityCouncil. As has been pointed out  such sanctions haveproved to be both unfair and counterproductive.Because of the adverse effects of these sanctions in theeconomic and social area  those who suffer the mostare innocent people — the elderly  women andchildren. The Security Council should therefore resortto targeted sanctions only in serious and exceptionalcircumstances when other methods of pressure havefailed  in order to avoid causing harm to the entirepopulation.The other major obstacle to world peace is theproliferation of light weapons — paradoxically  in poorcountries. Only with the combined efforts of all Stateswill we be able to deal with this phenomenon  becausearms manufacturers and merchants form a worldwidenetwork that represents big financial interests. Anypeacekeeping programme should therefore include  as amatter of priority  the monitoring of flows of lightarms  since it is such weapons that are used by mostclandestine movements to cause death and destructionthrough terrorism.Furthermore  fear cannot be dispelled from theworld as long as competition to produce weapons ofmass destruction continues. Our Organization shoulddo everything it can to bring about complete globaldenuclearization in the medium term. This standingthreat to humanity undermines all hopes for a world ofpeace  to which the founding fathers of our worldOrganization aspired.Those with the responsibility of governing someof the poorest countries in the world appreciate  on adaily basis  just how hard it is to ensure that peace canprevail in a community that is bereft of food and otherbasic needs. A proverb in our national language Kirundi  says  “If you go to sleep with an emptystomach  you will wake up with a heart full of hatred”.It is no secret that the world has an abundance of richesand resources of all kinds. But that does not preventpeople in some parts of the world from dying of hungeror malnutrition  while their fellow human beings inother parts of the world — and sometimes even in theirown countries and cities — are wallowing in luxury.This means that true cooperation is the kind thatencourages growth in production and income to enablepeople to take control of health  education  nutritionand decent housing. By giving greater assistance to thepoorest countries  the rich countries would be workingnot only for a fairer world but for greater security fortheir own people.The millennium report of the Secretary-General submitted under agenda item 49 (b) of the fifty-fourthsession  rightly stresses the seriousness of the tragedycaused by the HIV/AIDS pandemic throughout theworld  focusing particular attention on Africa. Of the36 million people who are HIV-positive  more than 2315million are in sub-Saharan African. According to thatreport  in the same region  more than one child in tenhas lost its mother to AIDS. The very pessimisticprediction has been made that by 2010 there will be 40million orphans. Burundi has not escaped thisdangerous epidemic  which appeared at the beginningof the 1980s and is continuing to cause devastationtoday  particularly among the most active and therefore  the most productive people.In the meantime  with the assistance of the WorldHealth Organization  the United Nations Children'sFund and other actors  to which we extend our heartfeltthanks  my Government has launched a robustprevention policy against HIV/AIDS. A special fundhas been established to combat this scourge  whichcould decimate entire generations. That is why weendorse the recommendations of the Secretary-Generalto reduce the HIV infection rate  particularly byincreasing access to information  education and healthservices for people who are already infected. At thesame time  we recommend that the pharmaceuticalindustry be provided with all the financial supportnecessary to develop an effective and affordablevaccine to eradicate this scourge by the end of thecentury.Before we can be sure of having built a moresecure and prosperous world  we must be mindful ofthe need to bequeath to our children anenvironmentally balanced planet. Unfortunately  wehave to say that the industrial progress that wassupposed to have generated prosperity is making ournatural environment increasingly unhealthy. We must as a matter of urgency  control the quality of industrialproduction and the phenomenon of population growth particularly in urban areas  if we wish to safeguardquality of life for future generations.We have often behaved as if nature would remainhealthy without our making any effort. Today desertification is a threat to many countries that used tobe covered with vegetation. Drought has invadedregions that used to be crossed by great rivers andstreams. In those places where there is still enoughwater  it takes millions of dollars to treat it to make itpotable.My delegation would like to reiterate theSecretary-General's appeal to all Member States at theMillennium Summit to fund an assessment ofecosystems before it is too late. The result would nodoubt be a clear  realistic programme to protect ourenvironment.Despite the difficult situation in which we havebeen living for several years  Burundi  in closecooperation with other Member States  will worksteadfastly to achieve the goals pursued by ourOrganization. We hope that the United Nations willadapt to current challenges and to changinginternational relations for the benefit of all humankind."
"13",501,"BEL",55,2000,"Mr. President  I should first of all like to congratulateyou on your election to the Presidency of the fifty-fifthsession of the General Assembly. I wish you everysuccess in this task which is both difficult andinspiring.Allow me to include in this tribute the Secretary-General who has a crucial role in promotinginternational cooperation for peace  security  justiceand development in the world.I fully associate myself with the speech made bymy French colleague  Mr. Hubert Vedrine  on behalf ofthe European Union. His declaration covered quitebroadly European concerns regarding different regionsof the world and the crises they continue to experience.Like my European colleagues  I will confine myself torepeating the encouragements of the European Unionfor the Israelis and Palestinians to seize this historicopportunity now within their reach to conclude aframework agreement in the coming weeks.The new century is a blank page. It depends on usand on our Organization to provide the appropriateanswers to the challenges inherited from the pastcentury. The Heads of State and Government whogathered here for the Millennium Summit set forth theobjectives that will mobilize our energy for the comingyears. I will only mention three of our highestpriorities. First  world peace. This is the primaryresponsibility of the Security Council. It is thereforeessential to bring the ongoing reforms to a successfulconclusion and to improve the Council's legitimacy aswell as its representative character. To adapt theSecurity Council to the evolution of the world is theprimary condition for its ability to respond to ourexpectations. Belgium coordinates a group of ten smalland medium-sized countries in the quest forconstructive compromise formulas. Regarding theenlargement of the Security Council  the creation of tennew seats  five permanent and five non-permanent with an equitable geographical distribution  seems to usto be a path worth exploring. As for the right of veto we have put forward a number of concrete andmoderate proposals seeking a voluntary and partiallimitation to the right of veto. Such a reform  abalanced one along these lines and responding to thewishes of most Member States can  and should makesignificant progress in the months to come.Secondly  the elimination of poverty andattainment of sustainable development. Theglobalization of the economy must proceed hand inhand with job creation and economic take-off in thepoorest regions as well as with universally recognizedsocial and environmental norms. There is no moredenying that great inequalities  differences indevelopment  the lack of good governance anddisregard for human rights are factors which createinstability  both within States and among States in theirinternational relations.Thirdly  the defence and promotion of democracyand human rights. For us this requires equalparticipation of men and women in public life anddecision-making  as well as the fight against all formsof racism  intolerance  discrimination and xenophobia.8Serious violations of human rights and universal valuesmust therefore never be allowed to go unpunished.This also implies a permanent quest for theconditions  modalities and terms that underlie commonhuman values. Democracy  and on this at least weshould all agree  is much more than a statement offact regarding an established balance of power or anarithmetic majority. It is a political morality thatincludes loyal electoral behaviour. It is respect for  andencouragement of the open expression of differingpoints of view. It is a frame of mind based on a loftyand optimistic conception of the human being.I say this because  even at home in our oldEuropean democracies which one would consider safeand sheltered  we see reappearing the vile spectre ofrejection of differences  exclusion and xenophobic orslanderous prejudice.European parties are again raising and exaltingwhat is most sordid and most barbarous in humannature. Saying nothing or resigning oneself to this factis tantamount to trivializing the phenomenon andtrivialization means corruption of the spirit.I say this also because we must recognize that ourpolitical systems  in theory well equipped to withstandsuch assaults  unfortunately tend all too often to give into the temptation to minimalize them under thespecious invocation of so-called higher demands ofrealpolitik.It is not my purpose here to allege some moralsuperiority but simply to remind ourselves that historyalways exacts a price when one refuses to learn fromits lessons.Belgium has participated over the past decade innumerous peacekeeping operations under the auspicesof the United Nations  among others in Somalia Rwanda and in the Balkans.Reviewing these experiences  the Belgian Senateissued a detailed report in December 1997 containingrecommendations that prefigure  to some extent  therecommendations contained in the Brahimi report. Iwill point out a few aspects on which there is completeconvergence between the two reports.First  United Nations forces must be prepared toconfront the worst case scenario. The Blue Helmetsmust be trained  equipped and commanded for such aneventuality.Secondly  these forces must have at their disposalall relevant information  as well as the capacity toanalyse such information in terms of strategy andtactics  so they must be able to rely on an effectiveintelligence capability.Thirdly  troop-contributing countries must beclosely involved in the preparation of the mandates andin the management of operations. The Assembly willnot be surprised to hear me plead for therecommendations formulated in the Brahimi report toreceive wide support of all Member States. I hope thatall actors concerned  the Member States  the SecurityCouncil and the Secretariat  prove theirdetermination and their will to extend reforms to alllevels and bodies of the Organization. I pledge the fullsupport of the Belgian Government to DeputySecretary-General Louise FrÈchette  who is responsiblefor their implementation.I would also like to point out that  in our opinion the conclusions of the Brahimi report cannot bedissociated from other discussions to be held during thefifty-fifth session  specifically those on the revision ofthe scale of assessments for peacekeeping budgets. Inthis regard as well  Member States will have to keep anopen mind in order to set up an equitable system offinancial burden sharing that is adapted to the currentshape of the world.Another sensitive question manifests itself clearlyin the light of recent experiences  namely the properrole of the United Nations in relation to regionalorganizations  and indeed even in relation to theinitiatives of neighbouring States in a conflict zone.Lessons to be learned from the Yugoslav crisis are notthe same as those that can be drawn from recent crises particularly those in Africa. The goal in this regard isnot to deny the merits of the regional approach. On thecontrary  Belgium supports the creation of regionalrapid reaction forces in the service of peacekeeping  aswas underlined one week ago by our Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt  before this very body.It has to do more with highlighting the fact thatthe merits of the regional approach clearly can neverjustify inaction on behalf of the internationalcommunity or some sort of oratory diplomacy thatpasses off solving problems to regional bodies andorganizations or to temporary coalitions. The SecurityCouncil  as the supreme authority in matters of peaceand security  must be able to play its role  although it9should certainly be possible to refer some tasks toregional institutions most able to take action.I would like to make one last observationregarding preventive diplomacy and peacekeeping. Thearsenal at the disposal of the United Nations is notlimited to sending troops. Other means are availableand  moreover  have been used repeatedly during recentyears. I am referring to sanctions  and in particular toeconomic sanctions. This type of coercive measure  ifapplied by the Security Council in accordance to theCharter  can indeed produce the results envisaged whentheir use is well targeted and limited in time or whenthey are inscribed in a realistic timeframe. Butexperience also shows that when they are appliedindiscriminately or when they serve overtly ambitiouspolitical objectives  their effectiveness tends todecrease after a certain amount of time  and they mayeven produce results wholly opposite to the onesinitially envisaged. It is increasingly rare for sanctionsto be an useful instrument. Too often  they onlypenalize populations without reaching the targetedrulers  who often understand how to exploit theboomerang effect of such sanctions.I would like to move now to a subject dear to myheart  Central Africa. During the past year  my countryhas expressed strongly its desire to be involved in  andto contribute to  the mobilization of the internationalcommunity in support of the Lusaka peace process. Itis essential that all Congolese parties engage resolutelyand without preconditions in a dialogue  as they agreedto do in Lusaka. It is equally essential that ourOrganization and its Members who have the means todo so support the rapid deployment of the UnitedNations Organization Mission in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo (MONUC)  even though someof the conditions and modalities of that operation mayhave to be reviewed in the light of the Brahimi report.One thing is certain: without the presence of apeacekeeping force there will be no peace. Nor willthere be peace  or even a permanent cessation ofhostilities  without a dialogue between the Congoleseparties. Both these questions are obviously linked. Inorder to overcome the current impasse it is essential tomake progress where possible. It therefore seems to usthat the problem should not be stated in terms ofpreconditions  order of events or priorities. In anyevent  the responsibility of the Security Council andthe international community remain in place. Without apolitical leap by the parties to the conflict  and withoutthe necessary material support of the internationalcommunity  the peace process is doomed to fail.In Burundi  where action by the countries of theregion and the remarkable facilitation undertaken byformer Presidents Nyerere and Mandela have started toyield promising yet still incomplete results  it is alsotime for our Organization and the principal donorcountries to act to consolidate the gains achieved andto set the country once and for all on the path to peaceand development. It is in this spirit that Belgium willparticipate actively in the meeting organized by theEuropean Commission that is to be held in Brussels on15 September to prepare for the donors' conferencesoon to be convened by France on the request ofNelson Mandela.Regardless of how well-intentioned they may be efforts in the cause of peace can sometimes be to littleavail  given the greed and rivalries fuelled by theillegal exploitation of local resources. Resourcesattained in that way are financing wars  whichthemselves become a source of profit. The problem ofthe diamond trade in conflict areas is at the centre ofthis question. We know that war diamonds representonly a fraction of international trade  but these illegalrevenues nevertheless contribute to destabilizing thesituation  encourage the logic of war and spreadcorruption and anarchy. Belgium is active in the effortsto create a global system of verification. It is high timeindeed to put in place a realistic and effective legalframework binding on everyone in order to regulate thetrade in diamonds.I would now like to speak about non-proliferationand disarmament. Last April  during the ReviewConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  Belgium intervenedvigorously to express its concerns regarding a certainnumber of elements that could lead to the weakening orputting into question the very foundation of the non-proliferation regime negotiated in recent decades. Wecertainly welcome the conclusions of the Conferenceand the reflection that it triggered. That has led to afavourable climate for the implementation of the planof action. That being said  numerous States still refuseto adhere to the Non-Proliferation Treaty  while othershave not yet ratified the Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.We have followed closely  and with someconcern  the debate in the United States on anti-ballistic defence. Belgium is not opposed in principle10to the idea of anti-missile defence. We are only statingthat the political perception  the analysis of the threatand the means to counter it vary greatly from region toregion. There is no unique or universal response  butwhat is essential is to make sure that an anti-missilesystem  whatever it may be  should contribute togeneral stability and to the consolidation of mutualconfidence. In other words  the decisions will have tobe taken not only on the basis of a strategic andtechnical analysis  but also on a consensual basis thatbuilds upon the overall political and strategic balance.We welcome the decision by the AmericanAdministration to postpone its decision on thelaunching of a programme. Besides the question of thefeasibility of such a programme  its unilateral naturewould have a negative impact on our commondisarmament objectives. We now hope that thisdecision will encourage negotiations for a START IIIagreement between the United States and Russia. Rapidprogress on a new  substantial reduction of strategicnuclear arms could in turn lead to breaking the impassein negotiations for a fissile materials cut-off treaty atthe Disarmament Commission in Geneva.Belgium also welcomes heartily the adherence todate by 138 States to the Convention on the prohibitionof anti-personnel mines. Further efforts have to bemade in order to implement it and mobilize thenecessary funding to eliminate these especiallyinhumane weapons forever.I have dwelled mainly on peace and internationalsecurity. I would like to turn to the two other subjectsthat Belgium considers a priority in the programme ofaction of the Millennium Summit. Without thesepriorities  our efforts in the field of security would befruitless. I am referring to universal respect for humanrights and worldwide development.The protection of human rights is a leadingfeature of my country's foreign policy. Ourparticipation in the Commission on Human Rights willenable us to further enlarge our initiatives and ourpolitical action. We will be able to act more directly inthe fields where we have a particular interest  such asthe fight against racism and xenophobia  and the rightsof the child. Belgium was actively involved in thenegotiation of the Optional Protocol to the Conventionon the Rights of the Child aimed at sparing children asmuch as possible from the suffering and consequencesof armed conflict. The signing of that Protocol on theoccasion of the Millennium Summit  as well as ourcountry's signature of the second Protocol  on sexualexploitation of children  are specific signs of ourcommon will to reinforce the protection of the rights ofthe child.I would like to reiterate my country's wish to seethe death penalty permanently abolished all over theworld. I also appeal to countries that are not in aposition to do so at this time to adopt a moratorium asa transitional measure. We certainly cannot accept thedeath penalty still being implemented in cases of thosewho were minors at the time of the offence  pregnantwomen or the mentally ill.We are following very closely the evolution ofinternational law and jurisprudence aimed atcondemning persons convicted of crimes againsthumanity. My country has been at the forefront ofnational legislation in this context and hopes that thesemeasures can serve as a deterrent and an example forother States. We have just ratified the Statute of theInternational Criminal Court  and we are encouragingother States to do the same in support of this importantcommitment.Let me say a few words on globalization and itsproblems. Globalization is the expression of aninevitable technological evolution. It makes little senseto condemn this evolution as a whole  for it is naturaland has many positive effects  but we need to channelits dynamics towards real economic and social progressfor the well-being of a larger number of people. But theglobalization of the economy and trade cannot simplymean the renunciation of our political and institutionalresponsibilities. The risk is very real. We are alreadywitnessing a form of abandonment of responsibilities inthe case of Governments and Parliaments confrontedby the gigantic challenges of globalization and thealmost impossible task of dealing with them at thenational level. In the absence of a really effective andrecognized global authority  the dynamics ofglobalization could lead us into a political vacuum.There will be no new economic world order without anew political world order in which national democraticinstitutions  politically representative and accountable can play a role. This is another challenge facing ourOrganization and its Member States. We will have toprovide an answer in the new millennium.The United Nations system is at the heart of theissue of globalization  whose effects are becomingmore and more evident. Questions have been raised;now it is time to find the answers. We are convincedthat only the United Nations system  with all itsspheres of activity  is in a position to harmonize globaleconomic development with human development.Here  more than anywhere else  we realize that humanbeings  wherever they come from  share a high degreeof common aspirations  as well as the same fears  thesame needs and the same dreams. This belief has toguide us in all our actions  both here and at home. "
"14",546,"BEN",55,2000,"It is mypleasure to congratulate the President on his election. Itbears witness to the esteem which the internationalcommunity has for his country and for him. In wishinghim every success in the conduct of our work  I shouldlike to assure him also of the sincere cooperation of thedelegation of Benin.May I also pay a well-deserved tribute to hispredecessor  Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  Minister forForeign Affairs of Namibia  for the outstanding workhe accomplished.In view of the developments in internationalrelations  the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  hadthe felicitous initiative of gathering the highest20representatives of the peoples of the world forconsultations on a new world order and on the rolewhich the United Nations will be called upon to play.I would like to pay him a well-deserved tributeand emphasize the determined conviction andcompetence with which he heads the Organization.The Millennium Summit showed once again thatmultilateralism and international cooperation remainthe best approach to confront problems inglobalization. Indeed  the positive effects ofglobalization remain limited  as is borne out byimbalances in economic and social terms thatcharacterize the world today and violate human dignityand human rights. What must be done therefore is tochannel the globalization process towards economicand social progress for the benefit of the greatestnumber.In this process  the United Nations has acomparative advantage — it is the only institution ableto embody universally accepted values and the onlyplatform for organizing fruitful debate on world issues as well as on the ways and means for settling them.The United Nations is the body where the weakand the forgotten are able to make their voices heardand to participate in the attainment of a consensus onquestions of common interest.And  indeed  globalization today is a faitaccompli; however  we must emphasize that it is notneutral. Good governance  democracy and transparencymust be consolidated not only in national terms  butalso in international relations.These principles must be applied both withinStates as well as with respect to forces that governglobalization and make use of it as before to avoid anyform of democratic control.At the Millennium Summit  the heads of Stateand Government adopted a document which determinesthe main outlines of the United Nations action for thetwenty-first century.It is now up to the world community and  thus  upto our States  to civil society and to the private sectorto show the necessary determination to implement theguidelines of the Summit quickly and resolutely tomake a reality of the message of hope anddetermination which was expressed by the leaders ofthe world.Benin is pleased that special attention wasfocused on Africa. The initiatives taken for thecontinent require the firm support of the developmentpartners in the sense of a partnership and solidaritywhich must basically work on the following: a lastingsolution to the debt problem; a more just order for theinternational trade system; support in terms of financialresources and strengthening production capacity.We call for the effective implementation ofmeasures to integrate developing countries into theworld economy taking account of the special needs ofthe least-developed countries with a view to halting thedeterioration in their situations.In this regard  the holding of the Third United NationsConference on the Least Developed Countries is ofparticular importance. It is essential that it lead toconcrete results.The elimination of poverty is one of thechallenges that the international community was unableto meet in the twentieth century. It is our responsibilityto dedicate ourselves to this task. In this regard  we arepleased with the initiative taken by the Administratorof the United Nations Development Programme(UNDP) to organize a special ministerial meeting todiscuss the strategic orientation of UNDP and the needto provide it with the resources essential for it to carryout its missions. Benin is relying on UNDP  the mainbody for coordinating development assistance  to meetthe challenges facing developing countries.In commending the countries that haveannounced an increase in their official developmentassistance  I appeal for the restoration of a balance infavour of core budgetary resources to make it possibleto execute the programmes and projects to whichGovernments accord priority.With regard to financing for development  it isparticularly essential to ensure that resources are bettermobilized and that development action involving allpartners  including the Bretton Woods institutions  isbetter coordinated.All these programmes and plans can beimplemented only in an environment in which peaceand security are guaranteed. Benin therefore welcomedwith great interest the Brahimi report (A/55/305) containing an in-depth analysis of peacekeepingoperations.21With regard to Somalia  Benin would also like toexpress its satisfaction with the leader of the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development and all thefacilitators for their courageous initiatives to bringpeace to that country through a process of dialogue andreconciliation. We appeal to the internationalcommunity to lend its support to the consolidation ofthe process so that Somalia can rapidly become part ofthe community of nations.Benin is  and will remain  committed torespecting and promoting human rights  democracy andthe rule of law. These principles are inscribed in itsConstitution. In that context  since the fifty-secondsession the General Assembly has supported Benin inits organization of the Fourth International Conferenceof New or Restored Democracies  to be held inCotonou from 4 to 6 December 2000. This Conferencewill undoubtedly be an important stage in theinternational community's progress towards theconsolidation of democratic principles. At theConference the old and new democracies will exchangetheir experiences and commit themselves to promotingdemocracy  peace and political stability anddevelopment. Cotonou is preparing a warm welcome and hopes that there will be a great response to itsinvitation."
"15",592,"BFA",55,2000,"Exactly one week ago  the MillenniumSummit was held in this very Hall  in which more than150 leaders  heads of State and Government took anactive and interactive part.This Summit  which my delegation wishes tosalute once again  has played a great service inbringing together so many eminent personalities totruly take stock of the state of the world through a starkre-reading of the mission of and the basic strategicobjectives assigned to the United Nations.What more can be said? How can it be bettersaid?The conclusions arrived at by our leaders  whichgo to the very substance of the diverse and changingproblems that undermine humanity  frame the itemsinscribed on the agenda of the fifty-fifth session. Theyalso give us the opportunity to strike while the iron ishot and to embark immediately on theirimplementation where it is possible.In that context  the general debate in progress is areal challenge; a challenge to stay the course  but also achallenge to our ability to get down to basics.34But before I go on  I wish to convey to thePresident  on behalf of my delegation  heartfelt warmcongratulations on his election to the presidency of ourAssembly. This election is a well-deserved tribute tohim and his country  Finland  with which Burkina Fasoenjoys an excellent relationship of friendship andcooperation.My country is a Bureau member and we wish toassure the Bureau of our full willingness to cooperatewith it.Our congratulations also go to His ExcellencyMr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  Minister for Foreign Affairs ofNamibia  on the effectiveness of his guidance of theprevious session of the General Assembly.I also wish to renew Burkina Faso's appreciationand support for the work of the Secretary-General  Mr.Kofi Annan  who guides the work of our worldOrganization with courage  lucidity and determination.The waning millennium will no doubt forever beetched in the memory of humankind. Unfortunately  itwill be etched in blood  as during it we witnessed  asvirtually powerless bystanders  the rise of slavery colonization and racial discrimination; the escalation ofthe most atrocious kinds of war; the ongoingdegradation of the environment; and the deteriorationof the terms of trade. But it will also be etched in gold for we witnessed prodigious scientific andtechnological progress and economic and industrialgrowth  even though the structure for sharing theirfruits was slow moving and unfair.No continent more than Africa  no people morethan Africans  bear more heavily today the stigma ofthe scourges they have suffered  which will for evermark them  or of their sharing but little  ifanything  of the benefits of progress. My delegationtherefore believes that we should embrace that historytogether and in a spirit of solidarity  agree to be theliving and collective memory of it and learn its lessonsso that we may strengthen our capacity to solve withgreater efficiency and equity the problems of security peace  development and a better quality of life thatmake up the core of our priorities. Whether thatinvolves resolving the smouldering or open conflictsthat continue to decimate our populations and to forcethem to flee by the thousands into exile  or whether itentails looking for lasting solutions to the problems ofunderdevelopment  the unbearable debt burden  theAIDS pandemic  malaria or natural and environmentaldisasters  we must  whatever the cost continually goback to our sources and history.I therefore make a solemn appeal to theconscience of the peoples of the United Nations toprevent hegemony and domination from being thehallmark of our Organization during the thirdmillennium. That would be a betrayal of this history and make our collective memory a selective memory.As the Assembly is aware  despite the progressmade during the second millennium  there still remainquestions and concerns among developing countries particularly those in Africa. Their questions andconcerns are not caused solely by the acceleration andunprecedented worsening of their continuedimpoverishment. Unfortunately  they also stem fromthe fact that today  at the dawn of the twenty-firstcentury  international relations continue to be basedessentially on force. That sad fact is made worsebecause  with the end of the cold war  we are passivelyand almost with a resigned attitude witnessing a singlemind-set developing.As most heads of State and Government have saidfrom this rostrum  the time has come to undertake thenecessary reforms at the national  regional andinternational levels to build a more just  equitable unified and fraternal world. Let us hope that the basicchallenge  I would even call it heroism  of the newmillennium will be to move forward together insolidarity  calmly and democratically towardsglobalization while we remain ourselves  that is retain our intrinsic values and our dignity as freeindividuals.With regard to the United Nations  we areconvinced that making it more democratic is absolutelynecessary. That democratization must include athorough reform of the decision-making processes ofthe system  and of the Security Council in particular and should go hand in hand with giving greaterattention to development issues  particularly through amore thorough examination of the idea of adevelopment council  as proposed by the MillenniumSummit. It also means making the Organization trulyuniversal. In this regard  Burkina Faso welcomes theadmission of Tuvalu as the 189th Member State. Wealso think it is unfair to continue to marginalize theRepublic of China  a country that meets all therequirements of a sovereign State to take its place inthe United Nations.35Throughout its history  and particularly since the1990s  Burkina Faso  learning from its ownexperience  experience grounded in a culture ofdialogue and negotiation  has based its contributionon the quest for solutions to national and subregionalconflicts on the basis of dialogue and agreement. Wehave done so because we are convinced that dialogueand agreement  which are certainly not the weaponsof the weak  are the only way to reach lasting peace.We are therefore very surprised and disappointedthat for some time now my country has been forced toconfront accusations and all sorts of completelybaseless recriminations. Is this the result of a deliberatedesire to harm  or simply of misunderstanding? It iswrong and unfair that in efforts to find lasting solutionsto conflicts one should yield to the easy temptation ofaccusation  recrimination  condemnation and exclusion.Burkina Faso has never hesitated to demonstrate itsgood faith  to show its willingness to cooperate withthe United Nations and the international community  orto express its desire for transparency.That is why we set up an inter-ministerialcommittee on Angola and Sierra Leone to follow upand monitor implementation of the sanctions decreedby the Security Council. We also invited the Council toundertake any investigations in Burkina Faso that itdeemed necessary to find the truth. Two UnitedNations delegations therefore recently visited thecountry. Their leaders stated that they hadaccomplished their missions freely and peacefully.Similarly  in the face of the recent surprising  toput it mildly  allegations by Guinea  we would like toreassure that beloved  fraternal country  as well as theinternational community  that Burkina Faso had nopart  directly or indirectly  in those unfortunate events.We repeat our readiness to welcome or support anyinitiative that could shed light on this matter  which wefind profoundly distressing.At the national level  Burkina Faso is resolutelycontinuing to consolidate and anchor the democraticprocess begun in 1990. That process is essentiallycharacterized by the regular and systematic holding ofelections at the municipal  legislative and presidentiallevels  in objective  transparent and fair conditionsrecognized by the international community; thestrengthening of public freedoms and the promotion ofhuman rights; public financing of political parties unions and an independent press; recognition of officialstatus for the opposition; reform of the judicial systemto allow it to play its full role in consolidating andregulating the rule of law; and strengtheningdecentralization and local governance.Turning to the economy  our Government isconcentrating on a truly unified type of development.Its priorities are poverty eradication  environmentalprotection  food self-sufficiency  and education andhealth for all.We welcome the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries(HIPC) Debt Initiative  which seeks to reduce the debtof poor  highly indebted countries  and the election ofour country to that body  which strengthens our anti-poverty strategy.At the African level  Burkina Faso hasconsistently worked to strengthen good-neighbourlyrelations and to promote subregional and regionalintegration as well as peace and security.That is why we are committed to the institutionalstability and the strengthening of the subregionalcooperation or integration organizations of which weare a member  in particular the West African Economicand Monetary Union  the Economic Community ofWest African States and the Economic Community ofSahel-Saharan States. We hope that the latter will beaccorded the status of observer at the United Nations.For that reason we have spared no effort to helpcreate the African Union  which the African peoples sofervently desired.These are the main ideas that Burkina Fasowanted to share with the international community andwhich attest to our unswerving commitment to theideals of the United Nations and to our unshakablefaith in our common ability together to forge a betterfuture  a glorious future for the whole of humankind."
"16",635,"BGD",55,2000,"Thehistoric Millennium Summit and the forward-lookingDeclaration it adopted have set a very positive tone forthe Millennium Assembly  which is now continuingwith this general debate.We extend our heartiest congratulations toMr. Harri Holkeri on his well-deserved election as thePresident of the fifty-fifth session. His deepcommitment to the values and principles of the UnitedNations gives us the confidence that the affairs of thisAssembly are in very good hands.I should also like to congratulate ForeignMinister Theo-Ben Gurirab  my dear colleague  for hissuperb leadership of the fifty-fourth General Assembly.We are grateful to him for his invaluable guidance inthe preparations for the Millennium Summit and itsoutcome.May I also express Bangladesh's sincere thanksand gratitude to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for hisvision in convening the Millennium Summit and for hisuntiring efforts towards its success. His millenniumreport contains a number of good proposals and ideas which we wholeheartedly support. I reiterateBangladesh's full support and cooperation to theSecretary-General in his determination to enhance theefficiency and effectiveness of the United Nations.Let me at the very outset extend our heartiestcongratulations to the people and Government ofTuvalu as the newest Member of this Organization.Twenty-six years ago this month  whenBangladesh had just become a Member of thisOrganization  the Father of the Nation  BangabandhuSheikh Mujibur Rahman  addressed this Assembly. Heunderscored our commitment to the Charter of theUnited Nations. For our people  it was a great moment.We have travelled a long way since that time and ourcommitment to the United Nations has only grown instrength.As Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina mentioned inher speech at the Millennium Summit:“In this Organization  the powerful and theweak  the large and the small  the wealthy and thestruggling come together as equals to addresstheir problems  to forge cooperation and tofurther understanding. It certainly is in ourinterest to strive for a United Nations which canfulfil our common goal — a better world forevery human being”.To the people of Bangladesh  human rights is asacred trust  because we were victims of its abuse. Andyet the very person who had championed the cause offundamental rights was denied the most basic of allhuman rights  the right to life. I speak of the ghastlymurder of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman along with almost his entire family and close relations by a group of assassins on 15 August 1975. Themurderers had committed a crime and human rightsabuse of the worst kind. And  in what could best bedescribed as an arrogant affront to human rights anddemocratic principles  the killers were grantedimmunity from law by the so-called IndemnityOrdinance issued by the undemocratic regime of thattime.15The present democratic Government inBangladesh has repealed the Indemnity Ordinancesince its assumption of office. The accused have beentried and found guilty of murder  and the verdict of thecourt of law has been announced. Some of them however  have managed to escape justice by findingasylum in foreign lands. If human rights is to dominatethe agenda of the new century  we would urgently askthe international community for its cooperation inbringing these self-confessed killers to Bangladesh toface justice. Here I would like to express myappreciation and gratitude to those countries whichhave been cooperating with us in this matter.To Bangladesh  a very important manifestation ofhuman rights is the right to development  which needsfurther assertion by the international community. Inensuring that right  it is essential that our collectiveefforts focus on addressing poverty. Unless we takepositive actions in this regard  globalization will bemore of a challenge and less an opportunity — freedomfrom want will remain elusive. The challenges areparticularly daunting for the least developed countriesand merit priority attention.Just as globalization touches us all marginalization of these vulnerable countries wouldaffect us all in the global family. We would urge theinternational community to make every effort for thesuccess of the third United Nations Conference on theLeast Developed Countries in 2001 in Brussels.In the past decade  the international communityhas made tremendous progress in recognizing thechallenges and adopting elaborate programmes ofactions in the areas of social development  humanrights  environment  population  human settlement andfood security  as well as on women and children. Nowthe challenge before us is to fulfil the commitments wehave made together. Let us resolve that the next decadewill be the decade of implementation.At home  in facing the challenges of the comingdecades  poverty eradication has been set as the over-arching goal of the present Government of Bangladesh under the leadership of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.We are making increasingly great investments in ourpeople and in our social and human development.In ensuring the effectiveness of this engagement Bangladesh has focused on the rights of women andchildren. Bangladesh has become party to most of theinternational instruments relating to the rights of thosetwo groups. During the Millennium Summit  PrimeMinister Sheikh Hasina ratified the Optional Protocolto the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms ofDiscrimination against Women and the two OptionalProtocols on the sale of children  child prostitution andchild pornography and on the involvement of childrenin armed conflict. Adoption of the “Woman and ChildRepression Prevention Act  2000” by our nationalParliament is also a major step forward in eliminatingviolence against women and children.Unfortunately  our efforts towards sustainablehuman development have been set back throughcalamities beyond our control. Sometimes it is naturaldisasters like floods  cyclones or tidal surges.Sometimes it is silent killers like dengue fever orarsenic contamination of groundwater. Today  twothirds of the Bangladesh population is at risk as theresult of arsenic contamination of drinking water. TheGovernment has responded to this crisis with urgencyand determination; in collaboration with internationalagencies such as the World Bank  the United NationsChildren's Fund (UNICEF) and the World HealthOrganization (WHO)  as well as non-governmentalorganizations (NGOs). Adequate emphasis has alsobeen given to ensuring alternative sources of safedrinking water for the community.In her statement at the Security Council summittwo weeks ago  Prime Minister Sheikh Hasinaemphasized that international peace and security mustalso be understood in terms of human security. She alsoemphasized that we should prevent war crimes  crimesagainst humanity and genocide against the civilianpopulation. We believe that the establishment of theInternational Criminal Court can effectively deal withthese crimes. We signed the Rome Statute last year andhave already initiated the process for early ratification.As an elected member of the United NationsSecurity Council  Bangladesh remains committed to itsobligations to maintain and preserve internationalpeace and security. Bangladesh strongly supportsenhanced effectiveness of the United Nationspeacekeeping operations  as well as its peace-buildingmeasures. Bangladesh is proud to be one of the largesttroop contributors to United Nations peacekeepingoperations  in fulfilment of our commitment to globalpeace and security. In this context  we welcome therecommendations of the Brahimi Panel and lookforward to their consideration by the relevantintergovernmental bodies and the Secretariat. Here we16would emphasize that the resources needed for theirimplementation should not in any way undermineother  already existing programmes.An area of our common concern has been UnitedNations sanctions  their effectiveness and their impact.It is a matter of satisfaction that the Security Council after years of debate  has set up a Working Groupunder Bangladesh chairmanship to study variousgeneral issues related to sanctions. We are confidentthat the work of the Group will help the Council toagree on measures to streamline the sanctions regimes.To ensure peace and development  we must moveahead with an agenda for real disarmament. Thenuclearization of our own region in South Asia hascaused us concern. As one of the least developedregions in the world  South Asia cannot afford to getinto a race for nuclear weapons. In accordance with itsconstitutional commitment to total and generaldisarmament  Bangladesh took the lead in South Asiato sign the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty(CTBT) in 1996  ratifying it earlier this year. We alsowere among the first in South Asia to sign the OttawaConvention on anti-personnel landmines  which wasalso ratified by us during the Millennium Summit along with the Convention on certain conventionalweapons (CCWC) and all its Protocols.Bangladesh considers peace and development tobe fundamental rights. One cannot endure without theother. The United Nations and its Member States mustcontinue to espouse and promote a culture of peace.Bangladesh took the initiative for the internationalobservance of this millennium year and the first decadeof the twenty-first century as the International Year forthe Culture of Peace and the International Decade for aCulture of Peace and Non-violence for the Children ofthe World  respectively.As we have said on earlier occasions  Bangladeshbelieves that the United Nations should be prepared torespond effectively to the challenges of the newcentury. Since United Nations reforms were initiatedby Secretary-General Kofi Annan  a lot has been done but much more could be added to this. We aspire togreater democratization and transparency in theorganizations of the United Nations. We also believethat involvement by non-governmental organizationsand other actors of civil society can significantlyenhance the effectiveness of the United Nations.A changed world needs a changed UnitedNations — an Organization for today's world. We needto demonstrate courage and determination in order topreserve the United Nations as the world's mostuniversal forum. Its founding fathers spoke about thescourge of war. Today the United Nations will only liveup to the global reality if it cannot only free the world'speople from the scourge of war but also savesucceeding generations from the scourge of poverty.May Bangladesh live forever.May the United Nations live forever."
"17",681,"BGR",55,2000,"First of all  on behalfof the Bulgarian delegation  I take this opportunity tocongratulate you  Mr. President  and the other membersof the presidency on assuming the particularlyimportant task of presiding over this importantmillennium session of the General Assembly and towish you every success in guiding it to a successfulconclusion.Let me start by saying that the Republic ofBulgaria  as an associated country  aligns itself with thestatement delivered on behalf of the European Union.This past year has been marked by a series ofevents  culminating in the Millennium Summit. Fromthis General Assembly session we expect consensusdecisions aimed at a strengthened and more efficientUnited Nations  capable of bringing us closer to acommon vision for a better future  rid of the scourge ofconflict and war  poverty and disease  backwardnessand under-development  and based on peace andsecurity  sustainable development and prosperity in thecontext of a dominating tendency towards a moreglobalized and interdependent world. This truly is aformidable task. It cannot be achieved by or for aseparate country or region. It requires a broad andsustained effort to create a shared future  based uponour common humanity in all its diversity  as rightlypointed out in the Millennium Declaration.On the verge of the new millennium  it would notbe an exaggeration to say that humanity has achieved alot. Nowadays we have at our disposal far better andefficient means to produce more goods and services  tofight diseases and live longer and better lives  to reapthe benefits of the new information technologies in allspheres of life. But at the same time  we cannot butrecognize that humanity is still confronted bytremendous challenges. Poverty and misery are stilldominant over large parts of the world. People in somany places are still exposed to conflict and violence.The world is still threatened by weapons of massdestruction. New threats  such as terrorism international crime  illicit traffic in narcotics and smallarms  are coming to the fore. Also of particular concernare the changes in the world climate and environment which are bringing disasters capable of destroying thehomes and livelihoods of millions.To cope with these challenges we must acttogether. This is the reason why we need astrengthened and effective United Nations  which couldbe achieved through the shared responsibility and thegood political will of all its Member States. TheMillennium Assembly is giving us the opportunity toreaffirm our commitment to the purposes and thefounding principles of the United Nations  to go aheadwith reforms and to strengthen its role andeffectiveness  so as to make it serve us all better inmeeting the challenges we are confronted with at thebeginning of the new millennium.26Bulgaria joins the other Member States insupporting the proposals  contained in the MillenniumReport of the Secretary-General Kofi Annan(A/54/2000) and aimed at the system-wide streamliningand strengthening of the Organization and at making itmore efficient and responsive to new realities. Ofparticular importance in this regard is the strengtheningand revitalization of the principal organs of the UnitedNations  in particular the General Assembly  theSecurity Council and the Economic and Social Council.Regarding the reform and the enlargement of theSecurity Council  we share the view that this processshould result in a more representative  effective andlegitimate Security Council  taking into considerationboth the increased number of the United Nationsmembership and the enhanced role and political andeconomic potential of certain States  like Germany andJapan  for example  which could assume theresponsibilities of permanent members. In our view  areformed Council should be more transparent  open andaccessible to the interested non-member States. A fairand balanced representation  including the Group ofEastern European States  whose membership hasdoubled in the last decade  should definitely besecured. A decision on the enlargement of the Counciland on its working methods should be supported by thebroadest possible consensus  including all thepermanent members of the Security Council.During the past year  the international communitycontinued to be engaged closely with the situation insouth-east Europe. As a country  suffering mostdirectly the impact of the developments in the region Bulgaria is particularly concerned with the situation inKosovo. We note that progress in implementingresolution 1244 (1999) of the Security Council hasbeen achieved  particularly with regard to restoringpeace and stability in the province. At the same time  itmust be recognized that in terms of multi-ethniccoexistence the situation is still far from satisfying.Continuing ethnic violence is causing serious concern.Particularly worrying are the attacks against membersof the international peacekeeping contingents andUnited Nations personnel. The situation requiresresolute steps on behalf of all community leaders inKosovo to reject violence and to promote tolerance andcooperation in compliance with the adopteddeclarations. We see such an approach as a keyprerequisite for building up an atmosphere ofconfidence and ethnic tolerance.The successful preparation and holding ofmunicipal elections with the participation of all ethnicminorities  including refugees and displaced persons  isparticularly important for speeding up the politicalprocess in Kosovo and for securing lasting peace andstability.Since the very beginning of the Kosovo crisis Bulgaria has been actively engaged in the overallefforts of the international community to settle theconflict and ensure lasting peace and stability in theregion. As is well known  Bulgaria participates in theinternational peacekeeping forces in Kosovo andrenders logistical support to the peacekeeping Missionin the province. Furthermore  my country has beenmobilizing significant resources  in accordance withour potential  to increase its contribution tointernational peace activities.In response to the appeal to increase the size ofthe United Nations civilian police force in Kosovo Bulgaria has increased its contingent to 60 policeofficers  and is now considering the possibility ofincreasing that number to 100. Bulgaria has sent anengineering platoon to join the international presencein the field. Bulgarian companies are engaged in theconstruction and assembling of houses to shelterdisplaced persons and refugees in Kosovo. Last  butnot least  Bulgaria has been supplying low-costelectricity to Kosovo. The overall cost of theseendeavours has so far reached $6 million.We deem particularly important the involvementof all the countries of the region in the process ofseeking settlement of the outstanding issues throughthe process of multilateral and bilateral negotiations. Inthis context  the informal meetings held at the level ofprime ministers and the meetings of the foreign anddefence ministers of the countries neighbouring theFederal Republic of Yugoslavia that are devoted todifferent aspects of cooperation are useful.Of particular importance to the post-conflictreconstruction of conflict-stricken areas is theelaboration and the implementation of a long-termstrategy for the economic reconstruction anddevelopment of the countries of the region throughtheir integration into the European and Euro-Atlanticstructures. The speedy implementation of the differentprojects within the framework of the Stability Pact forSouth-Eastern Europe could contribute significantly tothe economic development and stability of the region.27We deem infrastructure projects as being  particularlyimportant in that regard. Such projects will contributeto enhancing the transportation and communicationslinks of the region and connecting them with the rest ofEurope. Attracting investments and developing tradeand the participation of companies from the region inthe reconstruction process are important as well.We highly appreciate the progress achieved instrengthening cooperation between the countries of theregion in such fields as fighting organized crime andcorruption  the illicit traffic in narcotics  curbing theuncontrolled possession of small arms  and so on. Animportant achievement of that cooperation is thecreation of a multinational peace force in south-easternEurope  with joint headquarters in Plovdiv  Bulgaria.We are confident that the establishment of this forcewill strengthen the spirit of confidence and cooperationin the region of south-eastern Europe.An issue of special relevance to Bulgaria andalso  I believe  for other countries of the region  is thenegative impact on the national economy of the strictimplementation of the economic sanctions imposeduntil recently by the Security Council on the FederalRepublic of Yugoslavia. As is well known  Bulgariastrictly abided by the decisions of the United NationsSecurity Council  and as a result suffered economiclosses commensurate with the country's foreign debt.Those losses still affect our economic development.Given the continued relevance and importance of thisissue under the present international setting  Bulgariasupports the view that  since the provisions of theCharter have equal importance  the issue of assistingthird States affected by sanctions has to be taken intoconsideration together with the imposition of sanctions.The elaboration of a concrete mechanism for thatpurpose is therefore important for the United Nations which must find ways and means of alleviating theirnegative effects  in particular on third States. Theinternational community as a whole should take care ofthis. In our view  it is necessary that there be closer andmore direct participation in the whole process by allthird States that could potentially be adversely affectedby the imposition of sanctions. We are confident thatthe discussions on this issue at the present session based on the decisions already adopted and on thereport of the Secretary-General under resolution54/107  will result in more concrete decisions to thatend.Bulgaria not only supports international efforts toovercome the crisis in south-eastern Europe  but it alsofully supports the efforts aimed at resolving conflictsituations in Cyprus  the Middle East  the Caucuses Africa and elsewhere in the world. Bulgaria notes withsatisfaction the positive progress in the relationsbetween South and North Korea.In the context of the new challenges in the fieldof international peace and security  United Nationspeacekeeping operations continue to be a crucialelement in the activities of the United Nations. Mycountry supports the efforts of the internationalcommunity aimed at ensuring the necessary tools andresources required to promote conflict prevention  thepeaceful resolution of disputes  and post-conflictpeace-building and reconstruction. We are convincedthat the new generation of peacekeeping operationsshould include in their mandates a proportionatecombination of political  military  humanitarian reconstruction and other relevant activities.In this regard  we believe that there are stillunexploited opportunities to strengthen the cooperationof the United Nations and to make its cooperation withregional organizations in the field of preventivediplomacy  crisis management and peacekeeping moreeffective on the basis of on their competitiveadvantages. We share the concern of other MemberStates over ensuring the United Nations ability todeliver on its mounting array of peacekeepingcommitments  and we are committed to work togetherto strengthen the capacity of the United Nations in thisvital area.We fully support the need to reform the UnitedNations peacekeeping scale of assessments. I wouldlike to point out  as a clear demonstration of this fact that the Government of Bulgaria has decided to assumean additional financial commitment by increasing itscontribution to peacekeeping operations.An issue closely linked to the maintenance ofinternational peace and security is the fight againstterrorism and international crime. Bulgaria attachesparamount importance to the efforts of the worldcommunity in the fight against terrorism. We condemnall terrorist acts and lament the loss of life and thedestruction inflicted by such acts. We share the viewthat the threat of terrorism is assuming a magnitudethat requires a decisive and joint response by the wholeinternational community. Bulgaria supports the28activities of the United Nations aimed at setting normsand standards for the fight against terrorism andinternational crime through the negotiation of variouslegal instruments and by creating appropriateinstitutions for that purpose.We consider that the establishment of theInternational Criminal Court is a significantachievement in that regard. I would like to reiterate mycountry's strong commitment to the fight against themost serious kinds of international crime in all theirforms. That commitment is a consistent part ofBulgarian policy. We are confident that theestablishment of the International Criminal Court willbe an efficient step by the international communitytowards deterring the potential perpetrators fromcommitting such acts.Together with peacemaking and the building of amore secure world  the broadening of the human aspectof development through democracy and participationhas been widely accepted and has become one of thepriorities of the activities of the United Nations. Theprinciple of the indivisibility of the universallyrecognized civil  political  economic  social andcultural rights continues to be a key element of today'ssystem of promotion and protection of human rightsand freedoms. Bulgaria is confident that the activitiesof international forums in the field of human rightsshould be aimed at ensuring the effective and universalenjoyment of those rights on a global scale.The principle of the indivisibility of universallyrecognized civil  political  economic  social andcultural rights continues to be a key element in today'ssystem of promotion and protection of human rightsand freedoms. Bulgaria is convinced that the activitiesof international forums in the field of human rightsshould be aimed at ensuring the effective and universalenjoyment of those rights on a global scale. In thisrespect  the monitoring and effective control of theimplementation of human rights and fundamentalfreedoms remain of crucial importance. Guided by thisunderstanding  Bulgaria is now party to all universalhuman rights instruments that have established specificmonitoring bodies and has recognized their competenceto consider communications from individuals.In our view  the relevant experiences of someregional organizations with competence in the humanrights field also could be taken into consideration. Weshare the view that a more effective coordination andexchange of information and even joint efforts areneeded between the United Nations and regionalorganizations such as the Council of Europe and theOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe(OSCE).A better implementation of internationalstandards could be achieved by improving existingmechanisms and by constructive and open dialogue onthe most sensitive issues  including those related tohuman rights in individual States. Accordingly  theBulgarian Government attaches great importance to theenjoyment of all human rights by Bulgarians livingabroad and considers respect for their rights as anessential element in the enhancement of relations.Enhanced socio-economic development is anotherimportant factor for securing stability and peace in theworld. The achievements registered in this field shouldbe recognized and encouraged. The review process based on the relevant ideas contained in the millenniumreport of the Secretary-General  must result in thestrengthening of the coordinating role of the Economicand Social Council and of the entire machinery of thisOrganization. Of particular relevance in this regard arethe steps aimed at the practical realization of thefollow-up measures to the major internationalconferences.Bulgaria attaches major importance to the role ofthe United Nations in the field of sustainabledevelopment and is following closely the UnitedNations dialogue and the activities of the respectiveUnited Nations bodies and agencies on issues related todemographics  social development  women  the fightagainst diseases and drugs  and so on.Bulgaria is cooperating actively with the UnitedNations system of specialized agencies andprogrammes. We are interested in further developingthis cooperation. We are looking forward to moredynamic and streamlined activities  especially throughthe use of the potential of United Nations DevelopmentProgramme for capacity-building and assistance in thedevelopment and implementation of joint projects. Inthis regard  the system of resident coordinators and theefforts to make that system more operational willundoubtedly play an important role.Bulgaria shares the concern of the internationalcommunity regarding the spread of diseases  inparticular the AIDS virus. We support the activities ofthe United Nations in this field  and we join our efforts29to those of Governments  non-governmentalorganizations  and academic and research institutionsin the fight against this dangerous disease.Development and economic growth areimpossible without full participation in globaleconomic and financial exchanges. In our opinion  theUnited Nations and its institutions could play a moreactive role with regard to the specific problems relatedto economic transition and reforms.Disarmament issues continue to play an importantrole in overall efforts to secure a better world for futuregenerations. The Bulgarian Government attaches highpriority to international efforts to strengthen thenuclear non-proliferation regime. We call for an earlyentry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty as an important step in that direction andsupport the decision of the Conference onDisarmament to establish an ad hoc committee toconduct negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty.We favour the strengthening of the Biological andToxin Weapons Convention and believe that a furtheracceleration of the negotiations and an early conclusionof the protocol to the Convention is required.As a State party to the Chemical WeaponsConvention  Bulgaria would like to contribute toincreasing the number of accessions to the Conventionin order to achieve recognition of the prohibition ofchemical weapons as a universal norm of internationallaw. As a concrete effort to this end  we are hosting aregional seminar of the Organization for theProhibition of Chemical Weapons in Sofia from 28 to30 September of this year.With regard to conventional arms  anti-personnellandmines are widely recognized as a terrible weapon which kills and maims hundreds of thousands of peopleworldwide. Convinced of the need for a totalprohibition of anti-personnel mines  on 29 July 1999the Bulgarian Parliament ratified the OttawaConvention  thus contributing to its early entry intoforce.We are also ready to contribute to the efforts ofthe international community to reduce conventionalweapons  including small arms  especially theirexcessive and destabilizing accumulation in areas ofconflict. We regard universal participation in theUnited Nations Register of Conventional Arms as animportant step towards effective transparency  on botha regional and a global scale.For Bulgaria this past year has been a period ofcontinued intensive efforts by the Government to buildon the economic stabilization that has been achievedand to move forward with structural reforms modernizing State administration  enforcing the rule oflaw in civil society and creating favourable conditionsfor sustainable economic growth. The steps andinitiatives that have been undertaken in compliancewith the Government programme 'Bulgaria  2001'are directed at moving ahead with the integration ofBulgaria into European and Euro-Atlantic structures.Being an integral part of Europe  Bulgaria regardsaccelerated accession to the European Union and fullmembership in North Atlantic Treaty Organization(NATO) as an expression of our sovereign politicalchoice based on broad public support. Since Bulgaria isendeavouring to promote and enhance the values ofdemocracy  we are sincerely interested in seeing thesevalues become widely accepted throughout South-eastern Europe. The Republic of Bulgaria welcomes itsinclusion in the process of enlargement of the EuropeanUnion  together with other associated countries fromCentral and Eastern Europe  as well as Cyprus. TheBulgarian Government is fully aware that our accessionendeavours are contingent on the success of domesticeconomic and legislative reforms.The Bulgarian Government has developed aclear-cut national strategy to meet the criteria forNATO membership  based on a comprehensive nationalprogramme of preparation  which is being updated andoptimized. Bulgaria has the political will and isundertaking concrete steps to translate and fulfil inregional terms the objectives of the Euro-AtlanticPartnership Council and the enhanced Partnership forPeace. Our positive attitude is reflected in the ongoingregional political dialogue and the practical follow-upmeasures to enhance regional security and defencecooperation in South-eastern Europe.In conclusion  I would like once again to declaremy country's readiness to cooperate actively with allMember States for the successful implementation ofthe lofty goals which we have before us at the presentsession of the General Assembly. We are confident thatdiscussions on important agenda items will betranslated into practical measures."
"18",726,"BHR",55,2000,"It is mygreat pleasure to congratulate you  Mr. President  onyour election as President of the General Assembly atits fifty-fifth session and to wish you every success inyour task. May I also assure you of my delegation'scooperation in achieving the objectives we all desire. Itis also my pleasure to thank your predecessor Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  for his efforts in conducting theproceedings of the fifty-fourth session  as well as theproceedings of the special sessions held during thesame period.I would like to avail myself of this opportunity toexpress my deep appreciation for the valuable andconstant efforts that Secretary-General Kofi Annan hasmade to enable the Organization to deliver its messageand to enhance its role in the maintenance of peace andsecurity throughout the world.May I also extend my delegation'scongratulations to the Government and people ofTuvalu on the occasion of its admission to membershipin the United Nations. Its admission is a furtherdemonstration of the universality of the Organization.The fifty-fifth session is remarkable because italso encompasses the work of the Millennium Summit which was attended by a large number of leaders ofMember States. The very presence of those leaders  andthe discussions and meetings they held  served tounderscore the importance they attach to the role andresponsibilities of the United Nations in the newcentury. They also identified the changes andchallenges that will require joint internationalcooperation on the basis of the lofty and nobleprinciples and purposes enshrined in the Organization'sCharter.More than half a century after its establishment the world Organization must deal effectively withpolitical  economic  social and cultural changes andtake advantage of their positive impact. This isparticularly the case with regard to the ongoing andaccelerating revolution in the fields ofcommunications  modern technology and economicglobalization. In this regard  it is my pleasure tocommend the Secretary-General's report to theMillennium Summit  entitled  “We the peoples: the roleof the United Nations in the twenty-first century”. Thatreport has shed light on the global issues of the years tocome and includes the positive aspects  misgivings andapprehensions associated with those issues.The State of Bahrain welcomes the UnitedNations Millennium Declaration and the reaffirmationby Member States of their faith in the Charter'sprinciples and the need to strengthen the role of theOrganization. We are confident that if we aresuccessful in giving effect to those principles  the2Organization will be able to fulfil its political economic  social and human responsibilities. Foremostamong those responsibilities are the preservation ofinternational peace and security and combating disease poverty  ignorance  drugs  violence  terrorism andcrime. Those responsibilities also include preservationof the environment and natural resources.While the cold war era threatened the world withthe dangers and risks of war  the ultimate challengesthe world must face in the future include borderdisputes  racial and ethnic conflict  globalization of theinternational economy  development issues  and otherpolitical  social and environmental challenges  as wellas issues related to weapons of mass destruction andterrorism.The State of Bahrain — whose full integrationand close association with the international communitywas emphasized in the address to the MillenniumSummit by His Highness Shaikh Hamad Bin IsaAl-Khalifa — is determined to continue to shoulder itsnational  regional and international responsibilitieswith a view to meeting the requirements of the newcentury. Given its ancient civilization and the fact thatit is fully committed to the obligations associated withmembership in the United Nations and the internationalcommunity  Bahrain will deal positively and within theframework of regional and international cooperationwith the changes dictated by the new era in such amanner as to ensure justice  security  peace andprosperity for all.Since it attained political independence and beganto exercise full sovereignty over all its islands territories and territorial waters  in 1971  under the lateEmir  His Highness Shaikh Isa Bin Salman Al-Khalifa the State of Bahrain has constantly sought to build amodern State and a developed civil society bypreparing and training its people to deal with therequirements of the modern age and to take a positiverole in the changes taking place currently and in thefuture. Today  in its new era  the State of Bahraincontinues its strenuous efforts at modernization andprogress through domestic openness and by takingprogressive and measured steps in various fields. Thosesteps include guaranteeing freedoms and ensuring therule of law and women's participation in all aspects ofnational life  notably through membership in theConsultative Council.In the field of human rights  Bahrain continues totake considerable steps by signing a number ofinternational conventions in recognition of theimportance of those rights. Those conventions havemade the resulting legal rights and obligationsabsolutely clear  while at the same time they firmlyoppose the use of human rights as a pretext forinterfering in internal affairs or for underminingreligious beliefs  human values and cultural and socialcharacteristics of States.Despite its continuous efforts and the admirablestanding it has achieved in the field of humandevelopment  the State of Bahrain  like otherdeveloping island States  faces a number of challengesstemming from its limited size  high population densityand limited natural resources. As a result  Bahrain hasundertaken ambitious development projects with aview to diversifying the sources of its national income.Those projects include an open economic policy thathas made Bahrain an advanced regional and globalcommercial and financial centre.In the area of foreign relations and the fulfilmentof national and international obligations  the State ofBahrain's contributions to the maintenance ofinternational peace and security are evidenced by theclose relations it maintains with brotherly and friendlyStates on the basis of cooperation  mutual interests mutual respect and non-interference in the internalaffairs of other States. Driven by its firm belief in theimportance of regional and international security  themaintenance of which is a joint responsibility  and inthe light of the serious and dangerous events witnessedby the Gulf region over the last 20 years the effects andramifications of which continue to pose a threat to thesecurity and stability of the area  the State of Bahrainwill continue to call for adherence by all States to theprinciples that contribute to the maintenance ofsecurity and peace and the prevalence of stability progress and prosperity.Among the most important of those principles arerespect for the status quo and the sanctity of existingborders; establishment of relations among States on thebasis of the principles of good neighbourliness  mutualrespect and non-interference in the internal affairs ofother States; recognition of the national sovereignty ofeach State; and settlement of disputes through peacefulmeans and in accordance with the principles ofinternational law accepted by the parties to the dispute.3On this basis  and given its commitment to themaintenance of international peace and security especially in the strategically important Gulf region  inwhich many States have vital interests  the State ofBahrain reaffirms its principled and consistentpositions on current regional and international issues.Accordingly  it renews its invitation to Iraq tocooperate with the United Nations; to fully implementrelevant Security Council resolutions  particularlythose relating to weapons of mass destruction; and torelease prisoners and detainees of Kuwaiti and othernationalities  as a means leading to the lifting ofsanctions and to an end to the suffering of the brotherlyIraqi people. Meanwhile  it declares anew its call forthe preservation of Iraq's independence  sovereigntyand territorial integrity and its objection to anyinterference in Iraq's internal affairs.With its deep interest and concern for a continuedspirit of cooperation and good-neighbourly relationsamong the Gulf States  the State of Bahrain hopes thatthe positive developments in relations between theStates of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and theIslamic Republic of Iran will lead to a peacefulresolution of the dispute over the three islands — AbuMusa  Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunb — which allbelong to the United Arab Emirates. It also reaffirmsits support for all efforts to that end and hopes that thework of the tripartite ministerial committee establishedby the Gulf Cooperation Council will succeed infinding a solution aimed at ensuring the preservation ofthe region's security and stability  in an atmosphere ofamicable and natural relations among all its States andpeoples.The Middle East peace process has witnessed and continues to witness  developments  bothpolitically and on the ground  as evidenced by thecontacts and negotiations between the PalestinianAuthority and Israel  including  most importantly  theCamp David summit  held recently under the auspicesof the United States of America  with a view toreaching a final agreement between the two parties.Further  the contacts that have taken place inWashington in search of a possible resumption ofnegotiations on the Syrian-Israeli track are among themost significant developments in the peace process thisyear  despite the failure of such efforts owing toIsrael's refusal to withdraw completely from the SyrianArab Golan to the borders of 4 June 1967.Insofar as the situation on the ground isconcerned  the withdrawal from southern Lebanon which Israel was forced to carry out as a result of thesteadfast opposition and heroic resistance put up by thebrotherly Lebanese people against the occupation constitutes a significant turning point in the peaceprocess and demonstrates that occupation can in noway ensure security.The developments through which the peaceprocess has gone on all tracks and in all stages haveshown that the success of the process and theachievement of the desired just  comprehensive anddurable peace are contingent upon the implementationof Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338(1973) and of all relevant resolutions of internationallegality  which call for the withdrawal of Israel from allArab territories occupied since 1967 and acknowledgethe legitimate rights of the Palestinian people including the right to establish their own independentstate  with Jerusalem as its capital.In accepting peace  with all the steps it entails  asa strategic option  the Arab side had hoped that Israelwould implement all these resolutions and fulfil theterms of all agreements and commitments  as well asabide by the principles of the 1991 Madrid Conference notably the principle of land for peace.We believe that a fully comprehensive solution isa fundamental prerequisite for the achievement of ajust  durable and comprehensive peace in a regionwhose peoples have been beset by conflicts andinstability  which have drained their resources andabilities in the context of a heated and futile arms racethat has deprived all parties of security. In order to savethe peace process from total collapse and failure  wecall upon the co-sponsors of the peace process and theinternational community to redouble their efforts andpressure Israel into meeting the requirements of peaceby fully implementing all resolutions of internationallegality.Despite the easing of global tensions with respectto certain regional and international issues  there arestill issues in a number of different regions that giverise to concern on the part of the internationalcommunity and that threaten security and stability  bothwithin those regions and beyond.It is unfortunate that internal strife persists inAfghanistan and the Democratic Republic of Congo  aswell as in other areas. We therefore call once again for4the intensification of efforts to find solutions to suchconflicts and to encourage the parties to direct theirefforts and capacities towards the settlement of theirdisputes and the development of their countries andsocieties. We are pleased  in this connection  towelcome the recent positive developments in Somalia which have led to the election of a President in thatcountry. We appreciate all the efforts that have beenexerted towards that outcome  which  we hope  willbring about security and stability for Somalia and forits brotherly people.Furthermore  it is our pleasure to express oursatisfaction at the agreement reached in Algeria thisyear between two neighbours  Ethiopia and Eritrea  andour appreciation for the efforts exerted in this directionby the Organization of African Unity and theconstructive role played by President AbdelazizBouteflika of the brotherly People's DemocraticRepublic of Algeria.It is perhaps true to say that the globalization ofthe economy and the stunning developments in thefields of information  communications and scientificinnovation — which have torn down the barriers to theflow of international trade  facilitated the transfer ofcapital across borders  made interaction among variouscultures inevitable and made every State in the world aneighbour to all other States — have both pros andcons and therefore constitute a great challenge for thefuture.The misgivings with regard to globalization havebeen amply discussed and identified. Foremost amongthese is the fear that it will weaken States' nationalauthority and their ability to act freely in determiningthe levels of their own economic and socialdevelopment  which would have a serious effect on theliving standard of the peoples of those States. Thesituation therefore requires a reform of theinternational economic order so as to enable it to dealwith the financial  economic and social ramificationsand consequent difficulties of globalization  whoseprimary victims are likely to be developing and poorsocieties.The process of economic globalization anddevelopment has given rise to many challenges for theworld economy and the international community. Thepositive aspects of globalization  as perceived by some such as the smooth transfer of products  goods andservices across borders and the immense advances ininformation technology  should be coupled with abalance between global and national economic policies.Despite the benefits of globalization in the fieldsof information technology  electronic commerce education  health  social development  access tomarkets and consumer benefits through the ability tocompete  there is fear that globalization's adverseaspects might affect numerous segments of developingsocieties that might not have the ability to benefit fromthe opportunities provided by globalization  given theirinability to compete — thereby increasing poverty andthe marginalization of vast sectors of the population.It is in the interest of the international communitythat the progress accompanying globalization beutilized to achieve economic growth and integration  toassist in the eradication of poverty and to achievesocial equality and development by way of directingthe process of globalization in a humane manner inorder to mitigate its adverse effects. We must deal withthis phenomenon in a manner conducive to theestablishment of a world where a balance of interests isstruck and where equality  mutual interest and anhonourable way of life are available to all  withoutexception.It is our pleasure to express  in this context  oursupport for the decisions and recommendations of theSouth Summit held in Havana and the Summit of theGroup of 15 held in Cairo in June 2000  and thecontents of the final document of the twenty-fourthspecial session of the General Assembly  held inGeneva last June  to follow up the implementation ofthe Copenhagen World Summit for SocialDevelopment in respect of the human dimension ofdevelopment.Among the challenges that mankind and ourinternational Organization must address in the newcentury is the conservation of the environment and themitigation of the adverse effects of economic industrial and technological developments in the world.Such a task undoubtedly requires a global effort to bemade within the framework of the continuingimplementation of the world programme for theprotection of the environment set out in Agenda 21 which was adopted at the United Nations Conferenceon Environment and Development  by linking theinterests of the developed countries with those ofdeveloping countries  while using all means andmachinery available to fight pollution for the sake of5safeguarding our children and grandchildren from thedangers of a planet spoiled by human activity.Another challenge is the military one posed bythe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction andnuclear capabilities and their means of transfer  whichhave increased in many regions of the world in the pastfew years. Given the threat to the world's future security and safety that such weapons pose  it is awelcome sign for mankind as a whole that the StatesMembers of the United Nations have welcomed theReview Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  held in NewYork in April and May 2000  and that the nuclearPowers have agreed on the total elimination of nuclearweapons.Aware of the dangers of the proliferation ofnuclear weapons  especially in the light of the wars andconflicts that our region has witnessed in recentdecades  we in the Middle East  including the Gulfregion  have supported all initiatives aimed at freeingthe region from all weapons of mass destruction  inparticular nuclear weapons.The gravity of the phenomenon of terrorism —which has intensified in recent years  challenging thewill of the international community and posing a threatto the security and stability of States and peoples — isof concern to us all. In reaffirming our condemnationof terrorism  regardless of its form  cause or origin  wecall for further measures to combat it  to punish itsperpetrators and to prevent them from practising theiractivities by denying them shelter.It is incumbent upon us to reaffirm and reactivatethe role of the United Nations in order to meet andeliminate these challenges in the framework of thecollective partnership provided for in the Charter  oneof the most important objectives of which is to replacewar and confrontation with dialogue and cooperation.We are convinced  however  that the momentumgenerated by the Millennium Summit and by theemphasis in its Declaration on support for the role ofthe United Nations in promoting harmony ininternational relations and maintaining world peace andsecurity can be exploited only through theimplementation of the essential reforms of theOrganization's organs and bodies  especially theSecurity Council  by adhering to the principle ofequitable geographic representation and transparency which are among the most important elements thatenhance its role in the maintenance of internationalpeace and security.The advent of the third millennium  with all thehopes it inspires  requires us all to consider andevaluate the action we should take to correct theconcepts and adjust the machinery through which wehope to achieve peace  security  prosperity and well-being for all in a framework of close internationalsolidarity on the basis of the oneness of the human raceand its mutual interests. The unique characteristics ofthe cultures  civilizations  religious beliefs and socialtraditions of various societies and peoples should beused to promote understanding  rapprochement andinteraction among all States and peoples in a world oftranquillity  justice  security and peace.The millennium to which we look forward is onein which we hope relations among peoples will beenhanced and dialogue and cooperation will replacewar and conflict  which bring nothing but devastationand destruction."
"19",764,"BHS",55,2000,"The Bahamasdelegation sincerely congratulates Mr. Harri Holkeri onhis election to the presidency of this MillenniumAssembly and assures him and the members of hisBureau of its full cooperation and support.I wish also to commend Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab ofNamibia  who presided over the fifty-fourth session ofthe General Assembly.The Bahamas delegation also wishes to payspecial tribute to the Co-Chairpersons of theMillennium Summit  Ms. Tarja Halonen  President ofFinland  and Mr. Sam Nujoma  President of theRepublic of Namibia. Their combined wisdom andfocused leadership contributed in no small part to thesuccess of the Millennium Summit.The Bahamas is pleased to welcome Tuvalu as thenewest Member of this Organization. Tuvalu'smembership is a sign of the confidence that the UnitedNations continues to enjoy among nations of the worldas the best hope for the realization of the aspirations ofall peoples.We applaud the Secretary-General's continuingcommitment to the United Nations. This wasparticularly demonstrated by his bold proposals for thereform and revitalization of the Organization  whichculminated in the practical  responsive and visionaryMillennium Summit Declaration. The Declaration wasunanimously adopted by an unprecedented number ofheads of State or Government. In this MillenniumDeclaration  world leaders collectively and succinctly22outlined the labyrinth of issues on the global agendafor which solutions are essential in the twenty-firstcentury. It is now our responsibility to implement it ingood faith. It cannot be business as usual in this UnitedNations.The Millennium Declaration placed globalizationhigh on the list of issues requiring urgent attention. Asa process offering opportunities for growth anddevelopment  globalization has never been challenged.It is a grim reality  however  that few have profited  andsome  particularly smaller economies  have becomemarginalized and even more vulnerable.For many of the small island developing States ofthe Caribbean  their mainstay industries  particularlybananas and financial services  have come underextreme pressure in this rapidly globalizing world.With respect to financial services  the Bahamas hasalways cooperated  and will continue to cooperate  withinternational efforts to combat money laundering.Currently we are amending our legislation andreinforcing our regulatory regime so as to fully complywith international best practices.While the Bahamas will move expeditiously tocorrect deficiencies in our financial services industry we call upon the Financial Action Task Force onMoney Laundering (FATF) and the other concernedfinancial agencies established by developed countriesto immediately adopt open and transparent proceduresto recognize when such deficiencies have beencorrected and to then take the necessary action as amatter of priority.Additionally  it has been a source of seriousconcern to us in the Bahamas that one group ofcountries  the Organization for Economic Cooperationand Development (OECD)  would seek to unilaterallydetermine what constitutes “harmful tax competition”in respect to financial services. We urge those countriesto cooperate in resolving these issues on the basis ofconstructive multilateral dialogue  given that thepressures applied in this and other areas not onlydisrupt growth and development  but could well lead tothe reversal of the gains made in the developmentprocess.The intensity of protests in Seattle and inWashington  D.C.  have mirrored the frustration ofmany developing countries in a globalization processwhich appears to be biased towards the rich andpowerful and to widen the gap between haves andhave-nots. Yet no country can opt out of globalization.Nor can we ignore the challenge its potentiallydevastating consequences present for peace andsecurity. The United Nations resolve that globalizationmust be fully inclusive and equitable should bebuttressed with effective action to ensure a vibrantglobal economic order in which all countries  large andsmall  developed and developing  mutually benefit.The Bahamas is now an observer in the WorldTrade Organization (WTO) and will move purposefullytowards full membership. We have chosen to take thiscourse of action because we intend to participate fullyin the WTO processes. These processes should  andmust  make globalization and trade liberalizationinclusive and equitable instruments for development.We made this commitment at the highest level at theMillennium Summit.There is another commitment in the MillenniumDeclaration that is of critical importance to smallisland developing States such as the Bahamas and othermembers of the Caribbean Community. TheMillennium Declaration reaffirms the United Nationsresolve to address the special needs of the small islanddeveloping States by implementing both the BarbadosProgramme of Action and the outcome of the twentysecond special session of the General Assembly on thisplan. It did so in recognition of the vulnerability oftheir economies to external shocks and theirsusceptibility to climate change  sea level rise andnatural disasters.I wish to re-emphasize here that the call in theBarbados plan is for action. In line with theMillennium Declaration and their own national efforts the small island developing States now expect action through initiatives such as global disaster managementstrategies and a vulnerability index. Such initiativesmust take fully into account the socio-economicdevelopment and survival of small island developingStates. For Caribbean Community (CARICOM) smallStates  we also hope to see the development of anintegrated management approach to the Caribbean Seaadvanced.We would also  in this United Nations  urge ourpartners in the developed world not to continue to putour countries at risk by shipping nuclear and hazardouswastes through the Caribbean Sea. We reiterate thisappeal in the face of recent evidence that suggests that23the highly professed safety measures touted by thenuclear-power industry are questionable.In the Millennium Declaration  world leaderscommitted themselves to overcoming many seeminglyintractable problems for which effective responses canonly be of a global nature.The world's drug problem  and the trafficking insmall arms and light weapons  are issues for which theglobal community urgently needs results. While thesetwin evils are  in our view  closely linked  everyindication is that the trafficking in firearms is taking ona life of its own. The introduction of firearms intoordinary  non-drug related criminal activity  and evendomestic conflict  is perhaps the greatest single threatto peace and stability in the Bahamas today.Therefore  the Bahamas looks forward to nextyear's United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade inSmall Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects. Weare confident that the commitments made in ourMillennium Declaration will motivate us to grasp thissignificant opportunity for concerted action. Weespecially urge developed countries in which firearmsare manufactured to take the steps necessary to preventillicit arms trafficking.In the Millennium Declaration  world leaderscommitted themselves to the eradication of poverty hunger and disease  and to making the right todevelopment a reality for all. This commitmentcompels us to act on several fronts to achieve ourobjectives. We must  for example  reach agreement toensure the success of the high-level international andintergovernmental event on financing for development to be held in the year 2001.Our commitment means that we must ensure thattechnological advances benefit not just the few  but allof humankind. We must work more assiduouslytowards the elimination of human rights violations including violence against women and the traffickingin women and children. We must ensure equal rightsfor men and women  to bring down barriers todevelopment. For countries such as the Bahamas forced to bear the brunt of sustained illegal migration the United Nations must collectively address not onlythe challenges of migration flows worldwide  but alsothe reprehensible practice of alien-smuggling.Our commitment means that we must achieve acomprehensive reform of the Security Council.Addressing the unfolding human tragedy of HIV/AIDS is also an important front on which theMillennium Declaration charges us to work. Thepernicious effect of this disease  particularly on theeconomically productive sectors of society  has had adevastating impact on families  communities andnations globally. However  the major burden that AIDSpresents  particularly for health care systems  has beenmost profoundly felt in developing countries  where itthreatens to limit and reverse development efforts.Adequate resources must be provided to confront HIV/AIDS  particularly in Africa. In this regard  thepharmaceutical industry must be encouraged to play itsnecessary role.The Bahamas welcomed the recently convenedconference in Barbados under the auspices of theWorld Bank  UNAIDS  the Pan American HealthOrganization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO)  the United Nations Development Programme(UNDP)  CARICOM and the Canadian InternationalDevelopment Agency (CIDA)  which brought togetherhigh-level Caribbean health  education  economicdevelopment and labour policy-makers. The Bahamasis committed to doing its part in addressing this seriousproblem and has offered to host a regional centre toassist in combating this HIV/AIDS pandemic.The agenda set for the United Nations by worldleaders is a formidable one. Forgive me if I restate theobvious — the Secretary-General cannot carry out thecrucial mandates we ourselves have entrusted to himunless and until he is assured of adequate andpredictable resources on a timely basis. At the sametime  the quotas on the basis of which the Organizationreceives its resources must be assessed in a fair transparent and equitable manner. Only in this way willwe be able to give renewed impetus to the vibrantprocess of administrative and budgetary reformcurrently under way. By so doing  we will also breakthe cycle of the Organization's inability to implementthe mandates that we ourselves have collectively set.Furthermore  we must arrest the process wherebymany issues  including some of critical concern todeveloping countries  have been moved out of theambit of this universal Organization into narrower special interest organizations. These organizationsharmonize and seek the interest of their Member States.Therefore  the decisions they take can run counter  notonly to the interest of non-Member States  but also tothat of global society as a whole.24Allow me to raise one more serious concern - thesafety and security of our international civil service the dedicated men and women who are the embodimentof the United Nations global outreach. In this respect we extend our profound condolences to the families ofthe staff members who lost their lives as a result of therecent attack on the United Nations office in WestTimor. We also join other delegations in condemningthis attack and in urging the Government of Indonesiato spare no effort in bringing those responsible tojustice. We also extend condolences to the family ofthe United Nations refugee worker killed in an attackin Guinea. In situations such as these  we must showthat we can meet the concerns of our peoples and ourworld.Through the historic Millennium Declaration heads of State and Government reaffirmed their faith inthe United Nations and its Charter as indispensablefoundations for a more peaceful  prosperous and justworld. They also emphasized that the United Nations isthe pre-eminent global organization and has a centralrole in setting and acting upon the global agenda.Heads of State and Government equally provided uswith a concise  focused and realistic blueprint foraction by the United Nations in the twenty-firstcentury. They have charged the Secretary-General tokeep a score-card  the results of which will determinewhether we have been true and honourable custodiansof the United Nations Charter. It is imperative for us todemonstrate individually  and through our collectiveefforts  that we can leave for succeeding generationsthe kind of world envisioned in our Charter."
"20",789,"BIH",55,2000,"At theoutset I would like to extend my warmestcongratulations to the President on his well-deservedelection. I also wish to express our sincere appreciationto His Excellency Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab for hisdevoted work  tireless efforts and dedication whilesuccessfully presiding over the fifty-fourth UnitedNations General Assembly.The Millennium Summit that concluded only afew days ago has reaffirmed the unanimous belief ofthe world leaders that only together  guided by thespirit and the objectives of the founding fathers of theUnited Nations and respecting the established systemof principles  norms and standards of internationalrelations and international law  can we successfullyrespond to the challenges of the twenty-first century.Despite its weaknesses  imperfections  inadequateefficiency and sometimes missed opportunities  theconsequences of which were partly felt in my country the United Nations succeeded in maintaining globalsecurity  in containing several local and regionalconflicts  in preserving peace and in facilitating thenormalization of life. It has been successful in offeringrelief and hope to the most unfortunate ones. Again my country experienced this side of the United Nationsas well. In this respect  we again welcome theSrebrenica Report and subsequent Brahimi Report.28If all this was achieved mostly under theconditions of the confrontations of the cold war  in aclimate of mistrust and in the century during whichhumanity not only achieved the highest objectives butalso touched the lowest depths  there should be nodoubt that the United Nations can fulfil its new tasks.Addressing this Assembly on behalf of the country thatin the memory of humankind is associated with theeruption of the First World War  an event that was anearly omen of the entire tragedy of the twentiethcentury  I would like to express hope that at the veryend of this century  after all the horrors of the SecondWorld War and after the inconceivably tragic conflictsfollowing the dissolution of the Socialist FederalRepublic of Yugoslavia  Bosnia and Herzegovina hasexhausted all the misfortune of being at the epicentreof historic earthquakes. And I hope that  under theauspices of the United Nations  Bosnia andHerzegovina is ready to gain anonymity through aspeedy recovery and blessed  long-lasting and happyprogress.The United Nations through its activities has andwill continue to influence the developments in theworld. It has to follow the rapid and very often radicalchanges in international relations and to adjustaccordingly and find the best ways to exercise itsduties and its role. The reform of the United Nations nodoubt is a very delicate issue. But its postponement andendless debates that only maintain the status quo are aneven greater issue. Furthermore  these things bring intoquestion the ability of the United Nations to modernizeand democratize in order to improve its capacity andefficiency. An agreement has been reached on some ofthe most crucial issues regarding the reform of theSecurity Council  including the increase in itsmembership  both its permanent and non-permanentseats  to include the representatives of the developedand the developing countries and to provide moreequitable geographical representation of the countries.I believe that by adopting this minimum of initialreforms of the Security Council and throughcontinuous work on the other related issues  such asthe issue of the veto  a favourable atmosphere wouldbe created and this would positively influence relationswithin and all the activities of the United Nations.In our address to the General Assembly a yearago  our delegation announced that we would like tobecome a more active member of the internationalcommunity  primarily of the United Nations. We saidthat we were determined to move from the position ofthe recipient of the concern and attention of theinternational organizations and forums  a position inwhich we were placed for more or less well-knownreasons  to the position of a contributor tointernational efforts. The fact that we are in a positionto consider the need or even the imperative of taking amore active and creative role  and thus a bigger shareof responsibility  testifies to the trend of normalizationof the situation in our country  which was ravaged by awar only five years ago. Although small in number  anintegrated group of 13 policemen from both entities comprising representatives of all three constituentpeoples  who only recently were fighting eachother  have been deployed with the internationalpeacekeeping force in East Timor. Furthermore  withsignificant assistance from and the endorsement of theUnited Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina(UNMIBH)  efforts to form a joint unit composed ofthe military from both entities are under way. Onceestablished  the unit would be sent to a peacekeepingmission under the United Nations flag. We areconsidering very seriously the possibility of presentingthe candidature of Bosnia and Herzegovina for a non-permanent seat in the Security Council after the year2010. In this way  we are confirming our commitmentto the stabilization and normalization of life in ourcountry  and particularly our commitment to economicand democratic development. We are confident that  asearly as 10 years from now  Bosnia and Herzegovinawill succeed in becoming a member of the mostimportant body of the United Nations.Although we display courage in expressingreadiness to take a larger share of responsibility as aMember of the United Nations and of other regionalorganizations  we are fully aware that we still need theinternational presence in Bosnia and Herzegovina  thatwe still need its assistance and support in thenormalization of life  in eliminating the consequencesof war and in preparing ourselves for self-sustainabledevelopment and progress. Implementation of theDayton/Paris Peace Agreement still remains the mainfocus of the activities of the authorities in Bosnia andHerzegovina at all levels. Its implementation is also theprimary focus of the international community and itsrepresentatives in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Imperfectas the Peace Agreement undoubtedly is  this cannot bean excuse for a lack of commitment to itsimplementation. For it is exactly its consistentimplementation that can bring us closer to the point at29which it would be normal  and even unavoidable  toestablish a new framework and new directions forBosnia and Herzegovina's progress towards higherlevels of development and higher living standards.However  this will only be possible when the commoninstitutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina become a placeand an instrument for the realization of commoninterests and objectives of both of its entities and of allof its constituent nations and peoples  instead ofbeing a locus for very costly obstructions andconfrontations to the detriment of all  in particularthose who want to return to their homes.In many areas throughout Bosnia andHerzegovina in the past 12 months progress has beenmade. This is encouraging and indicative of the factthat in many fields of life things could advance fasterand more successfully along the road towards desiredand needed progress.The return of refugees and internally displacedpersons still remains the priority. There continue to becases in which returnees have to flee their only recentlyrebuilt homes when faced with brutal attacks byneighbours of different ethnicities or religions. But atthe same time it is encouraging that more often thereturnees are welcomed by their neighbours andoffered assistance and support. During the first sixmonths of this year three times more so-called minorityreturns were registered compared to the same periodlast year. However  the number of returns is consideredto be even larger  since not all returns have beenregistered or have not been fully completed as yet. Theother positive development noticed in the returns is thefact that among the returnees there are more and moreyoung people and families with school-age children which was not the case in the past  when only so-calledelderly households returned to their homes. Thisprogress  of course  may be the result of improvedsecurity conditions  freedom of movement  somewhatbetter infrastructure or offering assistance with therepairing of houses or apartments; but  above all  thisprogress is the result of a growing awareness on thepart of the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina that it issavage  illegal and inhuman to deprive people of theirsacred rights to home  life and security.Returns were also significantly increased becauseindicted war criminals were more successfully broughtto justice and because of a more independent  morereasonable and more constructive engagement on thepart of the media. Still  the role of the internationalcommunity in achieving all that has been mentioned in particular the role of the High Representative  thePeace Implementation Council  the United NationsMission in Bosnia and Herzegovina  the StabilizationForce  the Office of the United Nations HighCommissioner for Refugees and the Organization forSecurity and Cooperation in Europe  is irreplaceable.In this context  I would like to take thisopportunity to express our gratitude to the members ofthe Security Council for inviting the three members ofthe Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina to NewYork last November on the occasion of the fourthanniversary of the Dayton/Paris Peace Agreement. Thatvisit resulted in the adoption of the New YorkDeclaration. Implementation of the provisions of theDeclaration brought about major achievements: theestablishment of the State Border Service  theformation of the Secretariat of the Presidency andimprovements that facilitated the functioning of thisjoint institution  the reconstruction and enlargement ofthe Council of Ministers  and the creation of conditionsconducive to the return of refugees and internallydisplaced persons. Also  as a related activity  the firststeps in organizing the battle against corruption havebeen taken.The decision of the Constitutional Court ofBosnia and Herzegovina on the constituency of all thethree nations in Bosnia and Herzegovina will have far-reaching consequences for overall developments inBosnia and Herzegovina. This decision should reducethe unique ethnic and religious apartheid anddisenfranchisement of citizens belonging to the so-called minority nations. Among the achievements thatencourage and have a positive impact on the change ofthe overall climate in Bosnia and Herzegovina must bementioned those made in the area of the judicialsystem. Those achievements are reflected in theprofessionalization of judges and prosecutors and intheir modernization. Through the establishment ofmulti-ethnic police comprising uncompromisedprofessionals  training and education of youngpolicemen in police academies  composition of policeforces that reflect the demographic picture of the localpopulation  the space for abuses is thereby narrowed and an environment favourable to arbitrary behaviourand unpunished harassment and oppression of citizensbelonging to so called minority nations is eliminated.It is my pleasure to inform the Assembly thatsignificant efforts are being made in the promotion and30protection of human rights and civil freedoms inBosnia and Herzegovina in all fields.In the course of preparing for the WorldConference against Racism  Racial Discrimination Xenophobia and Related Intolerance  we will requestthat government bodies  courts  the police force schools and universities  non-governmentalorganizations  religious institutions and their leadersand distinguished individuals from different spheres oflife  challenge those who still advocate and practisedifferent forms of discrimination and intolerance andstep on human rights  freedoms and human dignity.We  in Bosnia and Herzegovina  are aware thathealing the consequences of war and post-warstagnation and removal of impediments to fasterstabilization and progress rests primarily with thedomestic political leadership.We are also aware that the future of Bosnia andHerzegovina is in its integration into European andother institutions. The Stability Pact for south-easternEurope has therefore been accepted as a frameworkconducive to regional cooperation  elimination ofmistrust  strengthening of security conditions and forcatching up with missed opportunities in the spheres ofhuman rights and democratic emancipation andeconomic progress. Bosnia and Herzegovinawholeheartedly embraces the Stability Pact as the mostimportant regional endeavour so far  convinced that despite the slow realization of a number of projects anddespite the slower inflow of contributions  itsobjectives are fully consistent with the objectives ofBosnia and Herzegovina's foreign policy. Theachievement of these objectives would embark us onthe road to faster integration into the Council ofEurope  the European Union  the World TradeOrganization and the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization. There is no doubt whatsoever that theFederal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) shouldparticipate in the Stability Pact  but we share the viewsof those who condition its participation on thenecessary democratic changes in that country. At thesame time  we consider that the other countries of theregion should not be kept hostage by the FRY on theirway to Euro-Atlantic integration. In this context  wewould like to recall that  at the early stages of theestablishment of the European Union  there was nowaiting list for the present members of the Union andthat they did not have to pass the entering examinationsuccessfully and simultaneously. At this point in time the waiting lists and admission procedures could becounterproductive and could encourage those forces inthe region  including in my own country  to persist incontinuing the state of chaos and exclusion.At the beginning of this year  the situation in theneighouring Republic of Croatia has been significantlyimproved by the opposition victory in the elections. Anumber of issues that burdened the relations betweenthe two countries have practically been resolved  sincesome of the issues were tackled in the bilateralmeetings at the highest levels immediately after theelections. The change brought about by the electionsalso positively influenced the return of refugees although more visible results in this area are still tocome.However  regrettably  there is still noimprovement in relations with the FRY and  at thispoint  it is still uncertain when the improvement mightoccur. For sure  without democratic changes in Serbia the establishment of full diplomatic relations betweenBosnia and Herzegovina and the FRY could hardlyoccur. The democratic changes in the FRY certainlywould positively reflect on the internal relationsbetween the two entities of Bosnia and Herzegovina aswell as on overall relations in the region. Thedemocratic changes in the Bosnia and Herzegovinaneighbourhood have certainly cut off the influx ofexported elements of destabilization and crisis. I havealready referred to the positive example of changes inCroatia.We  in Bosnia and Herzegovina  must gather thecourage and strength to face our reality and to choosethe path and the direction that would lead us speedilytowards the achievements that would compensate forthe decade of suffering  deprivation and missedopportunities. In the process of making this clear andrational choice  we would like to count on theunreserved support of the international community  andon a rather sooner than later integration into Euro-Atlantic institutions. We have to say that thisintegration is already very much behind schedule andwe do not have a lot of time to waste."
"21",836,"BLR",55,2000,"Let me first welcomeTuvalu as a new Member of the United Nations.The current session of the General Assembly isan important landmark for the international community.We are still feeling the beat of the Millennium Summit.Our crucial task now is to seek specific ways toimplement the provisions of its final Declaration.In his address to the Summit  PresidentAlyaksandr Lukashenka of Belarus clearly defined anultimate objective  as we see it  for shaping the imageof the United Nations in the twenty-first century  whichis to meet the needs and aspirations of our respectivenations and seek practical opportunities for realimprovement of the quality of life of every singleindividual. This is the imperative that reality has beendictating to us. It is also the main thrust of theSecretary-General's report (A/54/2000) “We  thepeoples: the role of the United Nations in the twenty-first century”.Belarus holds in high respect the unique historicrole played by the United Nations in internationaldevelopments of the second half of the twentiethcentury. As can be seen from all the Organization'sprevious experience  a stable  just and prosperousworld can only be attained on the basis of the sovereignequality of States  their territorial integrity and politicalindependence  non-interference in their internal affairs20and respect for national traditions. Humanity has had toconfront conflict and humanitarian stress every timethose principles were disregarded. We believe that theywill continue to be of similar importance in the nextcentury.Just as was the case 55 years ago  there is hardlya more pressing task for the United Nations than themaintenance of international peace. All Member Stateshave equal rights to peaceful and sustainabledevelopment. Thus the security of no State  whethersmall island country or super-Power  can be achievedthrough disrespect for the interests of others.The Republic of Belarus is committed to itschoice of a nuclear-weapon-free world. We believe inthe generosity and great meaning of the initiative bythe head of our State to establish a nuclear-weapon-freespace in Central and Eastern Europe. We are confidentthat in due time this idea will receive a sufficientnumber of proponents.During this session Belarus has deposited itsinstruments for ratification of the ComprehensiveNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and the additional Protocol tothe Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons  theProtocol on Blinding Laser Weapons. At the same time a continuing absence of visible consensus within theUnited Nations on the key issues of the internationaldisarmament process is becoming a dismaying reality.To exit this dead end would essentially require settingpriorities and embarking upon an active dialogue aimedat achieving progress in both nuclear and conventionaldisarmament. Five million victims over the pastdecade — is this not serious enough to make realaction imperative?It is crucial to maintain and consolidate thestrategic global parity built under the complexconditions of the twentieth century. In this regard preservation of and respect for the Anti-BallisticMissile (ABM) Treaty is a logical basis for themaintenance of international stability. Its violationcould result in an extremely dangerous disruption ofthe established set of interdependent agreements in thisarea. The Republic of Belarus will again sponsor theresolution on the ABM Treaty during this session.The time-span between the two most recentsessions of the General Assembly has been marked bythe United Nations active involvement in the peacefulsettlement of disputes  post-conflict peace-building andrehabilitation. We observe with satisfaction the actionstaken by the Security Council  more resolutely andconsistently than in the past  with respect to suchcomplex situations as conflicts in Sierra Leone  theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  Ethiopia andEritrea  Angola and East Timor. My country has beenfollowing with hope the developments in the MiddleEast. We believe that the withdrawal of Israeli troopsfrom Southern Lebanon and the Palestinian-Israelipeace talks will favour the resolution of the crisis in theregion.For over a quarter of a century attempts havebeen made to break a stalemate in the settlement of theCyprus problem. It is crucial that the United Nationscontinue its work to resolve this crisis on the basis ofthe appropriate resolutions of the Security Council andthe General Assembly.The development of specific preventive measuresfor the elimination of root causes of potential conflictsshould be the focus of United Nations attention in thenear future. It is important to make irreversible thegrowing trend in international efforts to defineuniversal mechanisms and specify practical measuresof conflict prevention and crisis management. Theactivities of the Panel of experts headed byAmbassador Brahimi  in addition to the upcomingConference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms andLight Weapons in All Its Aspects  are an importantcontribution thereto.As the Secretary-General has rightly observed the very credibility of the Organization as regardsplaying a decisive role in the war and peace process isat stake. In this respect  the Republic of Belarus hasbeen and remains firmly committed to the preservationof the primary role played by the Security Council indecision-making on actions to avert threats to peaceand security. Viewed from that perspective  furtherimprovement in the working methods of the Counciland reform of its membership on the basis of equitablegeographic representation are not merely an importanttask  but a pressing imperative.Belarus reconfirms its determination toconstructively contribute to the activities of theCouncil should my country be elected as a non-permanent member for the period 2002-2003.The tremendous benefits of globalization will bereduced to nothing unless there is a clear understandingof the dire need for the international community tolearn a common language — that is  the language of21law. In recent years we have witnessed practicaldemonstrations of situations in which even the slightestdeviation from internationally accepted norms wouldinevitably present an extreme danger not only for theviolators themselves  but also for the entireinternational community. It is an encouraging fact thatsince its outset the United Nations has gainedsignificant potential by accumulating all the far-reaching ideas  hopes and aspirations of humankind forbuilding a better world.Implementing the norms of international law atthe national level should become a priority for theUnited Nations and its partners. Today my country is aparty to the United Nations most important conventionsand treaties. The establishment of a legislative modelbased on the United Nations Charter and internationaltreaties and conventions  complemented by nationallegislation  is the objective we must all strive for.The stability of the interdependent world ishardly attainable when the system of internationalpolitics is perceived solely as the domination of oneState or interaction among separate groups of States.Differences in social and economic advancement willpersist for a long time. Therefore  in a globalizingworld the United Nations should play a more activerole in promoting the economic development and socialprogress of all countries.Belarus supports a sharper focus in internationalefforts on the problems of the developing countries particularly in Africa. We also deem it expedient totake into account the needs of countries witheconomies in transition  which would by no meanssoften the focus on the problems of the developingworld. We see no contradiction in such an interlinkage as appropriate goals and objectives to this end couldonly be formulated jointly with the United Nations.The Republic of Belarus shares the apprehensionsexpressed by many States over the environmentalfuture of our planet. In this regard  we perceive ashighly indicative the debates at the Millennium Summitand at the Summit meeting of the Security Council.Belarus has signed and ratified a number of importantinternational agreements in the area of environmentalprotection  including the United Nations FrameworkConvention on Climate Change and the Convention onBiological Diversity.Against this background  we continue to beacutely sensitive to the ever-diminishing interest by theinternational community in the Chernobyl disaster  theworld's largest technological catastrophe of the pastcentury  to which Belarus fell a major victim. In thisregard  I should like to quote once more from theaddress by the President of our country at theMillennium Summit:“Without awareness of our joint responsibility forpreserving the common human environment  alldiscussions of a fair distribution of the benefitsand disadvantages of globalization will remainjust shallow talk.” (A/55/PV.4)We are confident that the United Nations  which has sofar contributed significantly to assisting our people inthe relevant area  will be in a position to find newsources and mechanisms to help Belarus overcome theChernobyl tragedy.The ideas of democracy and respect for humanrights can certainly play a key role in continuoushuman development in the twenty-first century. Yet tomake this goal attainable  it is essential to relinquishattempts to use those principles to discriminate amongpeoples and “punish” unwelcome States andGovernments. Regrettably  we must note a certaininvolvement by the United Nations in efforts toestablish a “club of countries of advanced democracy”on the basis of some random criteria. It is inadmissiblethat the idea of the forum of new and restoreddemocracies approved within our Organization shouldlead to the separation of peoples into teachers andpupils.The principle standpoint of Belarus on this issueis the following: a truly democratic world can only bebased on an equal dialogue among differentcivilizations.This year is of special significance to thedevelopment of democracy in my country.Parliamentary elections due in October will be held infull conformity with democratic standards. We haveinvited international observers to monitor the electionsand look forward to seeing them carried out andcontributing in real terms to democratic development inBelarus.Each session of the United Nations GeneralAssembly is a milestone in the evolution of the UnitedNations itself and the development of the system ofinternational politics as a whole. In that sense  thecurrent session has been endowed with very special22powers. It is up to us all to determine how much theUnited Nations will be able to show that the hopes andaspirations of our nations at the dawn of the newcentury were justified. In the discharge of these nobleduties  the international community can invariablycount on a due contribution by the Republic of Belarus."
"22",871,"BLZ",55,2000,"On behalf of the Belizedelegation  I extend my congratulations to you  Sir  on yourelection to the presidency. Your vast experience ininternational affairs will greatly aid in our deliberationsduring this fifth-fifth session of the Assembly. We areenriched by the presence of our newest Member  theRepublic of Tuvalu; we welcome Tuvalu to our UnitedNations family with the assurance of Belize's cooperationand support.The recently concluded Summit  which produced aprogressive and far-reaching resolution  has set the pace forour deliberations during this general debate. Although thegoals are ambitious  their achievement is crucial to thefuture of the United Nations. In his brief address to theSummit  my Prime Minister stated:“we are called to a new appointment with history: tobring democracy to global governance  to share abetter and more productive future where all can livein dignity and peace.” (A/55/PV.3)Together with the goals put forward in the Declaration  thissets before us an agenda for our way forward.In moving forward  we must begin by rededicatingourselves to upholding the fundamental principles of ourCharter  principles which seek freedom from fear and wantin a world where discrimination and hate are eradicated andthe right of all people to live peaceful  quality lives isrealized.These ideas are as relevant today as they were 55years ago. Despite the many advances we have made  manyof us continue to allow our differences to lead to conflict which results in overwhelming suffering and hindershuman development. We must avoid these costly conflicts for without peace we cannot grow.At its inception  this institution recognized that peaceand the elimination of war were essential to humandevelopment. Although we seem to have reduced thelikelihood of another global conflagration  we continue  atthe regional and local levels  to allow our differences todivide us  resulting in overwhelming suffering  whichfurther hinders progress and development.As a global institution  we must actively work to endall conflict. Our peacekeeping efforts must therefore beproactive and efficient. Our forces must protect innocentwomen and children; provide refuge to those who seek topromote principles of democracy; and rise up against rogueindividuals and organizations that threaten to underminedemocratic Governments. To achieve this  let us firstcommit ourselves to reinforcing the preventive capacity ofthe United Nations peacekeeping forces.2Belize regards peacekeeping operations as animportant component of the United Nations. We agree thatfor our forces to be effective  they must be well equippedand capable of defending themselves. We continue to meetthe financial commitments assigned to Belize based on theprinciple of capacity to pay. We welcome the recentBrahimi report  which is progressive and takes acomprehensive look at our peacekeeping efforts. Mydelegation supports the recommendations it advances.Belize adheres to the principle of the peacefulresolution of conflicts  and in this spirit continues to workwith Guatemala to arrive at a negotiated and peacefulresolution of our differences. Belize will comply with therecently agreed framework established through theOrganization of American States.For some time now  this institution has engaged in aconversation on development for the future and  morespecifically  on globalization. For developing countries globalization  as it exists today  poses serious concerns thatseem to fall on the deaf ears of those who continue to pushus along what is obviously a destructive path. While wewelcome the promises of this new economic order  wecontinue to fear globalization in its current form  for whatwe have seen so far is neither responsible nor sustainable. Itis not sustainable because those who lead the way seek onlythe advancement of their personal interests.The proponents of globalization advised that marketliberalization would lead to prosperity. We wereencouraged to transform our economies and create moreeffective and efficient government. We have tried  andcontinue to try  to do so. However  our call for assistancewith this transformation has not always been heard.However  much of what has been asked of most of us  wehave done. The fact that today in Central America and theCaribbean every nation is legislated by a democraticallyelected Government and that we have opened our borders markets and lifestyles to others  demonstrates ourcommitment to transparency and effective governance.In Belize  we have done our part to ensure equitabledevelopment. We enjoy a vibrant and working democracywhere 85 per cent of our voting population exercise theirfranchise to vote; we have an open economy where all areencouraged to participate; and we have formed partnershipswith civil society to address social needs and protect ourprecious environment. We have been responsible  yet allwe see of globalization is the threat of the elimination ofour current economic sustenance. If this is the legacy ofglobalization  then those of us who have suffered at thehands of this new order must ask if globalization today isresponsible  if it is good. We continue to believe that it canbe.(spoke in Spanish)In the current economic order  small economies suchas ours can aspire to a productive future only if thearchitects of this new modality provide us with thenecessary assistance. Developed countries must committhemselves to a process of globalization that is not onlyfree  but fair. Just as they request the opening up of ourmarkets  such institutions and the administrators ofglobalization must be more open  democratic andrepresentative. Thus  just as we work with civil society tohelp us to deal with our political and social needs  theymust work together with the international civil agencies sothat the needs of the poorest can be provided for. We willnever achieve the objective of just world if povertycontinues to affect our people. The eradication of poverty isour moral duty.(spoke in English)We agree that true sustainable development cannotoccur without the protection and preservation of ourenvironment. This must be a path that combines the effortsof all nations. We in Belize understand that we have aglobal responsibility to protect our natural resources. Thatis why we are signatories to the Framework Convention onClimate Change and are in the process of signing the KyotoProtocol. However  our efforts can be effective only ifothers are equally committed. We encourage our developedpartners to continue to honour the commitments they madein Rio to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions in atimely manner. Currently  over 40 per cent of Belizean landis under protected status  our precious coral reefs areclosely monitored and our tropical rain forests carefullymanaged. Together with local non-governmentalorganizations  we are seeking an adequate balance betweenthe protection of our natural resources and the fulfilment ofthe development needs of our people  while agreeing thatour environmental protectionism must work in harmonywith our developmental needs.Much has been accomplished over the past year. Onsocial issues  we reaffirmed our commitment to thedevelopment of women during the Beijing + 5 conference.The Copenhagen + 5 conference addressed the need forgreater social development and  together with our partnersin the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)  Belize activelyparticipated in the Review Conference of the Parties to theTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons3(NPT). Belize continues to push for an end to the shippingof nuclear waste through the Caribbean Sea.These successes  however  should not distract us fromthe suffering and injustices still being endured by millionsof people. In Africa the situation in Angola  Sierra Leoneand the Democratic Republic of the Congo concerns us.The spread of the HIV/AIDS virus is alarming; we must dowhat is necessary to assist those afflicted.We are troubled by the situation in Timor. Therecent events  which resulted in the death of UnitedNations peacekeeping personnel  were tragic. We alsolearned of the death of another United Nations officialin Guinea. We condemn these acts  and join with theSecretary-General in expressing our condolences to thefamilies of those who gave their lives for the cause ofpeace.Belize joins others in support of the Middle Eastpeace process. We continue to support the right of thePalestinian people to self-determination. Likewise  wecall upon this Organization to recognize the desire ofthe 23 million people of the Republic of China onTaiwan for the opportunity to contribute and participatein the work of this Organization and other internationalbodies.The Millennium Declaration  adopted by ourheads of State and Government  reminds us of ourresponsibility to protect those fundamental values suchas freedom  equality  solidarity  tolerance  respect fornature and responsibility. It calls for collective actionto be undertaken by developed and developing nationsto advance the cause of peace  protect our children andpreserve the planet for future generations. These aregoals that can be achieved through greater inclusionand genuine concern for each other. We must find newways of thinking to help us reform these institutions which create inequality and therefore divide us. Let uscommit ourselves to reducing redundancy  eliminatingwaste and refining our responsiveness to Memberneeds  but let us do it quickly.The United Nations is our truest form of globalrepresentation. It possesses the capacity to elicit thebest from all of us. Together  our ability to accomplishthese ideals set out in the Millennium Declaration ispossible. Let us rededicate ourselves to its fulfilment."
"23",918,"BOL",55,2000,"The Government of Bolivia has given me the task ofconveying its most sincere congratulations to you  Sir on your election as President of the General Assemblyat its fifty-fifth session  which is a recognition of yourpersonal merits and a tribute to your country. At thesame time  I thank Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab for his workduring the fifty-fourth session and for his dedicationduring the preparations for the Millennium Summit andthe Millennium Assembly.Special thanks must also go to Secretary-GeneralKofi Annan for his report preparatory to theMillennium Summit  the content of which has given usan opportunity to reflect upon and address specificissues with which the United Nations has beenconcerned in its 55 years of existence.We also welcome the recent admission of Tuvaluas a new  fully fledged Member of our Organization.10The recent Millennium Summit reaffirmed therecognition by the international community of theimportance and significance of  and the prospects for the United Nations Organization. It also highlighted theurgency of adapting it to  and equipping it for  the newrealities in which we live  which are certainly quitedifferent from the situation and circumstances thatprevailed when our Organization came into being.The concerns of peoples and Governments todayare also different. Poverty  underdevelopment andexacerbated inequalities contribute to new divisions which threaten to lead to violence. These realities mustbe corrected  because they have the potential ofspawning conflicts that  if allowed to persist  couldseriously jeopardize the world's economic and politicalstability  and  it goes without saying  internationalpeace and security.Our Organization needs to be strengthened if it issuccessfully to channel the expectations andopportunities of globalization while controlling  andindeed preventing  the dangers implicit in it  especiallyfor the more vulnerable economies  which are nowthreatened by new forms of exclusion.The United Nations must be renewed so that itcan continue to be the effective instrument for dialoguethat is required to build a world in which greatersecurity and solidarity prevail.We must consequently redefine theOrganization's priorities in such a way as to make itconducive to clear-sighted and effective action. Thiswill require substantial reform of the system'seconomic and financial bodies  modernization of theGeneral Assembly's methods of work  and theadaptation of the Security Council to these newrealities. Other  equally important tasks includeensuring that the necessary resources are available tothe Organization; obtaining financing for developmentand peacekeeping operations; and adjusting the scale ofassessments in accordance with the basic principle of acountry's capacity to pay.A few short days ago  at the Millennium Summit the President of Bolivia  Hugo Bánzer Suárez  referredto the close relationship between freedom and poverty and between poverty and violence. He called for thefight against poverty to be waged in accordance withthe principle of shared responsibility and with agenuine commitment to democracy  in order to mitigatepresent inequalities  which are threatening to intensify.It is unfair  in an open economy  for markets to beclosed and for discriminatory measures to be appliedwith protectionist intent. It is also vital to favourcountries with small-scale economies through greatercapital inflows and debt relief programmes.Science and technology must become the heritageof humankind. Scientific and technological knowledgemust not widen already existing gaps and divisions.At the historic meeting of South AmericanPresidents  held recently in Brasilia  the heads of Stateof the region stressed the importance of access to thenew information and knowledge age  which will openthe way for our countries to strengthen a system ofcontinuing education that ensures education at alllevels for the all sectors of society and permitsunrestricted access to knowledge and information.Democracy  which essentially seeks to organizelife in society  is a vital concept that changes and isupdated in tune with the changing pace of societiesthemselves  without in any way detracting from itsfundamental values. Convinced as we are thatdemocracy must go beyond electoral formalities andthat sovereignty is vested in the people and expressedthrough its representatives  we in Bolivia have declaredthe principle of political dialogue and consultation tobe the basis of a pluralistic and participatorydemocratic system.In that context  the practice of holding a nationaldialogue was instituted during the administration ofPresident Bánzer. That mechanism is aimed atestablishing a new relationship of joint efforts andshared responsibility between Government institutions the political system and organizations throughoutsociety. The creation of key State policies grew out ofthe first such national dialogue  held in 1997.This year  a national dialogue has been initiatedonce again to lend fresh impetus to institutionalreforms and to put together a national anti-povertyprogramme. A new plan  involving over 3 000inhabitants in townships across Bolivia  is beingelaborated whose objective is to assign rights andresponsibilities that  within the framework of a marketeconomy  will make it possible for us to combat thepoverty that still afflicts vast sectors of our population despite nearly 20 years of life under democracy.Shortly after taking office  in August 1997 President Bánzer Suárez vowed that during hismandate Bolivia would be removed from the drug-trafficking loop once and for all  through theimplementation of an integrated policy thatencompasses alternative development  the eradicationof illegal coca crops  confiscation  prevention andrehabilitation.Despite doubts as to the feasibility of this plan we can now affirm that we will be fulfilling ourcommitments ahead of time. In 1997  there wereapproximately 38 000 hectares of illegal cocacultivation in Bolivia. Today  more than 80 per cent ofsuch illegal crops have been eradicated.Our concern now is essentially whether we cansustain these achievements. Conditions must be createdwhich in future will obviate a return to coca-leafproduction as a result of the lack of jobs and income.Our major efforts now are aimed at alternativedevelopment  to see to it that illegal coca income isreplaced by legal earnings from other productiveactivities. If we do not achieve concrete results  we runthe risk of seeing those persons who cannot hope tofind any other means of subsistence fall once againprey to the temptation of cultivating coca. That wouldconstitute a surrender to the drug dealers and signify adefeat not only for Bolivia but for the worldcommunity.What Bolivia needs  then  is support in two basicareas: first  in the area of investment  to promote oureconomic growth in the sectors that generate the mostjob opportunities; and secondly  in the opening ofsecure markets for our exports.At previous sessions of the Assembly  Bolivia hasaired the historical  political and economic argumentson which it bases its absolute need to regain themaritime status that gave rise to its existence as anindependent country. To that end  Bolivia has beenencouraging direct dialogue with the Republic of Chile.As a consequence of prior contacts  the ForeignMinisters of Bolivia and Chile met in Portugal inFebruary this year  where an agreement was reached toprepare a working programme  to be formalized in thesubsequent stages of dialogue  that will incorporate without exclusion of any kind  the essential points of abilateral relationship and seek to surmount thedifferences that have impeded full integration betweenBolivia and Chile  the main obstacle to which hascertainly been Bolivia's unresolved maritime demand.In a significant advance  on the occasion of the recentmeeting of Presidents of South America  the Presidentsof Bolivia and Chile  Hugo Bánzer and Ricardo Lagos reiterated the willingness of their Governments to enterinto dialogue on all topics relating to bilateral relations without exception  in order to create a climate ofmutual trust enabling the establishment of closer tiesbased on the structure and positions maintained by thetwo countries.The world community  the Americas in particular is following with great expectation the course of thisdiplomatic process and the progress achieved therein.The proposal to hold a dialogue on all topics withoutexception is a challenge to the creativity of thoseinvolved and puts to the test our political will to correctonce and for all an unjust situation that has prevailedsince 1879. Furthermore  Latin America's capacity tosettle its own disputes in a fair  peaceful and negotiatedway will be strengthened and progress thus made onthe road to regional integration.In that context  we propose the implementation ofa programme to promote the integrated development ofwestern Bolivia and northern Chile. We are alsoconfident that Peru will participate in this programmein order to mobilize the resources and capabilities ofthe three countries of the region. In this way  acontribution will be made to linking the Atlantic andPacific basins. The persistence of Bolivia's landlockedstatus at the heart of the continent is  without doubt  anobstacle to the creation of a major opportunity forthoroughgoing understanding and dialogue in the SouthAmerican region and minimizes the effectiveness ofwork to promote integration being carried out in thearea.This occasion provides a fitting opportunity forus to thank Secretary-General Kofi Annan for hisinterest in relations between Bolivia and Chile  whichhas been brought to the attention of the authorities ofboth countries. The Secretary-General has expressedhis satisfaction with respect to the conversations held according to the terms laid down by the parties  at thelevels of heads of State  Foreign Ministers and otherauthorities of Bolivia and Chile.My country pledges to make every effort totranslate the desire recently expressed by the Presidentsof Bolivia and Chile into action that will enable us Bolivians and Chileans alike  to advance towards theresolution of our differences  with a view to the futureand in a spirit of brotherhood.12"
"24",965,"BRA",55,2000,"Brazil applauds yourelection  Sir  to preside over the fifty-fifth session ofthe General Assembly of the United Nations. Yourpersonal political experience and Finland's historiccontribution to the promotion of peace  human rightsand social development are valuable credentials thatyou bring to the honoured task of chairing our work.On behalf of the Brazilian Government  I paytribute to your predecessor  Foreign Minister Theo-BenGurirab. His diplomatic skills and commitments to thehighest ideals of the United Nations insured him adecisive role at the helm of the fifty-fourth session.I wish to make a very special reference to ourSecretary-General  Kofi Annan. His moral authorityhas served as a beacon as we strive to fulfil theprinciples and goals of the United Nations. His report “We the peoples: the role of the United Nations in thetwenty-first century”  is a contribution of fundamentalimportance to the cause of peace and justice  and to astronger United Nations. It will serve as a permanentsource of inspiration as we ponder the crucial decisionsthe Organization is called upon to make.Brazil had the satisfaction to co-sponsor theresolution bringing Tuvalu into the United Nationsfamily. We salute Tuvalu as our newest member.For the sixth consecutive time it is my honour totake part in the opening of the general debate. On allprevious occasions  I took stock both of the positiveand negative aspects of the current state of worldaffairs  the facts that afford us satisfaction and thosethat are cause for frustration and even indignation. Thisis our daily challenge and the motivating force behindour work.We meet here for the last time this century. We allknow that the twentieth century has been marred by afundamental contradiction. We have seen a growingabundance of intellectual and material resources thatshould have brought about a greater convergence ofopportunities and expectations as well as of livingstandards throughout the world. Yet  what we also sawwas a failure to harness the necessary political will totranslate those extraordinary possibilities into a realityof progress shared by all. This applies not only to theinternational community as a whole but is equally validfor the great majority of nations represented here among which is Brazil itself.No doubt  we have much to gain in identifyingthose aspects of our relations with the internationalenvironment that are a hindrance to nationaldevelopment. Yet it is equally illuminating to seekwithin our own countries examples of success andfailure that help explain the world we live in.Globalization is asymmetrical in part because it flowsfrom national societies that are themselves sociallyunbalanced and seem to have lost some of their urge tobring about social justice.Freedom — the greatest of values — continues toadvance on all fronts and in all continents. That is acrucial development. There is cause for concern however  that the core values of equality and fraternityare dangerously being put aside. It is imperative thatthese two other essential elements return to the top ofour agenda. They must retake their rightful place at thecentre of our policy decisions before it is too late —before some are misled into believing that theinevitable price for preserving freedom is theperpetuation of the divide between the rich and thepoor  between those who are included and those whosuffer exclusion  between the “globalized” and thoseleft behind.If democracy and freedom are to put down firmroots within our countries  we must foster a genuinesense of solidarity that translates into effective action.Only thus will we build an international order that isconducive to the preservation of peace and canfunction as an engine of sustained growth. It isunacceptable that major global issues and campaignsfor transnational solidarity be manipulated andexploited in order to disguise what amounts to theprotection of narrow interests. Unfortunately  this iswhat is happening in the field of international trade.First  the inconsistency between free traderhetoric and the continued use of protectionist policiesof various types by developed countries. As I stated atthe World Trade Organization conference in Seattle  thename of this game is discrimination. Anddiscrimination  especially when waged against theweakest  is the absolute negation of solidarity. We must5reverse these grave distortions in international trade and especially as concerns agricultural products.It is inadmissible that the most prosperousnations  whose economies are strongly based in themanufacturing and service industries  should be legallyentitled to restrict access to their markets foragricultural goods  while they call for the free flow ofthose goods in which they benefit from an enormouscompetitive advantage. It is even more intolerable thatthese countries be allowed  as is presently the case  tosubsidize the production and export of agriculturalcommodities to the tune of dozens of billions ofdollars. These policies cause enormous harm toexporting nations that are more efficient andcompetitive in this field  but lack the financial meansto offer equally generous fiscal incentives to theirfarmers.Secondly  not satisfied with the persistence of thishighly discriminatory situation — where what is saidoften deviates from what is done — there are those inthe developed countries who give voice to sectionalinterests and defend a new offensive against theexports of developing nations. This is what the newlanguage of protectionism  camouflaged ashumanitarian internationalism  would seem to suggest.It unfurls the seductive banner of labour andenvironmental standards  which  if adopted  wouldfurther restrict the access of products from developingcountries to the markets of rich countries.This rhetoric and its appeal to certain segments ofpublic opinion might suggest that the exports ofdeveloping countries pose a threat to the economicwell-being and the way of life of the more developedsocieties. We all know this is not true. After all  theseexports represent less than a third of world trade andare made up mostly of raw materials.The main objective of those who wish tointroduce labour conditionalities into trade rules haslittle to do with improving the quality of life ofworkers in poor countries. Their fundamental aim is toprotect backward sectors of their own economies thatstrictly speaking are no longer capable of competingeffectively in a free trade environment.Sanctions and commercial barriers are inadequatetools to enhance labour standards and to protect theenvironment in developing countries. Our countriesand our own societies  more than any other  areinterested in achieving those very same objectives which is why we need more — not less — exports andeconomic growth.This is a message that developing countries mustmake ring out in a clear and powerful voice. We mustinstil in developed societies an understanding that theyare not alone in the world. Above all  they must notpresume to unilaterally write the rules of internationaltrade solely according to their interests and points ofview  as if the other 5 billion human beings did nothave equally legitimate aspirations to progress  justiceand well-being.Nations must come increasingly to comprehendand respect differing realities and objectives amongthemselves. At the same time  they must recognizetheir commonalties and affinities; explore and enlargeareas of convergence and opportunities for cooperation;and overcome suspicions  rivalries and disputes.Nowadays it is above all through regionalintegration that this learning process takes place. Formost countries  it opens the door to a more intensiveand meaningful participation in global affairs.In the Americas  and more specifically in LatinAmerica  we have set ourselves firmly on this course.The countries of the region are increasingly integratedamong themselves and into the world. These are thetwo inseparable faces of the same forward movement.A few days ago in Brasilia  on the initiative ofPresident Fernando Henrique Cardoso  a meeting ofPresidents of South America took place for the firsttime in our history. This gathering sought to bringtogether the leaders of South America around thecommon challenges that grow out of our sharedgeography and physical proximity. It is only naturalthat this first meeting should have occurred in Brazil which shares borders with nine of its 11 SouthAmerican neighbours  and has lived in harmony withall for over a century in a spirit of peace  friendshipand growing determination to move ahead on the roadto full integration.The Presidents took important and concrete stepsin this direction that will bear lasting fruit. In thepolitical realm  they agreed to underscore thecommitment of the countries of South America todemocracy and decided that participation in futureSouth American gatherings would hinge on thepreservation of the rule of law and full respect fordemocratic values and procedures. They also agreed to6hold consultations among their Governments in theevent of a threat to democracy in our region.In trade matters  they resolved to beginnegotiations on a free-trade zone betweenMERCOSUR and the Andean Community  to beestablished before January 2002 and to be expandedinto an economic zone covering all of South America including Chile  Guyana and Suriname. To this end thePresidents decided to coordinate the planning andfunding of projects for integrating the region'sinfrastructure  in particular in the priority areas ofenergy  transport and telecommunications. By workingtogether in this way we will more quickly set up thephysical links that will enhance South American unity.Drug trafficking and organized crime are issuesthat affect  in different forms  all regions of the world.The Presidents highlighted the role of the Organizationof American States in the fight against drugs in thehemisphere and the setting up last year of themultilateral evaluation mechanism to assess theperformance of our countries in this effort. They alsodecided to establish systematic consultations amongnational agencies and to set up a South American anti-laundering task force.The meeting of Presidents of South America wasan event unique in the almost two centuries ofindependent nationhood for most of the subcontinent.As well as having historic significance and long-termimpact  this summit will also generate results in theimmediate future.None is more significant than the commitment todemocratic values. President Fernando HenriqueCardoso was very much to the point when he said:“the South America of today is synonymous withdemocracy ... In this dawning of democracy  wewill not tolerate abuses. And we will increasinglydemand the right not only to vote  but to defendfreedom  access to information and the judicialguarantees that make elections an effectiveexercise in democracy”.The United Nations has seen importantachievements over this last year. Let me recall a few.The goal of creating a more just  tolerant society wasreaffirmed during the follow-up world conferences onwomen — Beijing +5 — and on social development —Copenhagen +5. At the Non-Proliferation Treatyreview conference  modest but nevertheless significantprogress was made towards freeing the world from thescourge of nuclear arms. As one of the New Agendacountries  Brazil is proud of its contribution to thesuccess of the conference  whose results will be alitmus test for future advances in the nucleardisarmament field.Efforts to establish an International CriminalCourt have moved ahead  and Brazil signed the RomeStatute. Those that commit crimes against humanitymust not  under any circumstances  go unpunished.In the Brahimi report (A/55/305)  a valuableframework has been laid out on how to strengthen thework of United Nations peacekeeping operations and as a result  on how to overcome recent failures. Thecourageous Rwanda and Srebrenica reports offer us aprecise diagnosis of what needs to be done.In Timor  under the leadership of a modelinternational official  Sergio Vieira de Mello  a newState is taking form and coming to life. We express ourstrongest condemnation of the attack on innocentworkers at the United Nations office in Atambua  WestTimor  who were helping to achieve this very goal.In contrast with these achievements  thefrustrations are well known. Peacekeeping operationsin Sierra Leone and in the Democratic Republic of theCongo have still to show results; the conflict in Angolagoes relentlessly on as a result of UNITA's inexcusablefailure to comply with international directives and law;and there is growing awareness of the devastatingdimensions of the AIDS epidemic in Africa and in therest of the world.Less than a week ago  in a historic meeting in thisvery Hall  world leaders took stock of the work andachievements of multilateralism. The outcome was aclearer reaffirmation of our determined andunequivocal commitment to reinvigorate the UnitedNations. We reinforced our convictions about thecrucial role of this Organization in ensuring that justiceis done and that international peace takes root.Brazil has always been convinced of this.In the absence of the United Nations  humanrights would be more vulnerable; the distance betweenantagonists would be wider; the difficulties ineradicating poverty would be greater; the growth oftolerance would be slower and democratic practiceswould face even stronger opposition.7It may be that the Millennium Summit only gaveexpression to what we already knew. The historiclegacy of this Summit should  then  be our renewedwillingness to act.We all know that it is by mobilizing political willthat we can make a difference. The United Nations isthe model political forum of the internationalcommunity and its central goal is to provide the waysand means to bring to life our dearest ideals  values andaspirations.In this hall there has often been a divorcebetween words and deeds  between objectives and thetools to achieve them  as if they hailed from differentuniverses  distant and isolated from each other.It is only through political dialogue  andconsultation among States made possible bymultilateralism that a degree of rationality andpredictability can be brought to the workings of globalforces.To foster multilateralism is to strengthen theUnited Nations and the modern understanding of theindividual as the central beneficiary of internationalaction. Only thus can we look forward to progressiveand just governance in this integrated world.It is our obligation to fulfil our commoncommitments  so vigorously underscored during theMillennium Summit. We must do so with determinationand a sense of urgency."
"25",1009,"BRB",55,2000,"I join other delegations incongratulating Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland on hiselection to preside over the proceedings of the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly  and on Finland'sable service as Co-Chairperson of the MillenniumSummit. My delegation's appreciation is extended alsoto the outgoing President  the Foreign Minister ofNamibia.I take this opportunity also to express the distinctpleasure of the Government of Barbados at the fact thatanother member of the fraternity of small islanddeveloping States  Tuvalu  has recently taken its placeat our table.Five short years ago  the United Nationscelebrated its fiftieth anniversary with a massivegathering of world leaders not much different from theevent which engaged our attention for the better part oflast week. Then as now  the report card was weighed;then as now  amid critical assessment of its deficienciesand calls for bold reform  the Organization's continuedvalidity was ultimately recognized and its unique andinherently positive role in multilateral relationsemphatically supported.We hope that this time the Millennium Summitwill have served as more than just a familiar echoreverberating  unchanged  at five-year intervalsthrough these chambers  magnified among the myriadmurmurs that linger from other occasions of25specialized summitry. For there is nothing inherentlymagical about the passing of a millennium  or a decade or even a quinquennium. Indeed  the proliferation ofplus fives in this place is enough to confound theentire fraternity of mathematicians and accountants.And none of us is totally confident that the finalreckoning will leave us on the plus side of the ledger.On the contrary  it seems  sadly  that we have becomeconsumed by the show  not the substance; the process not the result; the plan  not the implementation.In this  the last year of the second Christianmillennium  as we review the progress of the peoplesof the planet over the past century  we find that  onbalance  humankind has not done very well. In manyfundamental ways  the twentieth century has not livedup to the promises and expectations that an era markedby such far-reaching technological change andinnovation should have produced. In contrast  it hasushered in a time of unprecedented violence andsuffering  visited mainly upon innocent civilians byinternational and internal warfare fought withincreasingly sophisticated and deadly weaponry.The end of the ideological divide has not beenfollowed by an era of peace and development  as wehad all anticipated  but by a horrendous upsurge ingenocidal  religious and ethnic conflicts. The threat ofnuclear proliferation and biological warfare has onlypartially receded  and the scourges of terrorism  narco-trafficking and transnational crime continue to scarinnocent lives and threaten democratic governance.While a few thousand souls live in obscene luxury  halfof the world's population subsist on less than twodollars a day  and millions remain desperately poor with no prospects of bequeathing a better life to theirchildren. The new plague of the twentieth century AIDS  continues its decimation  with disproportionateeffects upon the poor in the developing world. In sum our modern civilization has not evolved into a caringand enlightened species  but rather into one that hasoften abused the positive aspects of its heightenedcapacity and modernization to the detriment ofhumanity and of the earth.We well know that the United Nations is not  andcannot be  the panacea for all the problems of thetwenty-first century  but we are convinced that it canand should serve as a mechanism through which theGovernments of the world  and their people  can workin common cause to find real solutions to the mostpressing global problems and challenges. In ourincreasingly interdependent world  there is little chanceof success for unilateral action. This applies equally tothe Organization's mandates for the maintenance ofinternational peace and security and those for thepromotion of economic development and socialprogress.Since the Organization's creation in 1945  theinternational landscape has changed considerably.Internecine and intra-territorial conflicts based onreligious and ethnic differences have escalated  and theUnited Nations has seen its peacekeeping role usedmore in the last decade than ever before. At the sametime  the effectiveness of that peacemaking andpeacekeeping capacity has been called into question byinternational public opinion and Governments alike.We continue to expect miracles of the United Nationsin ending the bloodshed in the most troubled corners ofthe world  but we seldom provide it with the tools  thefinancing and the appropriate mandate to allow fortimely and decisive action. Without this support United Nations peacekeeping efforts will remainreactive  and not preventive.One of the most complex issues currently beingdebated in the context of an enhanced role for theinternational community in the maintenance ofinternational peace and security is the clash betweenthe opposing tenets of sovereignty and humanitarianintervention. My delegation believes that this is amatter of such fundamental importance that it requiresin-depth discussion and the elaboration  by broad-basedconsensus  of clear new rules under international law.For while we do not believe that the internationalcommunity can stand idly by in the face of massive andgenocidal violations of the human rights of citizens bypower-hungry tyrants  we must at the same time ensurethat any international response to such situations is notinfluenced primarily by the national ambitions of thirdStates.Decisions must be based on clearly definedcriteria  informed by an objective verification of thefacts. Action must be confined to the saving of lives not the overthrowing of Governments. Humanitarianintervention  however compelling the circumstances must never be used as a guise for unwarrantedinterference in internal State governance.The balance sheet for the twentieth century in thearea of economic and social development is similarlymixed. While the United Nations  through its26specialized agencies and programmes  has made greatstrides in the fight against hunger  disease anddeprivation  that progress has not been evenlydistributed. The goal of the alleviation and ultimateeradication of poverty remains largely unfulfilled  withdesperate consequences for the growing numbers of theworld's population who live in extreme poverty.Structural adjustment  the errant compass of the so-called lost decade of the 1980s  has taken its heavysocial toll. So  too  has the burden of debt  which despite the promise of debt forgiveness for the leastdeveloped countries and special initiatives for thehighly indebted poor countries  continues to constrainfuture economic prospects for a large number ofdeveloping countries. At the same time  the decline inofficial development assistance has had a direct impacton the most vulnerable sectors of society  I refer towomen  children  the elderly and the infirm.The Secretary-General has challenged theinternational community to set a target for the halvingof the numbers of the population living in extremepoverty by 2015. For this to be achieved  there is anurgent need for a higher level of political will and ashared commitment to create the necessary social andeconomic framework to enable the poor anddispossessed to redirect their lives.Education remains the most powerful tool forensuring social progress and the betterment of livingstandards for the underprivileged. It is therefore one ofthe most disappointing truths of this closing centurythat the international community has failed in itscollective endeavour to eradicate illiteracy  especiallyamong children. Although in the developing world theadult literacy rate has increased by half  from 48 percent in 1970 to 72 per cent in 1998  the informationrevolution now threatens to create a new category offunctional illiterates. The eradication of illiteracy andthe provision of at least primary basic schooling areeminently achievable goals.As an engine of social mobility  education standsas the most important component in ensuring thesuccess of an individual and of a society. It is thegreatest social liberator and facilitator of peace and isone of the fundamental pillars supporting democracy competitiveness and social stability.The development of my country  Barbados provides ample proof of how education can empower apeople and foster upward mobility for each succeedinggeneration. Education has always been one of thehighest priorities for the Government of Barbados anda major source of budget expenditure. We are one ofthe very few countries where access to education isfree at point of delivery  mandatory up to 16 years ofage and universal at the primary  secondary and tertiarylevels. Currently  the Government of Barbados isembarked upon an ambitious programme within theschools known as EDUTECH 2000  which aims toensure that every child is equipped to functionsuccessfully in the new information age.As we approach the new century  the world facesprobably one of the most disastrous threats to itssustainability  a threat which has ended the lives of anunimaginable number of persons  crippled theeconomies and threatened the productive workforce ofsouthern Africa  and taken an increasing toll in Asiaand in my own subregion  the Caribbean. I am referringto the pandemic of AIDS/HIV.Current estimates indicate that there are over 33.4million people worldwide who are now infected withthe disease. In the Caribbean region alone  that figurenumbers some 330 000  which is an astounding andfrightening statistic to contemplate for a country likeBarbados  with a population of 267 000 people. Ourregion has the highest prevalence per capita in thewestern hemisphere  and a prevalence second only tothat of sub-Saharan Africa. It has been reported by theJoint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS(UNAIDS) that  every day  there are 16 000 new HIVinfections and that 95 per cent of all reported AIDScases occur in the developing world.The AIDS pandemic is  in our view  the gravesteconomic and social crisis facing the global communityas we enter the twenty-first century. Many of ourleaders and policy-makers are only now beginning tograsp the enormity of the problem and to fullyappreciate the devastating impact which AIDS ishaving  and will continue to have  on the economicsustainability of every country  from the smallest  mostundeveloped nation to the largest  most economicallyviable State  because AIDS is not only a human and asocial tragedy  it is also an economic one. It attacksour present workforce not only in its productive  butalso in its reproductive capacity  thus simultaneouslydecimating the economic potential of two generations.It is a sobering reality that AIDS is now the leadingcause of death among young men in the Caribbean  andit is projected that the disease may cause a decline in27the region's gross domestic product by as much as 4 to6 per cent over the next decade.We cannot tackle this grave crisis solely on thebasis of current strategies and financial flows.Containing the spread of AIDS and dealing with itseconomic impact is an immediate priority which willrequire a major commitment of human and financialresources. In this regard  I am pleased to note theserious attention now being given to the crisis by theWorld Health Organization (WHO)  the World Bankand other international financial institutions. Justyesterday in Barbados  a major conference wasconvened under the auspices of the World Bank UNAIDS  the Pan American HealthOrganization/WHO  the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme  the Caribbean Community and theCanadian International Development Agency to bringtogether high-level Caribbean health  education economic development and labour-policy makers tomap out a new crisis strategy for the Caribbean region.Barbados applauds the recommendations of theSecretary-General that the United Nations should adoptas an explicit goal the reduction of HIV-infection ratesin persons 15 to 24 years of age by 25 per cent withinthe most affected countries before the year 2005 and by25 per cent globally by 2010. The United Nations mustmake AIDS education and research a priority for thecoming century. Determined leadership is needed topersuade Governments and internationalpharmaceutical companies that a partnership must bedeveloped to combat the disease  both through researchand through the provision of drugs at reasonable cost tothose who are most in need.The trafficking in and abuse of illegal drugs haveparalysed the development of many of our societies.They have also eroded the productivity of the workforce and led to social discord  violence and aconspicuous erosion of values and respect for the ruleof law. The countries of the Caribbean have notremained untouched by this affliction  both astranshipment and  more recently  sadly  as consumingStates.In the fight against this menace  the UnitedNations Drug Control Programme (UNDCP) hasplayed a crucial role and its subregional office inBarbados deserves special mention for its activesupport for our own efforts. In Barbados  UNDCPassistance has been invaluable in the establishment ofthe Integrated Drug Programme through our domesticNational Council on Substance Abuse and also infacilitating our community outreach efforts. Ofparticular note too  has been its role in theestablishment of an Anti-Money Laundering Authorityin Barbados.As a small island developing State  Barbados isvery aware that the natural environment performs forus free basic services without which human beingscould not survive. At the same time  certain industrialand technological advances have threatened thebiodiversity of many of the small island developingStates. Therefore  for ecological reasons and forreasons of sovereignty and sustainable development Barbados  on behalf of the Association of CaribbeanStates  last year launched an initiative leading to theadoption of resolution 54/225 on promoting anintegrated management approach to the Caribbean Seaarea in the context of sustainable development. We aregrateful for the recognition by the General Assembly ofthe efforts of the Caribbean to protect and preserve ourmost precious resource.The functions of the Caribbean Sea are many andmulti-layered. It is the source of our food  it is the mainattraction which drives our tourism markets and it isour primary and most reliable link with the outsideworld. The destruction that would be caused if therewere an accident involving nuclear waste or oil in ourwaters would be beyond catastrophic and it would takecenturies for our environment to fully recover. We lookforward to continued assistance from the internationalcommunity in helping us to achieve the objectives ofthat resolution to maintain and protect this  our mostvital natural resource. It remains the ultimate goal ofthe region to have the Caribbean Sea recognized as aspecial area within the context of sustainabledevelopment.In this spirit  Barbados also welcomes the newlyestablished United Nations Open-ended InformalConsultative Process on Ocean Affairs and intends tobe an active participant in the consultative process. Wewelcome the efforts of the General Assembly toaddress the problems of over-exploitation of livingmarine resources and the degradation of the marineenvironment.The collective efforts of our Governments toalleviate poverty and disease and to help our humancapital to take full advantage of the opportunities for28economic and social advancement take place within theparameters of a challenging new international order.Naturally  I refer to the phenomenon of globalization.Globalization is not entirely new. It has existed invarious incarnations among trading nations throughouthistory. What makes the modern incarnation different however  is the manner in which the accompanyinginformation revolution is making possible theintegration of trade  investment  finance  productionand services across national boundaries. What alsodistinguishes it is the philosophy of multilateralism which offers all countries  developed and developing  asay  at least in theory  in shaping the rules whichwill henceforth govern international economictransactions. Nor is globalization as a conceptinherently negative. The precepts of expanding marketaccess  trade liberalization  increased technologicaladvancement and more efficient and effectivemechanisms of manufacturing and agriculture are allpositive elements. It is in the rigid application of theseelements  however  and their application without regardto the social dimension of development  that distortionshave arisen which threaten to widen further the incomegap between the developed and the developing worlds.I reiterate that the true challenge of the newmultilateralism will be to ensure that globalization doesnot become an instrument of oppression for the peoplesof the developing world  but  rather  becomes a meansof offering a better life to all of our peoples.In our efforts to sensitize the developed world tothe need for adequate transitional measures fordeveloping countries and for recognition of the specialvulnerabilities of small economies  Barbados hasfrequently pointed to the fact that our Caribbeancountries are being asked to undertake in 10 years aprocess which was carried out by the advancedindustrialized societies over a period of more than 40years  spread over eight rounds of multilateral tradenegotiations between 1947 and 1994. In this regard  wehave emphasized that  however clinically sound aprocedure might be  the compression of its applicationinto too short a time period can often be a fatal therapy.One of the greatest essential inequalities of thecontemporary global economy is that  while thedeveloped world was allowed an extended period overwhich to properly phase in trade liberalization  to itsbenefit  smaller  less endowed societies with less scopeto absorb the shocks of adjustment are expected tomake a potentially beneficial adjustment over anincredibly short period of time. It would not haveworked for the developed world; it will not now workfor the developing  and is in fact the considerationwhich argues the case for longer phase-in periods toapply the changes in the global trading regime.Barbados is not opposed to globalization. Wehave already indeed begun the process of restructuringour economy and repositioning our society to meet thatchallenge. But our efforts  we believe  must be met bya similar display of good faith on the part of the WorldTrade Organization  which must  as my Governmenthas repeatedly stated  review  repair and reform itself adopt an ideology that is developmental and embrace adevelopmental agenda that is progressive and balancedin its substance  its processes and its outcomes.That display of good faith is also necessary inpromoting constructive and mutually beneficialdialogue between the industrialized countries and theirdeveloping country partners on the crucial matter of theregulation of international financial centres in theirjurisdictions. My country has spoken extensively inother forums about our serious concerns over theunilateral manner in which the Organization forEconomic Cooperation and Development hasproceeded on its so-called harmful tax competitioninitiative  and on the real motives underlying thisunfortunate move. The setting of international rules inthe area of financial services cannot properly be doneby a grouping of 29 countries to the exclusion of allother interested parties. In this age of enlightenedmultilateralism there is no place for the application ofunilateral  extra-territorial solutions to internationaleconomic developments.On balance  we must not allow our frustration atthe many missed opportunities to obscure the fact thatthe twentieth century has produced much that ispositive. As we look forward  in the words of the PrimeMinister of Barbados  the Right Honourable OwenArthur:We face the prospect that the simultaneousoperation of the enormous power of technologicalchange  the dismantling of barriers to themovement of output  capital  ideas and skills  andthe emergence of rules-based  consensus-driveninstitutions of global scope will create a newglobal society that is capable of affordingdevelopment to all  and of putting the scourge ofpoverty behind us for ever. We will leave thetwentieth century and enter the twenty-firstconscious of the dangers  but excited by theprospects."
"26",1041,"BRN",55,2000,"Mr. President  I should like to offer you mycongratulations on your election and my best wishesfor the coming year  and also to convey my greatappreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Theo-BenGurirab  for his fine work and guidance over the pastyear.I would like to start by thanking our Secretary-General for his report to the Millennium Summit. It iscomprehensive  ethical and most impressive. We havenever had anything like it before. One effect it has hadis to give deep meaning to the expression theinternational community. I think that in the past  wehave often used this term far too lightly. Now we knowwhat it stands for. It is spelled out in the finalDeclaration made by our heads of Government  whichis now a textbook for the coming year. Its great ideasstill echo in this Hall  and its noble aims light up thefuture.In our view  it has given precise targets that cantruly help developing nations. For the first time  we candistinguish clearly between immediate issues and long-term ones. This is very important  because many of thethings on which we spend so much time and so manyresources are not  in fact  today's issues. They are sadlegacies passed on by the twentieth century.Obviously  they are important. Each one is tragicin the consequences it has for ordinary peoples' lives.But they are all primarily the responsibility ofGovernments and regional organizations. The morethey dominate the affairs of the United Nations  themore they stop us from concentrating on the deep-seated problems of developing nations. Those problemsare the ones that can truly be called today's issues. Asthe Secretary-General highlighted in his Summit report they are becoming very serious indeed. We have evenhad to give them a new name: transnational issues.They each have academic titles: technologicalproblems; demographic problems; socio-economicproblems; and environmental problems. But take awaythe grand language  and they all add up to a simplefact: they are far too big for individual Governments todeal with  or even regional organizations.It is all too clear that they will not be solved inthe marketplace  either. The solutions will not trickledown. In fact  the global market economy haslengthened their list and created its own set of specialproblems.It would all be very depressing indeed but for onething. The Summit Declaration has clearly invited usall  as Members of the United Nations  to accept a jointinternational responsibility to find solutions. Naturally we may differ on how to go about it  but what is mostimportant is that we have to recognize and accept theneed for new priorities. Consequently  we highly valuethe assessment made by the Secretary-General ofwhere these lie.For example  we appreciate his timely advice thatglobalization requires policies and measures that aresensitive to the needs of developing nations. We arepleased that he has upheld the peoples' right todevelopment as fundamental. We join him inrecognizing the special concern of our friends andcolleagues on the African continent. We support all thathe is trying to do to improve the efficiency andeffectiveness of the United Nations  because thisshould enable it to concentrate on what it does best andis best equipped to do.By this I mean the practical  urgent work done byits organs and agencies and its professionals andvolunteers  in the field  close to the people. Much ofthis represents development in areas such as educationand training  which are absolutely critical if the peopleof developing nations are to move beyond a day-to-daystruggle for basic food  shelter and medicine and takepart successfully in the new global economy.It means that the work of agencies such as theUnited Nations Educational  Scientific and CulturalOrganization (UNESCO)  the United NationsChildren's Fund (UNICEF) and the World HealthOrganization (WHO) is vital. It needs to proceedurgently and not be held back because essential fundsare diverted to solving ancient problems.The vital tasks of the United Nations todayshould not be held hostage by the twentieth century. Ithas urgent new work to undertake for developingnations. This work can be simply summed up. It is toensure that the phrase developing nations actuallydoes mean nations that are developing  rather thanwhat they too often tend to be  just a polite expressionfor the very opposite.The Summit Declaration offers us all the chanceto do just this  in friendship and cooperation  and Ihope that we will do everything we can to implementits provisions. It would be the best form of appreciationwe could offer to the Secretary-General and his staff atthe end of a remarkable year's work."
"27",1124,"BWA",55,2000,"I congratulate thePresident on behalf of the Botswana delegation on hiselection to lead the fifty-fifth session of the GeneralAssembly. He can count on our support as hedischarges his onerous responsibilities during thishistoric session and in the year that lies ahead.I also take great pleasure in saluting my brotherand colleague  the outgoing President  Mr. Theo-BenGurirab  for his outstanding leadership of the fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly — the lastsession of the twentieth century — and for steering itto a successful conclusion.Secretary-General Kofi Annan has continued togive a good accounting of himself as the chiefexecutive of this  our United Nations. We owe him adebt of gratitude for the manner in which he has without fear or favour  led the United Nations duringthe past four years.Five years ago  in this very Hall  we celebratedthe fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the UnitedNations. On that historic occasion  the former President12of the Republic of Botswana  Sir Ketumile Masire  hadthis to say about the United Nations:“The United Nations has served us well.Small States such as my own have found in theUnited Nations a vital forum for collectivebargaining. It has contributed to the advancementof international cooperation in solving economic social  cultural and humanitarian problems. It is acentre for harmonizing the actions of nations inthe attainment of these common ends.”(A/50/PV.37  p. 3)Botswana's faith in and commitment to theUnited Nations remains undiminished  and we are hereon the eve of the new millennium to renew that faithand to reaffirm that commitment.The United Nations begins the new millenniumheavily laden with the residual problems of theoutgoing century. Even as we meet here  bloodyconflicts of varying degrees of intensity and savageryare ravaging societies in many places around the globe.Endemic poverty holds sway in the developing world in contrast with the lavish opulence of the West.Diseases  the most virulent of which is the devastatingHIV/AIDS pandemic  have continued to cause untoldmisery all over the world  particularly in sub-SaharanAfrica. All these problems pose a serious challenge tothe United Nations and to the international communityas a whole. The character of the twenty-first centurywill no doubt be determined by our ability andcommitment to face this challenge.On the African continent  the struggle for peaceand against war remains an all-consumingpreoccupation. The agendas of the United NationsSecurity Council and the Organization of African Unity(OAU) attest to this vexing state of affairs. All theefforts of the leaders of Central and southern Africa which a little more than a year ago produced theLusaka Agreement aimed at bringing peace to the war-torn region of Central Africa  have thus far come tonaught. There is no peace in the region because theAgreement remains unimplemented even as the partieshave continued to profess their fidelity to it.The United Nations now has the authorization ofthe Security Council to deploy more than 5 000observers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo tomonitor the ceasefire and pave the way for thedeployment of a full-fledged peacekeeping force in thenear future.A crucial element of the Lusaka Agreement among others  is that there must be dialogue in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  among the peopleof that country  if the international efforts spearheadedby the United Nations and the OAU aimed at creatingconditions for national reconciliation in that countryare to bear fruit. Regrettably  there is no dialogue inprocess in that country  although a facilitator has beenin place for nine months.We hope the Congolese leaders will soon realizethat without the implementation in full of the LusakaAgreement  their country will be bereft of any hope forpeace. There may be no second chance. The LusakaAgreement is their only salvation.The leaders of Burundi  next door to theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  recently gatheredin Arusha  United Republic of Tanzania  to make peaceunder the facilitation of the former President of theRepublic of South Africa  Mr. Nelson Mandela. Theirgathering in Arusha attracted the presence of leadersfrom near and far  including the President of the UnitedStates of America  Mr. Bill Clinton.Regrettably  the peace agreement reached wasembraced by some and denigrated by others  whichdoes not augur well for peace in Burundi. It is ourfervent hope that those who have not embraced theArusha peace agreement will do so. In having PresidentMandela as Facilitator  the people of Burundi could nothave been more fortunate — and for the second time.Before President Mandela  it was the latePresident Mwalimu Nyerere  may his soul rest inpeace  who gave so much of himself for peace inBurundi. Burundi may not be so fortunate a third time.On that occasion  President Clinton had this to say: “SoI plead with you: you have to help your childrenremember their history  but you must not force them torelive their history.” Burundi would do well to heedthese words and save its children from the scourge ofendemic conflict.The Great Lakes region of Central Africa needspeace. The neighbours of the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo and Burundi  all of them  will not havepeace so long as carnage continues in their backyard.Angola will not have peace so long as its neighbours tothe north are strife-torn.The United Nations is making steady progress inSierra Leone  following initial mishaps which13threatened to reduce this Organization to an object ofridicule. The size of the United Nations force in thatsmall country should be enough to frustrate themurderous activities of the bandits of theRevolutionary United Front (RUF). In the finalanalysis  however  the future stability of Sierra Leonecannot be imposed by the United Nations or even indeed  by the Economic Community of West AfricanStates. It is the people of Sierra Leone themselves whomust embrace the logic of peace through nationaldialogue and reconciliation.The silence of the guns in the Horn of Africa inthe tragic war between Eritrea and Ethiopia could nothave been more welcome. The region has more thanenough problems without endless war. Famine isstalking the area  evoking earlier episodes of humandevastation  particularly in Ethiopia and Somalia. Inpeace  it is hoped the international community will beable to assist the affected areas without hindrance. Ourhearts and best wishes go out to the people of Somaliain their difficult endeavour to restore normalcy to theirfractured country. We hope the new central authoritythey have established will be respected by all theparties in the country.The struggle for peace in Africa  if it is to besuccessful  must be prosecuted on two fronts —political and economic. On both fronts  I can assurethis Assembly that Africa is not a hopeless continent as some of our detractors would have the worldbelieve.The Secretary-General's seminal report on thecauses of conflict in Africa has not fallen on deaf ears.Our continent has been changing for the better forsome time now. Changing democratically electedgovernments by unconstitutional means  whatever thereason  is no longer tolerated. Coup makers are nolonger welcome in the councils of the OAU. We havecome to accept that good governance and the rule oflaw  far from being regarded as sinister neo-colonialistconcepts as some may wish to stigmatize them  simplymean accountability and transparency on the part ofthose who are entrusted with the responsibility ofrunning the affairs of their nations. They meancultivating a culture of incorruptibility  openness andtolerance.On the economic front  I cannot gainsay theobvious fact that people cannot eat democracy or goodgovernance. Democracy in an environmentcharacterized by abject poverty and ignorance is anendangered species. Africa needs investment and aid tobuttress its democratization process. The challengefacing the United Nations in the new century istherefore to strive to ensure that Africa's difficultrenaissance is not simply encouraged but alsosupported in material ways.The western world would do well not simply toshout at Africans  to pontificate about human rightsand good governance and deprecate the continent'scivil wars and endemic instability  from the privilegedcomfort of Western Europe and North America.Africans need and deserve hands-on solidarity andconstructive engagement with the developed world ifthey are to succeed in their struggle for peace anddevelopment.Let me state the obvious. Small States like myown derive a sense of security from our membership inthe United Nations. The United Nations is our shieldagainst the vagaries and predatory nature of worldpolitics. That is why we have been unstinting in thefulfilment of our obligations to the Organization. Wepay our dues to the Organization without fail. We haveparticipated in its peacekeeping activities. And we havedefended it against its many detractors.It is no secret  however  that this United Nationsto which we all habitually profess our unflinchingcommitment and devotion is perpetually tottering onthe brink of insolvency. This is unfortunately so  evenas we equally habitually burden the Organization withescalating tasks for it to perform on a shoestringbudget. The Secretary-General is right in challengingus  the Member States  to hold one another responsiblefor the financial difficulties faced by the UnitedNations. We alone can resolve these difficulties. Wemust honour our Charter obligations and do so withoutconditions.We must strengthen the United Nations in orderto secure our future  the future of mankind. We mustcontinually reform the Organization to adapt it to therealities of the post-cold-war world and the newmillennium. A crucial part of this reform andadaptation is the reconfiguration of the SecurityCouncil  on which there is sufficient consensus in ourUnited Nations family. The Council needs a heavy doseof democratization and accountability; about this  thereis no dissension.14We must strengthen the peacekeeping arm of theUnited Nations to make good or deliver on ourCharter's pledge “to save succeeding generations fromthe scourge of war ...”. Peacekeeping has always been acrucial function of the United Nations. And so the needto enhance the rapid reaction of the United Nations toconflict situations around the world has long beenrecognized and is deeply felt. The lessons in Kosovo East Timor and  more recently  Sierra Leone havetaught us that the United Nations needs better trainedand well-equipped troops  as well as innovative imaginative and realistic mandates from the SecurityCouncil.Let there be no repetition of the kind ofhumiliation the United Nations recently suffered inSierra Leone at the hands of a ragtag army of bandits.The conflicts that are wreaking havoc on societiestoday are radically different from those thatpreoccupied the United Nations during the cold warera. We must therefore devise new and creativemechanisms and strategies for responding to them.Let me conclude my statement by reiteratingBotswana's commitment to the United Nations and itsCharter. This Organization is irreplaceable  and I amsure the presence here two weeks ago of so many worldleaders to mark the turn of a new millennium is morethan enough testimony to this obvious fact."
"28",1166,"CAF",55,2000,"Our stubborn quest for a world of peace progress  solidarity and of concord recently promptedthe Heads of State and of Government from the worldover to commit themselves at the Millennium Summitto joint reflection about the ways of making a reality ofthis aspiration in the twenty-first century.The conclusions they arrived at  conclusions thatcan be summarized as the need for us to usher in a newera in international relations  without a doubt mark theframework for the future work of our Organization.It is thus a positive circumstance that our work isunfolding against this backdrop so that during ourdeliberations we might strive to act in accordance withthe guidelines set for us by our Heads of State.But before my delegation attempts its ownassessment of the state of the world as we look at thefresh challenges facing us in the twenty-first century  Ishould like  on behalf of His Excellency Mr. Ange-Félix Patassé  President of our Republic and Head ofState  who wishes us every success in our work  toaddress to you  Mr. President  as well as to the othermembers of the Bureau  our heartfelt congratulationson your election to the presidency of this session.Your superb mastery of international affairs in thecontext of which your country  Finland  holds a veryspecial place  bodes well indeed for the success of thissession and  in this connection  you can count on thecooperation of the delegation of the Central AfricanRepublic.The competence with which your predecessor Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab of Namibia  guided the work atthe fifty-fourth session  has earned the full appreciationof my delegation.I should like as well to express again to theSecretary-General the full support of the Governmentof the Central African Republic for all he is constantlydoing at the helm of our Organization to provide solidunderpinnings for peace and development in a worldwhich has become complex indeed. The relevance ofthe proposals that he put forward in his introductoryreport at the Millennium Summit reflect his deepcommitment to fully serving the cause of theOrganization  and we are deeply grateful.Furthermore  the Central African Republic  whichhas always encouraged our Organization to strideforward towards universality  welcomes the admission7of Tuvalu as the 189th Member State. I am delighted tocongratulate this young republic on behalf of thedelegation of the Central African Republic.A world of peace  of progress  of solidarity and ofconcord  such was the philosophy of the foundingfathers of the United Nations.How can one explain then that 55 years later weshould be so far from attaining that goal?Peace  when it is not assured  gives way to war.Factors such as penury  destitution  poverty  AIDS malaria and tuberculosis — compounded byintolerance  injustice  indifference and socialinequalities — these make up the threats to the balanceof peace.Progress is a reality for only a quarter ofhumankind  while three quarters still are not enjoyingdecent living conditions.Solidarity still is something selectively applied ina world that is nonetheless interdependent.All this cannot foster fellowship within thisconstantly changing world.That is the state of the world as we enter thetwenty-first century.The Secretary-General's report entitled “We thepeoples: the role of the United Nations in the twenty-first century” has the merit of having pointed out allthese distortions that do not help to ensure the smoothunfolding of international relations.But even though the United Nations  55 yearsafter having come into being  has not fulfilled thehopes to which its inception gave rise  the factnonetheless remains that it does exist. And the fact thatit still does exist is something which first and foremostis due to the determination of States  which do in factfeel the need for this Organization. We must thereforestimulate renewed interest in the United Nations; thatis what is at stake at this session.The United Nations must regain its authority inorder to contribute to regulating the course of events inthe world in the twenty-first century. On the basis ofreal solidarity among States  we must conceive of anew kind of cooperation that would make it possiblefor us collectively to organize a defence of peace  thepromotion of development and of progress  as well asthe fostering of human rights and of democracyeverywhere around the world.The fact is that as you look around the worldthese days  you find that peace is jeopardized in manydifferent countries  and especially on the Africancontinent.What is more  all this is happening as though theconventional conflict-settlement machinery were nolonger suited to coping with crisis situations. Still  theresources afforded by the United Nations  as well as byregional organizations  have made it possible for a newattitude in the face of conflict to emerge  one whichfirst and foremost involves regional solidarity.It is in this context that my country today stillplays host to a United Nations office  the UnitedNations Peace-Building Support Office in the CentralAfrican Republic (BONUCA)  responsible for strivingto consolidate peace. Indeed the tragic events for whichthe Central African Republic became the stagingground in 1996 and 1997 prompted African countriesfirst to intervene in the context of the Inter-AfricanMission to Monitor the Implementation of the BanguiAgreements (MISAB)  before bringing the UnitedNations into the picture. The United Nations Mission inthe Central African Republic (MINURCA) made agenuine contribution by its very presence and by whatit did in restoring peace and in promoting nationalreconciliation  thanks to the support provided inorganizing both legislative and presidential elections.I would like here again to express theappreciation of the Government of the Central AfricanRepublic to the Secretary-General of the UnitedNations  to the members of the Security Council andespecially to the countries that so generouslycontributed to supporting that mission of peace byproviding the wherewithal for MINURCA.The experience gained in the Central AfricanRepublic can be made available as an asset to theUnited Nations  reflecting a success in keeping thepeace and consolidating it. My delegation  whichsupports the Brahimi report  hopes that therecommendations it embodies will be fullyimplemented so that we really see take root a newdoctrine for United Nations operations ofpeacekeeping.In the same vein  my delegation hopes that theUnited Nations provides the same resources to8promoting a lasting settlement in the situations inSierra Leone  in Angola  in Burundi  between Ethiopiaand Eritrea  as well as in the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo.As to the Democratic Republic of the Congo which shares a rather long border with my owncountry  my delegation calls for cooperation from theinternational community in the context of the UnitedNations  so that a solution may be found to thisconflict  the consequences of which have already takena heavy toll  both for the Congolese people  with whichwe are bound by fraternal ties  as well as for theneighbouring States such as the Central AfricanRepublic  which is currently hosting tens of thousandsof refugees that have fled the effects of the war. Mydelegation takes advantage of this opportunity to callupon the competent international authorities  the Officeof the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugeesin particular  to devote special attention to the CentralAfrican Republic in this instance.Moreover  my delegation firmly supports theongoing process seeking to bring about a settlement tothe question of the Middle East. We do not doubt thatthe determination of the parties involved will make itpossible to lift the last remaining obstacles so that afair  negotiated and lasting solution in accordance withSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338(1973) may be found.The United Nations subsequently should regainits authority in order to enable it to contribute byletting multilateralism work to promote developmentthroughout the world. The fact is that without denyingwhat has been done internationally to fight poverty andwhile acknowledging that developing countries shouldshoulder primary responsibility for ensuring thenecessary preconditions for their development  mydelegation hopes that the community of States willcome to grips with the question of poverty and willapply a fresh way of thinking to it in this twenty-firstcentury.All the indicators of poverty are there for us tosee  and you can find them everywhere in Africa: weakprimary educational systems  a lack of sanitaryinfrastructure  a lack of drinking water  of the properconditions for hygiene  to name but a few. The Africancontinent is part of that 1 billion inhabitants of ourplanet living on less than one dollar a day  while two-thirds of the population of the planet hold three-quarters of the world's income.Poverty is extreme in Africa; we must do ourutmost to come up with new ways to reduce it in thetwenty-first century.The Central African Republic  which at thebeginning of this year took part in the Librevillesummit on growth and poverty reduction in Africa abides by the new strategic framework to combatpoverty proposed by the Bretton Woods institutions.My country therefore calls for an increase in theresources allocated to such agencies as the UnitedNations Development Programme  the United NationsPopulation Fund  the United Nations Children's Fund(UNICEF) and the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization to support theCentral African Republic's strategy to combat poverty.Of course  eradicating poverty will be necessaryin order to make it possible for developing countries totake part in the work of development. That isparticularly true with regard to the countries of Africa.But it will also be necessary to put developingcountries in a position where they can really rise to thedevelopment challenge. In this connection  the issue ofthe debt burden comes to mind  for it continues tosubstantially handicap all development efforts.How  then  can we ensure that globalizationstimulates development in Africa instead of leading tomarginalization? Inasmuch as the new technologiesthat are being introduced contribute to the overallprogress of mankind  Africa must expect to benefit and we once again call for the rules governing the workof the World Trade Organization to take Africa'sinterests into account.In his introductory report to the MillenniumSummit  the Secretary-General reminded us that allactivity is people-oriented. Nothing is more true. Mydelegation hopes that the United Nations will regain itsauthority so that it can contribute to ensuring thenecessary conditions for the promotion of rights anddemocracy throughout the world. Guaranteeing andprotecting human rights contributes to nationalconsensus and strengthening democracy in a country.We have understood that so well in the CentralAfrican Republic that we have created a governmentbody called the High Commission for Human Rights whose mission is not only to monitor respect for human9rights  but also to implement the various internationallegal instruments signed by the Central AfricanRepublic aimed at promoting human rights. Thatimplementation requires resources in order to bringabout the most widespread dissemination possible ofhuman rights at the national level. As human rights areindivisible  it is important to establish cooperationbetween States to promote human rights throughout theworld. My delegation hopes that in the course of thetwenty-first century the United Nations will becomeincreasingly involved in international efforts toestablish a worldwide culture of human rights. It mustbe reformed and renewed in order to be able to take onthat role.Renewal means adaptation to the realities of theworld today. The Organization's procedures  methodsand approaches to every issue within its competencewill have to be streamlined. However  let us not forgetthat protecting international peace and security is theprimary task entrusted to the United Nations. That roleis primarily the responsibility of the Security Council.My delegation would like to see the SecurityCouncil reformed in order to better discharge thatresponsibility. The world has changed profoundly  andthe composition of the Security Council should reflectthat. Even though the veto power is not as abused todayas it was during the cold war  we should restructure theCouncil in both the permanent and non-permanentcategories to take into account the new internationalreality. That is the opinion of the delegation of theCentral African Republic.In that way we can contribute to setting relationsbetween nations on a different course. That requires areal and willing commitment by States. This year'sadoption of the Constitutive Act of the African Unionas an expression of Africa's willingness to join theUnited Nations in meeting all the challenges is amanifestation of that commitment. My country will doeverything in its power to encourage this newmovement towards integration.The century that witnessed the birth of the UnitedNations has ended. A new century is beginning  one inwhich there is still a United Nations — something thatis cause for satisfaction to mankind. But what shall wemake of the United Nations in the twenty-first century?That is indeed the fundamental question raised by theSecretary-General in his report to the MillenniumSummit.Should we continue to keep the United Nationslocked in the vice of contradictions that exists betweenMember States? Should we continue to look onhelplessly as its authority is flouted in peacekeepingoperations? Should we continue to accept theOrganization's being left behind as the world movesforward? The answer  in the opinion of the delegationof the Central African Republic  is a resounding “No”.Let us therefore return to the dream of thefounding fathers and make sure that in the new centurythe United Nations has the necessary means to bringabout peace  solidarity and harmony throughout theworld. Such a world is possible if we want it. That isthe world our Heads of State spoke of in their messageto us at the Millennium Summit."
"29",1213,"CAN",55,2000,"I would like to begin bycongratulating you  Sir  on your election as Presidentof the General Assembly. Your experience and wisdomwill doubtless guide us in carrying out the importantwork ahead.As we all know  that work is to immediately andresolutely transform the high hopes of the MillenniumSummit into a better reality for the peoples for whomthe United Nations was founded.(spoke in French)This means assuming responsibility for ouractions and our inaction. It also means thatGovernments must be ready to assume theirresponsibility for their citizens.Last week our leaders delivered here a messageof hope and determination. Their words clearly showedthat we all need the United Nations. The UnitedNations is the only organization that embodiesuniversal values; that offers a global forum to addresscommon problems; and that is on the front line aroundthe world fighting for people.(spoke in English)There was another message from the Summitabout whether the United Nations is keeping up withthe times; about whether we  the Member States —custodians of the Organization and guardians of theCharter — have the political will to support renewaland modernization.When the lights turned off last Friday night herein New York  did other lights go on around theworld — in our Chancery offices  Parliamentaryassemblies and Cabinet meeting rooms — to illuminatethe way forward? Are we all  each in our own way asking how we can change our ways to better help theUnited Nations manage a new global agenda?Clearly  globalization has brought unprecedentedbenefits and possibilities. But it also clearly brings newrisks to people in all our countries. Many of those newrisks cross State lines  while most violent conflict nowoccurs within States' borders. In both cases  the impactis felt directly by ordinary people.Yet the debate within the United Nations remainsdriven — and too often circumscribed — by rigidnotions of sovereignty and narrow conceptions ofnational interest. And action by the United Nationsremains hampered by inflexible institutional structuresthat have become increasingly inward-looking  drivenby their own interests rather than by those they weredesigned to serve.The Secretary-General has  with a courage rarelyseen in public life  given us a vision of a way forward.2It is a vision that serves the world's people  and onethat resonates with them  even though it may aggravatesome of their Governments. He has challenged us tofollow his lead  to adopt a people-centred approach tointernational relations  to move this Organization fromthe sidelines to the forefront of change.This is not a new agenda for Canada. Indeed  overthe past five years  promoting human security has beenthe focus of our own approach to our changing world.And it has been encouraging to see the shift in attitudetoward a more realistic sense of what it means to besecure in the world as an individual.Our leaders endorsed this new vision in theirSummit Declaration. But if we have truly come to theunderstanding that security means more than protectingborders  we must now act to turn last week's goodintentions into effective action. This means takingresponsibility to adapt our institutions  broadenparticipation in their functioning  and increasetransparency and accountability to make a tangibledifference for the people we represent.It also means responsible  accountable globalbehaviour  sharing and protecting the common spacethat sustains life.Aggressive pursuit of the global arms control anddisarmament agenda is the ultimate responsible act.Our generation built the nuclear arsenals that areoutmoded and rotting; we produced the chemicalweapons that poison people; and today we still makeand distribute the small arms that are foundeverywhere: in the hands of children  the arsenals ofdrug dealers and the garrisons of guerrilla fighters.But we have also had a certain foresight to beginbuilding a system of international obligations andprinciples to contain such behaviour. We now have tovalidate and implement these instruments. Above all we must do nothing to damage them.Certainly  Governments must prepare for thedefence of their people. Responsible defence is anelement of responsible government. But surely  ourresponsibility to defend our citizens begins not with thedevelopment of new weapons systems  but bydismantling old ones: by ratifying the ComprehensiveNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT); by joining the 104States parties to the Ottawa Treaty on landmines; byimplementing the international non-proliferation normsand disarmament obligations embodied in the Treaty onthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT); bydeveloping comprehensive action plans to stop theproliferation of small arms and missile technology.The collective action of States working for thelong-term security of their people is clearly thepreferable path. But where States are unable  orunwilling  to protect their citizens  the United Nations and in particular the Security Council  has a specialresponsibility to act.Today  most wars are fought within failed States.In these wars  it is the victimization of civilians that isthe motive  the means and the manifestation of aconflict.If the Council is to acquit itself of itsresponsibility to these people  their protection must beat the core of its work  not at its periphery.This is the agenda that Canada has brought to theSecurity Council over the past two years. It has notbeen an easy task  but I would like to acknowledge thatthe Security Council is meeting the new challenges. Inrecent months  the Council's work has increasinglyfocused on the protection of civilians  with action inthe areas of AIDS  physical protection  war-affectedchildren and sanctions reform. The Council hasrecognized that dealing with these issues is critical tobuilding effective peace-support operations  and hasembodied this recognition in recent resolutions. Today we are providing members a checklist  a checklist ofresponsible action in the Security Council.(spoke in French)The Brahimi report also proposes a plan ofaction. It is a comprehensive strategy for strengtheningthe United Nations capacity to help people. Canadasupports the panel's findings. We will be its strongestadvocate and can be counted upon to work tirelessly tobuild the political support required to implement boththe spirit and the letter of its recommendations.(spoke in English)By far the most difficult challenge in protectingcivilians in armed conflict is in situations where abuseis most severe: genocide  war crimes  crimes againsthumanity  massive and systematic violations of humanrights and humanitarian law which cause widespreadsuffering  loss of life and abuse.We need a new form of deterrence against suchforms of behaviour. The establishment of an3International Criminal Court (ICC)  which makesimpunity illegal and which holds individuals directlyaccountable for their actions  is that deterrent. And ifits power to deter the abuse of people fails  the Statuteprovides both a basis and a structure to take concretelegal action to redress injustice.The Court's Statute provides us with a uniqueopportunity to fix one of the worst failings in theinternational system. Today I appeal to everyGovernment here that has not done so to sign the RomeStatute by December and to ratify it on an urgent basis so that the world's people can finally have the justicethey deserve.Canada seeks to systematically put in place thebuilding blocks for a new type of international system one that is inspired and guided by the United NationsCharter  but that is also prepared to deal with theunderside and underworld of globalization.Of course  prevention is the best form ofintervention. But when preventive measures fail; whenthe quiet diplomatic efforts and the targeted sanctionsdo not work; when the fact-finders find facts toohorrendous to imagine; then there must be recourse tomore robust action.The question of intervention in these instances including  as a last resort  the use of military force  isfraught with difficulty and controversy. Many wouldsweep it under the rug as too divisive  too difficult  toodamaging to the status quo. But Rwanda  Cambodia Srebrenica and Kosovo remind us that it is important tofocus on this question. It would be easy to pretend thatthe humanitarian tragedies associated with these placesare a thing of the past. It would be easy  but it would bewrong. There is no certainty that similar atrocities willnot happen again. Indeed  the opposite is more likely.The spiral into extremes of human suffering cannotalways be constrained.Reading the editorial page of The New York Timeson Tuesday  12 September  we realize that some wouldhave us believe that the United Nations Charter waswritten only to protect States and State interests:“intervening in civil conflicts takes the UnitedNations a step too far”.I disagree. I say that in the face of egregious humansuffering it is a step in the right direction.Nothing so threatens the United Nations very future asthis apparent contradiction between principle andpower; between people's security and Governments'interests; between  in short  humanitarian interventionand State sovereignty.Last fall I stood before this body and argued thatthe United Nations Charter was written for people. Ourcollective agenda here is not the nation States' agenda or the ministers' agenda  or the diplomats' agenda. It isthe people's agenda. Indeed  “We the peoples” are theopening words of the Charter. Those who would seekto hide behind that document to justify inaction needonly to read its preamble to reacquaint themselves withits original intent.Secretary-General Annan has challenged us torethink what it means to be responsible  sovereignStates. Canada has responded by creating anindependent international commission on interventionand State sovereignty. Its purpose is to contribute tobuilding a broader understanding of the issue  and tofoster a global political consensus on how to moveforward. The commission will be led by two co-chairpersons — one from the developing and one fromthe developed world — with the participation of a widerange of representatives of Governments and non-governmental organizations from all regions and underthe overall guidance of an advisory board composed ofministers  former ministers and distinguishedpractitioners from the academic  humanitarian andlegal fields.The commission will undertake its work duringthis Millennium Assembly year  and will present itsrecommendations in 12 months' time. I ask thosepresent here in the Assembly Hall to join in thisenterprise  difficult as it may be  so that we can seek toreconcile these concepts to find the space that we canall share.It is difficult  but it is not impossible. We havedone it before. Thirteen years ago  the BrundtlandCommission's report  “Our Common Future”  took twoseemingly contradictory ideas — economicdevelopment and the protection of the environment —and out of that contradiction forged a synthesis calledsustainable development. That new conceptfundamentally changed the way in which the worldthinks about those issues  and its work informs ourthinking to this very day. It is Canada's hope that thisnew commission can diffuse the anxiety that surrounds4the issues of intervention and sovereignty by building asimilar bridge between our current notions of theseconcepts  and in so doing help to define the way aheadfor Governments and the United Nations to tackle themost challenging international dilemma of the twenty-first century.However  the responsibility no longer stops justwith Governments. The private sector must also take itsresponsibility for the communities on which it dependsfor its business. Ethical business is good business. Themany companies that have joined the Secretary-General's Global Compact with Business recognizethat profit made on the backs of exploited and abusedchildren — by gun-running  drug dealing or conflictdiamonds — is no longer acceptable. In the globalizedeconomy  the world's people are the ultimateshareholders. If they do not profit  no one will. Wemust therefore work on all of these fronts and with allof these new players to build a future where humansecurity is universally respected and protected. In themeantime  there are steps that we can take to protectthe most vulnerable.To build a world that values human security wemust start with concern and action for those who willinherit it. It is fitting  therefore  that in this year offresh resolve the future of our children is a key elementof the agenda  particularly through the special sessionon children that is to be held next year. Nowhere is thesafety and well-being of children more at risk than inconflict situations. Children should have no part in war.Yet today they are among its main victims  counting inthe millions.(spoke in French)Four years ago  Graça Machel brought attentionto the horrific plight of war-affected children. Sincethen  action has been taken too reduce their suffering most notably with the appointment of Olara Otunnu asthe Secretary-General's Special Representative forChildren and Armed Conflict and  more recently  withthe historic agreement last January on the OptionalProtocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Childon the involvement of children in armed conflict.This week  with Graça Machel as honoraryChairperson  Canada is hosting in Winnipeg theInternational Conference on War-Affected Children.This meeting  the first of its kind  brings together morethan 130 Governments  60 non-governmentalorganizations and private sector groups  internationalorganizations and young people from every region ofthe world.(spoke in English)I am pleased that so many ministers and seniorofficials from the Organization will join us inWinnipeg this weekend. I encourage those not alreadyrepresented to attend.The aim of the conference is twofold: toformulate a comprehensive  global action plan and toforge the necessary political will to implement it.Together  we hope it will help children traumatized bywar  and ultimately eliminate their involvement andvictimization in conflict.Earlier this week in Winnipeg  as we opened theconference  a young Ugandan girl named Grace spoketo me  at a meeting of young people affected by war about her experience as a child soldier. Her story wasone of victimization and chilling brutality. Her beliefthat the international community could help her andothers like her was touching and inspiring. Her plea forus to do so is the essence of the Organization'svocation. Indeed  it is one of our basic responsibilities.For me  that young woman's simple appeal makes itclear that we have no option but to be ready  to bewilling  and to be able to forge a United Nations for thetwenty-first century.In view of the daunting challenges ahead  anyattempt to retreat  to shut out the world or to turn awayfrom international engagement would be to follow adangerous path that is neither practical nor desirable.The truth is that we share a common humanity. Thereality is that we are linked by the forces of history intoa common destiny. The fact is that the answers to ourproblems lie in strengthening  not diminishing  globalcooperation and global solutions.In today's world  the security of States and thesecurity of people are indivisible. Providing for thatsecurity is a necessary precondition for success in otherimportant endeavours  such as advancing economic aidand trade development. In this new century  too manypeople like Grace are still subject to the worst of thepast century: to the scourge of war  to human rightsabuses and to too few prospects for social progress anda better standard of living. Yet the hopes contained inthe United Nations Charter still have meaning for them and indeed relevance for all of us. Fulfilling itsaspirations is our enduring goal and fundamental5responsibility. With human security as our guide  let usmake it our focus as we renew our commitment to thepurposes of the United Nations and to a better futurefor Grace and for all the people that we represent.This goal is a responsibility that I have beenhonoured to share with many of those present here overthe past five years. It is a goal that we must allcontinue to strive towards — whatever our position inlife  whatever our title — in order to ensure that thissystem we have built does not surrender to the cynicswho offer no alternatives  or to the game players whoparalyse the transcendent purposes of the UnitedNations for simple transitory diplomatic points.Only in so doing will we truly live up to thepromise contained in the Charter: to serve the majestyof the people and to make this Organization work forthem."

My appreciation also goes to the praiseworthyefforts of Foreign Minister Gurirab of Namibia duringthe work of the session that has just come to an end.Likewise  we congratulate the Secretary-General on theleadership he has demonstrated since taking office. Werecognize and value his commitment to the vision of anew United Nations for the twenty-first century. Weencourage him to continue his efforts to reform theOrganization.Globalization is without a doubt the name of ourera. Today it is pointless to ask ourselves whether wewant to participate in globalization. Isolation is not arealistic option. Chile views globalization as anunquestionable reality and as a font of opportunity thathas brought us very valuable benefits. The opening ofour economy has enabled us to double the size of ourgross domestic product within 10 years  compared withthe almost 50 years it took to accomplish the previousdoubling. Technological advances have helped to bringus closer to major world centres.Globalization gives rise to opportunities  but itcan also deepen the inequities which have alwayscharacterized the international system. The UnitedNations can help to ensure that globalization does notresult in exclusion  with the benefits of modernizationlimited to a lucky few. We must make a firmcommitment to developing a new form of internationalcooperation  focused in particular on broadening accessto the knowledge-based economy.The flows of goods  services  capital  informationand technology characteristic of globalization tend tobypass domestic regulations and escape the control ofGovernments. This lack of regulation is generally notcounterbalanced by other standards or authorities. It isup to us to fill this vacuum by using all availablemultilateral forums.As never before in the history of humanity resolving the daily problems faced by peopleworldwide depends on collective internationaldecision-making. The challenge confronting the UnitedNations today is to lend a certain degree of order toglobalization; to establish effective institutions andrules  so that globalization will serve to advance thedevelopment of our peoples; and to ensure that thefruits of scientific and technological advances benefitall peoples.At the Rio Group's most recent Summit of Headsof State or Government  held in Cartagena  Colombia the countries that make up this regional politicalcoordination body prepared a joint contribution to theMillennium Summit  reaffirming the central role of theUnited Nations in this new era on which we areembarking.The past year has given rise to a mixture of hopeand concern with regard to peace and security. Chilefollowed with particular interest the historic talks heldbetween the leaders of North and South Korea  from 1315to 15 June of this year. We congratulate the leaders andthe peoples of both countries on the progress made atthis groundbreaking summit.The conflict in the Middle East has entered whatseems to be a decisive stage. We are heartened by theadvances made this year and encourage the parties tocontinue their negotiations in accordance with theestablished timetables and relevant Security Councilresolutions. We are confident that Israel and thePalestinian National Authority will find satisfactorysolutions to the remaining issues  particularly thoserelated to Jerusalem. We are also encouraged byIsrael's withdrawal from southern Lebanon.We support the Security Council's decisionsestablishing a massive humanitarian programme forIraq  under the 'oil-for-food' formula  and we favouran ongoing evaluation of that programme. We urge theIraqi Government to cooperate effectively with the newinspection agency  the United Nations Monitoring Verification and Inspection Commission  whosework we deem particularly important.We have followed closely developments in theBalkans. The seeds of intolerance and 'ethniccleansing' are still present in the region. Chile viewswith fear the possibility of a new Balkan conflict. Onlyfull respect for democracy and human rights can bringabout peace in the region.We are concerned by the conflicts in Africa. Weare hopeful as to the significant mediating role playedby regional entities such as the Organization forAfrican Unity  especially in the Ethiopia-Eritreadispute  and the Southern African DevelopmentCommunity. We hope that these efforts  along withthose of the United Nations  can bring about peace allowing the continent to fully develop its enormouspotential.We are pleased to note that the Security Councilhas directly addressed the scourge of HIV/AIDS inAfrica  designating it as an international security issuerequiring urgent action. We hope that initiatives will beadopted to effectively combat this problem  which castsan even greater shadow over the future of the continentthan the current armed conflicts.We view with concern the difficulties surroundingthe upcoming referendum in the Western Sahara. Chilewould like to see the elections take place as soon aspossible  on the basis of a free and secret ballot andadequate voter information. We are concerned aboutthe obstacles that are hindering this undertaking.Although post-cold-war hopes for a world free ofnuclear weapons in the near future have been tempered that goal remains fully valid. I have the honour toreport than on 12 July  Chile deposited its instrument ofratification for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-BanTreaty  the sixteenth country to do so. We call uponall nations to ratify this Treaty as soon as possible inorder to reach the quorum of 44 countries necessary forits entry into force.In our information-based society  the problemsexperienced by any one country affect the worldcommunity as a whole. No state can shirk its theresponsibility to promote peaceful coexistence withinand among nations. From the ethical standpoint of ourcommon humanity  we have viewed with interest thedevelopment of the concept of humanitarianintervention. Chile continues to abide by the principlesof non-intervention and the self-determination ofpeoples. But these principles must be linked to otherprinciples of equal or higher priority  which haveemerged prominently since the end of the cold war. Wecannot remain impassive in the face of thehumanitarian catastrophes caused by great conflicts.Thus  we propose that in specific cases  and inaccordance with the Charter of the United Nations concerted multilateral action be taken to provide rapidassistance to those who are suffering. Chile is also anenthusiastic participant in the Human SecurityNetwork  in response to an initiative put forward byCanada and Norway.Chile considers it an ethical and politicalimperative of the greatest urgency to expand itsparticipation in the United Nations peacekeepingforces. Since 1999  we have developed an internal legalframework that is in closer harmony with internationalrequirements for participation in these operations.Those legal modifications have enabled us toparticipate in the United Nations TransitionalAdministration in East Timor  beginning in February ofthis year.My country is also willing to discuss a newpayment scale for the financing of United Nationspeacekeeping operations. We believe that this scalemust be adjusted to reflect the current financialsituation of Member States.16We cannot fail to mention the process of SecurityCouncil reform. While some progress has been noted indiscussions of the Council's methods of work and ofthe degree of transparency required by this body  wenote that there have been few  if any  advances towardthe expansion of its membership.Chile feels a certain dismay and fatigue at thelack of progress  which is the result of positions thatappear irreconcilable. The issue of the veto furthercomplicates this sensitive subject. Until we seriouslyaddress the question of limiting the veto with a view toits ultimate abolishment  we doubt that the discussionsundertaken by the Assembly's Open-ended WorkingGroup on the Question of Equitable Representation onand Increase in the Membership of the SecurityCouncil and Other Matters related to the SecurityCouncil will bear fruit.Globalization is not limited to the economicsphere. It also involves the universalization of valuesand principles of our common humanity  and thestrengthening of the rights of the individual  whichhave increasingly become subjects addressed byinternational law. The absence of democracy and goodgovernance  and the people's lack of a voice andparticipation in public affairs in States Members of theOrganization are of concern to us all. The UnitedNations exists for individuals  not for those whogovern. Under the imperative of putting people at thecentre of all our efforts  we must support and promotehuman rights and democratic processes.Chile was among the countries that worked toconvene the Towards a Community of Democraciesconference held at Warsaw  Poland  last June. Morethan 100 United Nations Member nations participatedin that gathering and endorsed its final declaration. Weare convinced that  as time passes  the community ofdemocracies will be an increasingly potent moral forcewithin the United Nations  provided that it maintainsits high standards and requirements.Democracy is based on justice  both national anduniversal. Chile enthusiastically supports theestablishment of an International Criminal Court  andhopes that all countries will ratify its statute.Establishing a permanent body to exercise criminaljurisdiction over those accused of crimes that fallwithin its purview will discourage the irregulardomestic proceedings which have allowed suchindividuals to enjoy impunity  as well as limitingjurisdictional disputes among countries.At the World Summit for Social Development held at Copenhagen in 1995  heads of State orGovernment met for the first time in the history of theUnited Nations to declare with force and clarity thatthe chief responsibility of our societies is to improvethe quality of life of our populations  particularly fortheir most marginalized and dispossessed members.This year  in a special session  the Assembly reviewedthe progress made towards fulfilling the Summit'scommitments and launched new initiatives on theirgenuine implementation. That was an important step inthe quest to better humanize the process ofglobalization. We must continue to incorporate theobjectives of the social Summit into our national andmultilateral policies.In the social sphere  the United Nations hasrecognized the vital need to promote gender equality.Chile has worked together with our regionalneighbours in Latin America and the Caribbean toreaffirm the principles and proposals of the FourthWorld Conference on Women. We have renewed ourcommitment to the advancement of women  and havedeveloped a new plan to equalize opportunities for menand for women. A concrete demonstration of thatcommitment is the fact that about one third ofPresident Lagos Escobar's cabinet members arewomen.We reiterate Chile's strong support forpreparations for the General Assembly's 2001 specialsession to follow up the World Summit for Children.We also attribute special significance to the concern ofthe United Nations for the rights and welfare ofindigenous populations and of the elderly.Chile has volunteered to host the regionalpreparatory meeting for the World Conference againstRacism  Racial Discrimination  Xenophobia andRelated Intolerance. We aim to contribute to theregional consensus in that area  confirming our veryfirm commitment to tolerance and respect for diversity.Environmental protection is an issue that crossesnational borders and has become a global concern driven in part by an emerging international civilsociety. Here  international cooperation  under theauspices of the United Nations  continues to be anurgent necessity. The United Nations Conference onEnvironment and Development  held at Rio de Janeiro 17laid the foundations for agreements on climate change forest conservation and biodiversity. It is veryimportant that we fulfil and gradually expand thosecommitments with new agreements and protocolsensuring the management  protection and conservationof our planet's resources. This session  as well as theRio + 10 event which will take place in 2002  mustcontinue to spur commitment to a new ethic ofenvironmental conservation.We are witnessing the globalization of financialmarkets  which significantly affect capital  currencyand credit flows  as well as the economies of all ofnations. As recent experience demonstrates  a financialcrisis in one corner of the world can rapidly trigger adomino effect  spreading the crisis even to farawaynations with no responsibility for or control over thecauses of the original disturbance. It is a great injusticethat countries that have been prudent and responsible inthe management of their domestic economies can beaffected by problems with which they had nothing todo. It is urgent for us to find ways to impose order andstandards of good management on the internationalworld. This does not mean obstructing internationalcapital flows  but rather establishing an appropriateinternational framework to address the problems theymay cause.Chile has enthusiastically supported theinternational community's progress towards free tradethrough deregulation and the elimination ofprotectionist measures and barriers. The failure of the1999 Seattle World Trade Organization (WTO)conference was unfortunate. But let us be frank: thatfailure was not brought about by civil-societydemonstrations  but by the lack of agreement amongthe world's leading commercial Powers. Chilecontinues to believe in the urgent necessity of initiatinga new round of multilateral trade negotiations.The United Nations must play a key role inbringing about substantive improvements in themanagement of commercial  monetary and financialsystems  so that their operations will take into accountthe needs of all countries. The Economic and SocialCouncil has done commendable work to coordinateUnited Nations activities with those of the BrettonWoods institutions. But the General Assembly too hasa critical role to play in this area.The decision to hold a High-level Internationaland Intergovernmental Event on Financing forDevelopment in 2001 was of groundbreakingsignificance  and we must resolve to carry forward thecommitments expressed at the Millennium Summit toensure the success of that event. That would lead to anew phase in North-South relations  since the politicallegitimacy arising from a broad multilateral consensuswill allow us to design a new financial architecture anda system of international trade and exchange thatreflect the legitimate interests of all the world'speoples.My country believes that official developmentassistance is still necessary to promote thedevelopment of many countries and regions. Aglobalized world cannot neglect the principle ofsolidarity  which is an idea so central to the UnitedNations tradition. In the same spirit  internationalassistance must be provided to relieve the distressingconditions of many countries burdened withunsustainable debt  so that they can meet thechallenges of development.This year Chile began a new six-year politicalterm  under fully democratic conditions. Our country isin complete harmony with the international community.We possess a vibrant civil society  which made its owncontributions to our preparation for the MillenniumSummit. Human rights and the rule of law arerespected in Chile. Our courts impart justice withrigour and a sense of responsibility. We enjoy avigorous and open economy  and we have resolved tocontinue reducing inequalities in our country. We reachout to the world from a firm foundation in our ownregion  Latin America. We are strengthening ourmultilateral policies  based on open regionalism and oncooperation with countries with similar criteriathroughout the world.We are confident that this General Assemblysession  dedicated to the millennium  will be recordedas the one in which we began to address the greatchallenge of our time: to give order to the forces ofglobalization and promote the extension of its benefitsto an ever-increasing number of the inhabitants of ourplanet. You can rest assured  Mr. President  that Chile'sdelegation will lend its full support to meeting thischallenge."
"31",1320,"CHN",55,2000,"Please allow me to extend my warm congratulations toyou  Sir  on your assumption of the presidency of theGeneral Assembly at its current session. I am confidentthat  with your wisdom and experience  and with thesupport and coordinated efforts of the member States the Millennium Assembly will successfully completeall its work. At the same time  I would like to expressmy appreciation and thanks to Mr. Gurirab for thecontribution he made as President of the GeneralAssembly at its last session.The Millennium Summit  which attractedworldwide attention  has just concluded. The UnitedNations Millennium Declaration is a consensus reachedby world leaders on how to meet the major challengesfacing mankind today. The Declaration reviews andsums up the course that the United Nations hastravelled over the past 55 years. More importantly  itoffers a blueprint for the United Nations in the newcentury and the new millennium and importantguidance to people around the world in their pursuit ofpeace  development and common progress. I would liketo add my voice to the call to action made bySecretary-General Kofi Annan at the closing ceremonyof the Summit. We should work together to turn theconsensus reached at the Summit into action and usherin a new era of peace and development for people allover the world.It is the primary mission of the United Nations inthe new century to uphold the purposes and principlesof its Charter  promote democracy in internationalrelations  maintain world peace and stability andfacilitate the development and prosperity of allcountries. The United Nations Charter is amanifestation of the peoples' aspiration to equality justice and freedom. Over the past 55 years  the UnitedNations has adhered to the Charter aims ofsafeguarding peace  developing friendship andpromoting cooperation  as well as the core principlesguiding international relations  such as sovereignequality and non-interference in the internal affairs ofStates. It is precisely for these reasons that the UnitedNations has grown in strength and its membershipincreased from 51 to 189. This Organization is stillplaying an irreplaceable role in world affairs.The history of the past 55 years has amply provedthe effectiveness of the purposes and principles of theUnited Nations Charter. Today  global issues havemade our interests intertwined and modern technologyhas made our communication easier. In thesecircumstances  we need more than ever to face ourcommon challenges together on the basis of equality mutual respect and democratic consultation. Thepurposes and principles of the Charter are by no meansoutdated  but are rather of greater relevance today.Democracy in international relations requirescompliance with the principle of sovereign equality  as5provided for in the United Nations Charter. Countriesdiffer in size  strength and wealth  but they are allequal members of the international community. Noneshould be discriminated against and their statesovereignty brooks no encroachment. The internalaffairs of a country should be managed by the people ofthat country and major world affairs should be decidedby all countries through consultation. The response toglobal challenges calls for worldwide cooperation andcoordination. This is a necessity of our times and aprerequisite for the establishment of a fair and just newinternational political order. It is also the foundationand source of vitality for the United Nations in the newcentury.The reform of the United Nations should give fullexpression to democracy in international relations. Thereform is aimed at better safeguarding the fundamentalrights and interests of all Member States and especially  at truly reflecting the will of developingcountries  which make up the bulk of United Nationsmembership. It should not merely satisfy the needs of afew countries. The reform of the Security Councilshould seek primarily to increase representation ofdeveloping countries and should be based on extensivedeliberations among Member States. It is against thewill of the overwhelming majority of Member States toset arbitrar deadlines or to force the passage ofimmature plans.There is general agreement among the UnitedNations Member States on basing the scalemethodology of regular budget and peacekeepingassessment on the principle of the capacity to pay. Thismethodology is also one that has been confirmed timeand again by the General Assembly through itsresolutions and should therefore be abided by inwhatever circumstances. Any adjustment to thismethodology should take into full account the specificeconomic conditions of developing countries. Suchadjustments should be made only when there isconsensus among all Member States through extensiveconsultation  thus facilitating the normal and soundoperation of the United Nations.Another important historical task facing theUnited Nations is to respond to globalization and toachieve the common development of mankind. Thetwentieth century has seen both unprecedentedeconomic prosperity and the greatest polarization. Inthe last decade of the century  economic globalizationhas advanced at the fastest pace  while the gap betweenthe North and the South has continued to widen.According to the World Bank  the revenue of the low-income countries accounts for only 6 per cent of theworld's total  although they make up more than half ofthe world's population  while that of the developedcountries is 80 per cent with only one sixth of theworld population.It is especially worrisome that there is an evenwider gap between developing and developed countriesin the field of advanced technology. The new economyis so far benefiting only the rich countries. Mostdeveloping countries are still information have-nots.Should this situation be allowed to continue  manydeveloping countries will long remain deprived of theopportunity to participate in technological progress andeconomic growth and the world will be furtherpolarized.To prevent poverty from swallowing upachievements of development and to prevent socialinjustice from shaking the basis of global stability  theUnited Nations must play its due role in narrowing thegap between the rich and the poor and bringing aboutcommon prosperity to the world. It is an unavoidablemajor responsibility of the United Nations in the newcentury to promote the establishment of a newinternational economic order based on cooperation onan equal footing and aimed at common developmentand to ensure that economic globalization benefitseverybody in the world.The United Nations should give top priority to theissue of development  make efforts to change thecurrent situation in which global economic affairs aredominated by only a few countries and ensuredeveloping countries their right to equal participationin economic decision-making. In making or revisingglobal economic rules of the game  considerationshould first be given to the need of developingcountries in order to facilitate their development andreduce the risks they may face when participating inglobalization. The United Nations should also mobilizeall the resources available and encourage theinternational community to narrow the “digital divide” and it should help developing countries to seize  as faras they can  the opportunities brought about by thescientific and technological advancement driven by theinformation revolution. The United Nations also hasthe responsibility for introducing new rules to theworld to make science and technology truly serve all of6mankind and the lofty cause of peace and developmentin the world.As drastic and profound changes are taking placein the international situation  what kind of securityconcept should be embraced is a major subject beforethe United Nations and all its Member States. Globalstrategic stability is the foundation on which worldsecurity rests. And the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile(ABM) Treaty is an important cornerstone for globalstrategic stability. Any move to undermine the totalityand effectiveness of the Treaty will have a profoundnegative impact on world peace and security. Theproposal for a national missile defence system that isprohibited by the ABM Treaty is essentially aimed atseeking unilateral military and strategic supremacy  andthus a typical example of the cold war mentality. Sucha plan  if implemented  will only bring serious negativeconsequences to the security of the whole world. Theadoption by the General Assembly of the resolution onpreservation of and compliance with the ABM Treaty(A/54/54 A) at its fifty-fourth session by anoverwhelming majority is an indicator of the firm willof most countries in the world to maintain and strictlyobserve the ABM Treaty. The United Nations shouldcontinue to show serious concern over the attempt by acertain country to develop a missile defence system tothe detriment of global strategic stability  and it shouldtake necessary measures to stop this dangerousdevelopment.Security is mutual and relative. No countryshould enhance its security at the expense of that of theothers. To seek absolute unilateral security is notfeasible and will lead to greater insecurity. Withincreased international contacts and exchanges countries of the world will find themselves sharingmore common interests and facing more commonchallenges. Security can only be realized throughdialogue on an equal footing and in the spirit of mutualunderstanding and mutual accommodation. It can onlybe maintained on the basis of mutual respect andpeaceful coexistence  and it can only be consolidatedthrough mutually beneficial cooperation and commondevelopment. The only way to protect the fundamentalinterests of all countries and enhance universal securityis to replace the old security concept based on militaryalliances and military build-up with a new one that ischaracterized by equality  mutual trust  mutual benefit cooperation and settlement of disputes throughdialogue.In recent years  China  Russia  Kazakhstan Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan have reached  within theframework of the Shanghai Five and throughconsultation and cooperation based on equality  anagreement among themselves on confidence-buildingin the military field and reduction of military forces inthe border areas. This offers something useful for theinternational community to draw upon in itsexploratory efforts for a new security concept.We have noted with pleasure the positive changesin the situation on the Korean Peninsula and thepositive outcome of the successful historic summitbetween the Democratic People's Republic of Koreaand the Republic of Korea. It has shown once againthat dialogue and consultation based on equality serveto enhance mutual trust and improve relations betweenStates. We appreciate the efforts made by both theDemocratic People's Republic of Korea and theRepublic of Korea to promote peace  stability anddevelopment on the peninsula and in the region.We deeply regret that the tripartite summit atCamp David failed to produce any agreement. Webelieve that the Middle East peace process will moveforward as long as the parties concerned earnestly patiently and unswervingly engage themselves innegotiating and seriously implement the agreementsthat have already be reached among them on the basisof the relevant United Nation resolutions  inaccordance with the principle of land for peace and inthe spirit of mutual trust and mutual accommodation.In the twentieth century  mankind suffered a greatdeal from the scourges of war. In the twenty-firstcentury  humanitarian crises of a massive scale must beprevented  and the tragedy of innocent people beingslaughtered on a large scale must not be allowed torepeat itself. The United Nations shoulders a primaryresponsibility for the maintenance of world peace  andtherefore it should work harder to stop conflicts andeliminate wars.In the present-day world  hegemony and powerpolitics still exist. Territorial disputes  ethnic feuds andreligious rifts have all led to incessant regionalconflicts. Some countries and regions hope that theUnited Nations will assist them in stopping conflicts which we fully understand. At the same time  we mustnot fail to see the complexity of internationalintervention and the danger of inappropriateintervention. The United Nations intervention should7aim at eliminating the root causes of a given conflictrather than delaying its settlement. It should aim atfacilitating reconciliation between the conflictingparties rather than deepening their hatred and hostility.We are of the view that major powers and groups ofcountries should respect the sovereignty and territorialintegrity of the countries concerned rather thanmeddling in their internal affairs or triggering newconflicts.In the new circumstances  peacekeepingoperations remain an important means for the UnitedNations to fulfil its obligations in safeguarding worldpeace and security. In this regard  it is essential toensure and enhance the Security Council'sresponsibility and political leadership in peacekeepingoperations and to ensure the observance of thepurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.United Nations peacekeeping operations should belaunched with a sense of realism and within thecapacities of the United Nations. The limited resourcesshould be put to where they are most needed.Human beings are the most precious among allthe creatures on earth. To promote human developmentand protect all the rights and interests of mankind is theprimary responsibility of all countries. China is themost populous country in the world. The ChineseGovernment has taken upon itself to safeguard theindependence and dignity of the Chinese nation and toensure the almost 1.3 billion Chinese the right to adecent life and all-round development. It has regardedthis as its sacred duty and will do all it can to achievethis end.Human rights improvement is an ongoingprocess. The human rights conditions of a country areup to the people of that country to assess and improve.Since people live under different circumstances  theform in which human rights are embodied changes withthese circumstances and with time. Therefore  how toprotect and promote human rights depends on theactual conditions and specific needs of a country. Toarbitrarily impose a fixed set of human rights rules regardless of the differences in the specificenvironment and reality  will not serve the interests ofthe people of any country. To interfere in othercountries' internal affairs in the name of protectinghuman rights in order to advance one's own politicalagenda is simply to blaspheme and betray the humanrights cause.The United Nations should vigorously encouragedialogues and exchanges among different civilizationsand countries on human rights and discourageconfrontation and exclusion — which are the generaltrend of the human rights movement. In providinghumanitarian assistance  the United Nations shouldgive equal priority to the prevention of conflicts andthe protection of human rights  on the one hand  and tothe reduction and elimination of poverty and thepromotion of human development  on the other hand.In this context  the United Nations should work inclose coordination and cooperation with the countriesand Governments concerned  instead of bypassingthem  and ensure human rights for the majority of thepeople. Otherwise  such operations will trigger ahumanitarian disaster of a greater scale. Only when theabove-mentioned principles are abided by can theUnited Nations play a useful role in protecting humanrights.A few days ago  from this solemn podiumChinese President Jiang Zemin proclaimed to thewhole world the Chinese people's firm determinationto turn China into a strong  prosperous and unitedcountry with a high degree of democracy  and topromote world peace and development. In the past 20years and more since the inception of reform andopening-up  China completed the first and secondphases of its modernization strategy. With the advent ofthe new century  China will begin the third phase of thestrategy and enter a new stage of acceleratedmodernization. Once China becomes a member of theWorld Trade Organization (WTO)  there will be majorbreakthroughs in its opening-up. China will honour itscommitments and seriously fulfil its obligations  whileenjoying its rights.Although there will be difficulties  risks andchallenges on the road ahead  China is capable ofremoving every obstacle and achieving its grandobjective of modernization. China will unswervinglystick to its independent foreign policy of peace andfurther develop its friendly relations with the rest of theworld on the basis of the five principles of peacefulcoexistence. A strong and developed China will notonly benefit more than a billion Chinese people butalso serve prosperity and progress worldwide.To resolve the question of Taiwan once and for alland complete the reunification of the motherland is ashared aspiration of the entire Chinese people including our Taiwan compatriots. Adherence to the8principle of peaceful reunification and one country  twosystems in resolving the Taiwan question will serve thedevelopment of the two sides on either side of thestraits  contribute to amity and unity amongcompatriots on both sides  and facilitate peace andstability in the Asia-Pacific region. The ChineseGovernment and people have committed themselvesmore strongly than anyone else to a peacefulreunification. They have demonstrated the utmostsincerity and made the greatest efforts to this end. Weare convinced that — with the concerted efforts of theentire Chinese people  including those living inTaiwan — China will be able to realize its completereunification at an earlier date.We are entrusted with the important task ofcharting a course for mankind for the coming century.Let us join hands and work together to build a moresecure  prosperous and progressive world in the newcentury."
"32",1354,"CIV",55,2000,"Allow me at the outset  Sir  to express my delegation'ssatisfaction at seeing you preside over the work of theGeneral Assembly at this fifty-fifth session. You maycount on my delegation's support.I should also like to pay an unqualified tribute toyour predecessor  Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  for thequality of the work accomplished during his term ofoffice  and to commend Secretary-General Kofi Annan a great African of whom we are all proud  for hiscommitment to strengthening the universal role and thecredibility of our Organization.The United Nations family is growing day by day for which we all rejoice. That is why my delegationwelcomes the Republic of Tuvalu.Before addressing the situation prevailing in mycountry  I wish to share some of our concerns about theinternational situation.The challenges of the third millennium are notnew. They have been broadly outlined by theSecretary-General in his report  entitled “We thepeoples: the role of the United Nations in the twenty-first century”. For the delegation of Côte d'Ivoire given the difficulties facing the internationalcommunity  the issue is above all the need to draw upnew solutions in adhering to carefully establishedpriorities.As the Secretary-General stresses in hismillennium report “the 1 billion people living in developedcountries earn 60 per cent of the world's income while the 3.5 billion people in low-incomecountries earn less than 20 per cent”. (A/54/2000 para. 69)Furthermore  the technological progress that has beenachieved in computer science and communications which we welcome  has unfortunately also created adigital gap that has further marginalized the poorcountries.If  for the time being  we acknowledge theadvantages of globalization  it does seem to us that it isnot taking sufficient account of the concerns ofdeveloping countries  particularly those in Africa. Infact  the rate of Africa's participation in international27trade is still below two per cent. In sub-Saharan Africa particularly  the degree of poverty is almost the same asit was 20 years ago. This is why we would earnestlyappeal for Africa's integration and involvement inthose efforts to build a new architecture of the worldeconomy. Poverty and deprivation  which are the dailylot of peoples in the developing countries  are furtherexacerbated by the debt burden on their economies.In the particular case of my country  I would liketo emphasize that  even under the current difficultcircumstances  my Government continues to allocate52 per cent of its budgetary earnings to paying off itsexternal debt  and  quite naturally  this is to thedetriment of the priority programmes relating to health education and food self-sufficiency. Adding to this  wemust not overlook inflation and speculation  which leadto fluctuations in our commodity prices.In addition to our main preoccupation  which iscombating poverty  Côte d'Ivoire believes that toresolve conflicts  preventive diplomacy must bestrengthened and seen as a complementary dimensionto peacekeeping operations in the field. The conflictsthat beset the world have meant that peacekeepingoperations  which have become more and morecomplex  are now in the forefront of United Nationsactivities. Preparing for  organizing  setting up in thefield and financing these operations requiresconsiderable effort and considerable means. Thoseconducted in recent years throughout the world particularly in Africa  have unfortunately not had theresults we had hoped for. The experience of the “BlueHelmets” in Sierra Leone is illustrative of this.We hope that the excellent report of AmbassadorBrahimi  who has put forward new guidelines forUnited Nations peacekeeping operations in the twenty-first century  will be given the attention by StatesMembers that they deserve  so that acting on theserecommendations will endow our Organization with themeans it needs to play the role which it should inpreserving international peace and security.We very much welcome the conclusions ofBeijing Plus Five and the commitments which havebeen entered into in order to bring about theadvancement of women. We are convinced that thesecommitments will make it possible for women to fullyexercise all their rights and to finally achieve full andcomplete equality. Côte d'Ivoire  which was activelyinvolved in the work of this important meeting commits itself  for its part  to working for theimplementation of the targets set.May I  at this juncture in my statement  refer tothe question of the much-needed structural reform ofthe United Nations  particularly that of the SecurityCouncil. In these new circumstances  Côte d'Ivoirewould like to reaffirm the position held by theOrganization of African Unity (OAU)  which isclaiming two permanent seats and two new non-permanent seats in the Council.To return to matters in Côte d'Ivoire  and thesituation prevailing there  I would like to recall that on24 December 1999  my country underwent its firstexperience of an institutional change taking place apartfrom the balloting boxes. In fact  on the day beforethat  a military mutiny  on the part of soldiers who wereclaiming better living conditions  resulted in thetoppling of the existing constitutional order. Thisunexpected speeding up of events in my countryaroused  and continues to arouse  major concern withinthe international community  a concern and an anxietywhich points to the interest that the internationalcommunity attaches to my country. Up until now  Côted'Ivoire  considered as a haven of peace and an oasisof stability  and recognized as a driving force in theeconomy of the subregion  particularly of thosecountries that constitute the West African Economicand Monetary Union  has been playing an importantand irreplaceable part as a regulatory force in WestAfrica. The millions of our brothers who have comefrom countries in the subregion  and who live in mycountry  are substantially responsible for generating themoney circulating in their countries of origin. If thiscountry  Côte d'Ivoire  were to implode  it would haveunforeseen consequences for the process of solidarityand sharing.On 23 July  the Ivorian people expressedthemselves through a referendum on the new draftconstitution and electoral code placed before it by thetransitional Government. It should be recalled that themilitary arm was involved neither in the drafting of thenew constitution nor in that of the new electoral code.The political parties  social and professionalorganizations  the administrative regions of thecountry  religious organizations  women's and youthassociations and non-governmental organizations — inother words  civil society — were those who  throughtheir freely appointed representatives  drafted andsubmitted to the Government these new fundamental28texts that the Government  in turn  simply placedbefore the populace for its approval.This consultation  the transparency of which wasvery much heralded by the international community was characterized by a massive turn-out of theelectorate of 86.23 per cent. We believe that this resultshould  in itself  be enough to put an end to thediscussions and speculations that preceded andfollowed the referendum  the tone of which  in manyrespects  was not to the liking of the people of the Côted'Ivoire and their friends.We welcome the efforts made by the UnitedNations  the European Union  the OAU and theEconomic Community of West African States(ECOWAS) in order to try and bring about commonground among the political circles in Côte d'Ivoire andto support the transitional process. Therefore  theinternational community should be reassured that thepeople of Côte d'Ivoire will  on 22 October of thisyear  express their wishes through fair and transparentelections for candidates whose eligibility has beenestablished by the Constitutional Chamber of theSupreme Court.To spend time today still talking about therequirements for eligibility  as contained in the textsthat have been adopted  would be an attempttantamount to trying to perpetuate a discussion whosefate has already been definitely  once and for all  sealedby the people of Côte d'Ivoire.Trained in the school of the founding father ofmodern Côte d'Ivoire  President Félix Houphouët-Boigny  the apostle of peace  and belonging as we do toa subregion that has been beset by conflicts  some ofwhich have taken place at the very gates of Ivorianterritory  the people of Côte of d'Ivoire are only toowell aware of the importance of peace. The people aredetermined to preserve peace without backsliding orcompromise.My country is not xenophobic  nor is it a place ofexclusion. Côte d'Ivoire is still the only country in theworld where foreigners account for more than 40 percent of the total population. The problems of all kindsthat arise from this unparalleled immigration — social economic and even political — are real. The country isaddressing and coping with them as best it can. We donot wish our brothers and sisters  who are living onvery good terms with the Ivorian population  to leave.In this respect  we are very proud of being themost integrationist country of the EconomicCommunity of West African States and we intend toremain so. That is why we believe that the desire of theIvorian people to offer one single political post  that ofPresident of the Republic  to a citizen of establishedbackground should not serve as a pretext for spreadingmalicious rumours about our country and its people.In this connection  we are counting on theunderstanding and support of the internationalcommunity to help us successfully through thistransition and  within our self-imposed schedule  toachieve the state of constitutional normality that ourpeople so earnestly desires."
"33",1441,"COD",55,2000,"Once again I shall rely onthe kindness of those who interpret our speeches  sinceI am yet again putting them to the test of workingwithout a written text.I shall switch between repetition and familiarissues  between deception and truth.First  repetition. As last year  the President of theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  Mr. Laurent-DÈsirÈKabila  has sent me to this very same rostrum to speakabout the same issues. Once again our invaders andaggressors  from Rwanda and Uganda inparticular  are in our country  and I shall speak aboutthis again. This falls under the heading of repetition.I shall talk about this issue in the spirit and the letter ofthe principles of the United Nations. The letter isimportant insofar as it helps us make sense of thissituation. I would suggest to delegations a smallexercise regarding the reputedly historic work we dohere. By playing with historic a little  by transposinga letter or two  another meaning can be found.I am awaiting the letter of the solution that theUnited Nations will adopt one day regarding theproblem of the aggression against  and occupation ofour country by  people who are here in this very Halland who have spoken falsely yesterday and today.Uganda has said that it has come to my country inorder to solve problems among the Congolese. Havethe Ugandans come as tourists? Have they come asscientific researchers?We need to return to the letter of the definition ofaggression. These people  who ordinarily are ourneighbours  leave their country  cross our borders come into our country and are occupying it even as Ispeak. And  as if they had not already gone too far they have taken it upon themselves to say what weshould do to settle the problems among the Congolesepeople. They do not talk about inter-Ugandan dialogue;they do not talk about inter-Rwandan dialogue. Theytalk about the inter-Congolese dialogue. Perhaps that iswhy they are slitting people's throats  massacringpeople  cutting off penises  burying women alive. Theyare planting fields of arms in the way that Van Goghplanted fields of sunflowers  burying women alive andleaving their arms sticking out of their graves  withthe idea of later harvesting arms. They have multipliedthe number of Dachaus by thousands. They shut up ourpopulations in their humble huts and then set the hutson fire. Perhaps this is their understanding ofparticipating in a solution to the Congolese problem.Unjustifiably!It is a deception for the head of State of one ofthese countries to play around in New York and sayWe will not leave the Democratic Republic of theCongo. Notwithstanding the clear resolutions of theSecurity Council  resolutions 1234 (1999) and 1304(2000)  which state plainly that the Rwandans  theUgandans and Burundians must leave the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo  representatives of thosecountries come here and say We will not leave.These impostors come to this very building and dare toengage in such arm wrestling for the benefit of the26leaders and other representatives of the countriesgathered here.I do not want someone to tell me  even if it istrue You have made a wonderful speech.I want to be told We shall report back to ourGovernments and heads of State what you said because it is the truth: truth in response to deception.As the philosopher Spinoza said  Verum index sui etfalsi; that is  truth is a touchstone both of the truthitself and of falsehood. One of our singers  his name Koffi Olomide  is worth remembering  sings  in oneof the languages that are well known to Africans wholisten to Congolese music and from which I amtranslating: A lie takes the elevator  but the truth usesthe stairs. The phrase is even prettier in Lingala.And so it is  the lies of the aggressors havequickly arisen to fool people. They are trying to passfor little lambs  these people who are in a country thatis not their own  where no one wants them to be andwhere they have not been invited. They are there. Andthey have the nerve to say We will not leave notwithstanding the clear Security Council resolutionsthat enjoin them to leave our country without delay orconditions.I am repeating today what I said last year;however  I must repeat this because these people arestill in my country and show no sign of leaving. Theyhave outrageous plans  such as creating a Great LakesRepublic by cutting up our country and joining entireprovinces of it to their countries.All of this will seem quite clear if you look at amap of my country. You will see that our 2.347 millionsquare kilometres are located amid small asteroids thatgravitate around it in some sort of Brownian motion.They enter our country  massacre people and  as I saidearlier  shamelessly state that they are not going toleave. They believe that this lie will prevail because ithas taken the lift  while our truth has to take the stairs.But I believe that our truth is making headway in yourminds. Right is on our side.None of our own soldiers are in Kigali or inKampala  but there is an unwanted multitude of foreignsoldiers in my country  growing in number as well as inweaponry. No doubt they are there for tourism. Sincewe are embarking upon a historic millennium  andwe should consider the meaning of that adjective  wemust remind those people that they have to leave now today. They should go home. They must not remain inmy country because what they are doing is abominable.I have given the Assembly a Dantesquedescription of what these people are doing in mycountry  supposedly for peaceful reasons. They aremassacring people  as I have stated. They are buryingwomen alive and cutting off the penises of prisoners.This needs to be analysed. Why would anyone do thatto prisoners? The lies in the lift will not tell you aboutthat  but the stairway will. I hope you will inform yourrespective Governments of the realities of the situationin the Democratic Republic of the Congo. People say itis complex  but in fact it is not complex at all. Thosepeople are not in their country. They have crossed ourborders  supposedly to secure their own borders andsupposedly because the génocidaires are in my country occasionally returning to their own countries to sowdisorder.Once again  look at a map of our country. Youwill see that the asteroids that I mentioned  Rwanda inparticular  have borders on Lake Kivu. It is a verysmall area that is the real border between us. If youlook at the map  you will see that these asteroids  inorder to secure their borders  have gone 2 000kilometres beyond this real border  to the Atlantic  tostart a war. We do not know how they manage to movetheir soldiers around because they do not haveaeroplanes; however  know that they manage. Theymove heavy weaponry 2 000 kilometres in order tostart a war  the purpose of which is to defend theirborders 2 000 kilometres away. Who can possiblybelieve this? Who can claim that this is the truth?When you wish to defend and secure your border  youput your troops at your border so that others do notcross.There is yet another lie: they say that they arepursuing the perpetrators of the genocide that everyoneremembers from 1994. They claim that they arepursuing them because they have hidden in ourcountry. Well  these people occupy two provinces inthe border area of our country and one other provincethat is even farther away  farther from the equator.They have never caught any génocidaires  livingor dead. It would be a shock if they did. The Rwandans27are saying that there are génocidaires in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo in order to justifytheir presence. However  they have never caught any.Why have they never caught a génocidaire? Ithink they are incapable of doing two things at once.Each Rwandan or Ugandan has only two hands  andthose two hands are busy. Do you know what they aredoing? They are taking our diamonds  copper  gold precious wood and rare animals  which they do nothave on their asteroids. And they are becomingdiamond exporters. If you look at the stock exchange you will see that Rwanda this month exported so manydiamonds  but those diamonds are covered in the bloodof the Congolese people. The gemocracy thatemploys them is doing the same thing in Sierra Leone Liberia and Angola. One could say that the commondenominator between those countries and ours is thatwe are under the thumb of gemocrats who prevent usfrom creating democracy. We have gemocrats againstdemocrats. That is the deepest meaning to be found inthese poor countries that wish to become rich throughpillaging and plundering  which they do in the full lightof day where everyone can see them. What is moresurprising still is that nobody tells them to stop theirplundering and go home. This is an absolute fraud  andit threatens our African brothers as well. A country thatis one eightieth the size of ours  that not long ago before Lumumba  held the reins of our country  daresto allow its justice system  because in our countrythere are patriots and nationalists I come from a province near the Atlantic  2 000kilometres away from the Rwandan border. I seeappear in my province people who are easilyrecognized by their phenotype  accompanied by someCongolese passing through the province on their way toKinshasa. They even go to the airport to defend theirborders  which are 2 000 kilometres away. Our patriotsand nationalists stand up and do not welcome them. Wetell them what we must tell them  as a true patriotwould do in the face of the invader.That country  one eightieth the size of our own allows its justice system to prosecute me  to issue anarrest warrant against me and to inform all othercountries that if I go to their country  I should bearrested for crimes against humanity  just because Ispoke as a patriot against those who have come into mycountry.One country  more powerful than the others  hasasked  because of the thrashing it has received  to beallowed a corridor to the Atlantic. We do not know howthese people got to the province of Kivu  which theyhave virtually annexed. They have changed the localadministrators  appointed new governors and changedthe telephone system. In order to call this province  youhave to dial the code for Rwanda. This is well known.They even direct automobile traffic. In other words they have completely taken over our province.Nonetheless  in their speeches they say they are infavour of the territorial integrity and politicalindependence of the Democratic Republic of theCongo. At the same time  though  they are appointinggovernors in our country  changing the names of ourstreets and making decisions as if it were their country.These countries have spilled blood in our jungleand dare to assume the right to tell us who our Ministerfor Foreign Affairs should be. In threatening myfreedom of movement  perhaps they imagined that Iwould not manage to reach New York  but we havemore than one trick up our sleeve. Here I am. I willleave New York and go wherever my President tells meto go. We hope that other countries that wish tomaintain good relations with us will refuse to heedthese uneducated judges.I say uneducated because I have urged ourpeople to rise and crush the invaders and to make themeat their words  but these judges thought I had calledfor the invaders to be strangled. These judges are souneducated they did not realize that I was quotingVoltaire. And now that I've admitted to quotingVoltaire  they will probably issue international arrestwarrants for him  because they have no idea who hewas. Who are these countries to appoint themselvesuniversal judges and to prosecute people who are nottheir citizens for acts that were not committed in theirterritories? These judges do not rely on law  sincetheir position is indefensible  but on the law of thejungle  because they are hunters. They made theirpronouncements two years ago. They are like hunterswho make no sound as they stalk their prey  but I tooam silent. I have not been warned or notified  butINTERPOL knows it must arrest me if it gets its handson me. They have been just like big game hunters.Everyone knows what happened to our PrimeMinister  Mr. Lumumba. In the tragedy in which aSecretary-General of the United Nations lost his life the people  one person in particular  who carried28out that dirty work dissolved Lumumba's body insulphuric acid. Perhaps they are after me now becausethey are suffering a shortage of sulphuric acid. Thisgentlemen kept one of Lumumba's teeth as a talismanand displayed it on television  admitting that they haddismembered Lumumba's body  dissolved it insulphuric acid and kept his tooth as a charm. Theseuniversal judges have not been moved to prosecute theperson who boasts of having dissolved Lumumba'sbody and kept one of his teeth. I think these peopleintend to open a museum some time soon and to growrich charging admission to see Lumumba's tooth.My African brothers may also be prosecutedwhen people arrogating the right to appoint members ofGovernment issue warrants for them. That is why mybrothers should not remain silent. They are foreignministers and the same thing could happen to them.They should react. They should not think of me assomeone who is uneducated. These countries must beprevented from acting beyond their rights. No oneassigned them the task of running the world's affairsthrough their own brand of justice.I do not wish to linger on this ridiculous topic but I would go even further in discussing truth andmendacity. Everyone is convinced that we are erectingobstacles to the diplomatic work of the United Nations but Lumumba's tooth should be a sign that we havehistorical reasons for our actions. What goes aroundcomes around. I recognize that we have been veryparticular about how the United Nations forces may bedeployed  but we have acceded to the Organization'swishes. We agreed to the Mission and to the LusakaCeasefire Agreement  although the fire has yet tocease. People persist in believing in the validity of theAgreement  but it was signed on 10 July 1999 and thefires are still burning today and the war continues.Still  people keep talking about the Lusaka CeasefireAgreement.Well  the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement designatesthe invaders  the aggressors  as parties. These partiessigned the Agreement  but Security Council resolution1304 (2000) implies that they are the aggressors andenjoins them to leave my country. Thus  they are nolonger parties  but aggressors who should leave as soonas possible.Moreover  their Congolese puppets are playingthe role of Trojan horse. These invaders have exploitedcertain Congolese supporters of Mobutu to justify theirinvasion of our country and their aggression. Now  oneof these asteroids is giving shelter to Mobutu's formersoldiers. They are training in Kampala and their aim ofreturning to Kinshasa has been openly declared. Onelarge country is helping others to build military baseson our borders and is training their soldiers in order toincrease tourism in our country.We must be vigilant. We must act to ensure theimplementation of the United Nations resolutions. Wewould tell the United Nations that  in order to be moreeffective and to have a greater chance of success  itmust implement its own resolutions. I would expressthe hope that I shall not have to return here next year torepeat yet again that the Rwandans are still in mycountry  sowing death and pillaging our land. TheUnited Nations must finally implement its ownresolutions.How can it do so? It can compel the Ugandansand Rwandans to return to their homes. We do not wantthem in our country. They are our eternal neighbours asteroids that orbit our planet. Let them go home. Letthem talk to us. We want this war to end as all othersdo: with negotiations. The Second World War ended innegotiations; the war in Algeria ended in negotiationsbetween France and the National Liberation Front; thewar in Viet Nam ended in negotiations between thehost country here and the Vietnamese; the war betweenProtestants and Catholics in Northern Ireland  whichhas broken all endurance records  is showing signs ofending soon. How? Through negotiations between theCatholics and the Protestants.Just the other day  in reference to another topic  Imentioned that Security Council resolution 242 (1967)was adopted over 40 years ago  but that it is only nowbeginning to be implemented. Now  we are not going towait 40 years for our Clinton and our Camp David. TheUnited Nations must implement its resolutionsimmediately. It must support us to ensure that theaggressors  whatever they may say  go home. They arenot at home. We do not want them in our country. Theymust go home.The Second World War erupted after a longincubation. We now see hope for perpetual peacefollowing that war  but I agree with Paul …luard that wemust be vigilant because the womb that bore the vilebeast is still fertile. We want all men  even ourenemies  to be our brothers. We want to rebuild ourcountry  which was dismantled by the excesses of29Mobutu. Like luard  we want to turn water into lightand  as I said  to make every man our brother.That is my message to the Assembly. I repeat: donot tell me(spoke in English)You have made a wonderful speech.(spoke in French)Say We have understood your message and we shalltell our Governments to implement the relevant UnitedNations resolutions immediately so that the aggressorsgo home. Please help us to talk with them  in order toput an end to this war  which should end as all warsend. Some of us lost all our hair waiting for the blessedday  17 May 1997  after 32 years of activity. Look atPresident Kabila's head and mine; we can berecognized by our advanced baldness  which cameabout while we were waiting for the moment when wecould re-enter Kinshasa.So  my African brothers and my brothers fromother countries  including many from Latin America  Iconclude with a Spanish saying. I do not wish totranslate it  so those who do not understand will haveto stop a Spanish-speaking colleague and ask Whatdid he say?:(spoke in Spanish)When your neighbour's house is on fire  watch out foryour own house."
"34",1488,"COG",55,2000,"May Istart by joining previous speakers in offering  on behalfof the Congolese delegation  warm congratulations toMr. Harri Holkeri on his election to the presidency ofthis Millennium General Assembly  as well as to themembers of his Bureau. He can be sure that theCongolese delegation is ready and willing to help himaccomplish his important and delicate task.I should also like to pay homage to hispredecessor  Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  Minister forForeign Affairs of the Republic of Namibia  for theskill and wisdom with which he carried out hismission.Finally  I should also like to commend Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his devotion and efficiency ashe leads our Organization.The Millennium Summit  that great historicgathering  provided the leaders of the planet with anopportunity to debate at the highest level the burningissues of the dawn of the twenty-first century. Theheads of State and Government examined the report ofthe Secretary-General on the role of the United Nationsin the twenty-first century  and this led to wise andrelevant decisions  which we should welcome. It is nowup to us to do our utmost to ensure that the conclusionsof that report will be translated into action.The reform of the United Nations  themanagement of globalization  the preservation of theenvironment  the promotion and protection of humanrights  peacekeeping and international security areamong the challenges facing humanity  today morethan ever before. The reform of the United Nations isof course essential. After more than half a century ofexistence  our Organization must take account of thewill of all Member States to participate in themanagement of the world's affairs. The United Nationsmust therefore undergo the transformations required inorder to adapt to the requirements of the modern world.This reform is in our opinion both necessary andurgent.With regard to globalization  the question is nolonger whether one is in favour of or against thisphenomenon. Globalization is a concrete reality that ishaving an impact on all areas of international relations.Globalization is under way. However  if it is to produceall of its intended benefits  it is necessary to take intoaccount the interests of the developing countries. Inthis regard  the question of development assistance debt and access to developed country markets must beenvisaged as conditions that will allow more fruitfuland mutually beneficial cooperation between the Northand South.We are also very much concerned about theenvironment. Its preservation and protection have beenat the centre of the concerns of the United Nationssince the world conference in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. Itis of the utmost importance for our shared environmentto be preserved and managed in conformity with theprinciples of sustainable development. All of us —developed countries and developing countries Governments and private sector — all of us must agreeto pay the price in a spirit of solidarity in order toremove any pretext for those who sometimes say theyhave no other choice but to degrade the environment.What is at stake is the indispensable safeguarding offauna  flora and  above all  the forests of thedeveloping countries.The Congo  an equatorial country  feels a specialresponsibility in this area. Our Government has made asolemn commitment to the sustainable managementand use of our forests. This subject will in fact be thefocal point of a ministerial meeting of the AfricanTimber Organization  which will take place inBrazzaville from 9 to 13 October next.With regard to peacekeeping and internationalsecurity  extensive efforts have been deployed by theUnited Nations to free humanity of the scourge of war.And although our successes may be remarkable  theyare far from meeting the expectations of millions ofmen  women and children around the world  who awaitwith anguish. That is why we strongly support the28proposals in the Brahimi Report and call for their rapidimplementation. In addition  we follow with interestand hope the negotiations between the State of Israeland the Palestinian Authority  and we greatly hope thatthese efforts will be crowned with success.We also welcome the most recent developmentsin the Korean Peninsula  all the more so because theseexpress the will and deep aspiration of the Koreanpeople  separated by war  to live together in peace. Wealso welcome the results achieved in Somalia  thanks tothe mediation of Mr. Ismail Omar Guelleh  President ofthe Republic of Djibouti. We welcome this truerenaissance in Somalia and we express our best wishesfor the return of a lasting peace in that fraternalcountry.In Central Africa  determined to strengthen theiroperational peacekeeping capacities in the face ofpersistent crises and conflicts that are causingdeterioration in the region  the members of theEconomic Community of Central African States havedecided to establish a council for peace and security(COPAX)  whose operational organs will include therapid reaction mechanism and the multinationalpeacekeeping force. Above and beyond its preventivemission  COPAX is also a response to the Secretary-General's call for reserve forces. It is important for theinternational community to contribute to the properfunctioning of this sub-regional mechanism forpreventive purposes and for managing and settlingconflicts in this region of the world  which is the victimof murderous  devastating wars. We would like to takethis solemn occasion to express our desire to be fullyassociated in the search for solutions to the problems ofconcern to us.Our daily experience — one shared withothers — of the consequences of conflicts withneighbours fully justifies this concern; we want toeliminate the sources of conflicts with our neighbours.That is why  whenever it is necessary  the Congo doesits utmost to dispel any misunderstandings and tostrengthen the links of brotherhood and cooperativerelationships with its neighbours.Here  I must draw the attention of theinternational community to the humanitarian dramathat is under way in the north-eastern part of ourcountry as the result of the massive influx of refugeesand displaced persons fleeing the renewed fighting inthe Democratic Republic of Congo  a country withwhich we share approximately 2 000 kilometres ofborder. Given the seriousness of this situation  theGovernment of the Republic of Congo would like torenew its call for robust assistance for the populationsin distress  who have virtually been forgotten by theinternational community.As the Assembly knows  my country  theRepublic of Congo  has also been shaken by internalconflict. I should like to assure the Assembly that wehave re-established peace after the signature of theceasefire agreements and the agreements to ceasehostilities last year  thanks to the mediation of El HadjOmar Bongo  President of the Republic of Gabon.Once again  we should like to express our sinceregratitude to him.Since then  the Congo has turned its face towardsthe future. The future for us means the consolidation ofthis peace  national reconciliation  the rebuilding of ourcountry and relaunching the process ofdemocratization. That is why  starting in September ofthis year  as proscribed by the President of theRepublic  Mr. Denis Sassou Nguesso  the Governmentof the Congo has undertaken a mission to carry out thebroadest possible consultations on a draft constitutionto be submitted to our transitional Parliament in March2001. Its adoption will open the way to a constitutionalreferendum and general elections.Similarly  in the framework of the reconstructionof our country  we have just adopted an interim post-conflict programme for the period 2000-2002. Itsimplementation requires the mobilization of significantfinancial resources  and the support of the internationalcommunity is indispensable for this purpose.We can never reiterate enough that ourOrganization has demonstrated its utility. Its reform which is today unavoidable if we are to make it morecredible in a world which is undergoing constantchange and which will be changed profoundly byglobalization  is absolutely necessary. We must havevery strong political will to fight against poverty ignorance  illness  injustice and violence  as well as thedegradation and destruction of our planet. This is theonly way to guarantee the credibility of the UnitedNations to the peoples of the United Nations.May the commitments made at the MillenniumSummit guide our daily actions  so that the role of theUnited Nations will indeed be strengthened over thecoming century for the well-being of all of humanity.29"
"35",1535,"COL",55,2000,"Allow me to congratulate you  Sir  on yourelection as President of the General Assembly at thecurrent session. I am confident that under your ableguidance our deliberations will yield success. I alsowish to thank your predecessor for his leadership andfor the his exemplary work as President of theAssembly during the fifty-fourth session. I also havethe honour to extend convey my greetings to theSecretary-General and to acknowledge his firmleadership and his continuing interest in the search forpractical and innovative solutions.For Colombia  this session represents a historicchallenge: the challenge to forge new relationshipsaimed at carrying out the mission agreed upon by headsof State or Government at the Millennium Summit.They have defined the parameters of the world inwhich we wish to live and the conditions for creating anew international political and economic order. Mycountry had the honour to submit the Cartagena deIndias Declaration (A/54/929)  a commitment adoptedby heads of State of the Rio Group  which enunciatesthe aspirations of our region and is an exceptionalcontribution to the future of the United Nations. Wewill now undertake a careful follow-up of theseinitiatives so as to translate them into realities for thebenefit of humankind.Perhaps the dawn of the new millennium willenable us to face this challenge with optimism  tosignal a break with the legacy of half a century andwith the many proposals that have so often met withindifference. It represents an opportunity to translateour collective aspirations into tangible reality.In large part  our expectations relate to themeaning and scope of globalization. Sweepingrevolutions are taking place in the fields oftransportation  communication and the electronicmedia. Every day we are astonished by advances intechnology and by the discoveries of applied science.The main purpose of the United Nations and of itsvarious forums and agencies is to channel thisenormous store of technological and scientificknowledge towards the poorest and most vulnerablesectors of the population.Information technology is bringing structuralchange to the international economy and unprecedentedopportunities to promote creative cultural interactionamong peoples. But the information revolution can alsobecome a source of exclusion. We face the risk ofcreating a new form of illiteracy: cyber-illiteracy. Wemust bridge the digital divide and convert informationtechnology into a positive factor for education andpoverty-reduction so that the information revolutionmay become truly global. Failure to do so will increasethe gap between rich and poor.One of our principal challenges is therefore toglobalize globalization and to make it an imperative forthe twenty-first century. It is  in other words  to bringthe benefits of this process to more regions  nationsand individuals by democratizing access to newtechnologies  eliminating barriers to trade andinvestment and recognizing that the resources withwhich nature provides us are the common heritage offuture generations.Here  preservation of the environment is a keyelement. We have an obligation to respect nature and tobuild a sustainable future. We must put an end to thedestruction being caused by the irrational use of naturalresources and by unsound patterns of consumption andproduction. This requires greater political commitmentto control climate change  eliminate sources of waterpollution and put an end to the loss of our forests. Theprovision of financial resources and transfer ofenvironmentally safe technologies are issues still to beresolved. The international community must honour thecommitments it has assumed in this field before it istoo late.For their part  the United Nations and themultilateral financial institutions must develop a newframework to prevent and respond to risks andeconomic crises. We need a stable  ordered  transparentand predictable financial system  one in which we canstrengthen our early warning capacity  effectivelycontrol the volatility of capital flows and ensuresufficient liquidity to provide timely support tocountries affected by crisis. Another urgent priority isto create social protection networks that can be used intimes of financial crisis.The beginning of the millennium is marked alsoby new concerns and threats to peace and security. Theproliferation and illicit trade in small arms is one ofthese. The illegal traffic in such arms has reached31unacceptable proportions; its impact has been evenmore devastating than that of weapons of massdestruction. Despite this  the international communityis not giving it the importance and priority which thisgrave problem demands. Urgent and effective measuresare needed to halt and completely eliminate this illegaltrade.Countries affected by this phenomenon must notremain exposed to the criminal activities of thenetworks of arms traffickers who  taking advantage ofthe absence of monitoring and oversight mechanisms are causing irreparable damage to our societies.Governments have the political and moralresponsibility to act decisively against illicit armsexports and to bring all the force of the law to bearagainst the merchants of death and violence who profitfrom this nefarious trade. My country  Colombia  haspaid a very high price in human lives as a consequenceof this criminal activity.Countries that are exporters of small arms mustestablish controls on intermediaries and refrain fromauthorizing sales if there is a risk of improper use.There is a need for greater transparency and for theexchange of information on the modalities and routesof this trade. We must urgently create mechanisms toprovide financial and technical assistance so thataffected countries will be better able to implementeffective controls. We have a responsibility to ensurethat the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Tradein Small Arms and Light Weapons in all its Aspects  tobe held in 2001  results in concrete commitments andeffective action.The global problem of illicit drugs  for its part continues to be one of the most serious threats of ourtime. It is a factor for violence and corruption economic disruption and impoverishment  erosion ofthe social fabric and instability in democracies. It isalso a cause of alarming environmental disasters.No nation has suffered as tragically as Colombiafrom the consequences of this global problem. Everyday  lives are lost in Colombia through the action ofoutlaw groups whose activities are financed fromresources obtained from the traffic in drugs. Now when all our efforts are focused on the difficult battleagainst this problem  we need increased support andthe effective solidarity of the international community.Only by accepting and fully implementing theprinciple of shared responsibility will humankind beable to free itself from the scourge of illicit drugs. Weask for no more. Let us all assume the cost that is ourshare to bear in order to wipe this illegal activity fromthe face of the earth.Colombia is making extraordinary efforts toadvance towards a solution to its internal conflict. It isa fundamental objective that we will never renounce.We are aware that the building of peace takes time  butwe are making steady progress. In the midst of thecomplexities of our situation in Colombia  and despitethe cruelty of the present conflict  we have madeprogress in confidence-building  in the dialogue  in thediscussion of the thematic agendas and in theparticipation of civil society. We know full well thatthe achievement of peace requires in-depth action inthe economic and social fields that could give real andlasting content to these efforts.A number of countries have joined in thisprocess  at the request of the Government. Today peace in Colombia is important for the world. I appealto the international community to reaffirm its solidarityand offer its material support to our peace process.One of the most important developments of thelast two decades has been the increasing commitmentto respect for human rights. We have made someprogress in defining economic and social rights as anindivisible component of so-called traditional rights orindividual freedoms. The old objections that preventedus from proclaiming the universal validity andapplication of human rights are gradually losing wayand States have accepted their responsibility forensuring compliance.In recent years  civil conflicts have become amajor expression of violence. Internationalhumanitarian law is essential to deal with theconsequences of these confrontations. Its enforcement however  requires agreement on the minimum rules ofrespect for the civil population and the interests ofStates. The key to that enforcement is thathumanitarian law  its postulates  norms andmechanisms  should be equally applied by all partiesin conflict.The movements of people  including refugees ormigrants  must also be recognized as a priority issue.They are protected by a concrete framework of humanrights. In a world that promotes the free movement ofcapital and free trade  it is unacceptable that unjustified32restrictions continue to be applied to the movement ofpeople.The solution to concrete problems on theinternational agenda necessarily requires concertedaction and multilateralism; Colombia has always beenand will continue to be firmly committed to it. Webelieve that this multilateralism can be supplementedby convergent regional initiatives and bilateralism aspart of an approach to reduce distances andimbalances  in other words  a multilateralism thatserves as a bridge for rapprochement  solidarity andshared responsibility  concepts upon which the entirebuilding of the contemporary international order mustbe constructed.Our peoples  in whose name the Charter of theUnited Nations was conceived  yearn to see how thefulfilment of the purposes and functions of the UnitedNations can be reflected in the satisfaction of theirhopes and aspirations. Even though in many respectswe are still far from this objective  we must preservethe gains achieved. An attitude of passivity is notconvenient for the Organization. This Assembly mustadopt decisions to reactivate the process of UnitedNations reform  on realistic grounds  but withoutfurther delaying the measures that require urgentimplementation. There are many initiatives that can berealized without the need for reform of the Charter. Theonly thing required is the will to show solidarity and tomake timely political decisions.The United Nations acts as the world'sconscience  requiring greater priority in order to meetthe needs of the poor countries. Strategies must beurgently developed to mobilize funds to remove thecauses of underdevelopment. The growing gap betweenthe wealth of the prosperous and the poverty of thosewho are marginalized from progress is in itself anappeal for attention which should be listened to andshould lead to the translation of words into deeds.In this connection  we welcome the growing rolebeing played by non-governmental organizations whose activities should be accompanied by a properdefinition of their responsibilities. For their part  thetransnational corporations  which play such animportant function in the global economy  should giveserious consideration to the United Nations throughfinancial support to the Organization  which is inurgent need of additional resources. This support couldwell be channelled towards United Nations poverty-reduction programmes.The reform of the Security Council continues tobe one of the principal reforms anticipated from theexpected adjustment of multilateral politicalinstitutions. But in this area we need a gradual  lessmaximalist approach. Formulas must be explored toensure greater participation of developing countries.We must take effective steps to promote greaterrepresentativity in the Council  on the understandingthat this does not constitute a privilege  but rather aresponsibility. Broader regional representation restrictions on the use of the veto and greatertransparency in the decision-making process couldbring the Security Council closer to a reality that is notthe same now in the twenty-first century as it was in1945.The election of new members to the Council willtake place in a few weeks. Colombia has the support ofLatin America and the Caribbean to be elected as anon-Permanent Member of this important organ. Onceour entry is approved by the General Assembly  we willassume this responsibility as of 1 January. It will be anopportunity to reaffirm Colombia's commitment to  andconfidence in  multilateralism and its resolute andunconditional commitment to the norms and principlesof international law. We will also reaffirm ourconviction that peaceful and negotiated solutions todisputes and respect for international humanitarian lawby all parties to a conflict are essential in order to buildfirm and lasting foundations for peace and security. Wewill promote better functioning of the Council especially in terms of information and consultationwith States that are not part of that organ  and we willfoster a more permanent and closer relationship withthe General Assembly as the supreme organ of theUnited Nations.Never before has humankind had the prospectlike the one now afforded at the beginning of the newmillennium to make steady progress towards peace progress and international stability. It is an opportunityfor the leaders of the world to make a decisive politicalstep in that direction. Let us give our peoples new hopethat the change in the millennium will signify notmerely a chronological change but also the beginningof a true political and social transformation. Only thuswill future generations recognize that we had thecourage to assume our obligations with responsibility."
"36",1575,"COM",55,2000,"Onbehalf of the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros I congratulate you  Sir  on your assumption of thepresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-fifthsession. I assure you of our full support andcooperation in the accomplishment of your tasks. Yourskill and extensive experience in international affairsconvince us that this session will be crowned withsuccess.I am honoured to take this opportunity to extendour profound appreciation to your predecessor  Mr.Theo-Ben Gurirab  the Minister for Foreign Affairs ofNamibia  for his outstanding management of our affairsduring the previous session  for his leadership role inthe General Assembly and for his spirit of effectivecooperation.We also thank Secretary-General Kofi Annan forhis tireless efforts in the service of our Organization.His wise approach to the important issues and thereforms he is implementing in the United Nationsdeserve our support and cooperation at all levels.On behalf of the Islamic Federal Republic of theComoros  I also congratulate Tuvalu on its admissionto membership of the United Nations.(spoke in French)Considering the enormous responsibilities of theUnited Nations in peacekeeping  the defence of humanrights and the promotion of social well-being  it is easyto see why  55 years after its creation  the Organizationstill has a great deal to do. Given its varied activities  itneeds more solid and up-to-date structures that areadapted to contemporary conditions; sufficient andreliable funding; sound  transparent and energeticmanagement; and the ability to carry out its tasks inconformity with current priorities and specific regionalconcerns. The Millennium Summit further reaffirmedour Organization's essential role in this respect.That is why the United Nations neworganizational plan must allow it to respond to theneeds of today's world in the face of major upheavalsthat inspire intense introspection and consideration. Itsreform is also necessary to guarantee sound andreliable structures  with equitably distributed duties that will confirm its universal nature and ensure betterresults. Thus  it is particularly necessary to open theSecurity Council  the organ primarily responsible forthe maintenance of international peace and security  toother countries  as permanent and non-permanentmembers  in order to make it more representative andto ensure that its membership and working methodsreflect present-day realities.At a time when the world is evolving andundergoing globalization  the island States and small poor countries with limited resources are preoccupiedby the threat of marginalization looming over them. Inaddition to the various crises besetting our countries this state of affairs calls on us to address the urgentneed for support  assistance and  especially  awarenessof the dangers we are facing.First are the dangers arising from the immediateand long-term repercussions of the conflicts engulfingthe planet  claiming millions of victims  most of themchildren  women and the elderly.Secondly  there are the dangers posed to theworld by the ever-growing number of acts of terrorism.In this respect  it is important not only to be aware ofthe potential danger and to find effective means ofcountering it  but also to draw clear distinctionsbetween and not to confuse the behaviour of peoplewho act in contempt of law and human dignity withthat of those who act primarily out of religiousconsiderations.Thirdly  there are the dangers resulting fromflagrant violations of human rights. To combat thisproblem  the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros9gives its full support to the implementation of theInternational Criminal Court  which should put an endto these abuses. The Republic is preparing to ratify theStatute soon  and it hopes that the implementation ofthe Court's jurisdiction will be effective.Fourthly  there are the dangers resulting fromnatural catastrophes and from the overall degradationof the environment — the increasing vulnerability ofwhich is a source of serious concern for the world. Thesmall land-locked States — developing countries oflimited size — are particularly exposed to thesedangers. Given the increasing severity of this problem there is an increasingly urgent need to give priority toprotecting ecological systems.Fifthly  there are the dangers posed by seriousdiseases from which our populations are suffering —diseases such as AIDS  malaria and many others extreme poverty included.Sixthly  there are the dangers posed by themarginalization of the poor countries in the midst of aworld undergoing rapid change  a world in which it ishard for these countries to find their way.Seventhly and finally  there are the dangers towhich these same countries are exposed as a result ofthe external debt burden which absorbs a great deal oftheir attention and wreaks havoc on their nationalbudgets.This is to say that in this first stage of our entryinto the third millennium  there are many outstandingquestions regarding the future of humanity  and thesequestions require careful consideration. The overallimage presented by the world today is a sombre one.Also  as regards economic issues  it goes withoutsaying that the world is facing a situation that calls forserious examination and for joint action by thedevelopment partners to support national  subregionaland regional efforts.In the case of Africa  its overall economicproblems are a source of concern because they havebecome aggravated as a result of the increasinglyglobalizing world and the great strain that external debtis placing on our economies. Further  it makes sense tobe concerned about the future of a continent that hasbeen marginalized  in particular as regards global tradeand the information revolution  and afflicted by allkinds of plagues. It is essential that — in addition tothe efforts of the individual countries and in theframework of regional integration — the continentbenefit from the good offices of the internationalfinancial institutions in examining and addressingdifferent problem areas. In this regard  I am pleased tohere reiterate our appreciation for the efforts of theUnited Nations Development Programme to fight alongside our Governments  all forms ofunderdevelopment.As a small landlocked developing country and asan African country  the Islamic Federal Republic of theComoros is grappling with these kinds of problems. Itcannot be denied that  despite our current situation  ourGovernment is manifesting a firm will in searching forways and means of lifting the country out of the hole inwhich it finds itself and of creating favourableconditions for improving the life of our society. Theeffort under way to clean up the public finances and torevive and restructure the national economy attest tothe Comorian Government's determination to improvethe socio-economic situation that has prevailed formany years in the Islamic Federal Republic of theComoros.Our bilateral and multilateral partners haveconsistently supported these efforts; however  I need toreiterate the necessity of enhancing this assistance inorder to help us meet the challenge ofunderdevelopment and  above all  to help us avoidfalling victim to the perverse effects of globalization.We should also focus on the political situation ofthe world  which is today divided by various sorts ofwars and crises  which are seriously upsetting thepeace and security of peoples. Greater attention shouldbe given to these two crucial objectives — objectivesthat form the very basis of our Organization — andgreater thought should be given to how to vouchsafethem.This is why  on the subject of wars  I would liketo appeal to the goodwill of the parties involved in theproblem of the Democratic Republic of the Congo andin the entire Great Lakes region and to ask them tofocus their efforts on démarches that can producenegotiated solutions to the disputes of these parties.As regards Somalia  my country is greatlypleased by the current happy outcome of the situationthere and by the establishment of a transitionGovernment. The Islamic Federal Republic of theComoros hopes that the solid foundations have now10been established so that a lasting peace can be securedfor this fraternal country.In the same vein  the Comorian Governmentappreciates the efforts made in the holding of the CampDavid negotiations and salutes the work of theGovernment of the United States of America in thisregard. The Comorian Government  which hassupported and continues to support the Palestiniancause  hopes that these efforts will lead to a speedyresolution of the Middle East crisis — a resolution thatwill be in the interest of the peoples of that region whohave so long suffered from incessant instability. TheComorian Government also believes that any solutionto this crisis must include the establishment of anindependent Palestinian State  with Al-Quds al-Sharifas its capital.Further  we proclaim the necessity of completelylifting the embargo against Libya  and also ask that theembargo against Iraq be lifted. We appeal to the IraqiGovernment to cooperate more fully with the efforts tofree the Kuwaiti prisoners.Conflict zones remain in all the continents. TheCharter of the United Nations having been written forthe peoples  the United Nations must enhance itsefforts to prevent and resolve conflicts by peacefulmeans. In essence this means insisting on the urgentnecessity of supporting the cause of world peace because its absence handicaps all efforts to achieve realsustainable human development.In this regard  allow me to review the currentsituation in my country  the Islamic Federal Republicof the Comoros  and to explain how disturbed thepeople are about the threat to peace posed by theseparatist crisis that has been taking place on thesisterly island of Anjouan for close to three years. Withthe support of the international community — inparticular  the Organization of African Unity (OAU) the League of Arab States  the European Union  andInternational Organization of la Francophonie  and theOrganization of the Islamic Conference — the IslamicFederal Republic of the Comoros has explored everymeans of putting an end to this crisis. Theintransigence of the Anjouanese party after thedeclarations that were made during the inter-islandconferences that were held at Addis Ababa and atAntananarivo have led the OAU to take repressivemeasures against this party — measures that were to beapplied in a step-by-step fashion.The object of imposing the economic embargoagainst the sisterly island of Anjouan was to lead theAnjouanese to be reasonable. However  the situationhas hardly changed  and during this time the lowestlevels of Anjouanese society — along with all thosewho were supporting national unity — suffered terriblyfrom the effects of these measures. Recognizing on theone hand that  given the hardening of the movement'sposition  this situation was victimizing the populationof Anjouan  and particularly the poorest levels  andconvinced on the other hand that we Comorianstogether might be able to come up with a non-militarysolution  the current leadership of the country  underthe enlightened direction of Colonel Azali Assoumani President of the Islamic Federal Republic of theComoros  has insisted on undertaking directdiscussions with the Anjouanese party  in the hopes ofarriving at national reconciliation.The attempts at initiating such a dialogue openedthe way to the signing of an initial text on 1 July 1999at Fomboni on the island of Mwali. This text isconsidered to represent a significant step on the part ofthe current regime — a step towards harmonizing theopposing points of view.The negotiations were continued recently  leadingto the signing of a joint declaration  again in Fombonion 26 August. This provides another appropriateframework for preserving the unity and territorialintegrity of the Comoros  to which the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs of The Gambia referred on 20September. Because it allows dialogue to be initiatedwith our Anjouan brothers on the future Comorianentity  the declaration is of particular significance toComorians.The Fomboni declaration makes it clear that thenew Commorian entity is the sole subject ofinternational law within the Comorian frontiersrecognized by the international community. In order topush ahead with this process  a timetable wasestablished spelling out the various stages leading tothe submission to a referendum of the act which is togovern the future Comorian entity.I should like to make it clear that the Fombonijoint declaration takes account of  and respects  thespirit of the Antananarivo Agreement  which wasrejected by the Anjouan party.Today  more than ever  there is hope that it willbe possible to resolve this unfortunate problem bypeaceful means and to lay the groundwork for ademocratic State — a Comorian-style democracy  ademocracy stemming from the living forces of thenation of the Comoros  without any outsideinterference or influence. Would it have been just toreject this breakthrough  thus penalizing innocentwomen and children who have been so sorely tried bythe embargo  and then to envisage a military solution?If there had been resort to war in order to have peace why not avoid it  if possible  and so prevent casualties?The Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros hascommitted itself to dialogue to settle conflicts respecting the principles of our Organization.This wise principle was the basis of the Comorianauthorities' approach to their brothers in Anjouan. Itherefore appeal for understanding by all our partnerswho have always supported our efforts to find anegotiated lasting solution to this crisis. This is why while respecting the position of the Organization ofAfrican Unity (OAU) and that of all our other partners I reiterate  on behalf of the Government of theComoros  our determination to continue this struggle together with them  in order to preserve the unity andterritorial integrity of our country.The Government of the Comoros pays tribute tothe Secretary-General of the OAU  Mr. Salim AhmedSalim  for his personal efforts and his efforts throughthe OAU to resolve this crisis. We also express ourwholehearted gratitude to the League of Arab States  aswell as the Organization of the Islamic Conference  theInternational Organization of la Francophonie  thecountries of the region and other friendly countries including France  for their support.We earnestly hope that reason has finallyprevailed with our brothers in Anjouan and that theyhave really understood that breaking up the covenant ofunity and fraternity which links us and will always linkus — Comorians of the four islands of our archipelagoState — will not benefit anyone.We hope that we have all learned the lessons fromevents which have so seriously affected the country inhuman  material  psychological and other terms  andthat we understand that war will always be a badmaster and the worst choice. The process ofreconciliation is a demanding task requiring a greatdeal of resources. In this connection  we make apressing appeal to the international community tosupport the programme of reconstruction and nationalreconciliation which the Comorian Government hasdrawn up in conjunction with the World Bank.Faithful to the fundamental principles of theCharter  the Government of the Comoros continues toopt for the policy of dialogue and discussion to resolveall of the problems which confront us. With profoundrespect for these principles  we appeal to France  withwhich the Comoros has for long had close ties offriendship and cooperation  to contemplate a direct andconstructive dialogue which will make it possiblequickly to reach a negotiated solution with regard toreintegrating the Comorian island of Mayotte into itsnatural community.As stability  understanding  unity  harmonyamong our peoples  partnership and progress go handin hand  creating conditions to guarantee these valueswould be the best gift which the internationalcommunity can offer present and future generations onthe eve of the next millennium.(spoke in Arabic)“If people one day want lifeFate has no choice but to respond;Night has no choice but to yield to dawnAnd shackles cannot but be shattered.”"
"37",1614,"CPV",55,2000,"Let mecongratulate you  Sir  on your election to preside overthis fifth-fifth session of the General Assembly. I amconfident that your well-known experience in the fieldsof politics and diplomacy will ensure the success of ourwork.To your predecessor  Minister Theo-Ben Gurirab I would like to convey my delegation's appreciation ofhis dynamic and successful leadership of the fifty-fourth session.I would like also to congratulate the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for the remarkablecontribution made by his report  We the peoples which provides a solid foundation for our discussionsand for our common efforts to place this Organizationincreasingly in the service of our community ofnations.It is with satisfaction that I extend my warmestcongratulations to Tuvalu  a member of the communityof small island developing States  on its admission tothe United Nations.During the current session of the GeneralAssembly  important meetings will take place that willaddress issues vital to the international community.These issues include financing for development; racismand racial discrimination  xenophobia and relatedintolerance; and the development of the least developedcountries. These global meetings will certainlysignificantly enrich the set of consensus documentswhich we have successfully produced  particularlyduring the 1990s  and which are intended to provide uswith essential frameworks for the optimization of anupdated international cooperation.As is well known  this resource has not beenexploited to any great extent. North-South dialoguecontinues to be affected by reciprocal accusationsbetween worlds separated by gross disparities in thelevel of well-being.The world needs to be governed well and in aspirit of cooperation if we really wish to achievedevelopment  justice and peace in a climate of socialstability.And yet  on both the national and internationallevels  the privileged continue to deny others openparticipation and a fair share. Thus  the question ofgovernance arises at all levels. But at each level  thosein whose interest it is to maintain the status quo use theother level's deficiencies to justify their own inaction.It is a perverse logic to think that our partners' errorsauthorize us to err as well. This is a pattern ofbehaviour  and even an assertion  which has beenportrayed as reflecting a reality of life; how this is tobe overcome has yet to be clarified.It will be some time before we see even theimmediate results of that great dialogue between worldleaders  the Millennium Summit. However  we areconfident that results will not fail to emerge. At the24highest level  the meetings between internationalleaders served as a platform for the growing  insistentaffirmation that we have the know-how and the meansto solve the problems of our societies and of thecommon ground on which we live. What we lack is theappropriate implementation of decisions and thenecessary will to do so. By this  I mean the politicalwill to accomplish collectively what is necessary andsufficient so that we may achieve progress for allhumankind  a long-time goal of our ideology and ourdiscourse.Awareness of the need for this political will stemfrom the underlying belief that we make up  and arepart of  an interdependent international communitywhose essence links the destinies of all to the successor failure of a single endeavour.Meanwhile  in the blend of competition andcooperation that characterizes international relations the scale is still weighted in favour of a framework ofinequalities  asymmetries and egotism that increasinglyimpairs our capacities and our imagination in the effortto achieve general progress and well-being.Thus  a vital question is that of the extent towhich we will see  at the international level  andparticularly in the case of those who benefit most fromthe current situation  a growing belief in the existenceof true independence and in the urgency of the need forcoordination and cooperation commensurate with suchglobal interdependence.At the same time  we need to view globalizationnot as it is today  exclusive  fragmented and offeringopportunities only to a select few  but rather as aprocess that will increasingly reveal and establish theworld as a single body.The Millennium Summit once again posed thequestion of the role of the United Nations in thetwenty-first century. I believe that our universalOrganization has an essential role to play as a catalystfor the tangible realization of the concept ofinternational community inscribed within its Charterand as a basis for its political vision. In the world oftoday and tomorrow  where events are the result ofaction by a variety of decision makers  the promotionof such an endeavour by the United Nationspresupposes the involvement of all partiesconcerned  that is  Governments  of course  but alsoparliaments  the general public  organizations of civilsociety  the private sector  the media  and so forth. Allof them can and should be included in this undertaking the purpose of which is to reveal the convergencetranscending the apparent contradictions.As a free  universal association of States  theUnited Nations has as its mission  and should makeitself able  to gather the world's voices and to givethem room for dialogue in pursuit of higher platformsof understanding. In that regard  the fundamentalvalues embodied in the Millennium Declarationprovide a lasting source of inspiration.In the short term  however  we need a consistentset of measures in order to create an enablingenvironment for development in which povertyeradication can be sustainably achieved. The prioritiesto be considered in developing such measures will varyto some extent. In the areas of greatest poverty  such asthe African continent  it is certainly essential to reversethe decline in public health and to devote the necessaryresources to improving the quality and expanding thescope of public education. In today's world  there canbe no development unless the people have reached aminimum level of health and education  and unless thecountry in question has reached a reasonable level ofinfrastructure  without which it cannot viably acceptthe economic investment that it needs.Furthermore  countless developing countriescontinue to hope for lasting solutions to the coreproblem of an unsustainable debt burden  solutions toreplace the long string of half-measures  always toolittle and too late  with which this issue has beenaddressed in the past.Even with adequate economic policies  aresponsible administration and a productive society States' capacity to make real  continued progress willbe significantly limited if they face restricted access tointernational markets and if tariff and non-tariffbarriers are imposed on them. Particularly in the caseof the least developed countries  these constraints maymake it impossible for them to integrate into the globaleconomy.Before closing  I wish to express my deepestconcern at the form and intensity of the conflicts thatcontinue to affect the daily lives of various countriesand their peoples  with disastrous consequences at theinternal and regional levels. In that regard  it is withthe greatest apprehension that we view the currentsituation in Sierra Leone  a country of our subregion;and we hope that the recently developed measures25involving the coordination of efforts by the UnitedNations and the Economic Community of West AfricanStates (ECOWAS) will help restore to the people ofSierra Leone the peace and stability to which they areentitled.Cape Verde continues to follow closely thesituation in Angola  a country with which we share along history. Owing to the refusal of UNITA to respectthe relevant Security Council resolutions and to complywith the provisions of the Lusaka Protocol  thehumanitarian drama that affects the Angolan peopleand  in particular  the massive numbers of refugees anddisplaced persons  has reached intolerable levels. Theinternational community should therefore give thehighest priority to providing humanitarian assistance toAngola.In East Timor  the laudable efforts of the UnitedNations augur well for the exercise of directsovereignty and self-determination in the near future.However  there are signs of continued efforts to disruptthis process. The recent murder of international civilservants serving as peacekeepers merits the deepestcondemnation of the international community andadequate measures by the Security Council.The role of the United Nations  increasinglyfocused on the value and dignity of human beings requires each of us -- large and small  rich and poor --to wager confidently on the solidarity of our commonefforts as the touchstone in our collective search forsolutions to the problems affecting our planet."
"38",1660,"CRI",55,2000,"Allow me at the outset to congratulateMr. Harri Holkeri on his well-deserved election topreside over the work of the General Assembly  whichattests both to his outstanding personal qualities and tothe admiration that the international community has forhis country  Finland. Allow me also to express ourgratitude to the outgoing President  Mr. Theo-BenGurirab  Minister of Foreign Affairs of Namibia  forhis excellent work.Just a week ago  in this same Hall  our heads ofState or Government held the Millennium Summit.That historic event served as the framework for an in-depth consideration of the role of the United Nations inthe next century and for the reiteration  at the highestpolitical level  of the universal support for thisOrganization.It is now up to us to elaborate on our leaders'observations and determine what is necessary to build amore prosperous future  a more just society and anincreasingly human civilization.At the outset of the new millennium  scientificand technological achievements in all fields areallowing us to glimpse an ever-brighter future.However  a double threat exists to progress towardsthat goal. On one hand  it is endangered by unevengrowth  which threatens to deepen the divide betweenthe wealthiest and the poorest. More effective measuresmust be adopted to create a more just and equitablesociety and international community.On the other hand  the future is also threatened bythe temptation of absolute materialism  which can beunderstood as the danger of reducing development tothe mere satisfaction of material needs. The risk oftransforming the human being into a commodity andthe temptation to seek wealth instead of happinessrepresent a continuing threat. We must establish a newsociety whose goal should be the promotion of thewell-being of all  as reflected in their full physical intellectual and spiritual development. We must createa society centred on ideas  creativity and abilities  andnot on power or wealth.The United Nations can and should play a centralrole in the construction of this new society. However we must note  honestly and courageously  that so farthe United Nations and the international community asa whole have been held back by innumerableconstraints and restrictions and known many failures.More than 50 years ago  at the founding of thisOrganization  we committed ourselves to eradicatingthe scourge of war  and we undertook to promote socialprogress and better living conditions for all.Unfortunately  though  to date  the United Nationshas been unable to respond fully to these pleas. Wereact to political and military crises with hollowstatements to the press. We condemn gross violationsof human rights with procedural resolutions  which arethen forgotten on our shelves. We create organs committees and tribunals without any real capacity foraction and lacking the necessary resources to fulfiltheir mandates. We convene summits  conferences andmeetings that limit themselves to repeating emptydeclarations and passing commitments. We sendmilitary observers who are unable to maintain peacebecause we do not provide them with the necessaryresources or political support. Over and over again weadopt inadequate measures to resolve crises  hopingthat they will perform miracles. We send internationalexperts with development programmes that respondneither to the needs nor the desires of their recipients.This Organization has imposed sanctions that affectinnocent civilians while at the same time inadvertentlystrengthening criminal regimes.We recognize  of course  that many of the UnitedNations activities have been successful andpraiseworthy. We cannot overlook the work of the22Office of the United Nations High Commissioner forRefugees or of the United Nations Children's Fund(UNICEF) in favour of victims of war and of children nor can we forget the heroic sacrifice of many BlueHelmets and humanitarian personnel. We must alwayskeep in mind the valuable mediation efforts and goodoffices provided to defuse armed conflicts. We mustlearn from those peacekeeping operations that havebeen crowned with success in spite of all of thedifficulties. We must recall and respect the gradualcodification of human rights and of the need to providethe highest possible standards of living.But the world expects greater leadership from theUnited Nations. The world's peoples are calling forfirm and decisive action on the part of the internationalcommunity. Humanity is looking to us to fulfil the loftygoals that we set for ourselves when we founded thisOrganization.For these reasons  new bases must be establishedfor the actions of the United Nations. The Organizationmust be provided with a renewed political andphilosophical paradigm that will enable it to garner thepolitical and material support it needs from all States inorder effectively to achieve its goals.Today the United Nations requires all of oursupport. Each one of us is obliged  individually andcollectively  to provide the best living conditionspossible to all our fellow citizens.The primary objective of the United Nations inthe twenty-first century must be to promote full respectfor human rights. More than 50 years after the adoptionof the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  thecontinuing violation of those rights  throughinexcusable killings for political  religious or ethnicmotives and through the displacement of millions ofrefugees and internally displaced persons  is a matterfor profound concern. We are distressed also by thefact that thousands perish daily of starvation or easilycurable diseases. We are concerned at the fact thatthousands of persons are still persecuted orincarcerated because of their political opinions and thatfor those reasons hundreds are subject to the mostdegrading torture or are forced to live in extremepoverty.The persistence of war is the cause of inexcusableatrocities and recurrent humanitarian crisis. The truevictims of war are not the fallen soldiers but thedisplaced or refugee children and elderly  the womenwho are raped  the young people who are murdered  themothers who lose their incomes  the innocent workerswhose workplaces are destroyed  the students whoseschools are bombed  the sick who cannot go to hospitalbecause there are no bridges and no medicines. In thecontemporary world  every armed conflict  every civilwar  every massive violation of human rights  everyhumanitarian emergency  caused either by man or bynature  calls for coordinated international actionthrough this Organization.In that context  all States must politically andfinancially support United Nations activities toeradicate the scourge of war. The Organization mustregain leadership in maintaining international peaceand security. It is imperative that all States strictlyadhere to the prohibition of the use of force.For those reasons  one of our tasks is to revitalizethe Security Council in order to increase its legitimacyand its capacity for action. That organ should nevertransfer  abandon or renounce its primary responsibilityfor the maintenance of international peace and security.To the contrary  it is essential to ensure that it canperform its functions satisfactorily by providing it withthe necessary resources and political support.The Security Council cannot renounce its rolesimply because it is unable to find a quick orinexpensive solution to a crisis. We cannot accept theestablishment of peacekeeping operations that lackpersonnel and resources to the point of beingirrelevant. Nor can we accept the dispatch of personnelwho lack training or motivation and who become easyvictims of conflicts. By no means can we consent to theimposition of sanctions regimes that affect innocentpopulations. When establishing a peacekeepingmission  the Security Council must define realisticgoals  so that mandates and resources will becommensurate with the actual requirements of thecrisis it is to face.Armed conflicts and political crises aremultifaceted phenomena. Every emergency situationpresents a series of political  military and economicproblems. True peace can be attained only when allindividuals enjoy proper living conditions  when theypossess a sufficiently high level of economicdevelopment to meet their basic needs  when theirfundamental human rights are respected and when theirinterests and individual rights are guaranteed bydemocratic means.23True peace requires a culture and a climate thatfoster mutual respect and that categorically rejectviolence. In order to achieve peace  we must create aculture of peace. With a view to creating such a cultureof peace  the United Nations must promote not onlypeace but also social justice  democracy anddevelopment. This should actively involve the SecurityCouncil  the General Assembly  the Economic andSocial Council  the Office of the United Nations HighCommissioner for Human Rights and the UnitedNations Development Programme. We advocate inparticular the strengthening of the role of the Economicand Social Council so that it can effectively monitorand coordinate the implementation of the economic social  cultural and environmental activities of theUnited Nations and of all its organs.In this regard  international cooperation plays acentral role in supporting local initiatives fordevelopment  democratization and the promotion ofhuman rights. Unfortunately  we are witnessing adecrease in international assistance in these fieldswhile the demand continues to grow. To address thissituation  each nation has to take into its own hands thetask of creating the conditions necessary to attainpeace  development and justice.We believe that only if human rights are fullyrespected will it be possible to create and sustain theconditions necessary for the full development of allmen and women. The promotion of democracy andsocial and economic development are alsoindispensable instruments to generate the material social and spiritual conditions required for thiscomprehensive development.Our experience has taught us that only democracycan provide the necessary framework for the fullrespect of human rights. Only democracy which grantsall citizens equal rights and opportunities to participatein the political process can secure true peace. Only ademocratic system which bestows on all people equalopportunities to enjoy the benefits of economicdevelopment and personal accomplishment will makepossible sustainable and just development. For thatreason  we celebrate the democratic consolidation that thanks to recent elections after a long period under thesame ruling party  is being enjoyed by Mexico and bythe Republic of China in Taiwan — which deserves anappropriate place in international forums.Additionally  our own national evolution hastaught us that the first step in such a policy is theelimination or reduction of military budgets. CostaRica abolished its army more than 50 years ago and hassince been free from armed conflict with its neighboursand from military oppression of its population.Reduction of military expenditure is especiallyvaluable for developing States whose resources arelimited and cannot be mismanaged. In that context armies are a heavy burden on national budgets and aconstant source of tension and repression. Would it notbe better to devote to health the $191 billion thatdeveloping countries waste on their armed forces?Would it not be preferable to allocate to education the$22 billion dollars that are spent in arms transfers tothe third world? Our historical experience has made usa witness to and an example of the multifaceted andpositive relationship between disarmament anddevelopment.The second step on the path to peace anddevelopment is to devote as many resources as possibleto education and health. Only an educated people canlive in freedom; only a healthy people can work fordevelopment; only a cultured people can be a part ofthe contemporary globalized world. For those reasons we must invest intensively and systematically in ourhuman resources while also striving for economicdevelopment  social justice and the institutionalizationof democracy.The third step towards the future is to securerespect for human rights and democracy to enablepeoples to choose freely their own destinies and tofacilitate the coordination of all of society's actors. Inmy country  we have deeply committed ourselves tothose principles  both in the national sphere throughconstitutional provisions  and in the international arenathrough various international conventions and treaties.In this regard  the issue of migrations is of thegreatest importance to my country. Costa Rica hasgiven emphasis to the need to relocate the nationals ofeach country peacefully and in an orderly fashion tosatisfy their specific immigration and emigrationneeds; to the movements of qualified human resourcesto promote economic  social and cultural progress inthe receiving countries; and to the orderly reintegrationand resettlement of persons who  for one reason oranother  have been obliged to abandon their country orplace of origin or who have been forced to leave anation that did not allow them to exercise their right24not to emigrate. Therefore  we appreciate the key roleplayed by the International Organization for Migration(IOM)  and we advocate in particular that States thathave not yet done so make the necessary amendmentsto their domestic legislation in order to guarantee thisright to all human beings.There are three main elements in the process ofdevelopment that we believe require greater attention.First  we should reconstruct society and its values especially through a renewed effort to acknowledgeand protect the value of the family in its role associety's basic cell. Unfortunately  the family is thefirst victim of political and economic crisis  thusforcing its dissolution by the scattering of its members.For this reason  we must emphasize that families arethe schools where the basic values of coexistence andrespect for the dignity of all other persons are taught and that  without them  it is impossible to create astable society.Secondly  it is necessary to make greater effortsto pursue sustainable development in all areas ofhuman endeavour. In this sense  we are pleased toreport that Costa Rica has achieved significantadvances in the environmental field regarding thepreservation of its rich biodiversity and the promotionof development in harmony with nature. We are one ofthe first nations to have undertaken carbon fixation andthe sale of oxygen as an additional source of incomefor development  on the basis of the sustainable use ofour forests and recognition of the economic value ofthe environmental services that they provide to allhumanity. In the same vein  we have incorporated theprovisions of the Kyoto Protocol into our domesticlegal system. Nevertheless  there is still a long way togo towards fully sustainable development.Similarly  Costa Rica is honoured to be theheadquarters of the Earth Council and the Universityfor Peace  which are working jointly to promote aconcept of development in greater harmony with theenvironment. We are confident that the University forPeace  in particular  can play a constructive role both inthe promotion of sustainable development as in thecreation of a culture of peace. Thanks to the work of itsnew Council and in particular Mr. Maurice Strong  whopresides over it  that institution can count on myGovernment's unwavering support.We take this opportunity to reiterate our pledge tooffer our country as the headquarters of the Secretariatof the Intergovernmental Forum on Forests. We areconfident that this new organ will finally secure theinternational community's coordinated andcomprehensive action with respect to forests.Thirdly  it is necessary to ensure that economicdevelopment is sustainable. To achieve this goal  it isnecessary to modify the international economic order with a view to making it more just and balanced  sothat it can grant to the smaller developing countriesgreater access to the benefits of the globalizationprocess and the opportunities for development that itcreates. Open commercial mechanisms enablingcommerce and investment to be engines for economicgrowth should be established. In a parallel  we shouldtarget our developmental policies towards moreefficient use of the digital revolution  which providesus with many opportunities to compete in the globalmarket and to increase our production. In short  wemust democratize globalization.We believe that knowledge and opportunities toaccess information and the new technologies areessential today to generate well-being. In today'sworld  marked by new technological frontiers  ourendeavours should also be directed towards narrowingthe digital divide. We should seek to provide more justand equitable access to the opportunities open to us inorder to transform economic and social activities. Inaccordance with this thesis  Costa Rica recentlyinitiated the programme “Communications withoutfrontiers”  becoming the first nation to provide free e-mail to all its population.Democracy  sustainable development and humanrights constitute the three fundamental elements uponwhich the United Nations action must be based  as wellas that of each of our nations. None is an end in itself;rather they are only a means to secure better livingconditions for all people. The true goal of our actioncentres on the human being; it is to guarantee greaterhappiness for all persons  the greatest respect for theirdignity and the necessary conditions for their fullphysical  intellectual and spiritual development."
"39",1729,"CUB",55,2000,"We areliving at a decisive moment in the history ofhumankind. More than half a century after the creationof the United Nations  on the threshold of a newmillennium that was supposed to herald an era of peaceamong men  solidarity among nations and greater well-being for the poorest people  we are confronted insteadby the most serious and complex economic  social political and environmental crisis in the history of thehuman race.The expectations of peace  stability andcooperation that the end of the cold war triggeredthroughout the world are far from becoming a reality.The emergence of a unipolar world in which a singlesuper-Power is capable of militarily controlling theinternational scene  far from meaning greater securityfor our peoples  has ushered in a new stage in whichthe hegemonism of that sole super-Power prevails —direct or covert interventionism under the guise ofmultilateral actions  insecurity for the small countries selfishness as a behavioural pattern in internationalrelations and the attempt to disregard the principles ofequality among States  national sovereignty  self-determination  non-intervention  the non-threat or theuse of force and the settlement of disputes throughpeaceful means — principles that have constituted thecornerstone of the United Nations.We are also living in a world characterized by theexploitation and the horrendous destitution of over l.3billion human beings  who  while suffering on a dailybasis and without giving up the hope of a better life fortheir children  wonder if we will still have sufficientreasons to reaffirm faith in the fundamental rights ofman and in the dignity and value of the human person as proclaimed more than five decades ago by thefounders of the United Nations.The attempts at imposing by force and underpressure the so-called right of humanitarianintervention are at present the greatest threat tointernational peace and security. We all know that thesmall group of developed countries — led by theUnited States and its allies with powerful forces — thatattempt to impose this perilous concept in thediscussions and decisions of our Organization  do nothave to fear the consequences of recognizing such aright in international relations. They are not  as we are the Euro-Atlantic rim  defined by the North AtlanticTreaty Organization (NATO) as the probable scene fortheir acts of aggression  and the new strategic doctrineof this alliance is not aimed at them  but at us  the poorcountries.Actions geared at fragmenting countries andnations  at recolonizing territories and re-establishingzones of influence must cease. The recent precedent ofunleashing deadly wars against defencelesspopulations  without even consulting the SecurityCouncil  is not only a flagrant violation of the Charter but it is also once again dragging the world intosituations like those that once took over 40 millionlives in a single war.How many other wars against small  poorcountries must be waged before we understand theneed to respect the Charter and engage in a deepdemocratization process in international relations?Is it possible that those who now buttress withthreatening language their attempts at interfering in thedomestic affairs of other countries have fallen for theidea that the serious problems of underdevelopment the after-effects of colonialism  hunger  disease and theconsequences of the constant pillaging of the thirdworld countries — the real cause of current conflicts —can be resolved through use of smart bombs?19Is it not really paradoxical that WesternPowers — while developing new  ever moresophisticated killing devices — intend to prevent poorcountries from using conventional light weaponry thatis essential to nations that  like Cuba  live under thepermanent threat of military aggression? Enough ofthis hypocrisy and Pharisaic behaviour. The world willbe really safer if total  complete disarmament takesplace  including  especially  nuclear disarmament.There has to come a day when light weaponry will beeliminated  when other types of deadlier and moredangerous conventional arms — the much moredangerous and deadlier arms owned by a handful ofdeveloped countries — must also be disposed of — thesooner the better. Yes  mines must be eliminated  butthe threats of aggression against poor countries must beeliminated long before that.Will our planet  by any chance  be safer if theUnited States finally deploys its hallucinating  costlyanti-missile defence system  through which thatcountry's rulers deceive their own people by promisingthem protection against missiles when nobody knowsreally from where they could be launched?Why does not the United Nations  instead oftamely following the hazardous death game with theWestern Powers  focus its attention on the so-muchtrumpeted yet unfulfilled purpose of setting aside aportion of the nearly US$ 800 billion  currently used onmilitary expenses  to promote development and try tosave the victims of the silent war that  year after year through disease and starvation  kills more than 11million third-world children under 5 years of age?In any case  peace will not be possible if there isno development for the over one hundred third-worldcountries that are presently observing  as stone guests the irresponsible squandering of the wealthy  selfishconsumer societies that insatiably eat up our children'sfuture. Setting out to halve in 15 years the number ofpoor people that we now have is undoubtedly aremarkable endeavour  but how will the other halfjudge our goal if they are doomed to live as indigentsall their lives?What has become of the right to development thatwas once so solemnly proclaimed by this very GeneralAssembly? Don't you think  dear colleagues  that thetime has come for us to calmly and firmly set out torescue the issue of the right to development as a UnitedNations priority? Isn't it precisely now — when nobodyargues anymore about the resounding failure of theneo-liberal policies that the International MonetaryFund and the World Bank imposed on third-worldcountries with a fundamentalist stubbornness to thebenefit of transnational companies — that our peoples united in a great alliance for the most basic rights  mustseize the opportunity to demand that a moreoutstanding  decisive role in these affairs be played bythe United Nations Economic and Social Council andthis General Assembly?Why should we continue to allow internationalcooperation to virtually disappear  just now when it ismost needed? Are we entitled to continue discussing year after year  without any concrete outcome  the rightto development  which our people are demanding while we watch  scattered and disoriented  as theInternational Monetary Fund and the World Bankcontinue to strip the Organization of the prerogativesbestowed upon it by the Charter? Those who haveimposed such devastating decisions as those leading tothe unbridled privatization of the national resources ofthird world countries and the indiscriminateliberalization of the capital account — therebyfacilitating the outflow of the scarce foreign currenciesfrom poor countries that  because of expediency orfear  have not been able to fight for the rights of theirpeoples — will be held to account by their children andby history.The Millennium Summit  which ended withpositive results  demonstrated once again that thedevastating effects of imposing a neo-liberal model in aglobalized world are hitting third world countriesparticularly hard. The socio-economic situation of suchcountries — especially those in Africa — is virtuallyuntenable. Likewise  it made it clear that unilateralismand duress have no place in a world in which solidarityand cooperation are the only possible means to achievesalvation for all.In the wake of the Summit  no doubts remain:now is the time to act  to adopt concrete measures inorder to fight the poverty and underdevelopmentcurrently afflicting the majority of the people of theworld. Cuba  a poor country that nonetheless has alarge store of human capital  has already started to takeaction. Deeds  not words  are what we need today.Two years ago  we put in place a comprehensivehealth-care plan under which almost 2 000 Cubanhealth workers are rendering services  free of charge  in2016 countries of Central America  the Caribbean andsub-Saharan Africa. Now  given the urgent appeal ofthe African countries  we would like to reiterate theoffer that President Fidel Castro made to the UnitedNations  the World Health Organization and thedeveloped countries during the Millennium Summit tocooperate with Africa in the fight against AIDS andother terrible diseases currently threatening to wipe outan entire continent. Cuba is ready to supply up to 3 000additional Cuban doctors and paramedics for such anundertaking in sub-Saharan Africa. They would alsocontribute to the training of African health workers inthe field. But it is essential for the industrializedcountries to do their share and to supply the necessarymedicines and materials for the programme. Africa iswaiting for us. Cuba stands ready. It is now up to thedeveloped countries.Democracy within countries is a goal that is beingsought. That is certainly commendable if the diversityof cultures  identities  historical experiences  nationalrealities and political models  and the right of eachpeople to adopt  with complete independence  thesystem that it deems most appropriate  are properlyrespected. But is there truly any democracy ininternational relations at present? Unfortunately thereis not.In order to attain it  let us put an end tohegemonism  foster development  replace selfishnesswith cooperation and  finally  respect the purposes andprinciples of the San Francisco Charter. We must put anend  right now  to the arrogance of the few if we do notwant the hopes for a world of justice and peace for allto crumble.In order to attain it  let us ensure that the UnitedNations truly contributes to building solidarity amongnations and not to the domination of a few over theoverwhelming majority. Let us face up to the attemptof some to put pressure on the United Nations throughthe non-payment of agreed contributions. Let us rejectthe use of the United Nations to impose a new colonialorder. Let us demand that the Security Council act asthe representative of all  not as the servant of one. Letus prevent it from arrogating to itself powers that itdoes not have  thereby violating the United NationsCharter and operating without due transparency whileit decides upon matters of life or death.Democratizing the United Nations and itsSecurity Council requires  as indispensable measures the abolition of the vexing and anachronistic vetoprivilege; an increase in the number of Councilmembers in proportion to the fourfold increase in thenumber of States Members of the Organization; theapplication of the principle of equitable geographicalrepresentation to the composition of that body  as withall others; and the fulfilment of its obligation  asenshrined in the Charter but ignored in practice  ofreporting to the General Assembly.Let us be realistic. Security Council reform is — Iwill not mince words — as far away today as it everwas. We should recognize that after seven years offruitless efforts we have managed to agree only that itis necessary to increase the number of members of theCouncil. At this point  therefore  we believe that weshould at least work to effect a proportional increase inthe total number of Council members  both permanentand non-permanent  ensuring adequate representationfor third world countries  as strongly reiterated by theMillennium Summit. How could the Security Councilbe expanded without the inclusion of a reasonablenumber of permanent members from the third world?Forty years ago  on behalf of Cuba  the leader ofa triumphant revolution proclaimed from this veryrostrum the dreams of hope and social justice for whichthe Cuban people had struggled for almost a century.Most of the States now represented in this Assemblywere colonies at that time. There was no talk then — asthere is today — about saving Africa  while it wasbeing ruthlessly pillaged. The time had not yet arrivedwhen hundreds of thousands of Cubans would go toAfrican lands to struggle for the real rights of itspeople  against apartheid  disease and illiteracy.That was the moment when the United StatesGovernment set out to overthrow the Cuban revolution which  committed to social justice and trueindependence for its people  threatened  through itsethics  its morality and its example  the seculardomination that the United States had exercised overthe entire western hemisphere. That was the momentwhen the economic  trade and financial blockade wasimplemented against Cuba — a blockade that  in thecourse of a harsh 40-year-old economic war  hasengendered such shameful pieces of legislation as theTorricelli and Helms-Burton Acts. It has to do with theblockade that this very General Assembly has rejectedfor eight consecutive years and which is still in forcedespite worldwide rejection and the obviousdisapproval of the people of the United States.21In these four decades  our people have resistedacts ranging from political pressures and attempts atdiplomatic isolation to the most insidious lyingcampaigns  from subversion and terrorism toassassination attempts on its main leaders  frombiological warfare to the most ruthless blockade andeconomic war and from the promotion of armed bandsto military invasion and the threat of nuclearextermination. Today  on behalf of that same generousand courageous people  we can once again say to ourthird world brothers and to all those who anywhere inthe world defend our right to life and development thatrevolutionary socialist Cuba will never cease tostruggle for everyone's dreams."
"40",1775,"CYP",55,2000,"I would like to extendmy warmest congratulations to Mr. Holkeri on his well-deserved election as President of the General Assemblyat its fifty-fifth session. I am certain that hisconsiderable experience and diplomatic skills willguide the work of this session to a successfulconclusion.I would also like to take this opportunity toexpress my appreciation to his predecessor  Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  the Minister for Foreign Affairs ofNamibia  for the exceptional manner in which hepresided over the fifty-fourth session of the GeneralAssembly.Earlier this month  in this very Hall  anunprecedented gathering of heads of State tookplace — an event that  through the final Declaration has given new impetus to enhanced internationalcooperation to tackle an array of internationalproblems. The Millennium Assembly has expressed thestrong will of the peoples of this planet for commonaction so that humanity can proceed with theconstruction of a better world.Cyprus reaffirms its commitment to the UnitedNations  which we have always considered andcontinue to consider to be the foundation on which theinternational community can pursue the lofty goals ofpeace  security  justice  respect for human rights  andsocial and economic development on a global level. Wethus fully support the continuing efforts towards thereform of the Organization  including its principalorgans  so that it will be able to successfully face themany international challenges. For  just as all livingorganisms are constantly evolving in order to adapt andsurvive in an ever-changing environment  so does theUnited Nations need always to have the necessarystructures and means that will make it as effective aspossible.Cyprus welcomes the efforts of the UnitedNations in the area of disarmament and we areparticularly pleased at the successful conclusion earlierthis year of the review process of the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We would liketo congratulate the Russian Federation for its recentratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-BanTreaty and the START II Treaty. We consider theexpansion of the regime of nuclear-free zones including one in our region of the Mediterranean  to bean important component in our goal towards a nuclear-free world.The illicit trafficking of small arms is an issue ofgrave concern. We are fully supportive of internationalefforts in this direction and consider more effectiveaction to eliminate this phenomenon to be animperative need of our increasingly interdependentworld.In countless reports of the United Nations and itsspecialized agencies  the concern is evident regardingthe continuing degradation of the environment and theimperative need for global policies in the pursuit ofsustainable development. The effects of overpopulationand unregulated development will undoubtedly createnew pressures on the environment in this new century.Small island States facing their vulnerability to globalwarming  rising water level and the increasing scarcityof water resources are particularly concerned in thisarea. We are particularly pleased with the organizationin Cyprus next January of the workshop on energy forsustainable development  a capacity-developmentinitiative of the Alliance of Small Island States. Weexpect this workshop to make a substantive input to theninth session of the Commission on SustainableDevelopment.The effects of globalization were extensivelydiscussed by world leaders at the Millennium Summit.I will therefore limit myself in this statement to onlyone aspect of the whole question of the impact ofglobalization  which we consider a major problem thatwe all have an obligation to address. The eradication ofpoverty is undeniably one of the major challenges thatthe international community faces. It is imperative thatnew and imaginative policies to attack the problem bedeveloped  with the Member States of the UnitedNations and the major international financial24institutions working in close cooperation on this issue.Debt relief should be a central part of these efforts.The progress achieved since the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights  which was adopted morethan half a century ago  has been considerable. Theinternational regime of human rights instruments hasbeen continually expanding and constitutes thecriterion against which the international communityand national Governments are judged as to theirdedication and actions in the protection of humanrights. The United Nations has been at the forefront ofthese new winds of hope for humankind. The subject ofhuman rights today encompasses a variety of topics.We are very pleased at the successful conclusion of thespecial session of the General Assembly on women andthe follow-up conference on social development  whichwere held earlier this year in New York and Genevarespectively. We look forward to continuing on thispath at the upcoming world conference on racism xenophobia and related intolerance and at the specialsession of the General Assembly on children.One of the areas of particular concern to Cyprusis the increasing number of refugees and internallydisplaced persons throughout the world. Cyprus hasitself experienced the tragic consequences of massdisplacement and ethnic cleansing. The vast majorityof displaced people — more than 22 million people according to the Office of the United Nations HighCommissioner for Refugees — are women andchildren  who are particularly vulnerable to grossviolations of their human rights. We strongly believethat the international community has an obligation tomore forcefully secure the right of return of theserefugees to their places of residence.Cyprus welcomes the withdrawal of Israeli forcesfrom Lebanon in accordance with resolution 425(1978)of the Security Council. We would like toconsider this as a harbinger of the achievement of acomprehensive solution to the Middle East question.Despite the temporary setback in the Israeli-Palestinianfinal-status negotiations  we believe that the processcan and should move forward  so that peace  stabilityand prosperity will finally be established in this long-tormented region. Cyprus supports the implementationof the relevant resolutions of the Security Council inthis respect.Cyprus fully supports Security Council resolution1244 (1999) and calls for the full respect of the humanrights of all the inhabitants of Kosovo  irrespective oftheir origin  as well as for the full respect for thesovereignty  the territorial integrity and the democraticprocess of all States in the region. We also commendthe European Union for its considerable initiatives andsupport for the economic and political stabilization ofSouth-Eastern Europe.We have been encouraged by the positive climatethat has existed since the June meeting between theNorth and South Korean leaders. We express oursupport for further measures to achieve reconciliation stability and cooperation in the Korean peninsula. Wehave been heartened by the prospect of reunificationand of the termination of the division in this sensitiveregion.Cyprus fully supports the process for theestablishment of an international criminal court andwas one of the original signatories of the Rome Statute.We look forward to further progress in the work of thePreparatory Commission for the International CriminalCourt and welcome the results of its last sessionregarding the consensus reached on the rules ofprocedure and evidence and the elements of crime. Oursupport stems from our firm belief that if we are to livein a world where justice and international law prevail then impunity for abhorrent crimes against humanityshould end immediately. Cyprus  itself a victim of suchcrimes  knows very well the bitter truth of impunity.For the last 26 years the General Assembly hasincluded in its agenda the question of Cyprus.Decisions by this Assembly  in particular resolution3212 (XXIX)  as well as successive Security Councilresolutions  call for the restoration of the territorialintegrity  unity and independence of the Republic ofCyprus and the withdrawal of the Turkish troops andsettlers from an independent country  Member of theUnited Nations  which was invaded in 1974 and whoseterritory  37 per cent of it  is controlled by the Turkishoccupation army.An attempt has been made from this rostrum togive a different version from and interpretation of theone upheld and understood by this General Assemblyand by the Security Council. When one talks about theevents of 1963  one should not forget the armedinsurgency against the legal Government of theRepublic and the deliberate decision of the TurkishCypriot leadership to withdraw its representatives fromParliament and the organs of the Government  in order25to pave the way for the present de facto division of theisland.Furthermore  it is well known and confirmed bythe three reports of the European Commission ofHuman Rights  following appeals by the Republic ofCyprus against Turkey  that ethnic cleansing occurredin Cyprus in 1974 with the violent uprooting of one-third of the Cypriot population from their homes andtheir expulsion from the areas that are now underTurkish occupation. This is a classic example of acreation of faits accomplis through the use of force.Enough has already been said about history  andmany recriminations were levelled by one side againstthe other. We have said time and again to our TurkishCypriot compatriots  and we repeat to the Governmentof Turkey  that it is high time we looked to the future.A future bright and prosperous for all Cypriots permeated by a spirit of reconciliation  in a peaceful demilitarized and reunited Cyprus  member of theEuropean Union  in which all Cypriots would live inconditions of peace  prosperity and the full protectionof their human rights and fundamental freedoms.We want a future without occupation armies without barbed wires of division and without humansuffering. Indeed  how can one seriously claim that themassive Turkish military force which invaded and hascontinued to occupy 37 per cent of Cypriot territory forthe last 26 years is a force of pacification andliberation? Had these forces been pacification orliberation troops  as Turkey tries to portray them would the Security Council  which represents thecollective wisdom of the international community  callrepeatedly for their withdrawal? Moreover  how cananyone  speaking before this body  describe UnitedNations resolutions and their call to uphold and adhereto international law as romantic descriptions andunrealistic assessments?One further point that I would like to make is thereference to the so-called realities in Cyprus. We havebeen asked to accept  if we want to find a solution these so-called realities on the ground. These realitiesare  of course  the result of the Turkish invasion and itsdire consequences on the people of Cyprus. One suchstark reality reflecting the ultimate aims of Turkey inCyprus is the importation of 98 000 Turkish mainlandsettlers into the occupied areas in an effort to changethe demographic structure of the island. Another realityis the mass emigration of our fellow Turkish Cypriotsfrom the occupied areas and the constant threat posedby the 36 000 Turkish occupation troops stationed onthe island. This threat is real and manifests itself fromtime to time through provocative actions on the ground.Such is the case of the Turkish advance in Strovilia following the adoption last June of a resolution by theSecurity Council renewing the mandate of the UnitedNations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP).This illegal action has been described by the UnitedNations Secretary-General as a clear violation of thestatus quo. The inability of the Organization to returnthe situation to the status quo ante tarnishes its imageand credibility. Could one imagine the consequencesfor international relations  when nations are forced toaccept solutions based on faits accomplis created andsustained through the use of military force andunilateral acts? Can we allow such a precedent to pavethe way for the disintegration of so many countriesaround the globe? What  indeed  would be theconsequences for small States in this kind of so-calledinternational order  where international law isselectively applied and the will of the mighty reignssupreme?The one and only reality is the imperative needfor peace and reconciliation in Cyprus through amutually acceptable solution within the parameters ofUnited Nations resolutions. We are currently engagedin the fourth round of proximity talks. We have cometo these talks with flexibility and with the political willto reach a solution as prescribed by this Organization.We appeal to the Turkish side to seize the moment andcapitalize on the current favourable environment inorder to reach a comprehensive settlement. Such asettlement will be based on Security Councilresolutions  which call for a bi-zonal  bi-communalFederal Republic of Cyprus  with a single sovereignty citizenship and international personality  comprisingtwo politically equal communities  as described inSecurity Council resolution 750 (1992). The Turkishside must realize that a solution must be mutuallyacceptable and based on international law  and it mustnot insist on imposing its will and on a solution basedon faits accomplis.Our common aim should be a solution that wouldbe honourable and something to be cherished by futuregenerations of all Cypriots  Greek and Turkish alike  towhom our utmost purpose is to bequeath a better placeto live in harmony  tolerance and cooperation.26"
"41",1799,"CZE",55,2000,"I would like tostart by congratulating you  Mr. President  on beingelected to preside over the fifty-fifth session of theGeneral Assembly  and wish you much success as youcarry out this important post. I would also like to takethis opportunity to thank your Namibian predecessor Minister Theo-Ben Gurirab  for the responsible workand efforts he invested in United Nations activitiesthroughout the year and  in particular  for the role heplayed in the preparation of the Millennium Summit.Let me also take this opportunity to welcome theadmission of Tuvalu to the United Nations  anotherexpression of the openness and universal character ofthis Organization.The Millennium Summit brought interesting stimulating ideas embracing the huge potential posedby the experience of the population of the wholeplanet  formulated in the words of the highestrepresentatives of Member States. The Summit  themost representative gathering ever  gave us a uniqueopportunity to make a multifaceted review of5challenges the world is facing at the threshold of thenew millennium. The unexpectedly positive Summitresults are generally being appreciated and approved.However  the implementation of those 32 UnitedNations Millennium Declaration provisions  as well asof an unprecedented Security Council resolution 1318(2000)  will not be easy  cheap or rapidly attainable.The start of the 1990s was characterized bybuoyancy and great expectations in handling long-termproblems connected with the era of Communism in theworld  the onset of democracy and the stress on theimportance of observing universal human rights.Bound up in this optimism were expectations that weresometimes unrealistic.Those expectations proved unfeasible in thesecond half of the decade. The intricate nature of theproblems  difficulties in finding lasting solutions  andinternal and external crises quite clearly exposed thebounds and the possibilities of the internationalcommunity  and the United Nations was no exception.Disillusionment and disenchantment sometimes led tothe assertion and the defence of utilitarian and otherparticular interests  which led to feelings of belongingand solidarity being greatly undermined.The inhabitants of the world  suffering from theravages of war  poverty  disasters and various forms ofoppression  expect actions of us today.Can we match these expectations? I hope  andfirmly believe  that we can. There is no longer time forfurther devaluation in the significance of the wordsdevelopment  security  cooperation and solidarity. Wecan no longer abuse the trust and patience of so manypeople. If reaching a compromise and consensuscontinues to be impossible for our diplomats  then itwill be all the more difficult to find it among States andentities in individual countries.The United Nations is expected to be able toprove its ability to adapt quickly and carry out internalreform  primarily of the Security Council. The SecurityCouncil has to reflect the reality of today  not that of 50years ago. Only a truly representative and effectiveSecurity Council will be able to overcome its currentimpotence  sometimes veiled in high-sounding butempty phrases. If no remedy is found now  after theMillennium Summit  the United Nations risks loss ofcredibility  and it will greatly reduce its influence onmany processes which are now shaping the world. HereI am thinking especially of those processes we includeunder the term globalization.Globalization does not stop at Forty-secondStreet. It is rushing around the world with the force ofa typhoon  picking up speed as it is fed ever newdiscoveries in information and communicationtechnology. But globalization is a much morecomprehensive phenomenon than the merestandardization of traffic regulations  televisionsystems or bananas. Globalization entails developmentand human security  as well as poverty and human fear.But it also encompasses human thinking. If it does notembrace solidarity and social justice  it will continue todivide the world between winners and losers  as wasmentioned here from this rostrum recently by theGerman Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer. The UnitedNations can help with this issue. If it fails  it will beguilty of loosing this crucial opportunity of making theUnited Nations again into a highly respectedOrganization able to tackle the most important globalproblems. We have to find the political will and themeans to do so.I would like to dwell on the topic ofpeacekeeping a little. What I have said about hugeoptimism and subsequent disenchantment is just asapplicable to this area. I am convinced that lastingsolutions to conflicts can only be found by peacefulmeans and by negotiations between all partiesinvolved. Peacekeeping remains a key instrumentwielded by the international community  as itestablishes peace and peaceful coexistence among thenations.We welcome the priority given to peacekeepinglast week. The Millennium Summit meetings  togetherwith Mr. Brahimi's report  present a unique opportunityto strengthen the United Nations capacity forpeacekeeping operations. Our pledges to enhance theeffectiveness of the United Nations in addressingconflicts at all stages  from prevention to settlement topost-conflict peace-building  should bind theinternational community from the very moment itapproved them last week.Far-reaching but realistic intentions announcedfrom this rostrum by Minister Vedrine on behalf of theEuropean Union earlier this week thus meet ourexpectations of how to bring into life the MillenniumSummit recommendations  anchored in a firm belief inthe United Nations potential.6Any reform of the United Nations would not becomplete without reforming its crucial body: theSecurity Council. Its role is irreplaceable. Thedecision-making process should respond not only to achange in the nature of today's crises  but also to thenecessary comprehensiveness of their solutions. Anincrease in the effective capacity of the United NationsSecretariat to act via the reorganization of itsDepartment of Peacekeeping Operations  closercooperation and coordination with regional structuresis an integral part of the process. We must look forways to react quickly  promptly and effectively.The Czech Republic's approach to the reform ofthe United Nations Security Council has been voicedmany times  and we prove it through our activeparticipation  notably in the open-ended working groupof the General Assembly and in the so-called Group of10. Unfortunately  deliberations on Security Councilreform are still short of bringing fruit  being effectivelyparalysed by the particular interests of several States.The new millennium must soon see a new  enlarged andmore representative Security Council  preferably withfive additional permanent seats for both developed anddeveloping countries and a few more non-permanentseats. We all have to take to heart the appeal of theMillennium Declaration to further strengthen ourefforts in this regard.Whether for programmes or for peacekeeping  inthe new millennium the United Nations needs asustainable and equitable system of financing. In thisregard  we are ready to cooperate actively indiscussions about making adjustments for the scale ofassessments for both the regular budget and thepeacekeeping budget. We express our appreciation tothe countries that have announced their preparedness toassume additional financial responsibility by movingvoluntarily from group C to group B in thepeacekeeping operations scale.The Czech Republic has voluntarily committeditself to remain in group B  but that is not a solution tothe problem. A new scale is urgently needed. However negotiations about such a scale should not be trappedin endless debates over past unpaid debts. All arrearsshould be settled before the adoption of a new  andhopefully fairer  scale of assessments.The anniversary we mark this year of the tragicmassacre in Bosnian Srebrenica leads me to the issueof war crimes  crimes against humanity and genocide.The international community's objective is to achievepeace  but lasting peace requires justice. In this respect the International Criminal Tribunals set up by theSecurity Council are of prime importance. Besidespunishing offenders  those International Tribunals haveanother extremely important function: to provepersonal guilt in criminal cases and  thus  to reject thenotion of collective guilt. The Tribunals are alsoimportant as deterrents for those who may be thinkingof easing their way to power over the bodies of theinnocent. The Czech Republic therefore highlyappreciates the work done by the InternationalCriminal Tribunals to investigate the crimes committedin the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda  and supports theestablishment of a similar body to punish crimescommitted in Cambodia and Sierra Leone.The International Criminal Tribunal for theFormer Yugoslavia increased its activities during thelast year  bringing to The Hague war criminals who hadgreater responsibility for crimes committed. Warcriminals have been prosecuted there  but their politicaland military leaders remain at large. Recentdevelopments  however  have shown that leadersthemselves are not immune from internationaljurisdiction. That trend is best illustrated by the effortsof the international community to establish anInternational Criminal Court  which most MemberStates of the United Nations voted for at Rome in 1998.The creation of a functioning InternationalCriminal Court  an institution that can play animportant role in projecting the principle of justice intointernational relations and in building an increasinglyefficient system for the protection of human rights  isone of the priorities of Czech foreign policy in the fieldof international law. The Czech Republic is taking allthe necessary steps to ratify the Rome Statute asquickly as possible.Developments in international law are directlybound up with the issue of human rights. I believe thatthe commitment of the United Nations to the right ofevery human being to a dignified life in safety shouldbecome the focus of attention of all Member States ofthe United Nations. The long and frequently painfulprocess of making progress in international humanrights  at the outset of which stood the terribleexperience of the Holocaust  has resulted in theconcept of universal human rights. The United Nationsis playing a key role in implementing that concept.7However  I think it would be wrong to use ourcontemporary understanding of human rights when welook back at events long past. In the last decade  theinternational community demonstrated both itsdetermination not to accept abuses of human rights andits willingness to defend the principle of the personalsafety of human beings  even to the detriment of thewell-established concept of national sovereignty.Accepting limits to absolute sovereignty for the sake ofhuman rights is a matter of political principle andmorality that forms the basis of the values of theUnited Nations. As I said here last year  we wouldprefer  if any actions do infringe on the sovereignty ofMember States  that those actions be made legitimateby a proper United Nations mandate. Human rights isnot a process that has been completed; it is stillprogressing. However  we should not judge history bythe standards of today.The protection of human rights is one of thefundamental principles of Czech foreign policy.Compared with other international compacts  those onhuman rights enjoy a privileged status in Czech law. Iam pleased that the Czech Republic subscribed duringthe Millennium Summit to the Optional Protocol to theConvention on the Rights of the Child on theinvolvement of children in armed conflict. Due effortsto complete a protocol to the Convention againstTorture should be made. The Czech Republic alsomade an active contribution to the preparation of theDeclaration on human rights defenders. I believe thatthe decision made this year by the United NationsCommission on Human Rights on the appointment of aspecial rapporteur of the Secretary-General for humanrights will help give rise to the mechanism we need forthe implementation of the Declaration.The last of the more general issues I would like todraw attention to is the issue of sanctions. By that I donot mean weapons embargoes. The Czech Republicviews them as instruments capable of reducing theintensity of a conflict  supports them and observesthem without reservation. A problem  though  lies inthe efficiency and impact of blanket economicsanctions. The last 10 years have provided ample proofthat in Cuba  Iraq and Yugoslavia  to take just threeexamples  blanket economic sanctions  whetherdeclared unilaterally or multilaterally  have beenunable to achieve their objective.Poorly nourished  isolated and sick people arehardly likely to rise up against a governing elite thatwill never allow the consequences of sanctions toaffect it or its faithful supporters. The result is thatchanges in the conduct of the rulers are even lesslikely.Growing globalization and the economic andinformation interconnection of the whole worldinfluence and change the conditions affecting theefficiency of sanctions. The Czech Republic wouldtherefore prefer the use of smart sanctions targetedagainst leading representatives of a State that refuses toobserve international law. In my opinion  suchsanctions could include a ban on the issue of entryvisas and the freezing of assets abroad. I think it wouldbe particularly useful and expedient if the examinationof the issue of peacekeeping also included the issue ofsanctions. The Czech Republic believes that a similarapproach  namely  the appointment of a panel ofexperts on this issue and subsequent discussion of areport drawn up by that panel  would be of immensebenefit in improving our collective efforts to achievepeace and security by punishing perpetrators and notvictims.Allow me to mention how the Czech Republicviews some of the most topical questions ofinternational policy.We believe that boosting defence capacities toprotect against potential attack is an absolutelylegitimate step by any government. In the case ofNational Missile Defence  however  we are talking of aconcept about which there are many questions. In ouropinion  security  as it is conceived of today  iscomprehensive and integral  something that cannotbe built up to the detriment of other partners.The Czech Republic believes that the way to asafer world lies primarily in the continuation of thedisarmament process and the non-proliferation ofweapons of mass destruction  leading ultimately to aworld free of nuclear weapons. We support the viewthat a more intense disarmament process will lead tosavings in the funds spent on arms. Employing suchsavings for peaceful purposes would increase theability of the international community to tacklepressing challenges such as the widening gap betweenrich and poor countries  and to deal with ethnic andreligious conflicts  environmental preservation and soon. I would like to assure the Assembly that efforts torenew the momentum of the disarmament process will8continue to have the unequivocal support of the CzechRepublic.The Czech Republic therefore welcomesPresident Clinton's decision to leave the verdict onNational Missile Defence to the new President.The Czech Republic is monitoring the situation inthe Middle East closely  as a traditional and activesupporter of the peace process established by SecurityCouncil resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and theprinciple of land for peace. The Czech Republicresolutely opposes the exploitation of the developmentsthat took place after the Camp David summit to attackthe peace process as a whole as well as the positiveresults achieved so far in negotiations between Israeland the Palestine National Council (PNC). The CzechRepublic also emphatically rejects the misuse of thissituation to carry out acts of violence  which can onlyresult in unnecessary suffering and more victims. Thisis not the way to achieve the much-desired peace andstability in the Middle East. The Czech Republicsupports the establishment of an independent Palestine but it would prefer the emergence of such a state in anatmosphere of general support enjoying the consensusof all those involved. That is why we believe that thePNC's postponement of this step by two months createsa certain space for further deliberations. We wish themto be fruitful and successful in their outcome  althoughwe are fully aware that even with good political will onboth sides  the issues are thorny and laden withemotions and the burdens of history.Last year from this rostrum I said that Kosovowould be the benchmark for the success ofinternational institutions. I also said that Kosovo wasgoing through a period when peace must bedefended  that is  a period in which it is vital toachieve political stability and democratization economic stabilization and the gradual development ofthe region.We can be proud of what the Kosovo Force(KFOR) and United Nations Interim Administration inKosovo (UNMIK) have done to assist the return ofethnic Albanians who were chased out of their homesby Serbian forces.Regardless of these tremendous efforts  however we cannot be quite satisfied with the developments inKosovo. In fact  some of the objectives of the relevantresolution have not been achieved. The positivedevelopments we have seen so far in Kosovo concernmostly one ethnic group; the other still lives under asecurity threat. There is still a very long way to gobefore a multi-ethnic  multicultural and democraticway of life prevails in the area.In keeping with Security Council resolution 1244(1999)  the possibility  on a permanent basis  of thereturn of non-Albanian ethnic groups and the buildingof a multi-ethnic  pluralistic and democratic societymust remain our objectives  no matter how unattainablethis aim may seem today. To give up on this objectivewould be tantamount to an admission of defeat on thepart of the international community.Certain negative features of the developments inKosovo also hinder the chances for the democratizationof Serbia. They play into the hands of those forces inthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Serbia whichbuild their election campaigns on xenophobia  on thecontinuation of the political isolation of the FederalRepublic of Yugoslavia and Serbia  and on thecontinuation of sanctions.In our view  the time has come seriously toconsider taking further steps in Kosovo  including atthe level of the Security Council. The Council hasalready taken the first steps in this direction  but it isimperative for it to return to the Kosovo issue soon.Obviously  many things will depend on the results ofthe forthcoming elections in the Federal Republic ofYugoslavia.The world beyond the doors of this Hall ischanging rapidly. Our children will live and work in anenvironment that we can only guess at. It is ourcollective responsibility to do all we can to ensure thatit is a world of peace  prosperity  solidarity andtolerance."
"42",1861,"DEU",55,2000,"First of all Iwould like to warmly congratulate you  Sir  on yourelection as President of the fifty-fifth session of theGeneral Assembly  and wish you every success withyour work. I would like to thank Foreign MinisterGurirab for his dedication in chairing the fifty-fourthsession of the General Assembly. I welcome Tuvalu asthe one hundred and eighty-ninth member of the UnitedNations and congratulate it on its accession. I endorsethe statement of my French colleague  Hubert VÈdrine on behalf of the European Union.At this session of the General Assembly  the firstin the new millennium  we are asked to determine thefuture tasks of the United Nations and which reformsare necessary in order to master them. The MillenniumDeclaration  which we all adopted on 8 September shows us the way forward. The implementation of thisDeclaration should be a main focus of the consultationsof this and future sessions of the General Assembly. Ipropose that the Secretary-General make use of theopportunity to draw up review reports at the beginningof the next session of the General Assembly.There was one issue in particular whichdominated this debate  namely globalization. It willradically change the economy and finances  politicsand culture everywhere. The question is  will a neworder which guarantees peace  justice and an equalshare in our common progress be established or will anew divide evolve in the world? Will the future of theglobalized world manifest its pluralist character in amultilateral order? Only the future can provide theanswers to these questions.Particularly for developing countries globalization offers great opportunities. If itnevertheless provokes strong opposition  this lies in theimbalances of this historical process. Indeed  just undera decade after the end of the cold war  our world istoday at risk from a new divide  one between thewinners and losers of the economic globalizationprocess. In his impressive Millennium Report  theSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  rightly highlightsthe growing inequalities in the distribution of income resources  investments and access to new technologies.In view of this situation  the internationalcommunity must make every effort in the comingdecade to ensure that globalization benefits all peoples.If market forces are not balanced by a politicalcorrective mechanism  it is to be expected that injusticein the world will increase further. Those who have beenhitherto excluded from the advantages of globalizationmust be included to a greater extent. They must begiven more say in the political decisions made aboutsteering global processes and they must be given anopportunity to gain a fairer share in the development ofthe world economy.In the twenty-first century  we will  more thanever before  need a form of global governance if we areto solve global challenges. The United Nations willplay a key role here. It is the only organization withinwhich the injustice between rich and poor can beovercome and where a reconciliation between peoplesand regions  global peace and sustainable developmentcan be achieved.Greatly strengthening the United Nations capacityto act is  therefore  a crucial question for the whole of15humanity in the twenty-first century. In addition to thecrucial reform of the Security Council  this will entailthe United Nations entering into creative partnershipswith industry and civil society.Germany strongly supports the Secretary-General's idea for a global compact with majorcompanies. The German initiative for a resolution inthe General Assembly on global partnerships will takeup this and other issues relating to the globalizationprocess.Global poverty is the key problem in North-Southrelations. It lies at the root of many global risks andthreats to peace. The Secretary-General providedprecise and stimulating analyses of this in his report.The industrialized nations have a specialobligation to support the poorest of the poor. With theCologne debt initiative launched by Germany  we arecombining debt relief with a strategy to combatpoverty. The 20 poorest developing countries should bedebt-free by the end of the year.The least developed countries should be grantedaccess to world markets with the greatest possibleexemption from duties and quotas. We must  also byway of liberalization steps in the World TradeOrganization  prevent these countries from beingsocially excluded even further.This applies in particular to the new economy.The United Nations and its Member States mustintensify their efforts to make it easier for thesecountries to use the information and communicationtechnologies. This is contingent upon initiatives in thefield of education  as well as the availability of thenecessary resources.However  how can poor countries ever catch upeconomically if they are  at the same time  afflicted to amuch greater degree than the North by terriblediseases? The fight against the disastrous spread of theAIDS virus  particularly in Africa  must be priority forus all. The focus must be on prevention. At the sametime  access to medicines must be improved andvaccine research must be intensified. The World Bank'spromising idea of establishing a future fund for thepurchase of vaccines deserves every support.Particularly in the fight against AIDS  new partnershipsbetween Governments and companies are crucial.The second major issue of this General Assemblyis peacekeeping. The Secretary-General showed theway ahead with the Brahimi report. Therecommendations it contains should be examined andimplemented as quickly as possible. Germany will playits part. Peace missions need a more robust mandate  aswell as more personnel and equipment. Member Statesmust do considerably more to ensure the rapidsecondment of well-trained troops  police officers andcivilian experts. The further development of the policeconcept is one of the most important tasks in thisconnection  as the last few months and years have  infact been teaching us.The German Government will offer Germantraining for civilian peace-mission personnel and offercivilian capacities to the United Nations stand-bysystem. In addition  we are drafting a plan for trainingcivilian experts for peace missions  thus creating a poolof qualified personnel who can be deployed at shortnotice.The prevailing form of conflict today is conflictwithin States. Therefore the main task of peacekeepingmust be to address the internal roots of conflicts. Inaddition to focusing on an improvement in socio-economic conditions  our efforts must focus onpromoting human rights  democracy and the rule oflaw. Mary Robinson  the United Nations HighCommissioner for Human Rights  aptly said that thehuman rights violations of today are the wars oftomorrow.Numerous concrete tasks are on the agenda. Theprotocols relating to the involvement of children inarmed conflict and to the sale of children  childprostitution and child pornography must enter intoforce as early as possible. The equality of women mustbe advanced in all spheres. I call upon all states toratify quickly the new Optional Protocol to theConvention on the Elimination of All Forms ofDiscrimination against Women and to abolish all lawsthat discriminate against women by 2005. The WorldConference against racism  to be held in 2001  musttackle all aspects of this issue. Out of a sense ofresponsibility for our history  our State and our societywill stand up firmly against all forms of right-wingradicalism  racism and anti-Semitism  both in our owncountry and in the world.I call upon all States to respect the integrity of theStatute of the International Criminal Court  to sign andto ratify it  so that the Court can commence work soon.There can be no exceptions to the Rome Statute.16One of the greatest dangers facing humanityremains the proliferation of weapons of massdestruction. The risk of regional arms races particularly in South Asia  has increased. Furtherdeveloping the international arms-control regimetherefore continues to be one of the United Nations keytasks. This will require resolute implementation of theresults of the sixth Review Conference of the Parties tothe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons. Against this background  President Clinton'sdecision not to commit now to the development of anational missile defence system is very welcome. TheAnti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty must remain as acornerstone of strategic stability and the basis forfurther nuclear-disarmament measures.In poor countries the excessive stockpiling ofsmall arms must be stopped. We must therefore doeverything we can to achieve tangible progress at theUnited Nations small arms conference to be held in2001. This presupposes the inclusion of all aspects including the legal transfer of production andstockpiles.Regional cooperation has proved to be anextremely effective means of preventing conflicts. TheUnited Nations can do much to help here. Allow me tomention two regions where progress is particularlyurgent. The triangle between Central Asia  theCaucasus and the Middle East is full of destabilizingfactors  oil  religious fundamentalism  terrorism drugs and the nuclear arms race  and this area isthreatening to become the crisis region of the centuryahead. A new comprehensive regional process  alongthe lines of the Helsinki model  which fosterscooperation instead of confrontation  could play animportant stabilizing role. Germany is prepared to takepart in such a process.In Africa  regional approaches have gained insignificance. In the main  however  it is  unfortunately too early to talk of effective peacekeeping structures.Unfortunately  the efforts on the part of the UnitedNations and of the Organization of African Unity toresolve the conflicts in the Congo and Sierra Leonehave not achieved a breakthrough so far. In the conflictbetween Ethiopia and Eritrea it is to be hoped that theceasefire that has finally been concluded will beconsolidated and that the United Nations peace missionwill be lent the full support of the parties to theconflict.The third issue  protection of our naturalenvironment  will probably become the crucial issueaffecting our planet. In the course of the twentiethcentury the world's population quadrupled  whileconsumption of energy and raw materials increasedtenfold. We must end the squandering of naturalresources and switch to renewable energy sources asquickly as possible. This cannot only be a matter forindustrialized nations. We are witnessing at this verymoment what a burden high oil prices places on poorcountries in particular. It must be in the interest of allStates to bring about the transition from the oil to thehydrogen age as quickly as possible. The mostimportant thing now is to finally overcome thedeadlock in the climate-protection negotiations and toensure that the Kyoto Protocol can be implemented by2002  10 years after the Rio Summit.Another key issue for humanity  the future ofgenetic engineering  can only be mastered within theframework of a global consensus. Genetic engineeringhas the potential to revolutionalize medicine andagriculture. At the same time  it raises more ethical andhuman rights questions than any other technology. Dowe not need clear  binding rules for dealing with such apowerful new technology? Why do we not seriouslyconsider within the United Nations creating underinternational law a convention that meaningfullypromotes genetic engineering and safeguards thefreedom to research and the findings of this research while  at the same time  defining an ethical basis andguaranteeing protection against abuse?The Millennium Declaration points the wayahead. But what help will that be if an increasingnumber of Members allow the world's real problems tobe dealt with and decided somewhere else? If we donot succeed in adapting the United Nations to deal withthe challenges of the twenty-first century and inmodernizing it fully  it will be sidelined  with fatalconsequences for peace and development  humanrights  the environment and social progress.We will all  rich and poor  lose out.We must therefore muster the strength toresolutely implement the Millennium Declaration. Weneed a world Organization that is strong and we mustuse its scarce resources more effectively. An importantprerequisite for this is that the United Nations beplaced finally on a solid financial footing. Togetherwith its European Union partners  Germany has put17forward proposals for a fairer  more balanced scale ofassessments  which must continue to be based onMember States' ability to pay..The Security Council no longer reflects thepolitical reality of our world at the dawn of the newmillennium. We share the Secretary-General's viewthat this central steering organ of the internationalcommunity must become more representative legitimate and effective  also involving the developingcountries. Last week Chancellor Schroeder reaffirmedGermany's willingness to take on more responsibilityin this connection. I would like to take this opportunityto thank my friend and colleague Robin Cook for theclear language that he used before the GeneralAssembly just a few minutes ago.The General Assembly must structure its work debate global problems in a more focused fashion thanhitherto and identify courses of action. The synergeticpotential between United Nations organizations  forexample in the environmental field  must be better usedand resources pooled to a greater extent by mergingorganizations.Reform of the United Nations will play a decisiverole in ensuring that the twenty-first century is saferand more just than the twentieth century. Allow me toconclude with a quote from the Secretary-General'sMillennium Report:No shift in the way we think or act can bemore critical than this: we must put people at thecentre of everything we do ... Only when thatbegins to happen will we know that globalizationis indeed becoming inclusive  allowing everyoneto share its opportunities.'"
"43",1899,"DJI",55,2000,"On behalfof the people of Djibouti  it is a great pleasure indeedto extend our sincere greetings to one and all at thisMillennium Assembly. May I also  Mr. President convey our congratulations on your election. Your vastand varied experience will serve the Assembly well.I should also like to express our appreciation toyour predecessor  Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab of Namibia for the excellent work done and the achievementsregistered. He showed great skill and commitment inhis task. Clearly the accomplishments of the fifty-fourth session were  to a large extent  due to hisleadership  dedication and tireless efforts.No organization  particularly one such as theUnited Nations  can survive for any length of time ifbeset  as it is  with mounting demands and dwindlingresources  and without deft  tenacious and imaginativeleadership. The trials and tribulations of the UnitedNations have continued unabated during the past year.It has had to restore peace and to tackle wars  conflicts natural disasters and disease while also addressingdevelopment. The list of difficulties goes on. Yet theSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  has managed tostrengthen the Organization and make it better suited tomeet the demands of the times. Under his enlightenedguidance  the United Nations continues to play acredible and meaningful international role. We arefortunate indeed.This being the last General Assembly session ofthe decade  the century and indeed the millennium  it isthe ideal time for us to reflect on the state of the worldand of its peoples. There has been an all-pervadingdesire on the part of the United Nations and itsMember States  to see fresh momentum in order togenerate the necessary energy to deal with the newmillennium and address critical issues. We have cometo realize that the strength of our resolve and ourdetermination to deal with the challenge of securing abetter  safer and healthier world for its inhabitants willbe decisive for the future of humankind. In manyrespects  however  it is still an open question.It is perhaps a sign of the times when anyoverview of the world today must give prominence tothe fact that the world is being ravaged by a disease namely AIDS. This deadly epidemic is continuing tospread. We are all aware of its terrible toll  particularlyin Africa  where it is decimating youth  theprofessional classes  the labour force and health-caresystems. The will of the international community willbe put to the test  and we will see how it responds incrisis situations.Last year I noted that dialogue had been renewedbetween Palestine and Israel  which opened apromising opportunity for charting a new course in theMiddle East. While it is true that the recent CampDavid peace talks are still suspended  nonetheless agreat deal was accomplished in terms of fully exploringthe scope and diversity of the issues underconsideration. There was at least a workable level oftrust and a clear willingness to discuss the key “finalstatus” issues of borders  settlements  water  refugees statehood and  above all  the status of Jerusalem. It isdifficult  however  to imagine any resolution orsettlement that would not include Palestinian control ofEast Jerusalem. Israel's continued claim to the entirecity  which would include control of Muslim holy sitesin the Old City  adjoining Muslim and Christianquarters and selected Arab villages  would becounterproductive to peace.Any mention of the Middle East must  of course include a reference to the enormous loss suffered bySyria and the world at large with the death of the long-serving President of Syria  Hafez Al-Assad. We wishthe new President  Bashar Al-Assad  all the best in hisefforts to follow in the footsteps of his illustriousfather.In my address last year  I touched upon the spreadand intensity of wars; rebel and splinter movements;and factional fighting in Africa. Sadly  while there havebeen some encouraging developments  a basicuncertainty remains. Fortunately  fighting betweenDjibouti's neighbours  Ethiopia and Eritrea  has ceased and troop redeployment and the deployment of UnitedNations observers are expected to take place soonunder the ceasefire arrived at under the auspices of theOrganization of African Unity. The level of death anddestruction in these hostilities simply defies theimagination  and the sight of so many civiliansdisplaced from their homes and deprived of theirlivelihood  crowded into camps on both sides  is truly adisheartening experience. It is high time for themember countries of the Intergovernmental Authorityon Development (IGAD) to opt for a comprehensivepeace and cessation of hostilities in this subregion  inorder collectively to focus on development and addressthe serious challenges posed by environmentaldisasters  such as the current looming drought.As concerns other parts of Africa  the persistingconflict in Angola is still with us  althoughGovernment forces appear to be gaining the upperhand. Regarding the conflict in Sierra Leone  thesudden international concern to see that the belligerentsare not allowed to sell the precious minerals of theircountry on the world market should  it is to be hoped reduce their capacity to wage war. This may beparticularly true for both these countries. We arepleased to see the measures being taken by the DeBeers group and the Belgian authorities to close12international access to these bloodstained commodities.Similar action must be taken with respect to othercommodities as well.Undoubtedly  the most ominous threat to thecontinent at present lies in its centre  in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo  where the ceasefire arrangedlast year has suffered a number of setbacks. The UnitedNations has been unable to deploy troops as envisaged.Talks between the Government and the oppositionappear to have broken off  raising the dangerousspectre of a return to civil war  which could bedisastrous for the entire continent. The distraughtpeople of that nation deserve a respite from instabilityand insecurity in order to be able to enjoy normal lives.In all these critical areas  be it the AIDS crisis ever-growing poverty  wars  the environment  humanrights abuses  weapons of mass destruction or lack ofdevelopment  the United Nations remains the onlyOrganization with the requisite experience and know-how to focus and refine the disparate efforts ofhumankind.Decisions regarding the maintenance ofinternational peace and security lie with the SecurityCouncil  which  with the explosion of United Nationsmembership over the last three decades  has become anot very representative body. If we are to restoreconfidence in its decisions  there has to be  at all costs an expansion in its membership  both permanent andnon-permanent  with the extension of permanentmembership to both developed and non-developedcountries. The Council should also have access tobetter information on unstable regions  and a rapidresponse capability. Furthermore  when serioushumanitarian crises are unfolding  measures to limit thespread and impact of conflict should be taken on aselective  case-by-case basis  but across the board byall Members.Like last year  I again intend to dwell on theproblem of Somalia  and I again request the indulgenceof the Assembly. At that time  Somalia was on theverge of total disintegration  following years ofpolitical paralysis. Urgent measures were needed toreverse this tragedy  a tragedy to which theinternational community had grown largely indifferent.The mood was simply one of waiting for the warlordsto eliminate one another until a victor emerged withwhom business could be done. In the meantime  thoseindividuals carried out systematic dismantling destruction and looting of the Somali nation  ignoringconsistent calls to change their reckless and criminalbehaviour.This  however  cannot be tolerated any longer.The people have spoken at last. They have decidedagainst endless uncertainty and aberration. They weresapped of their strength. The people have now optedfor government  law and order  and a better future. Weurge the international community  therefore  to respectthe will of the Somali people  and to refuse to continueto cooperate with those destructive elements that madeSomalia synonymous with chaos and violence.Somalia as a nation  as an entity  seemedcondemned to a slow death  unable to expect eitherregional or international intervention or a positivechange in the behaviour of the warlords. SavingSomalia  therefore  necessitated moving away from theusual practice  which revolved around a few  familiar self-anointed representatives of the people. Rather thanprovide them with yet another opportunity to play theirgame of deception  I suggested that it was time to movebeyond them; time to empower the Somali people; timethe Somali people assumed responsibility for their owndestiny. There needed to be a conference of all theactors  the ultimate objective of which would be the re-establishment of peace  government  legitimacy andreconstruction. I believe that a true reconciliation of allsegments of Somali society would tap into the popularmood of the Somali people  who overwhelminglyrejected the status quo. There was at last a burningdesire for change; a change that would transform thelives of the people and would restore respect  dignityand integrity; one that meant peace  security anddevelopment. For the first time  there was analternative in sight: not the power of the gun  but thepower of the people.The peace process was designed to embrace thewhole country  including regions that enjoyed relativepeace and stability. It was to be comprehensive inclusive and transparent  excluding no individual group  sector or region.But beyond comprehensive reconciliation  thegoal was to create a national framework leading to anadministration that represented the people fairly protected their basic rights and values and guaranteedliberty and justice for all. Somalia  after all  was anation that had gone without a government during thelongest period of State collapse in the modern era. It13was a country where the law of the gun  lust for powerand vengeance dominated the landscape  until fear andruthlessness had decimated every opportunity forpeace. The predictable outcome was a social andinstitutional collapse without parallel in this century.The key aspect of the Djibouti-led IGAD peaceprocess was its bottom-up approach  which emphasizedcommunity participation in discussions  slowlyconsolidating the gains achieved. This process not onlywas cumbersome  slow  painful  frustrating and visiblyfragile at times  but also endured internationalscepticism and indifference. All along  we insisted onthe openness  independence and integrity of the processto enable the majority of unarmed Somalis  includingelders  traditional and religious leaders  scholars women  politicians  the youth and the civil society atlarge  to own the process. Accordingly  our efforts weredirected towards safeguarding the conceptualframework and rejecting all conditional offers ofassistance  material or otherwise  while alwaysremaining open or receptive to ideas or proposals thatdeepened and enriched the process.The conference itself represented the culminationof a series of consultations  meetings  symposiums andcontacts that took place over the first six months of theyear. Its objective was to overcome and resolve someof the most divisive and emotional national issues. Theelaborate  extensive and admittedly costly preparationswere necessary to heal the painful past and formulatesensible humanitarian and political guarantees andsafeguards. Never again should there be toleration ofthe kind of hateful human rights violations and grossabuses of power that had destroyed the country.While the process took time and went throughseveral phases  it enabled delegates to address allaspects of Somalia's collapse  spurred by the strongdesire for peace prevailing in the country.The cornerstone of the process was the key roleplayed by the traditional leaders  particularly in theachievement of the broadest possible reconciliationamong the Somali clans. For long stretches of time amounting to years  there had been virtually no contactbetween them  allowing each to pile up grievancesthroughout the conflict. Slowly and painfully  theconference persistently addressed complex politicalissues  while striving to overcome deep animosities andimplacable attitudes.The very critical first phase of the conferencebegan on 2 May and concluded in early June. It was themost important phase  for we must bear in mind thatmore than 200 elders and traditional leaders from everypart of the country were coming together for the firsttime — not the first time in 10 years  but the first timein the entire existence of Somalia as a State — seekingto overcome a decade of frustration  fear  anger suspicion and mistrust  without ever having had contactwith each other before. Slowly  this legacy of the pastwas overcome and replaced with a common purpose:the search for a new destiny and a sense of the need toact at all costs. Through the wisdom  persistence andsincerity of these elders  it was possible to completethe reconciliation and to establish solid structures forthe second phase. The core political choices could thenbe made.The second phase began on 15 June  with theparticipation of over 2 000 delegates. The setting ofthis conference bore no resemblance to any in the past because this one took place in a giant tent. There wereno class or social distinctions evident among theparticipants  who included women  representatives ofall minorities  a number of warlords and  of course  theentire clan mosaic of Somalia. Proceedings werecovered by satellite and on the Internet in order toenable Somalis everywhere in the world to keep abreastof developments. Participants outnumbered theresidents in Arta  the hill-top resort town  which wasthe venue for the conference. Nearly every residentcontributed to the conference one way or another particularly in accommodating this huge and suddeninflux of visitors.This phase of the conference made it possible toaddress many issues  from civil strife  human rights healing and reconciliation  the economy  the politicalstructure  disarmament  transitional mechanisms suchas the interim constitution  the legislation  thegovernment and the judiciary system. Slowly  anirreversible momentum  a feeling of rebirth  tookshape. In a real sense  it was Somalia's secondindependence  this time not from colonialism but fromchaos and utter hopelessness.After one month of intensive drafting and debate an interim constitution  or charter  was adopted. Itestablished the number of representatives  including aquota for women  in the new assembly and themodalities for their election. This major step in theprocess signalled the beginning of a truly nationwide14reconciliation effort  as it contained a series ofaccommodations  including a clan-based system as thepolitical mechanism for power sharing during thethree-year interim authority. The resulting transitionalnational authority could therefore be a highly workablevehicle for both the parties who are for the process andthe troublemakers. No one  though  should take eitherthe reconciliation process or the new institutions asshielding any individual from past misdeeds or warcrimes. This is among the challenges that will confrontfuture constitutional Governments of Somalia.Let me say that 26 August 2000 is a date whichwill forever stir the hearts and spirits of Somalis. It wason this date that Somalia's interim parliament electedthe country's first president in more than a decade.Starting with a field of 25 candidates  voting wascompleted after several rounds and more than ten hoursof bargaining and negotiating in order to secure cross-clan support within the Assembly to win the necessarymajority. Interest among Somali viewers for theconference and the elections was certainly heightenedby up-to-the-minute radio and satellite coverage  whichpermitted Somalis everywhere to follow the electionsand the debates that had preceded them since thebeginning of the process.The man chosen from among the candidates ishere with us today. This man in the news is AbdikassimSalad Hassan  the new President of Somalia  aseasoned  urbane  and a highly experienced politician who has already demonstrated his rare skills through aseries of visits and engagements  both inside Somaliaand externally. I wholeheartedly congratulate him andwelcome him and his delegation most warmly in thisAssembly.What a joy to see Somalia retake its rightful placeamong the community of nations! The realization ofhaving a president at last fills Somalis everywhere withemotional exuberance. People are dancing and singingin the streets in what was described as a spontaneousnational holiday. We wish to express our deepestgratitude to the member States of IGAD and to Yemenwho were represented at the highest level to witnessthe swearing-in ceremony of the new president; we areequally grateful to Saudi Arabia  France  Egypt  Libya Italy  Kuwait  the Organization of African Unity(OAU)  the League of Arab States and the UnitedNations for having sent high level delegations. And  ofcourse  we wish to thank the entire diplomaticcommunity in Djibouti for their presence and steadfastsupport.Undoubtedly  we fully acknowledge the realismand genuine understanding so readily displayedthroughout this process by the other immediateneighbours of Somalia  namely Kenya and Ethiopia.We have also received tremendous comfort from thecontinued encouragement and support from theSecretary-General and his able staff both in New Yorkand in the region  particularly  from his SpecialRepresentative  Mr. David Stephen  and his staff whose presence in the conference throughout theprocess proved remarkably beneficial. Equally  theunfailing commitment demonstrated by the SecurityCouncil throughout its series of statements since thelaunch of the initiative has been a source of constantcomfort.Obviously  the peace process invariably enjoyedfull and unambiguous backing of IGAD  OAU  theLeague of Arab States  the Organization of the IslamicConference and the European Union. We are deeplyappreciative of their steady and principled stand. TheSomali people will be forever grateful. Following theformation of the new Somali parliament  the SecurityCouncil reiterated that the preservation of the territorialintegrity of the country was the precondition for overallnormalization in Somalia and recommended thatregional organizations work towards that end.Some discordant voices have been raisedquestioning the acceptance of the new Government andits ability to return to Somalia. Some scoffed it wouldbe a phantom government-in-exile  lacking legitimacyand resources. However  the triumphant return as wellas the ecstatic welcome from the public of the newPresident-elect  Abdikassim  into Mogadishu  thecentre of conflict  and the unprecedented show ofsupport from all militiamen  including those allied tofaction leaders  put the baseless stories to rest once andforever.For those individuals who chose to oppose thecreation of a representative and democraticGovernment  presumably because they are no longer atcentre stage in Somalia  they need to come to termswith reality. A generous hand has been extended to allthose people to join their peace-loving neighbours insupporting the talks  and now the Government. In fact I personally invited and met with several of them inDjibouti for discussions in order to assure them there15was a place for everyone in the new Somalia under itsproposed federal structure. Now  with a Government inplace  the ball is in their court. We can only hope thatthey will make good use of the remaining opportunityfor reconciliation and accommodation by placing thecountry first before their personal interests.The rebirth of Somalia opens unlimitedpossibilities for Somalis throughout the world torebuild their country. With the expected gradual returnto normality in the country  the diaspora will have theincentive to invest in their homeland  bringing thecapital and expertise needed to create employmentopportunities for the youth.It is to be hoped that the international communitywill mobilize emergency assistance for Somalia toenable the Government to lead the country  re-establishitself and re-create basic institutions and capacities. Inthe meantime  planning for medium- and long-termdevelopment must begin with the support ofinternational financial institutions  the donorcommunity  the United Nations and regionalorganizations.Finally  let me state with all candour that for us inDjibouti this process has strained our meagreresources  but neither our resolve nor our faith. It haschallenged our courage and perseverance  but ourcommitment has not wavered. Our people have madean exemplary effort and sacrifice.May this endurance test of our people  and of theSomali people as well  serve as a source of inspirationand mark the beginning of what could be a majoraccomplishment for the Horn of Africa  and indeed forAfrica and mankind as a whole."
"44",1920,"DMA",55,2000,"Iwish to extend my congratulations to Mr. Harri Holkeriand his country  Finland  on his election to the highoffice of President of the fifty-fifth session of theUnited Nations General Assembly. His experience andthe respect accorded him by the internationalcommunity will certainly ensure that the matters of thisAssembly are conducted with efficiency and urgency.I should also like to express my delegation'sappreciation for the very competent manner in whichhis predecessor  Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  presided overthe fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly.The recently concluded Millennium Assemblywas exceptional for the number of world leaders whoattended that historic event. The Declaration adopted atits conclusion sets forth laudable values and principlesfor the guidance of the international community.Further  it documents the goals that must be achievedand the challenges that must be met if we are tosucceed in creating a better world for all citizens of ourglobal village.But the Declaration is also a strikingly sadchronicle of the deplorable and degrading conditionsthat affect the lives of most of the world's population:debilitating and abject poverty  economic deprivation oppression and injustice  inadequate or non-existenthealth care in the face of the HIV/AIDS epidemic victimization on the basis of ethnicity  children withouteducational opportunities but with daily experiences ofhunger  lack of fresh and clean water and uncertainprospects of ever escaping depressing and unhealthysurroundings.These conditions were not newly discoveredimmediately prior to the Millennium Assembly. Indeed they have been the subjects of United Nationsresolutions at successive sessions of the GeneralAssembly in the past. While there has been someamelioration in some areas  largely through the effortsof the United Nations and its agencies  there has beennoticeable deterioration in others. The challenge thatfaces the United Nations  and the internationalcommunity in particular  is to go beyond the concernsexpressed  the affirmations and resolutions anddemonstrate in tangible and effective ways acommitment to serious engagement in a concertedeffort to bring about meaningful change in the lives ofthe many poor people among us.As the Commonwealth of Dominica and othersmall States embark on the difficult road of raising theliving standards of their citizens  we find the task mademuch more difficult by the negative impact of the twinforces of liberalization and globalization. Globalizationand trade liberalization operate to the advantage of therich and developed countries  which have the requisiteinstitutional and human resource capability and arewell placed to reap the benefits and rewards that accruefrom these processes. For small countries like my own with very limited ability to carry out properexploitation and to deal with current economic forces globalization has resulted in greater inequality andmarginalization and a widening gap between rich andpoor nations.That is the unavoidable result  since theproverbial levelling of the playing field is in realitynon-existent. And the countries benefiting from theprocess seem to have no interest in making sure that allnations  rich and poor  have an equal opportunity to beengaged in harnessing the opportunities presented byeconomic and scientific innovations and by therevolution in telecommunications and informationtechnology.Compounding this problem is the disturbing andalarming tendency of the rich and powerful to fashioninternational trade rules and organizations with thepurported intention of liberalizing trade but which inreality have resulted in creating a decisive edge ininternational commerce for themselves. Those whoadvance the concept of free trade as the most efficientvehicle for income enhancement in developingcountries continue to cling to protectionist policies forselected items of trade while simultaneously engagedin a determined effort to deny market access that30provides some small measure of special or differentialtreatment for our exports.A clear case in point is the World TradeOrganization (WTO) and what it represents for theCommonwealth of Dominica and other small banana-producing countries in the Caribbean and elsewhere.We have traditionally  over a period of 50 years exported our bananas to the European market  underspecial rules that made allowances for the particularcircumstances of small State size  or difficult terrainand high cost of production. In the interpretation andapplication of its rules  the WTO is not minded to craftdecisions that promote equity and fairness amongparties of unequal standing. But that is the logicalexpectation for an organization that was evidentlyestablished to decide disputes among equals and onwhose dispute panels  particularly at the appellatelevels  the advanced countries are predominantlyrepresented.The ruling of the WTO in the dispute with respectto the European Union's banana import regime hasresulted in economic uncertainty in the WindwardIslands  a situation made all the more damaging by thecontinuing inability of the parties to agree on a formulafor making the regime compatible with WTO rules. Mycountry holds firmly to the view that adopting either ofthe current proposals being considered to resolve thebanana dispute would result in economic stagnationand dislocation for the banana-exporting countries inthe Caribbean  particularly of course in the EasternCaribbean  as well as Jamaica  Belize and Suriname.We therefore urge the parties concerned toexplore a compromise solution that would allowDominica and other banana-producing countries tocontinue to export bananas to the European Union atprices that are fair and reasonable. Equal trade and fairprices are what we ask for  not handouts. Our sufferingfarmers ask for no more. Meanwhile  ourdiversification efforts are being accelerated while westand square and firm in support of our farmers. Mydelegation calls for a speedy resolution to this impasse as we view the application by the United States of tradesanctions against some members of the EuropeanUnion as counterproductive and not conducive toreaching a fair and negotiated settlement. Thethreatened carousel approach to imposing thosesanctions is punitive and a pressure device  unfair tothose European countries.At a time when there is a real prospect of ourlosing our market in bananas and as we explore avenueof economic diversification  our fledgling financialservices sector has been subjected  since June last year to a potentially serious attack from the Organization forEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD). TheOECD alleged that several Caribbean countries including my own  are guilty of establishing andmaintaining tax havens. These countries were alsocondemned for having competitive tax regimes and fortheir unwillingness to undertake to eliminate policiesthat the OECD unilaterally determined to be harmful toits members. The Commonwealth of Dominica believesthat the unilateral formulations contained in the OECDreport are inconsistent with international practice andare designed to impede the development of thecompetitive capacity of the Caribbean jurisdictions inthe provision of offshore financial services. We believethat international rules and practices must evolve fromgenuine consultative practices and must bedemocratically applied on the basis of acceptedprinciples and norms in the international community.We take the view that the report is simply one moreexample of small developing States being coerced intocomplying with rules  standards and practicespromulgated by advanced States to advance theprotection of their economies while ours continue todeteriorate.We are committed to the establishment ofadequate legislative and regulatory frameworksnecessary to insulate the sector from illegal activities.We are also ready to work with the Financial ActionTask Force to address any legitimate concerns theymay have. However  we do not intend to surrender oursovereign right to act in the best economic interests ofour citizens  nor will we be deterred from doing so bythreats of any kind from any quarter.While our efforts at improving our exportearnings are being undermined and our financialservices sector comes under serious scrutiny  thedevelopment programmes and strategies of theCommonwealth of Dominica continue to be affected bythe continuing decline in official developmentassistance (ODA). The expectation that foreign directinvestment would bridge the gap has not materialized notwithstanding the strides we have made in providinga climate of good governance  openness and stable democratic practice  which  we were told  were theprerequisites for investment development.31The simple truth is that the more advanceddeveloping countries have benefited disproportionatelyfrom the tremendous increase in foreign directinvestment over the last decade  with the small and lessdeveloped States receiving little or nothing at all. Theremust be an understanding that if small developingStates are to embark successfully on the road tosustainable economic development without the benefitof foreign direct investment  official developmentassistance is indispensable to that process and thedeclining trend in the provision of official developmentassistance must perforce and necessarily be reversed.The most deadly threat to our human resourcebase and to our population at large is the contagion ofHIV/AIDS. This disease takes a heavy toll not only inlives but also in social and economic terms  and thecountries most affected are the least able to deal withthe consequences. Statistics from the recent worldconference on HIV/AIDS indicate that sub-SaharanAfrica has the highest rate of infection in the world with the Caribbean coming a close second.This is not an African or Caribbean problem however. Global in scope and impact  the HIV/AIDSpandemic warrants global attention and action. TheCommonwealth of Dominica believes that as a firstimmediate step there must come into being apartnership between the pharmaceutical manufacturersand the stakeholders in the international community with the express purpose of ensuring that less costlyHIV/AIDS medication is readily available to thosemost in need. Simultaneously  there must be increasedefforts at raising awareness and consciousness of thecrisis and the preventive measures available  while adedicated commitment to the development of an AIDSvaccine must be matched by increasing funding forresearch.In 1994  the Commonwealth of Dominicaparticipated in the Global Conference on theSustainable Development of Small Island DevelopingStates and there reaffirmed our commitment tosustainable development programmes that enhance thequality of the lives of peoples  including their health well-being and safety.The task ahead of us is to ensure that themeasures and the resources of small island developingStates — the oceans  coastal environments biodiversity and human resources — are utilized in asustainable manner that will be to the advantage ofpresent and future generations  as it is ourresponsibility to preserve them. My country shareswith small island developing States the problem of thesafe disposal of solid and liquid waste. It has beenrecognized that this lack of capacity results in marinepollution and coastal degradation. Our position isconsistent with the Rio Declaration on Environmentand Development that small island developing Stateswill be constrained in meeting the challenges that facethem if they do not have the cooperation and assistanceof the international community.As the United Nations meets for the first GeneralAssembly of the new century  the delegation of theCommonwealth of Dominica wishes to address onceagain the issue of democratic representation in theUnited Nations for the people of the Republic of China.It is a concern to my delegation that the Republic ofChina  with a democratically elected Government and apopulation of 23 million  is unable to participate in ourdeliberations.The Republic of China is a model of democracyin Asia and is more than able to carry out theobligations of our Charter. Over the past few decades the Republic of China has proved itself to be a goodworld citizen  using its own economic development togenerously assist in alleviating debilitating povertythrough economic assistance programmes in manyneedy developing countries. The situation of theRepublic of China should be addressed to ensureparticipation in the work and activities of ourorganization and its agencies as a valued member ofthe international community.My delegation calls for this fifty-fifth GeneralAssembly to be a new beginning for the UnitedNations. Rejuvenated by the unprecedented sharing ofvision that we witnessed during the MillenniumSummit  let us utilize those ideas  proposals suggestions and criticisms to chart a way forward forthe United Nations that will allow it to meet the needsand challenges of this new century.Let us look towards a new vision for a future thatwill incorporate the weak and strong  the rich and poorand the developed and developing world  so that nonewill be marginalized. Let us collaborate in achievingthe objectives of the Secretary-General's millenniumreport of freedom from fear and freedom from want.Let us include all Members — developed  developingand least developed — in the decision-making process32so that all can share a future based on the premises laiddown by our forebears in the Charter of the UnitedNations."
"45",1964,"DNK",55,2000,"Allow me first toassociate myself with the statement by my colleague the French Minister for Foreign Affairs  on behalf ofthe European Union. May I also congratulate you Mr. Vice-President  and through you  PresidentHolkeri  on your election to preside over thismillennium Assembly.A few days ago  leaders from all over the worldgathered at the Millennium Summit. They gathered toreaffirm their faith in the Charter and to give directionto the United Nations in the twenty-first century. TheCharter remains as relevant as ever with its mandate topromote peace and security  create an internationalcommunity based on the rule of law  uphold respect forhuman rights and promote social development.The new millennium brings new challenges to theUnited Nations in an ever more globalized world.Increased communication between countries andpeoples reinforces the need for common norms ofsocial and economic behaviour. The global UnitedNations conferences within the last decade bear witnessto the value of the United Nations as a unique normsetting forum. The follow up conferences to the socialSummit in Copenhagen and the Beijing Conference onWomen are cases in point.These United Nations summits have advanced ourunderstanding of the interaction between peace development and human rights. The United Nationsprocess on financing for development offers anopportunity for renewed commitment and action. Therelationship between social development andpromotion of human rights is today recognized. Thebest preventive action against conflict and strife is toensure sound economic and social development basedon good governance  respect for human rights andprotection of minorities.An encouraging and innovative feature is thedecision adopted by the Economic and Social Councilin July to establish a permanent forum on indigenousissues thereby advancing the aspirations of indigenouspeoples. The Danish Government and the home ruleGovernment of Greenland welcome this recentdevelopment. We will actively support the work of thepermanent forum.I welcome the fact that the Security Council hasshown increasing attention to humanitarian issues. Theopen meeting in the Council on Africa in January gavenew prominence to the humanitarian challenges for thiscontinent. In the past year  the Council has taken upissues as diverse as AIDS in Africa  protection ofcivilians in armed conflicts and children in armedconflict. These initiatives increase our awareness of theroot causes of conflict.The international community must shoulder itsresponsibility in relation to the AIDS epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa. The rapid spread of HIV/AIDS couldseal the fate of more than 30 million Africans over thenext five years and epidemic undermines decades ofdevelopment efforts and dissolves the social texture ofnations. It could destabilize entire regions. The AIDSepidemic is not a local problem. It is a matter ofsecurity of global importance. Africa has enormouspotential but millions continue to survive on less thanone dollar a day.The growing transfer of private capital rarelyflows to the countries in Africa. We must do more tointegrate Africa into the world economy. Tradeopportunities must be improved. We must give freeaccess to the markets of industrialized countries  aswell as to products where African countries have agenuine competitive advantage.The legal framework of the World TradeOrganization (WTO) must take into account the specialdifficulties of developing countries. Trade-relatedtechnical assistance must be improved.Peace and security  we know  are fundamentalconditions for economic and social development. War internal strife and political unrest have devastated largeparts of Africa  causing untold human suffering anddestruction. No one should expect easy solutions  butwe must work together to prevent and resolve armedconflicts in Africa.We witness an increased African effort in thefield of peace and security. The internationalcommunity must support this trend through our activeinvolvement. We must assist in capacity-building byrelevant African organizations  and by backing UnitedNations peacekeeping efforts. Africa itself must createthe conditions for international involvement. Wewelcome the initiatives by the Security Council tocreate common ground for United Nationspeacekeeping operations by inviting the partiesinvolved to discussions and special sessions of theCouncil in New York.Although the Camp David talks did not bringabout an agreement in the Middle East  theyrepresented a major step forward. They helped tonarrow down differences on key issues. Abreakthrough has never before seemed so close at hand.Time  however  is quickly running out. I urge theparties to seize this historic opportunity. I salute thepolitical courage displayed by the Israeli and thePalestinian leadership in their efforts to achieve adurable solution. I welcome the recent decision by thePalestinian Central Council to defer the decision on thequestion of statehood in the interest of furthernegotiations.Democracy is a peacemaker. Democracies aremuch less prone to violent conflicts. The Secretary-General recently called attention to what he called figleaf democracies. The fig leaf of elections does not byitself turn a dictatorship into a democracy. Electionscan even lead to a backlash as frustrations rise andtensions turn into violence.Denmark increasingly turns her efforts towardsthe prevention and management of violent conflicts inline with our comprehensive engagement in developingcountries and active involvement in United Nationspeacekeeping activities. We will strengthen this abilityto react quickly and effectively.We will also continue to support regionalcooperation also when it comes to countering theuncontrolled spread of small arms. Landmines aresubstantial obstacles to development. Increased effortsby the United Nations  Governments and non-governmental organizations are necessary. Right now new momentum is needed. The second meeting ofStates Parties to the Ottawa Convention provides animportant opportunity.Peace operations are no longer a question ofmerely keeping the warring parties apart or monitoringceasefires. They are a comprehensive and complexundertaking involving disarmament  demobilization ofcombatants  supervision of elections  monitoring ofhuman rights and training of local police among others.We must enable the United Nations to adapt to the newrealities  do things better and avoid such failures ashappened in Rwanda. I fully support therecommendations in the Brahimi Report on UnitedNations peace operations. We must provide strongerpolitical and financial support to the Organization. Iwelcome the proposed shift towards the use of civilianpolice and the rule of law  as I welcome the focus onrapid deployment of military and civilian personnel.Police and judicial experts are indispensable torebuilding the economy in civil society  and their workmust be based on a solid peace-building strategy. Closecooperation between the United Nations and otherinternational organizations is called for. We mustestablish a partnership between the United Nations andregional actors.Last year the Secretary-General called uponMember States to pursue more effective policies to stop33organized mass murder and violations of human rights.I fully support this view. We cannot leave large groupsof people unaided where national authorities do notlive up to their responsibilities. Conflicts in Kosovoand East Timor raise serious questions with regard tosome of the classic principles of international law  theprinciple of State sovereignty  the principle of respectfor human rights and the principle of the non-use offorce in international relations. On the one hand  wehad a basic rule of international law incorporated intothe United Nations Charter ó that the use of force ininternational relations is prohibited unless authorizedby the Security Council or in self-defence. On the otherhand  many countries find that there is a political andmoral obligation to act in the face of atrocities causinglarge-scale human suffering within another State.There is no clear-cut solution to this dilemma.But surely no legal principle  including sovereignty can be used as a shield to commit crimes againsthumanity and other serious violations of human rights.The Security Council has a moral obligation to act onbehalf of the international community. We mustremember that the United Nations was founded  in thewords of the Charter  in order to reaffirm faith infundamental human rights. Any intervention reflects afailure of prevention. As a last resort  the internationalcommunity must have the ability to act in the face oforganized mass murder or ethnic-cleansing  even if theSecurity Council is blocked. The challenge is to keepopen the option of humanitarian intervention withoutSecurity Council authorization in extreme cases  but todo so without jeopardizing the international legal order.We must ensure that the Security Councilfunctions as effectively as possible. If not  theinfluence of the Council will be diminished. Thepermanent members of the Security Council shouldapply the right of veto only in matters of vitalimportance. Therefore  I reiterate my proposal toestablish a procedural rule; a rule according to which apermanent member of the Security Council would haveto state the reasons why it has decided to exercise itsright of veto in a given situation. Furthermore  theMember State should state on which grounds itconsiders that matters of vital importance are at stake. Ihope that this idea can be further developed and that itcan gain broad support.I have addressed new challenges and possibilitiesat the start of the new millennium. Let me end byreminding this Assembly that old challenges still needto be addressed. Weapons of mass destruction are alethal legacy of the cold war. They need our continuedattention. Certain States are still pursuing theacquisition of weapons of mass destruction andbuilding a missile capacity. There is a need for furtherimprovement of the international non-proliferationregimes. Peace  development and human rights havebeen the essentials in the work of the United Nationsfrom the very beginning. They remain essential. Theprimary responsibility for a more peaceful  prosperousand just world rests with Governments  but the UnitedNations is here to help us. The Millennium Summitconfirmed our common will to work together as trulyunited nations.I cannot leave this Assembly without expressingmy deep concern at the situation in Burma. Thetreatment of Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi is a disgrace  andI call on the regime in Burma to immediately restoreMrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's freedom of speech movement and communication."
"46",2009,"DOM",55,2000,"Representing and speaking on behalf ofthe Government of the Dominican Republic  whichsince 16 August 2000 has been presided over byMr. Hipólito Mejia on the basis of the votes cast by ourpeople for the Dominican Revolutionary Party  weshould like to reaffirm our profound commitment to theprinciples that gave life to this Organization and to theprospect for its further work as we head into a newmillennium.We should like to voice our congratulations to theSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for his havingconvened the historic Millennium Summit on the basisof the report about the role to be played by the UnitedNations in the twenty-first century  a document whichcontained an intelligent and pinpointed analysis of themost acute problems of the present and of what isahead for the international community.The Dominican Republic is convinced thatfreedom and equality for all States and for all humanbeings  without any distinctions whatsoever  constitutethe underpinnings for real peace and for harmoniousand democratic development of the internationalcommunity.The assessment of the world situation drawn up atthe Millennium Summit highlighted thatnotwithstanding the extraordinary scientific andtechnological strides made  the development incommunications media and the rapid expansion of thewealth of some countries  two thirds of mankind live inconditions which prevent freedom and equality frombeing a common denominator for all the peoples of theearth.It is all too well known that globalization is notemerging as some magic formula or a panacea to healwounds  nor as any wondrous invention of the geniusof certain sectors of the rich countries.Globalization is the continuation of a processgoing back centuries in the history of humankind andsomething which  unfortunately  on the one hand doescontribute to the progress and enrichment of some  buton the other hand still leaves us with a developed andan underdeveloped world. It is precisely because of itsunequal effects upon the peoples of the world that atthe South Summit of the Group of 77 held in Havana and at the Millennium Summit which took place in thisvery Hall  we heard with renewed strength a just callfor freedom and equality.The breadth and the dizzying speed of thechanges which globalization has triggered in recentyears have stirred the good conscience of humanity 15and  although it appears a paradox  a peacefulrebellion  albeit a distrustful one  is beginning toprotest what is seen in all this as just one more form ofthe traditional domination of the powerful over theweakest.We peoples that had been colonized  and  havinggained independence  had to live in permanent defenceof our sovereignty and our cultural identity  havedeveloped the kind of sensitivity that allows us to sortout the real consequences of certain historic processes.That explains how  faced with the effects ofinescapable globalization  we have reacted critically determined not to continue to live on the sidelines andnot to accept that we should withdraw  unable toachieve the security of a future filled with hopethrough the exercise of our free will.Globalization must be guided by the convictionthat the aspiration of a world free from upheaval can beachieved only by an equitable interdependence whichcan understand that the current imbalances caused bythe requirements and conditions imposed by certainbodies can be met by the underdeveloped countriesonly by the gradual application of free tradeagreements and the elimination of the kind ofprotectionism that stands in the way of the free accessof goods and services to the markets of the developedcountries.One single example shall suffice to illustrate theconsequences of the indiscriminate opening of themarket of an underdeveloped country. In theDominican Republic thousands and thousands ofmedium and small-sized companies have gonebankrupt because they could not compete with theavalanche of products from the highly industrializedcountries.Peoples whose asymmetry in relation to thedeveloped countries has been affirmed over centuriescannot and will not be able to adapt to beingparticipants benefiting from globalization if they do notreceive the kind of support that allows them to attaineconomic and social objectives that can contribute toovercoming their current underdevelopment. To talkabout globalization and to leave the poor countries totheir own devices to make all the efforts necessary tocome up to the speed of the wealthy countries is a crueljoke. Globalization must be imbued with an effectivespirit of solidarity and social justice. Otherwise underdeveloped humankind may find itself faced witha new version of the economic voracity that isillustrated in the fable of the shark and the sardine.We believe that these concerns are all toolegitimate and  first and foremost  foresighted. Wemust not in the future be forced to find a new word forglobalization to brand it as we branded the imperialpolicies of the past.Globalization is already doing more than give riseto concerns and exacerbate the problems of the poorcountries; it also steadily worsens the external debtsituation. How many times must we pay that debt?When will we finish paying it? We are convinced thatcertain aspects of globalization and the consequencesof external debt are two sides of the same coin. Theindifference to the harm that this ruinous debt burdendoes to the economies of poor countries makes onedoubt the existence of a true spirit of solidarity or asincere readiness to cooperate. Only forgiving that debtunder logical and favourable conditions and throughmechanisms guaranteeing effectiveness can giveunderdeveloped countries the encouragement they needto embark on the path into the new era.Moreover  current price of oil is a further sourceof distress for those who depend on it for energyproduction. This year's oil bill for the DominicanRepublic will be more than $500 million  whichaccounts for some 15 per cent of our national budget.This situation — one shared by many other peoples —demands consideration founded on internationalsolidarity and cooperation.When we in the Dominican Republic speak ofsolidarity and cooperation  we cannot but speak ofHaiti. Because we are adjacent to that fraternal people we know how much it needs the generous  sustainedsupport of the international community. As thePresident of the Dominican Republic  Mr. HipólitoMejia  said at the Millennium Summit  the DominicanRepublic cannot alone bear the present social burden ofhundreds of thousands of Haitian citizens. TheDominican Republic therefore wants a solution inwhich the international community would be an activeparticipant  one that must be based on human rightsand that must be implemented in accordance with thenorms and principles that must govern a soundmigration policy.But let no one think that we have come here togrumble and to use the General Assembly as a wailingwall. That is by no means true. The Government of the16Dominican Republic is absolutely convinced that it isDominican society itself that must make the greatesteffort to achieve development. Mindful of itsresponsibilities  therefore  the Government of theDominican Republic accepts the challenge ofglobalization  because it knows that the first thing is toaddress the priorities of development  and because itknows also that its greatest efforts must go towardsestablishing social justice to resolve problems ofeducation  health  the environment  the equality of menand women  children  eliminating poverty  ending drugtrafficking  nutrition and steady improvement in humanrights and civil liberties.Fortunately for many of the world's peoples developed countries and international bodies largelyunderstand that the point of globalization must not beto unleash market forces and to bring aboutprotectionism  production subsidies and technicalregulation  because such obstacles can only contributeto widening the gulf between rich and poor. Thosecountries and organizations are working togethersincerely to ensure that the benefits of this process willbe shared through cooperation involving thecomprehensive development of peoples. It was in thatspirit and with those concerns in mind that the UnitedNations proposed the 2001 High-levelIntergovernmental Event on Financing forDevelopment.The Dominican Republic has strengthened its tieswith the Caribbean  with Central America and withother areas of integration  and we are making ourcontribution to enhance the possibilities fornegotiations  access to foreign markets  technologyexchanges and cultural enrichment. Moreover  webelieve that South-South cooperation is anindispensable complement to growth-orientedprogrammes undertaken with developing countries.I turn now to the need to reform the Charter ofthe Organization. Much has happened since 1945. Withundeniable skill  the United Nations bodies of that timedealt with the tasks they faced in the wake of theSecond World War. But that was then; now  thosebodies do not reflect the realities of a new internationalcommunity that is larger and more demanding ofdemocratic development.Reform of the Security Council is imperative; theDominican Republic considers that it must take placein keeping with the sovereign equality of States equitable geographical distribution and the varyinglevels of development of peoples. We are convincedthat an increase in the number of both permanent andnon-permanent members  carried out on the basis ofthose principles  would enable the General Assembly toplay its role as the organ that is truly representative ofinternational democracy.I turn now the establishment of the InternationalCriminal Court  which was a major event. We hope thatthe Court will be able to mete out justice not only toheads of State  heads of Government and officials whocommit war crimes  crimes against humanity or crimesagainst citizens  but also to those who engage inadministrative corruption and theft of State property something that certainly constitutes a crime in manycountries because of the economic and moral harm itcauses to their peoples.Because of the desire of the Dominican Republicto be consistent with the historic tradition of itsinternational relations  it wishes to reaffirm its supportfor the Republic of China in its logical and justaspiration to rejoin the Organization  of which it was aprominent Member for many years. Here  our positionreflects a duty born of conscience  not a position thatwould diminish the rights that the United Nations hasrecognized others to have.Also linked to our historic tradition is theprinciple of national sovereignty. Since it wonindependence on 27 February 1844  the DominicanRepublic has held the right of self-determination as anunshakeable article of faith. Thus  when there is talk ofalso enshrining humanitarian intervention as a right  wefind ourselves faced with a situation that demandsclear-cut and precise definitions. We request this bodyto devote to this issue the attention it deserves so thatall its Members will participate in clearing up such aworrisome matter.Finally  the Dominican Republic wishes toexpress its conviction that the dialogue initiated by theMillennium Summit and the positions expressed in theGeneral Assembly will contribute positively tostrengthening efforts for peace and brotherhood  whichare the essence of the spirit of the United NationsCharter.17"
"47",2056,"DZA",55,2000,"Ishould like first of all  on my own behalf and that ofthe Algerian delegation  to convey to Mr. Holkeriheartfelt congratulations on his election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-fifthsession. I wish him every success in discharging hisnoble duties. The choice of Mr. Holkeri as President isa tribute to his personal qualities and to the experienceof his country  Finland  with which we enjoy a firmfriendship.I should also like to take this opportunity toconvey to his predecessor  Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  theForeign Minister of Namibia  our deep appreciationand gratitude for the great effort he made during hispresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourthsession.Finally  I should like to salute the spirit ofinitiative and commitment shown by our Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  the head of the Secretariat and commend his sincere and tireless work to reformthe Organization and to give it a new dynamism so asto prepare it to meet the challenge of the enormouschanges in international relations.I should also like to welcome the State of Tuvaluas a new Member of our Organization.Just a few days ago  the United Nations hosted apolitical event that was without precedent since theOrganization was created: the Millennium Summit.Because of a host of fast-paced developments thatoccurred in international relations  we  the peoples ofthe United Nations  must take time at this juncture ofhistory to organize a dialogue to discuss the shape ofthe new emerging world order and the effects on us  thepeoples  the States and the United Nations  therepository of our collective hopes and aspirations.The world has changed in a very short time froma system with clearly defined parameters to a systemwhere political and economic reference points aresorely lacking. It is a system defined by nebulousphenomena  which evolve according to rules set byforces that refuse  in the name of globalization  toaccept any form of guidance or collective democraticoversight. It is no surprise that globalization isincreasing the suspicions and fears of the developingcountries vis-à-vis the evolving new world order. Thecurrent state of international relations  marked byinjustice and imbalance  will inevitably get worsebecause of the unbridled process of globalization.It is because of this that the Millennium Summitforcefully proclaimed the need to reinvigorate theUnited Nations and to galvanize its role  since it is the18refuge of the weak and the marginalized. The massivepresence of the leaders of the whole world at theSummit was irrefutable proof of the commitment of thepeoples and nations of the world to the United Nationsand to the principles and purposes it embodies. TheUnited Nations is the only forum built on the ideals andreference points shared by mankind as a whole  markedby universality and globality in its missions andprerogatives.Certainly the United Nations is facing today newchallenges caused by rapid  profound and sometimessurprising changes in international affairs. No onedenies the fact that it needs to be radically reformed inorder to prepare it and adapt it effectively to meetcurrent and future challenges and to manage andredress the contradictions of international relations.Security Council reform and expansion of itsmembership are urgent matters  because this importantbody clearly lacks the necessary representativity togive legitimacy and efficiency to its decisions andactions.Likewise  consolidation of democracy andinternational relations  if it is to be truly meaningful must involve the enhancement of the GeneralAssembly and the establishment of its role as theprincipal source of international law  as well asoversight over the three principal organs  in keepingwith the United Nations Charter. Accordingly marginalization of the Assembly  when it comes tomajor questions such as the maintenance ofinternational peace and security  does not in any wayallow the overwhelming majority of nations tocontribute to the decision-making process ininternational affairs.Opening the United Nations to the outside worldis a necessity dictated by changes in the internationalcommunity and the demands of our times. By involvingcivil society in its work  the United Nations willbenefit from the considerable contribution that non-governmental partners can provide in meeting theneeds of countries in matters of development particularly in the areas of education  health andhousing. But this partnership cannot be at the expenseof the purposes and principles of the United Nations nor the independence of its decisions.It is in the context of this vision that we state ourposition on humanitarian intervention. For us it is aquestion not of whether or not it is acceptable tointervene in humanitarian disasters  but  rather  of legaland political parameters that should govern anydecision on this matter. We therefore demand thatterms of reference be clearly and precisely established that they should be democratically adopted in a contextof transparency and that they should effectively reflectthe will of the community of nations. They must bebased on principles of solidarity and justice  ruling outany forms of selectivity  special treatment or doublestandards.Experience has shown that the internationalcommunity has found in the United Nations aframework that allows for considerable progress to bemade with regard to security and cooperation. In thearea of disarmament  for example  thanks to theavailable frameworks for negotiation and dialogue  theOrganization has been able to realize considerableachievements  such as the signing of many conventionson weapons of mass destruction and the success of the2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty onthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) presided over by Algeria.The United Nations has also provided aframework to coordinate international efforts to dealwith new dangers that pose a threat to internationalpeace and security  such as terrorism  organized crime and drug and arms trafficking. On the subject ofterrorism  the international community has embarkedon a process of implementing its strategy to combatthis scourge and to prevent it. The United Nations andregional groups have adopted legal instruments thatsupplement international laws dealing with anti-terrorist actions. We hope that these achievements willbe enhanced by the adoption of a comprehensiveinternational convention  to be considered a political legal and moral international covenant  to combatterrorism in all its forms and manifestations.Algeria is keen that its relations within itspolitical and geographical spheres be governed by avision of the future that goes beyond short-terminteractions or ephemeral motives. In our policytowards the peoples and countries with which we haverelations of neighbourliness  geography and commonheritage  we want to consolidate the principle ofdialogue and consultation and develop cooperation andsolidarity in keeping with the demands of goodneighbourliness  common destiny  mutual interest mutual trust and non-interference in the internal affairsof States.19Regarding the Arab Maghreb region  Algeria'scommitment to build a unified  stable and prosperousMaghreb is based on our conviction that Maghreb unityis a strategic option dictated by the aspirations of thepeoples of the region and by the current internationalsituation  which encourages integration and theformation of blocs. Algeria is prepared today to workwith its Maghreb partners to reactivate the process onthe basis of an objective thorough analysis of commonMaghreb action according to a rigorous and pragmaticmethodology that seeks to maximize thecomplementarities of the countries of the region andthat ensures gradual integration  taking into account theprinciples of equity and balance of interests.It is on the basis of this vision that Algeria hasspared no effort to help find a just and lasting solutionto the problem of Western Sahara. Algeria's support forthe United Nations settlement plan is based on ourcommitment to preserve the security and stability ofthe region  without  however  rejecting the principle ofthe right of peoples to self-determination. Thesettlement plan  which was supported by both sides —Morocco and the POLISARIO Front — and by theinternational community  remains the practical realistic option that will guarantee a just and lastingsolution to this issue. Today the settlement plan is at adelicate stage  and the international community  whichhas already made a considerable effort to implement it must give it even more attention and more support.Thanks to the efforts of the Secretary-General and hisPersonal Envoy  Mr. James Baker  and the cooperationof both sides  the United Nations Mission for theReferendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) hasresolved the difficulties that for so long preventedimplementation of the plan. Today  there is no reason todelay or to block the referendum process.My country is convinced of the interdependenceof the interests of the States and peoples on both shoresof the Mediterranean Sea. We therefore reaffirm ourcommitment to the Euro-Mediterranean process  whichprovides a promising framework for the promotion ofdialogue and consultation among the countries of theregion and opens up great prospects for understanding intercultural exchange and improvement of partnershipfor the benefit of all peoples.The Middle East region has seen somedevelopments this year that have had an importantimpact on the peace process. The question of Palestine which is at the heart of the Arab-Israeli conflict  is at adelicate stage. That means that the internationalcommunity must mobilize even further in order tomove the peace talks forward. Algeria reiterates itssupport for the Palestinian people and salutes theirstruggle for recovering their legitimate rights including the right to establish their own independentState with Al-Quds as its capital.Algeria would also like to reaffirm its support forthe fraternal Syrian people and its right to recover theoccupied Golan.We express our profound satisfaction and pride atLebanon's regaining its sovereignty over all itsterritory.Algeria once again reaffirms the need to lift theembargo that has hit the fraternal Iraqi people so hard.We also call for a final lifting of the sanctionsthat continue to penalize the fraternal peoples of Libyaand the Sudan.Africa is undergoing profound changes that areopening up new vistas for the peoples and countries ofthat continent. Those changes have been brought aboutby the serious and determined will of Africans to freethemselves from the burdens of the past and by theiraspiration to join in the process of change that issweeping our world today. Democracy is gainingground daily as the mode of governance for the vastmajority of societies in Africa. The State of law andrespect for human rights are becoming embedded inAfrican societies. That tendency is strikingly reflectedin the historic decision by the 1999 Organization ofAfrican Unity (OAU) Assembly of Heads of State andGovernment no longer to recognize any anti-constitutional changes. That was a promising sign forthe establishment of a democratic culture in Africa.At the economic level  African countries havewasted no time in joining the world trend towards amarket economy and in creating the necessaryconditions to promote free trade and investment.With regard to the conflicts that have devastatedthe continent and continue to cause humanitariandisasters and to tarnish Africa's prestige  thecontinent's leaders are now using preventive diplomacyand their own skills in mediating and settling conflict.Along the same lines  the OAU's Mechanism forConflict Prevention  Management and Resolution isbeing reinforced as the authority of reference toprovide a framework for dialogue and conflict20prevention. As a result of those efforts  we see signs ofeasing in various conflicts in some parts of Africa.Through its chairmanship of the OAU last year  mycountry made great efforts to resolve some of thoseconflicts and to limit their scale.Algeria's efforts were successful in the case ofthe conflict between two neighbours  Ethiopia andEritrea  where the Algiers Agreement on Cessation ofHostilities doused the fire of that destructive warbetween two fraternal peoples. The Agreement nowoffers real prospects for a just and lasting settlement ofthe border dispute between the two countries.Algeria has also stepped up its initiatives to endthe conflict in the sisterly nation of the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo. In coordination andconsultation with the countries of the region concernedand with the United Nations  President AbdelazizBouteflika has intensified his efforts with the parties urging them to find a peaceful and negotiated solutionin order to spare the peoples of that country any furthersuffering and preserve its unity and territorial integrity.Today  more than a year since the Lusaka Agreement we can only view with regret the reversals that havetaken place in the peace process in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo. Those setbacks have led to adeferment by the United Nations of the deployment ofits peacekeeping mission.UNITA's continued defiance of the internationalcommunity in Angola and its failure to comply with thecommitments it made in the peace process continue toinflict the disastrous consequences of an endless waron the people of Angola. While reaffirming UNITA'sresponsibility for the ongoing war in that country  wenote with satisfaction the new effectiveness ofsanctions on that rebel group. We reiterate the need forcomplete compliance by any means necessary to makethe rebel elements comply with international law andhonour their commitments under the LusakaAgreement.The solidarity expressed by the internationalcommunity for the efforts of the leaders of SierraLeone to restore peace and security must beaccompanied by a tough attitude towards the criminalelements guilty of murder and despicable acts againstcivilians. Those acts have not spared even members ofthe United Nations Mission.While we reaffirm the fundamental role of theUnited Nations and the Security Council in themaintenance of international peace and security  wecontinue to stress the need for the Security Council todemonstrate the same effectiveness and speed of actionwith regard to conflicts in Africa as it does inconnection with conflicts in other regions of the world.In that regard  I would like to express our desire thatthe General Assembly give the necessary attention andin-depth consideration to the Brahimi report'srecommendations on peacekeeping operations  and thatit implement those recommendations so as to make theUnited Nations more effective in this essential area ofmaintaining international peace and security.The contrasts that exist in today's world can beseen very clearly in the economic and social situationof the world. Humanity has never before achieved sucha level of technological development. Thatdevelopment now makes it possible to meet basichuman needs economically  socially and culturally.However  some segments of humanity continue tosuffer the most abject forms of poverty and destitution.The Secretary-General's report to the MillenniumSummit contains a clear formulation of thosecontradictions  which do us no credit as a civilizedsociety that aspires to preserve human dignity and toprotect the rights of those whose rights have beenwrested from them.Mr. Kofi Annan also recognized in his report thatthe benefits of globalization remain limited to a smallgroup of people. That fact reinforces our conviction ofthe need to accelerate the restructuring of internationalrelations and our insistence on the need for a seriousand comprehensive dialogue between the North and theSouth to find solutions for the imbalances that exist inthe international financial and trade systems.It is time to tackle international economicrelations from the standpoint of humankind's needs anddignity rather than from the standpoint of market forcesalone  because experience has proved that such forcesdo not accord the necessary importance to socialissues. If there is one area in which we must translateinto reality the values of solidarity upon which theUnited Nations was founded and the interdependencewhich marks international relations  it is that ofcombating poverty  ignorance and epidemics.Effective and unified tackling of the problem ofsustainable development in the third world necessarilyentails settling the problem of debt  revivingcooperation for development  promoting investments21and opening up the markets of the North to theproducts and commodities of the South.We are meeting today for the last session of theGeneral Assembly in our century  which has beenmarked by many events  a century in which the horrorof destructive wars was mingled with the joy of peaceand détente  a century marked by a struggle betweenhope and resignation  where it became evident thatpeople are at once capable of the most abject acts andthe most useful kinds of actions.We leave behind a century and usher in another hopeful that humankind will learn from the past andwill demonstrate the necessary determination to avoidmaking the same mistakes  for which we have paidsuch a high price."
"48",2103,"ECU",55,2000,"At the outset  I wish to convey to thePresident my congratulations on his election to leadthis session of the General Assembly. He represents acountry that shares with mine the ideals and principlesthat favour peace  culture  human rights  solidarity andunderstanding.I hail the entrance of Tuvalu into ourOrganization  and I congratulate the Minister forForeign Affairs of Namibia  Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  onthe skilful and intelligent manner in which theimportant work of the last session of the GeneralAssembly.The political events that occurred in the world inthe last decade speeded up changes on the internationalscene  ushering in new global structures and processes.The disappearance of the ideological underpinnings ofthe cold war produced profound transformations thatchanged the geopolitical foundations that had prevailedin the twentieth century.The consolidation of large economic blocs andthe technological revolution have had a palpableimpact on the pace of economic and social changethroughout the world. The free market and the newtechnologies have favoured competition and havegenerated the transnational expansion of banking andfinance  which has fundamentally changed the way theworld economy works.In this global context  countries are joining thetrends of globalization from very different levels ofdevelopment  and consequently  the opportunities andthe effects of these new processes turn out to beextremely unequal. Technological  financial andproductive disparities have deepened between thedeveloping countries and the industrialized nations where most of this potential is concentrated.Notwithstanding the efforts of countries to adapt to andbecome integrated into a new internationalenvironment  inequities have grown and socialproblems have mushroomed in an environment ofdeteriorating international cooperation.The Millennium Summit  which opened thissession of the General Assembly  proved to be ahistoric opportunity to consider in depth the challengesinherent in the new global trends  which are generatinga new international order  with its risks and itspotential for peace and security  economic growth sustainable development and human security. It hasbecome clear in the light of these realities that nocountry can remain on the sidelines or be insulatedfrom the major global changes  and that all States mustface the great challenge of working together to regulatethe new processes within a universal endeavour tochannel the process of development to secure thebenefits of globalization  while meeting the needs ofthe peoples.Within this context of international responsibilityas a priority  the United Nations has a dominant role toplay  as a universal forum for States to work togetherfor ideals and objectives common to all peoples and tostimulate international cooperation for sustainabledevelopment and poverty eradication.In the new century  the Organization's potential inworld affairs must be fully used. Ecuador trusts in aneffective multilateral system whereby global norms forthe era of globalization are created in a democratic participatory and systematic manner. With thatobjective  the Summit acknowledged the representativenature of the United Nations in the fulfilment of itsessential goals  within the framework of the new globalprocesses and the challenges of the twenty-firstcentury.The interdependence of international political andeconomic problems becomes significant in this greattask  creating a complex mix of matters to beconsidered on the international agenda of this globalinstitution  the United Nations  which  because of itslegitimacy  has the responsibility for adoptingcoordinated policies and implementing guidelines thatensure the efficiency and timeliness of thisOrganization's response to events and phenomenaoccurring in the world that directly affect internationalsecurity and stability.I wish to reiterate my congratulations to theSecretary-General on his valuable contribution to thework of this Millennium Assembly through thepresentation of his analytical report on the role of theUnited Nations in the twenty-first century. His thoughtsare extremely useful in considering the role and thechallenges of the United Nations in the years ahead.I must also highlight the contribution of the LatinAmerican countries to the work of the Millennium18Assembly through the adoption of the CartagenaDeclaration by the heads of State or Government of theRio Group  and the contribution of the South Summitand the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  groupsof which Ecuador is a member.Ecuador shares the view regarding the advantagesand opportunities relating to the United Nationsinfluencing the management of international publicaffairs and cultivating the commitment of all actors toapproach the new global processes and structures fromthe perspective of human development.Globalization and poverty must be tackled withthe priority that their profound consequences forhuman development require. The trends ofglobalization today appear merely as an economicprocess  dehumanized and lacking in socialdimensions. This process concerns itself with freetrade  competition and new information technologies without an approach that guarantees that it works forpeople and that opportunities for progress and thebenefits of the process will be distributed worldwide to all countries.Ecuador is experiencing one of the most acutecrises of its history. Its effects have had a grave impacton State institutions and have led to instability in theprocess of consolidating democracy. Domestic andforeign factors combined in recent years havecontributed to aggravating the crisis throughmacroeconomic imbalances that have severely batteredthe economy and people of Ecuador. In this context ofenormous difficulties  the conditions Ecuador hadnegotiated for its foreign debt became extremelydifficult to meet. Those factors  together with theadjustment measures taken to confront the crisis  havehad a considerable impact on poverty.This global forum must be aware of the enormousdifficulties imposed on highly indebted poor countriesboth by disproportionate external debt servicing and bythe continuing obstacles to their export products  aswell as by the fluctuations in the international financialsystem that work against national efforts to createconditions of economic stability and sustainabledevelopment. In meeting its goal of bringing about ajust and equitable international order  the GeneralAssembly should find means to reduce the externaldebt of developing countries  including heavilyindebted medium-income countries affected by naturaldisasters.Ecuador has made great efforts to find a just andlasting solution to the problem of the excessive burdenof foreign debt. Last August it took a first step inrenegotiating the Brady debt segment  and it concludedits negotiations with the Paris Club last week. We trustthat understanding and above all fairness will mark thecontinuation of this process so that a definitive solutionmay be found for the problem of external debt  whichis crushing developing countries and hindering theimplementation of priority social programmes in theareas of health  education and employment. Therestraining effect of debt is undoubtedly one of themain obstacles in the fight to reduce poverty and attainthe goals set in this area by 2015.It is necessary to have an economic andinstitutional order that provides outlets to countrieswith small economies  which are the most vulnerableand likely to be affected by extreme crises.Ecuador  committed to overall nationaldevelopment  resolutely supports United Nationsactivities implementing financial and technicalcooperation in support of countries' national efforts topromote sustainable development in order to bringabout a better future for all peoples. The UnitedNations Development Programme (UNDP) plays a rolein that task as the main operational tool for the effortsof the Organization in support of national plans andpriorities to alleviate poverty  contribute to democraticgovernance and strengthen national capacities for thebenefit of human development. I appeal to theinternational community to ensure that the MillenniumAssembly gives resolute political backing to UNDP asthe central instrument for the overall management ofdevelopment in the twenty-first century  and to ensurethat the Programme has the financial strength necessaryto fully enable it to carry out its operational activities.The situation of international trade also deservesour priority attention  as it has a direct influence on theeconomic and social activities of nations. We call forthe elimination of trade barriers and obstacles  anddemand the application of norms that will make itpossible to carry out trade in an open  predictable andequitable way. In accordance with our long-standingtradition of integration  we support the strengthening ofthe Andean Community and its increased internationaloutreach  in particular with regard to its relations withthe Southern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR) the European Union  Russia and the Pacific Basin and19in the context of negotiations to create a free trade areaof the Americas.Ecuador shares the international community'sconcern over the continued degradation of naturalresources  the threats to the environment and theinadequate compliance with the commitments made atthe 1992 Earth Summit on sustainable development.Given its economic  social and environmentalimplications  we should insist on the need to givepriority to sustainable development as a cross-cuttingfactor in international relations  with regard both topolicies and cooperation. There is an imperative needto incorporate appropriate environmental technologiesand to develop sustainable production patterns in orderto strengthen national scientific and technologicalcapabilities. The Government of Ecuador hasincorporated the concept of sustainable developmentinto its national legislation  promoted the adoption ofpolicies and action plans in that context andstrengthened its own environmental authority.The phenomenon of drug trafficking  with itsglobal effects  is another matter for the internationalcommunity  as it respects neither borders nor nationsand poses widespread dangers to society. Drugtrafficking has developed a supranational system inwhich no particular nation can be viewed as the rootcause of the problem. It is essential that we recognizethe principle of shared responsibility in coping with thereality of this phenomenon  and that we take thenecessary international steps to resolve it. Abiding bythis universal commitment  which has already beenrecognized in the 1988 Convention against IllegalTraffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances is fundamental in our fight against this global problem one of the challenges confronting humankind.At the dawn of the twenty-first century  peace security and disarmament constitute other prioritychallenges that the United Nations will continue toface. Ecuador advocates the peaceful resolution ofinternational disputes and condemns the threat and useof force in relations between States  as we areconvinced that a system of peace and trust amongnations must be based on the peaceful resolution ofdisputes and on specific disarmament measures in thecontext of the purposes and principles of the Charter ofthe United Nations and the norms of international law.In its pursuit of the goals of peace and security the Security Council bears primary responsibility forthe maintenance and restoration of international peace.Ecuador deems it a priority  in terms of the renewal ofthe United Nations  to reform the Council'scomposition and methods of work. The Council'smission makes it vital that we correct the currentimbalances in the Council's composition  improve itsdecision-making machinery and lend greatertransparency to its methods of work.Another challenge for the United Nationsconcerns the role and the strengthening ofpeacekeeping operations. In recent years humankindhas witnessed the exacerbation of regional conflictsand the negative consequences of war in various partsof the globe. It is vital that joint action in theframework of this world Organization be strengthened so that the use of force  when absolutely necessary  canbe applied in strict conformity with Chapter VII of theCharter. In this way the United Nations will be able toretain the international credibility it requires as thelegitimate forum for  and agent of  collective action topromote international peace and security.One of the pillars of democracy in any society isstrict respect for human rights  the defence andprotection of which are the responsibility not only ofeach and every State but also of the internationalcommunity. The international community  therefore can no longer remain silent or indifferent; it must react in a legitimate manner  to the massive violations of therights of entire peoples that were perpetrated in thefinal years of the past century  which are a source ofshame for humankind. Furthermore  it is totallyunacceptable for one or more States to seek torepresent the international community and to apply unilaterally and by force  a non-existent “right tointerference” on the basis of humanitarianconsiderations.In 1998 Ecuador promulgated a national humanrights plan with a broad and democratic perspective.The plan  which takes an integrated approach to thehuman being  was devised and prepared through anationwide consultative process  with the fullinvolvement of civil society and the public authorities.In this context  the right to development constitutes alegitimate aspiration that must be appropriately anddecisively spurred forward by the United Nations.Ecuador  as a country that is acutely vulnerable toa variety of natural disasters  accords particularimportance to the role of the United Nations system in20the prevention  mitigation and reduction of the effectsof such disasters  among them the impact of the ElNiño phenomenon. In the quest to move forward withresearch on this phenomenon — which in 1997 and1998 affected not only the South Pacific region butother areas of the world as well — the GeneralAssembly and the Economic and Social Council lenttheir support to the establishment of an InternationalCentre for the Research of the El Niño Phenomenon  inthe city of Guayaqu'l  in Ecuador. I am pleased toinform the Assembly that my Government  as hostcountry  has taken the steps necessary to proceed withthe establishment of that Centre in the next fewmonths  as it is convinced of the scientific contributionthat such a United Nations-sponsored instrument canmake to humankind.Ecuador reaffirms its commitment tomultilateralism and to the ideals that inspired thefounding of the United Nations. The challenges of thetwenty-first century must be confronted by allcountries jointly and in a spirit of solidarity. TheMember States must see to it that this session of theAssembly makes a historic contribution to a universalendeavour to resolve global problems and to strengthencollective security. The achievements of the UnitedNations in this new century will hinge on aconstructive spirit of solidarity on the part of all peace-loving nations."
"49",2148,"EGY",55,2000,"It is agreat pleasure for me to convey through you  Sir  to thePresident of the General Assembly our sincerecongratulations upon his election. I am confident thathe will lead the work of this Millennium Assemblymost ably.I should also like to express our sincereappreciation to his predecessor  Mr. Gurirab  theForeign Minister of Namibia  for his exceptionalleadership of the fifty-fourth session.May I also express our high esteem for theSecretary-General for his most efficient preparation forboth the Millennium Summit and Assembly. Weappreciate his efforts to maintain and promote the roleof the Organization and to strengthen its effectivenessand credibility.The convening of the Millennium Summit andAssembly is an important milestone in the internationalsystem and the future of the United Nations. The twooccasions constitute a unique forum to review the stateof the world and its developments and to take stock ofthe performance of the Organization so as to enable itto occupy its central place in the international systemand hence lead the movement of change on the basis ofa general consensus and a meeting of all minds.The goal of the establishment of a stable andeffective system of collective security through dialogueand cooperation in the context of internationaldemocracy has been one of the most importantobjectives of the United Nations and those of theinternational community. It is thus necessary to allowthe United Nations to achieve its objectives byadapting its work to the current international variablesthat must take the United Nations seriously. This mightvery well be the thrust of the Secretary-General'sreport to the Millennium Assembly.In our opinion  the first step down this road is toagree on a broad modern definition of collectivesecurity in the coming decades. Security in its mostsimple and realistic definition is based on three basicand organically linked rights  namely  the right tosafety and stability and avoidance of the scourges ofwar  mass destruction and armed conflicts  the right todevelopment and to a decent life free from poverty destitution and want and the right to live in a healthyenvironment free from pollution  disease and negativesocial phenomena. A cursory glance at the state ofthose three rights would reveal that during the lastdecade of international transformations they havebecome exposed to new threats  while existing oneshave been exacerbated in a manner threatening graverepercussions.After the end of the cold war and the end oftensions between the two super-Powers  internationalpeace became exposed to a new kind of threat  thethreat resulting from the disintegration of some States the collapse of their national structures and thevictimization of their people due to internal strife andnegative foreign intervention.Globalization  world market  the information andcommunications revolution and the emergence of newkinds of economic activities all hold the promise ofunlimited progress  yet they carry with them thedangers of widening the development gap between thedeveloped and developing world.As for a healthy environment  whole continentsare suffering from epidemics  environmentaldegradation  backwardness and the spread of ethnicwars as well as the increased tragedies of refugees.Africa is the region most affected by that horribletriangle  armed civil conflicts  poverty and economicbackwardness  degraded environment  natural disasters deadly diseases and epidemics. There is a belt oftension encircling the continent and economicdifficulties and problems continue. Africa has thusreached an untenable situation that requires immediateand firm attention in order to help it extricate itselffrom that quagmire.I must reiterate in this regard that the AfricanStates  through the Organization of African Unity(OAU) and other groupings  are discharging theirresponsibilities as best they can. They are takingnecessary measures and steps to place themselves onthe right path towards a better future. Special mentionshould be made here of the OAU Mechanism forconflict resolution  the efforts to strengthenpeacekeeping capabilities through subregionalgroupings and the establishment of common marketsand economic groupings  such as the Common Marketfor Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA)  theSouthern African Development Community (SADC)and the Economic Community of West African States(ECOWAS). Our continent is moving towards a formof unity on the basis of the resolutions of the recentLomÈ summit  which will be followed up at theupcoming Sirte summit.An agreement was recently concluded in Arushaon the settlement of the Burundi conflict. A newPresident of Somalia  Mr. Abdi Kassim Salad Hassan was elected after the constructive efforts of theGovernment of sisterly Djibouti. There are effortsunder way in the Great Lakes region. All theseexamples prove Africa's ability to deal on its own withsome of its problems. Yet it cannot be left alonewithout the support of the international community particularly in the field of peacekeeping and peace-making. The United Nations must play its full role inthat field.Meeting the new challenges faced by theinternational community and achieving the goal ofestablishing an effective system of collective securityfor future generations require  as I mentioned earlier improving the United Nations performance andadapting it to the demands of these goals. In hismessage to the Millennium Summit last week President Mubarak stressed the need to pay specialattention to the maintenance of international peace andto support efforts for development  poverty eliminationand narrowing the widening gap between the rich andthe poor in our world.Allow me to address these priorities and to stresstheir linkage to a number of important subjects andnecessary steps. First  there is an urgent need tostrengthen and reform the United Nations in general.There is a similar need to reform and restructure theSecurity Council and to enhance its credibility. We aredetermined to continue our contribution to the currentdialogue on a comprehensive and balanced packagedeal on the expansion of both the permanent and non-permanent membership of the Council. This wouldenable the Council to be more equitably representative.It would also reflect the overwhelming majority of thedeveloping countries  members of the Organization.We are fully committed to the positions of theNon-Aligned Movement and the Organization ofAfrican Unity (OAU) in this regard. We reiterate theneed for expansion of the Council to be accompaniedby reform of its working methods and a revision of theuse of the veto power  with a view to rationalizing it.I wish to stress here what I mentioned earlier that Egypt has a long history of regional andinternational contributions. It plays a significant roleon the African  Arab and Islamic levels  as well as inthe Middle East and among the developing countries19and emerging economies. In addition  Egypt has mademany contributions to support United Nations activitiesand achieve its objectives. It has also contributed to theOrganization's peacekeeping operations. All this makesEgypt eminently eligible and qualified to shoulder theresponsibilities of permanent membership in anexpanded Security Council  within the frameworksuggested by the African heads of State andGovernment since 1997.Second  there is an equally urgent need to restorethe role of the General Assembly in the maintenance ofpeace  in accordance with the provisions of the Charter especially when the Security Council fails to dischargeits primary responsibility in this regard. This wouldensure that any collective actions or measures enjoyedthe international legitimacy represented by theOrganization. There is a need to further develop UnitedNations peacekeeping operations and provide themwith a rapid deployment capability. There is also aneed for concerted efforts to increase the capacity ofStates  particularly African States  to participate inUnited Nations peacekeeping operations  or those ofregional and subregional organizations which aremandated and financed by the United Nations. Egyptwill address these important issues when the GeneralAssembly considers the Brahimi report (A/55/305).These considerations must be kept in mind whenwe address how to develop the conceptual and practicalframework of peacemaking and peacekeeping. Newideas  such as humanitarian intervention and thepreventive deployment of forces  have  since the lastsession  begun to gain currency. We have called  andcontinue to call  for discussion of those ideas with thehighest degree of frankness and transparency. Thoseideas impinge on the concept of sovereignty. Sometend to belittle the value and importance of sovereigntywhen the matter pertains to the sovereignty of others.Those very same States tend also to consider itsacrosanct and inviolable when the matter pertains totheir own sovereignty.Third  the sanctions regime  as one of thecomponent parts of the measures taken within thecurrent system of collective security  needs a thoroughreview. Sanctions cannot last indefinitely. They mustnot cause human suffering to tens of millions of peopleor result in massive and destructive harm to theeconomic infrastructures or social fabric of States.Sanctions must not lead to the creation of angrygenerations who will continue to be embittered by theirsuffering  even after these actions are lifted.Fourth  there is a need to recognize theimportance of continued  serious consideration of thequestion of disarmament  particularly nucleardisarmament  which is the most destructive and posesthe greatest threats. The priority of nucleardisarmament must not be overshadowed by theincreased attention paid to small arms  light weaponsand anti-personnel landmines. This is not to say that wedo not recognize the importance of these subjects orthe need to deal with them comprehensively andappropriately. In this regard  we reaffirm Egypt'sinitiatives for the elimination of weapons of massdestruction  including nuclear weapons. We welcomethe results of the sixth Review Conference of theParties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons (NPT) in the field of nucleardisarmament in general. We welcome in particular theConference's recognition of the specificity of thesituation in the Middle East and its reaffirmation of thecontinued validity and importance of implementing theresolutions on the Middle East adopted by the NPTReview and Extension Conference in 1995.Fifth  with the accelerated pace of globalizationand trade liberalization  the gap between the rich andpoor countries is widening in a manner that threatensgrave dangers. The comparison between patterns ofproduction and consumption and standards of living inthe developing and developed worlds is both stark andshocking. Narrowing this gap and correcting thisimbalance in the international structure is not merely amoral obligation  but is vital. An internationalpartnership must be established to achieve thisobjective.The call for social justice within States must beaccompanied by a similar call for justice in sharing thebenefits of progress  globalization  the informationtechnology and communications revolution and tradeliberalization among members of the internationalfamily in the North and the South alike. We truly needto give globalization a human face and an equilibriumthat will enable it to contribute to bridging that gap.United Nations literature is replete with studieson the problems of and obstacles to development andthe elimination of poverty. This  however  is no longersufficient. In several international conferences we haveadopted plans and programmes of action containing20clear commitments to mobilize the financial resourcesnecessary to implement them. Yet implementation hasnot been at the level of the commitments contained inthose documents.A few months ago we reviewed progress in theimplementation of the recommendations of theinternational conferences on population  women andsocial development. But what were the results of thesereviews? What are the ways needed to face theobstacles that have impeded progress and made theimplementation of the recommendations of thoseconferences fall below our expectations?We have adopted the objective of halving povertyin the world by 2015. What is the course charted forachieving this objective and what are the commitmentsmade to mobilize the financial resources necessary forits achievement? What about the numerousprogrammes and initiatives for African development?Have their achievements been commensurate with themagnitude of the problems facing the continent? Is itnot time for a clear commitment  going beyond thecurrent initiatives  to lift the burden of foreignindebtedness that is crushing Africa? We need agenuine partnership between the North and the South.We need real and effective support by the donors andthe international financial institutions to implementdevelopment efforts and attempts to eliminate poverty not only as a moral value taking the form of freedomfrom want  as mentioned in the Secretary-General'sreport (A/54/2000)  but also as a vital objectiveconnected to the establishment of peace and stability.Sixth  in the same vein  an attempt to placeresponsibility for achieving development andeliminating poverty solely or even primarily on theshoulders of developing countries is both dangerousand short-sighted  because it would undermine theconcept of international cooperation  which is one ofthe cornerstones of the world system  and ignore therepercussions of the widening gap between the rich andthe poor in our world. That gap is now 16 times aslarge as it was in the 1960s.An attempt is also being made to linkinternational cooperation and the North's support forthe South with concepts and values that in themselveswe support but whose new conditionality we reject. Iam referring here to democracy  good governance andhuman rights. Questions of democratic transformation improved governance and administration  increasedtransparency and accountability  and promoting respectfor human rights cannot be dealt with in isolation fromthe questions of development  poverty and subsistence for they too are vitally important subjects. Should notthe call for democracy within States be matched by asimilar call for democracy among States andinternational organizations? Should not the call for therule of law be accompanied by a similar call for respectfor international law  the sovereignty of States and therights of peoples? Can good governance andadministration be achieved in the absence of a paralleleffort for the development of human resources and thecapacity-building? Is it sufficient just to pay attentionto the civil and political rights of people while ignoringtheir economic  social and cultural rights  foremostamong which is the inalienable right to development?Seventh  the success of the development effortsof the peoples of the world at this stage depends ontheir efficient use of the tools of the new age particularly information technology. The technologicalrevolution has led to a widening of the gap betweenthose who have those tools and those who do not.Nevertheless  information and knowledge technologiesare of such a nature as to enable them to contribute tonarrowing the gaps between the countries of the world.The attention Egypt pays to these globalquestions does not take away from the attention it givesto regional issues that are extremely sensitive. Amongthose questions  I would like to concentrate on theissues of peace in the Middle East and the situation inthe Sudan  which are of the utmost importance to Egyptand  without a doubt  to many in the Arab world Africa and the international community at large.The Arab-Israeli conflict entails vital issuesrelated to the lives of peoples and to the future ofnations. Those include recognition of legitimate rights sovereignty over national soil  the inalienable right toself-determination  the inadmissibility of theacquisition of territory by force and the right of allStates to live peacefully within secure borders. Allthese issues are directly linked to international andregional peace and security.The logic that must govern the peace process inthe Middle East should not stem from the assumptionthat one is dealing with a permanent foe or opponent. Itmust aim instead at turning past animosity into good-neighbourliness and normal relations among thepeoples and the States of the region. What is at stake is21the security of the region and the security andprosperity of future generations  and not short-termpolitical considerations. We face a clear choicebetween either settling the issue in terms of realestate  in which one party demands metres  miles ortens of miles  thereby keeping alive the seeds oftension and conflict  or by seeking through clearpolitical will to establish a just and lasting peace bywhich the rights of all parties are secured and theirobligations are well defined through necessaryinternational guarantees. The latter option must bebased on international law  something that applies tothe Israeli/Palestinian track and to the Syrian/Israelitrack alike.There is no doubt that the overwhelming majorityof States  communities and individuals support theachievement of a just solution that does not favour oneparty at the expense of the other. Most people wouldopt for peace and justice and would prefer to lookahead to the future in a positive way. Theoverwhelming majority of the Palestinian and Israelipeople also want peace  a peace that is clear and cleanand not partial  distorted or absent  something that at the end of the day  would be more of a headache thana concrete peace. In that regard  I would like to say thatPresident Arafat and the Palestinian people face one oftwo choices: either no solution or a bad solution. Thisis a policy that will never garner support orappreciation or ever lead to a viable solution.As to the so-called flexibility  which has been atthe forefront of commentary lately  it should mean onlyflexibility within the realm of international law and notoutside it. If we are talking about flexibility onJerusalem  that cannot in any way mean acceptingIsraeli sovereignty over Al-Haram al-Sharif. It couldinstead mean arrangements for the new PalestinianState that would give it sovereignty over all itsterritories while respecting the holy sites andguaranteeing their protection and free access to them.That would assume that  as a full-fledged member ofthe international community  the sovereign PalestinianState would be in charge.The peace process is but a few miles away fromthe finish line. We hope it will not take many longyears for Syria and Palestine to travel those few miles.We also hope that the sponsors of the peace processwill be wise and able enough to propose honestsolutions to the parties in order to enable the honestbroker to lead the negotiations to a certain conclusion.At this juncture  I would like to salute PresidentClinton's enthusiasm and tireless efforts in steering thepeace process during an eleventh-hour attempt to find alasting solution during his Administration.In order to achieve that objective it is essential touphold one guiding principle that cannot becircumvented  namely  full withdrawal from all Syrianand Palestinian territories  including East Jerusalem  inreturn for Israel's right to be integrated into the MiddleEast as a partner with equal rights to security  peaceand cooperation. That is the essence of resolutions 242(1967) and 338 (1973) and of the principle of land forpeace. Lasting peace and security can be establishedonly on that basis. If Arab territories  or any part ofthose territories  remain under occupation or if anyquestion is settled in a manner inconsistent with theprinciples of fairness and justice  it would create a timebomb that could explode at any time. The desired peaceand security cannot be fully realized without theestablishment of a full-fledged  independent PalestinianState.The stability of peace and security in the MiddleEast is tied to the need for serious consideration of thequestion of armaments in the Middle East. Permanentlydefusing tensions calls for dealing with the problem ofthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction andtheir delivery vehicles. This will also contributedirectly to the maintenance of international peace andsecurity. Peace and stability in the Middle East will notbe complete or lasting without the establishment of acomprehensive regional security system that ensurescontrol over the quantity and quality of armaments inthe region and establishes a zone free from weapons ofmass destruction  in accordance with PresidentMubarak's initiative  which enjoys globalunderstanding and support.The Sudan is a State of unique character inregional relations. It is at once a major component ofthe Arab world and an integral part of the Africancommunity. Its stability is also vital for the securityand stability of the Horn of Africa  the Red Sea and theNile basin. The importance Egypt attaches to thisbrotherly country therefore stems not only from thefact that it is Egypt's strategic twin  but because it is acentral factor to the security of a vast and vitallyimportant region.Many efforts have been made  and manyinitiatives have been presented  to achieve peace in the22Sudan  most of which were made in good faith.However  they all dealt with the situation from a singleperspective  that of the southern Sudan against thenorth.Consequently  Egypt and Libya saw the need tocomplement those efforts with a comprehensiveprogramme aimed at achieving broad nationalreconciliation encompassing all the factions and all theparties. The objective is to create a new Sudan  wherestability and harmony prevail within a basic frameworkof unity and territorial integrity  equality among itscitizens  and consensual self-determination by all itscitizens and component parts. This will bring comfortand reassurance to the Sudanese people and to all itsneighbours.The Egyptian-Libyan initiative has gone a longway towards bringing the parties closer. Thecoordination of this initiative with that of the Inter-Government Authority on Development (IGAD) ispossible. Efforts will continue to ensure the conveningof a conference on national reconciliation to achievepeace in that important country.The achievement of peace in the Middle East  theHorn of Africa and in the continents of Asia and Africaas a whole is a necessary condition for world stability.The situation in Afghanistan  Kashmir  the Caucasus Sri Lanka  the continued tragedy of Iraq  and theconflicts in Africa and their attendant social andeconomic problems all give rise to serious concernsabout the new world order  about its credibility andeffectiveness. We must act quickly in order to resolvethese problems in a context of international legitimacyand within the framework of the United Nations.Finally  amid all that  the United Nations standsas an expression of the will of the internationalcommunity. The purposes and principles of its Charterare a guiding beacon. Let this Millennium Summit andAssembly be a new turning point that will put us on theright path towards a world of greater security  justiceand stability  a world that builds upon the achievementsof the twentieth century and closes the chapter on itsgrave errors."
"50",2172,"ERI",55,2000,"At the outset  I wish toextend my congratulations to Mr. Holkeri on hisunanimous election as President of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-fifth session. I am confident that under his able and wise guidance  this session willsuccessfully accomplish its tasks.I would also like to express appreciation andthanks to his predecessor  Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic ofNamibia  for the effectiveness with which he directedthe work of the last session.I also take this opportunity to extendcongratulations to the Republic of Tuvalu on becomingthe latest Member of the United Nations.We shall not forget to express our thanks andappreciation to our Secretary-General  not only for histireless efforts to ensure respect for the values purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter but also for his far-sighted and thought-provokingmillennium report.The fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly ismeeting in the wake of the Millennium Summit  whoseDeclaration embodies three fundamental messages.First  it reaffirms that the ideals and goals of the UnitedNations are still sacred to humanity and that thepurposes and principles of the United Nations Charterare as valid today as they were in the past. Secondly  itreminds us that the lofty principles enshrined in theUnited Nations Charter require us to continuouslystrengthen the United Nations and to make thenecessary adjustments and changes to enable it to meetthe challenges of justice  peace and security  povertyand disease  socio-economic development  theinequities of the global economy and the protection ofthe environment. Thirdly  respect for the ideals andobservance of the purposes and principles of the UnitedNations remain the essential keys to the creation of apeaceful  prosperous and humane new world order. Tothis end  the Declaration enjoins us to be loyal to thesecommon ideals  goals  values and principles. It remindsus that each State has a responsibility to act not only byitself  but also within a regional system  to give theloyalty that is due to these values  goals  purposes andprinciples.In this connection  I wish to join others before mewho have reminded us of the urgent need to reform theUnited Nations  including in particular the SecurityCouncil and the General Assembly  with a view toenabling the Organization to reflect the realities of thetimes and to empower it to meet effectively andefficiently the challenges of the day and the future.I wish to reaffirm the commitment of the peopleand the Government of the State of Eritrea to the nobleideals and values  as well as the purposes and18principles  of the United Nations. Having madesupreme sacrifices and paid dearly  during a 30-yearstruggle for independence and membership in theinternational community  Eritreans appreciate howessential the United Nations and its Charter are to theirwell-being and prosperity. Having fully experiencedthe horrors of a long war and the benefits of a shortpeace  they recognize the need for the peaceful and justsettlement of disputes and for cooperation for mutualbenefit in the long human struggle to create aninternational order based on justice and equality.To this end  Eritrean foreign policy has beenpremised on the assumption that the threat or use offorce can never be an instrument of foreign policy  andthat even in a clear case self-defence it must be usedonly after all available methods of peacefully resolvingdisputes have been exhausted — and then only withextreme caution.It is for this reason — and because Eritrea hassuffered from the non-application by the UnitedNations itself of the principles of its own Charter andthe decisions of the General Assembly — that  uponindependence  Eritrea decided to make the ideals values  purposes and principles of the United NationsCharter the cornerstone of its foreign policy. By itsmembership  it had also hoped to play an active role inpromoting the principle of the universality ofmembership in the United Nations and in promotingthe achievement of fair and equitable regional andinternational orders.Eritrea is also fully aware of its responsibilities asa littoral State of a strategic international thoroughfareand has committed itself to contributing its share to thestability and security of the region  as well as to thecreation of a zone of peace and cooperation in theregion. To this end  it has made every effort to foster anatmosphere that will enhance cooperation among thelittoral States of both sides of the Red Sea and promotedevelopment and mutual prosperity. It has also played amajor role in the transformation of theIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD)from a simple natural disaster-control mechanism to avibrant regional organization which will promote peaceand cooperation among its member States  as well asadvance economic and social cooperation fordevelopment. The recent meeting of the ever-expanding Community of Sahelo-Saharan States  inAsmara  our capital  is a testimony to Eritrea'scommitment to the consolidation of the unity of and thebroadening and deepening of cooperative relationsbetween African countries. This commitment will forever be firm.In spite of its victimization  Eritrea had decidedto forget the past and to start with a clean slate as itevolved a vision  and set its priorities  for the future. Itestablished good relations with all its neighbours onthe basis of the United Nations and Organization ofAfrican Unity Charters and the principle of good-neighbourliness. It assumed that there would not be anyterritorial disputes with its neighbours  since itscolonial borders were clearly defined and recognizedand had been accepted at independence by all itsneighbours. It had no reason to assume that itsindependence would be threatened by any State  nearor far  any more than it had any reason to assume that ithad the right to use force to expand at the expense ofits neighbours. Its sole ambition as a new member ofthe international community was to make up for losttime in development.In spite of all its commitments and goodwill however  Eritrea has  during its brief seven years offormal independence  been tested by and had to defenditself against political pressures  threats and actualattempts which endangered not only its sovereignty andterritorial integrity  but also its hard-wonindependence. True  Eritrea may not be the only newcountry in history that has been so tested. Yet it mustbe the only Member of the United Nations whoseterritorial integrity — indeed  its very existence as asovereign  independent State — has been threatenedand is still being threatened at the beginning of thetwenty-first century.It goes without saying that this struggle topreserve its independence has been detrimental to thenation-building and development efforts of the newState. Yet throughout this time  Eritrea has neverwavered in its commitment to the peaceful resolutionof the disputes. Indeed  it has solved two of itsproblems peacefully on a bilateral basis and a thirdthrough international arbitration.It was perhaps during the last two years thatEritrea's independence  sovereignty and territorialintegrity were most severely tested. What was labelleda border dispute proved to be a serious attempt toreverse history and to recolonize Eritrea — or  failingthat  to truncate it  to Finlandize it  and to turn it into asatellite State. This attempt was thwarted by the united19effort of Eritreans at home and abroad. However  theattempt exacted its cost: the systematic and wilfuldestruction of much of the economic and socialinfrastructure of the country and the deliberate  brutalviolation of the human rights of Eritreans  includingthe terrorizing and brutalizing of the population in theoccupied territories.Eritrea is convinced that there is no alternative tothe solution of conflicts by peaceful means and on thebasis of the Charters of the United Nations and theOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and the existingprinciples of international law.From the beginning of the conflict  Eritrea hasrepeatedly declared that war can never be an option toresolve conflicts  that neither of the parties can settlethe conflict by imposing its will and creating facts onthe ground and then hope to achieve durable andmeaningful peace. It is a clear manifestation of itscommitment to peace and the rule of law that Eritreastill remains committed to a peaceful resolution of theconflict  notwithstanding the occupation of large tractsof its territory  the displacement of hundreds ofthousands of its people  the continued brutalization andterrorization of the people in occupied territory and thefeverish war preparations for yet another attemptagainst its territorial integrity. It has already taken boldmeasures  shown flexibility and made importantconcessions  however unpalatable they may have been in the hope of achieving a just peace and in spite of theattempts that are being made to destroy the OAU peaceproposals. Again  Eritrea pledges that it will continueto do its utmost to reach a comprehensive andconclusive agreement peacefully.Yet  the fate of peace hinges on three criticalfactors. First  the search for peace is a sharedresponsibility. It cannot be left to only one of theparties. Secondly  peace can be made certain only whenit is anchored on the values  ideals and principles of theCharter  which have been emphatically reconfirmed bythe Millennium Declaration. Among these is respect forthe independence  sovereignty and territorial integrityof States. Thirdly  peace can be achieved only with thefaithful implementation of agreements accepted byparties to a conflict. We invite all concerned to joinEritrea in extending full cooperation to the OAUFacilitators  in making a genuine and unequivocalcommitment to the OAU peace process and in beingfaithful to the letter and spirit of the provisions of theOAU peace documents  in particular the FrameworkAgreement and the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement.At this juncture  I wish to seize this opportunityto renew our appreciation and gratitude to HisExcellency President Abdelaziz Bouteflika for hisunwavering commitment to the peaceful resolution ofthe conflict  and to his personal envoy  His ExcellencyAhmed Ouyahia  for the wisdom and skill with whichhe led the indirect talks. We also extend ourappreciation to the international community  includingthe Government of the United States of America andthe European Union  as well as other Africangovernments  for their tireless efforts towards theachievement of a peaceful resolution and for thepositive contribution they made to ensure the signingof the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities inAlgiers on 18 June 2000. We request them to persist intheir noble endeavour until a genuine and just peace isreally achieved.Finally  the Government of the State of Eritreanotes with great appreciation the effort that has beenexerted  and the commitments made  by the UnitedNations to ensure an early  comprehensive settlementof the conflict. In this connection  I wish to draw theattention of the Security Council to the urgent necessityof deploying the peacekeeping force authorized by itsresolution 1320 (2000) as quickly as possible in orderto forestall any avoidable obstacles that may threaten or even destroy  the gains that have been achieved atgreat cost and much effort by so many."
"51",2218,"ESP",55,2000,"I wishsincerely to congratulate the President on his electionto preside over the work of the Millennium Assembly. Iwould also like to express my appreciation for the workof his predecessor  Foreign Minister Theo-Ben Gurirab which culminated in the recent Millennium Summit.I also welcome Tuvalu as a new Member State ofthe United Nations. I am sure that it will make a usefuland enriching contribution to the work of theOrganization.What kind of United Nations do we want? Why and to what purpose  do we need the United Nations inthis new millennium? The Millennium Summit wasconvened to answer those questions. The task of theGeneral Assembly is to devise and implement theguidelines that the Summit proposed. Spain would liketo suggest some ideas for progress in three of theOrganization's basic spheres of action: managingglobalization  combating poverty and peace-making.The United Nations that we want must be ourmain instrument for meeting the many challenges ofglobalization. Its universal nature places ourOrganization in an ideal position for that purpose. Itwould be unforgivable if it were not capable of risingto that task  which has to be undertaken in verydifferent fields. One such area is human rights. Theprocess of the universalization of human rightsconstitutes one of the United Nations most valuablecontributions to international relations since theadoption of the Universal Declaration of HumanRights  in 1948. If the twentieth century has been oneof formulating and structuring human rights on theinternational level  the next century must be that ofensuring that their effective implementation isuniversal.The practices in most urgent need of eliminationare racism  racial discrimination  xenophobia andintolerance. The 2001 World Conference againstRacism must be an effective instrument to that end. Wemust also strive to abolish the death penalty  which weconsider a punishment contrary to the dignity of thehuman being. The adoption of moratoriums againstcarrying it out could be a first step towards its totalban.Our Organization must also enable us to providesolutions  in a spirit of solidarity  to humanitarianproblems that until recently have simply not beenaddressed. The consequences have been borne bydefenceless civilian populations. I refer to the situationof refugees and persons displaced within their owncountries  civilian victims of armed conflicts andinternational aid workers who are subject to threats orcoercion. It is essential to broaden the scope of ouraction in this area and to pay special attention to themost vulnerable sectors of the population.Last week  in this very city  the President of theSpanish Government signed the two Optional Protocolsto the Convention on the Rights of the Child  relativeto children in armed conflict and on the sale ofchildren  child prostitution and child pornography. Inthat same vein  the General Assembly this year adopteda resolution (54/262) agreeing to the holding in Spainin 2002 of the Second World Assembly on Ageing. Weshall do everything possible to ensure the success ofsuch an important event.In this overall context  we must mention the issueof so-called humanitarian intervention  aptly proposedon more than one occasion by the Secretary-General.The United Nations that we want cannot be anOrganization that remains paralysed in the face ofmassive violations of human rights  wherever they maytake place. When that has occurred  its prestige hasbeen seriously affected  and it has been left out of basicdecision-making in times of crisis. The disgustprovoked by a passive stance in the face of thoseatrocities and the need to strengthen the role of the37Organization in crisis situations are merely two sides ofthe same coin. It is essential that we be capable ofbuilding consensus on at least two fundamental issues.The first is actions regarding which theinternational community cannot remain idle  such aswar crimes  crimes against humanity and genocide which are offences referred to in the Rome Statute ofthe International Criminal Court. Consensus shouldalso be reached among the permanent members of theSecurity Council over the cases in which they shouldrefrain from exercising their veto to block Councilresolutions aimed at putting an end to massiveviolations of human rights. The principle of Statesovereignty continues to be essential in contemporaryinternational society  but it must not be used as aprotective shield to trample upon human rights withimpunity.The establishment of the International CriminalCourt signals the direction in which the internationalcommunity is moving in that area. The creation of aninternational system of criminal justice constitutes themost important change in international law since theadoption of the San Francisco Charter. I am pleased toinform the Assembly that my country's process ofratification of the Rome Statute concluded yesterday. Ihope that the International Criminal Court will becomea reality in the not-too-distant future. I trust thereforethat the Rome Statute will be signed and ratified by thelargest possible number of States  without directly orindirectly affecting its integrity and effectiveness.If there is one issue that makes us realize thatthere are global interests demanding our collectivemanagement it is that of environmental protection. It isimperative that the Kyoto Protocol for combating thegreenhouse effect should come into force in 2002  atthe latest. Spain is a signatory of the Protocol  as wellas of the agreements on the ozone layer  bio-diversity bio-security and desertification — the latter problembeing one which especially affects my country.Unfortunately  globalization has also generatedfresh opportunities for the development of universalplagues such as terrorism and transnational organizedcrime. However  globalization also provides us withnew instruments to combat them  provided we agree onhow to use them. Spain supports the drafting of ageneral convention against international terrorism  andis grateful to India for its initiative in that respect. Thework aimed at the adoption of a convention againsttransnational organized crime must also be concluded.One of the United Nations top priorities is thefight against poverty. The Millennium Summit gavespecial attention to measures aimed at eradicatingpoverty. The specific implementation of thosemeasures must be a basic aspect of the work of theGeneral Assembly. The United Nations that we wantmust make it possible for developed and developingcountries to conclude agreements regarding the rolethey must play in that task.The high-level meetings that will be held in 2001on financing for development and on the leastdeveloped countries must not be wasted. Spain willcertainly do everything within its power to contributeto their success. My country follows the guidelinesproduced by the World Summit for Social Developmentsuggesting that at least 20 per cent of cooperationresources be devoted to basic social sectors such ashealth  education  housing and employment  whichhave the greatest impact on the most disadvantagedsectors of the population and  as a result  on theeradication of poverty. Spain has prepared an ambitiousmicrocredit programme aimed at meeting the needs ofthe least favoured sectors of the population ofdeveloping countries.Likewise  Spain has begun debt reliefprogrammes in several countries  includingMozambique and the Central American countries mostaffected by hurricane Mitch. We resolutely support theHighly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative. Medium-income countries with serious external debt problemsshould not be excluded from debt relief plans  as longas they implement meaningful domestic programmes toeradicate poverty.In the health sector there have been severesetbacks in recent years in the fight against infectiousdiseases  especially in Africa. Spain actively backs theJoint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS(UNAIDS) and the efforts under way to facilitateaccess to drugs against AIDS for patients in developingcountries. It also supports the holding of a specialsession of the General Assembly on that illness.Moreover  Spain has a special interest in examiningpossible action against other infectious and parasiticdiseases  particularly in Africa.The first sentence of the Charter states the resolveof the United Nations to save succeeding generations38from the scourge of war. We must not resign ourselvesto the indefinite prolongation of some regionalconflicts. In Africa a solution has not yet been foundfor the situation in the Congo  which for years hasravaged one of the richest and most influentialcountries of the continent. Angola and Sierra Leonecontinue to be the backdrop for civilian conflicts thatare often financed by the illegal sale of diamonds andother precious resources.Political and practical support for the UnitedNations and the mission deployed on the ground hasbeen a constant feature of Spain's policy concerningthe dispute over Western Sahara. Therefore  mycountry will maintain its commitment to a definitivesettlement of that dispute during this decisive time andwill support the efforts that the Secretary-General andhis Personal Envoy are making in compliance withSecurity Council resolution 1309 (2000).New prospects for peace have opened up in theMiddle East following the Camp David summit. It isvital to consolidate the important progress made thereand take advantage of this historic opportunity toconclude an agreement on all outstanding issues. Spainconsiders that  pursuant to the Declaration of Berlin the Palestinian people are entitled to establish theirown state. The evolution of the peace process must bereflected in the resolutions to be adopted this year bythe General Assembly  which must not be a mechanicalrepetition of the wording used in previous years.The situation in Iraq is nevertheless proving to befrustrating. The interruption of weapons inspections the absence of any foreseeable date for the lifting ofthe sanctions  the continuation of armed action and thedifficult humanitarian situation in the country allcombine to produce a situation that is far fromencouraging. It is imperative that consensus within theSecurity Council on this matter be strengthened andthat Iraq collaborate with the United Nations with aview to the full implementation of resolution 1284(1999) and other relevant resolutions.Turning to Latin America  it is vital that theinternational community send a clear message ofsupport for the peace process in Colombia. The effortsby President Pastrana to reach an agreement that willput an end to decades of violence and lack of securitydeserve the support of us all.The difficulties faced by the United NationsInterim Administration Mission in Kosovo in theaccomplishment of its tasks should not overshadow itsachievements to date in what is probably thepeacekeeping operation with the widest-rangingobjectives ever undertaken by the United Nations.Those objectives are to pacify the territory  to reconcileits population  to rebuild its economy  and to enableKosovo  as stated in resolution 1244 (1999)  to enjoysubstantial autonomy and an administration that is trulyits own  while respecting the principle of territorialsovereignty and integrity of the Federal Republic ofYugoslavia.Many of these conflicts could perhaps have beenavoided. Spain unreservedly supports the Secretary-General's efforts to direct the Organization's conflict-prevention. His report on Africa provides an innovativeapproach  proposing a wide-ranging package ofmeasures to address the conflicts on the Africancontinent.An important element in this arsenal ofpreventive diplomatic measures is a sound sanctionspolicy. Sanctions regimes must be carefully graduatedin order to fulfil their goal: to penalize a particulargovernment whose policies constitute a threat to peace without harming the civilian population of that country which in many cases is totally powerless to influencethe decisions of its Government  or third parties.Sanctions must be applied in a flexible way and besubject to periodic review  enabling them to be adaptedto changing circumstances.Disarmament and non-proliferation are anothertwo essential elements of conflict prevention. It is vitalto overcome the setbacks suffered in recent months bythe nuclear non-proliferation process and to promotethe signing and ratification of the ComprehensiveNuclear-Test- Ban Treaty  with a view to its early entryin force. It is likewise a matter of concern that it hasnot yet been possible to start negotiations on a protocolon fissile material; it is urgent to achieve the necessaryconsensus to that end.The conclusion of the negotiations on theVerification Protocol to the Convention on BiologicalWeapons represents an achievement in this field that isas important as the entry into force of the Conventionon Chemical Weapons. In the same way  the 2001United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in SmallArms and Light Weapons in All its Aspects mustconstitute a milestone comparable to the OttawaConvention banning anti-personnel mines.39Another of the United Nations goals must be toconclude the decolonization process worldwide bydoing away with the last vestiges of colonialism. Oneof them persists  as a painful anachronism  in Spanishterritory. I am  of course  referring to Gibraltar  where nearly three centuries after its population was expelledand the Rock occupied by British troops  a colonialsituation still lingers. This is an infringement of mycountry's territorial integrity and contravenes theprovisions of General Assembly resolution 2353(XXII). Regaining sovereignty over this part of ourterritory is a longstanding goal for Spain  which is fullyin favour of a meaningful dialogue. It is regrettable thatthe United Kingdom has not yet shown a genuinepolitical will to resolve this problem. Because of this 15 years after the start of bilateral talks in theframework of the Brussels process and despite thedecisions of the General Assembly  we have notregistered any progress at all on this matter  in spite ofseveral concrete proposals put forward by our side.We want a United Nations that is capable ofcarrying out the tasks that have been entrusted to it. Toachieve this  it must complete its process of reform.For instance  the role of the General Assembly — theonly body in which all the Member States arerepresented — must be enhanced  as it is the UnitedNations driving force for debate and political impetus.Civil society should be incorporated to a greater extentinto the Organization's work. This would contribute tobringing people closer to the United Nations and tosecuring a greater commitment from them with regardto its work.It is also vital to reform the Security Council inorder to enable it to fully perform its duties in themaintenance of international peace and security. TheSpanish Government believes that this reform mustdraw its inspiration from the following principles.First  it must be conducted on the basis of a broadand solid consensus  in order to avoid dangerousdivisions among Member States and to provide theenlarged Council with the greater legitimacy it needs tocarry out its work effectively.In the context of democratization  it must allowfor an increase in the number of non-permanentmembers from all regional groups  and especially fromthe developing world. Spain considers that anenlargement of this category of non-permanentmembers would best reflect the trend towards thedemocratization of international society at the dawn ofthe third millennium.To enhance the Council's effectiveness  stepsmust be taken to prevent exercise of the veto powerfrom blocking the Council in certain crisis situations.Finally  there must be greater transparency. TheCouncil's working methods must be improved byincreasing the number and quality of the consultationsamong its members and with other Member States  sothat the latter will not be left out of the decision-making process.The Organization that we need must also be ableto act firmly and effectively on the ground in order tomaintain the peace. The first step in this direction is toreflect on past mistakes. Therein lies the importance ofthe Brahimi report on United Nations peace operations which — in the same way as former reports on Rwandaand Srebrenica — hit a nerve when it acknowledgedour faults and proposed solutions for overcoming them.The Organization's shortcomings in this fieldhave at times been very serious  and have cost humanlives and brought great suffering to the peoples directlyaffected. They have also seriously discredited theUnited Nations in the eyes of our peoples.Spain has a direct interest in ensuring thatpeacekeeping operations are well organized andmanaged  because at this time hundreds of Spaniardsare participating in them in such faraway places as EastTimor  Kosovo  Ethiopia and Guatemala. Moreover last year Spain signed an agreement with theSecretariat on the Stand-by Forces — an agreement inwhich some of the recommendations contained in theBrahimi report already appear.Spain steadfastly supports these recommendationsand hopes that they will be rapidly implemented. At thesame time  we must be aware that all of this willrequire a much greater political and financialcommitment on the part of all with respect topeacekeeping operations. It will require fasterdeployment of the necessary military and civilian unitsand larger-scale measures in order to consolidate peaceonce conflicts come to an end. Above all  if UnitedNations troops are compelled to take greater risks inorder to guarantee the implementation of SecurityCouncil mandates  such mandates must be clear realistic and have the unequivocal backing of theCouncil. All this will require a serious effort to find40common positions and to achieve consensus within theCouncil in the elaboration of the resolutions containingsuch mandates  eliminating any ambiguities that couldhamper their effective application. It means moreresolute and unwavering action against specific Statesor groups which may attempt to disrupt such action including the possible application of sanctions. Onlythen will we be able to send our troops to situations inwhich they will have to risk their lives in order toensure that such mandates are upheld.Improving peacekeeping operations willundoubtedly be costly. Neither this nor any of the othertasks facing the Organization will be possible if it doesnot resolve its financial crisis. Spain is the eighth-largest contributor to its regular budget and pays itscontributions on time  in full and without conditions.Therefore we have a direct interest in seeing theOrganization's financial crisis resolved once and forall  as soon as possible. The principle of capacity topay must continue to be the basic criterion for decidingthe assessed contributions. European Union countriesalready are contributing much more than they should tothe United Nations budget in accordance with thisprinciple. Spain's stance will be a constructive one inthe negotiations to review the scale of assessments laterthis fall.In an increasingly interdependent world  there isno alternative to multilateral cooperation. The UnitedNations must rise to the occasion in order to fulfil theexpectations of the peoples who founded it. Thecountries represented here must face up to thatresponsibility by building an Organization capable ofmeeting the challenges posed by globalization in thenew millennium. The United Nations that we want ispossible. It is within our reach to achieve it."
"52",2244,"EST",55,2000,"Allow me to begin  Sir  bycongratulating you on your election as President of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-fifth session. I wish youall the best in carrying out your duties. I would alsolike to welcome the Republic of Tuvalu to the UnitedNations.Last week my Prime Minister  Mart Laar  spoketo the Millennium Summit on a number of issuesEstonia sees as being especially salient to the UnitedNations this year. In my brief remarks today  I wouldlike to underline four in particular: first  the need toreform the Security Council; secondly  efforts to raisethe effectiveness of peacekeeping; thirdly  theimportance of narrowing the global gap between richand poor; and  fourthly  the role of informationtechnology in furthering development.The first concerns efforts to reform the SecurityCouncil. The strong executive power vested in theCouncil was originally designed for the Council toprovide a venue for speedy decisions and subsequentaction. In practice  however  the Council isincreasingly prone to indecisive waffling  which in turnundermines its own authority and credibility  and thusits effectiveness. In order to combat that effect  Estoniabelieves that the voting procedures and mechanismsgoverning the work of the United Nations mostpowerful body must be revamped.One such procedure that deserves our attention isthe veto. Some permanent members of the SecurityCouncil have used the veto  or have threatened to doso  in order to advance their own domestic and foreignpolicy interests  irrelevant to the particular issue athand. Because the Security Council derives itslegitimacy from all Member States  it is the duty of thepermanent members to exercise their veto powerresponsibly.The composition of the Council  which stillreflects the power relationships current in 1945  isanother issue that calls out for resolution. From theinception of the United Nations that year until just adecade ago the people of my country were affordedonly rare glimpses of the goings-on at the UnitedNations through tears in the fabric of the Iron Curtain.When we finally re-established our independence  in1991  we emerged onto the international arena only to27discover that the Security Council  judging by itscomposition  was still stuck back in 1945. This strikesEstonia as being anachronistic  if not wrongheaded.The guarantors of  and greatest contributors to  stabilityin the world have in the course of half a centurychanged fundamentally. We need not fear opening adiscussion on whether the moral and legal reasoningunderlying Security Council membership in the wakeof the Second World War is still appropriate for thetwenty-first century. If countries have fundamentallychanged  so should  and so can  the United Nations.My second point regards peacekeeping. Earlierthis year my Government decided to forgo the discountrate that meant paying only 20 per cent of ourpeacekeeping assessment. Instead  we voluntarily andunilaterally opted to shoulder 100 per cent of what isexpected of us. This is because Estonia regardspeacekeeping as being among the United Nations mostcrucial assignments in fulfilling its historical mandateof collective security. Security cannot be had atdiscount prices. That is why Estonia is willing to paymore for what we hope will be a better product.Paying our own way is not enough to raise theeffectiveness of peacekeeping  however. What werequire  as Prime Minister Tony Blair said here lastweek  is a far broader concept of security. The SecurityCouncil took an important step last week towardsensuring the security of people and frontiers with itsunanimous resolution to overhaul United Nationspeacekeeping operations. Those changes should createa more potent and better financed force that can reactquickly where needed.My third point focuses on the need to increaseequality around the globe. In his millennium report  theSecretary-General called on all of us to focus on theeradication of poverty. We can go a long way towardslevelling the playing field for all peoples by alleviatingdebt and allocating more resources for developmentassistance. It is not as simple as that  however. As myPrime Minister  Mart Laar  said here last week  theseefforts must go hand in hand with good governance andopen markets. Without a commitment to these twoelements  no amount of aid or debt relief will bring uscloser to our intended goal.The idea that open governments and openmarkets are a prerequisite for good economicperformance leads me to my fourth and final point namely  the role of information and communicationstechnology in furthering development. In hismillennium report  the Secretary-General rightlystressed the need to ensure that the fruits of newtechnologies  especially information technology  areavailable to all.I personally took part in the High-level Panel ofExperts on Information and CommunicationTechnology  held here at the United Nations last April because we have some experience in these matters.Estonia has the honour of finding itself among the 20most computerized nations in the world. Moreimportantly  we have done this not as a rich country but as a nation with rather modest means.Among the Panel's most important findings wasthe undisputed  if not terribly original  conclusion thatinformation technology programmes are  in fact beneficial for development. Computer technology canbe a wedge  or it can be a bridge. It need not followthat poor nations fall ever behind. Policies can beimplemented  as we have discovered  that turn the“digital divide” into a “digital dividend”.We have seen this in my country firsthandthrough our Tiger Leap programme whereby everyschool in Estonia has  for some time now  beenconnected to the Internet. Even more clearly  we havewitnessed how access to information technology hasbrought new possibilities to rural areas  the areas whichoften bear the brunt of change. This is why Estoniawholeheartedly endorses  and will actively participatein  the United Nations plans to assist all Members inmaking the information technology dream a reality."
"53",2290,"ETH",55,2000,"Allow me  from theoutset  to extend warm congratulations to you Mr. President  on your election to preside over thefifty-fifth session of the General Assembly. I wouldlike also to express our appreciation to yourpredecessor  Minister Theo-Ben Gurirab  for the ablemanner with which he discharged his responsibilities asPresident of the fifty-fourth session of the GeneralAssembly.I wish also to take this opportunity to express oursincere appreciation to our Secretary-General  Mr. KofiAnnan  for all the efforts he has been making to makethe United Nations equally relevant to all of us. I wish in particular  to congratulate him on the success of theMillennium Summit  which we are hopeful will be alandmark for more meaningful and enhancedcooperation among nations.We have indeed been encouraged by the well-deserved emphasis that was given to Africa and toAfrica's predicament at the Millennium Summit. It isour hope that the Summit may have helped creategreater determination for cooperation with the peoplesof Africa so that Africa may make real progress inaddressing the challenges of development  peace andstability.The problems of Africa are defined by two veryclosely related challenges. Africa's developmentcontinues to be arrested by problems of insecurity instability and lack of peace. On the other hand  itappears unrealistic to expect durable peace in Africawithout hope in the future that could be brought aboutonly by visible indications of possibilities for progress.In both areas  Africa has not had the necessarysupport commensurate with the complexity of thechallenges it has faced. It might be necessary to hastento add here that indeed Africa itself might not alwayshave taken advantage of available opportunities formaking progress  and that we might sometimes havesquandered real opportunities for breaking out of thevicious cycle of poverty and lack of peace and stability.While this may be partly true  the significance ofthe missed chances that Africa has allowed to passshould not be exaggerated. It is far from the truth thatAfrica has enjoyed sustained  resolute and all-outsupport  either in the area of economic development orin the sphere of peace and security. On the other hand it is precisely this type of cooperation that is requiredby many in Africa to be able to embark on sustainable4economic development and growth. But whether withrespect to debt relief  or to declining terms of trade  orto all aspects of the challenges of and obstacles todevelopment  the types of cooperation made availableto our countries have always been limited as well asentangled with all kinds of conditions which have beenfar from helpful.Like all regions of the world and like allcountries  Africa and African nations should and mustassume primary responsibility for what happens inAfrica in general and in individual African countries.But at one time or another in their history  most regionsof the world and most countries have had occasions torely on international solidarity and cooperation as acatalyst for creating conditions for development andstability.But Africa's fate has been different. For whateverreason  it has been easier to lose hope with respect toAfrica than to give the continent the benefit of thedoubt; this  even when little has been done to helpAfrica address the real challenges it is facing in avariety of areas.This is not only in the area of economicdevelopment. We have seen the same thing taking placewith respect to the need for Africa to promote respectfor the rule of law and to create conditions for peaceand stability. Africa is also being marginalized in termsof the universal applicability of the principles ofinternational law. It is our hope that Africa will bejudged by the same standard in this regard. Otherwise there can be little chance for peace and stability in ourcontinent.We say this from experience. There is noeffective substitute  if opportunities are to be createdfor the peaceful resolution of situations of crisis inAfrica and for a quick and an appropriate response bythe international community to violations ofinternational law. Peace can never be promoted throughappeasement of aggression or by creating theimpression that  depending on circumstances  on wherethey take place and to whom they happen  some acts ofaggression can be tolerated.We in Ethiopia have  only a week ago  celebratedour New Year. We have entered the year 1993 withconfidence that it will be a year of peace and progress.Our people have made the commitment to resume thetask of economic development with full force  a taskwhich was rudely interrupted two years ago when ourcountry became a victim of aggression.It is also in this spirit that we are proceeding withfull commitment to put behind us the crisis we havehad with Eritrea. Even before the deployment ofpeacekeepers  contrary to experience in other places the cessation of hostilities has held for months now. Welook forward both to the deployment of thepeacekeepers and to a speedy conclusion of acomprehensive settlement. All those prepared tocontribute to this effort should rest assured that whatthey should expect from Ethiopia  its people and theirGovernment  is the fullest cooperation. For us agreements concluded are made to be respected  notviolated. In any case  what our people wish to beidentified with  fully and with no ambiguity  ispeacemaking  not war-making. We hope that we willhave the opportunity to work for peace and foreconomic growth and development.There are few who need the blessings of peacemore than the people of Ethiopia and of our subregion.As much as our people refuse to see aggressionrewarded at their expense  they have  on the otherhand  never been wanting in demonstrating fullcommitment to peace and legality. Our people willnever jettison this noble tradition.Ethiopia also takes its responsibility for peaceand stability in our subregion very seriously and inAfrica as a whole. In this regard  we have beenenormously encouraged by the developments withrespect to the peace initiative on Somalia under theauspices of President Ismail Omar Guelleh of Djibouti.It is Ethiopia's hope that what has already beenachieved in Djibouti will be built upon and that themomentum for peace and national reconciliation willbe maintained. We are convinced that if the remainingproblems are handled with realism  wisdom and mutualaccommodation  there is little doubt that the people ofSomalia will very soon be able to put behind them the10-year nightmare they have faced. I would like therefore  to take this opportunity to call on allconcerned to make this newly created opportunity forpeace in Somalia  and for the restoration of the SomaliState  irreversible. The process should not be allowedto be held hostage by those who may not be preparedfor national reconciliation. Nor should it be endangeredby a failure to be sufficiently accommodating and5sufficiently patient. This is what the internationalcommunity should encourage.The opportunity now created in Somalia shouldnot be allowed to slip away. This could easily happen ifall attention is focused on seeking internationallegitimacy rather than internal national reconciliation.It would indeed be a tragedy and a recipe for furtherbloodshed in Somalia if efforts are not made to buildon the peace and stability that have already beenachieved by some regions and parts of Somalia. Theissue of Somaliland  for instance  requires greatsensitivity and a sense of enormous responsibility.Whatever has been achieved in Djibouti is going to betested by how well the peace and stability that someparts of Somalia have achieved is preserved.For Ethiopia  and for Somalia's neighbours  theseare critical issues. The formal stand we will be takingwith respect to the evolving situation in Somalia willdepend on how these issues are addressed by those whonow have the chance to affect the destiny of the peopleof Somalia. While we wish them well and promisethem our full cooperation  we also ask them to use thishistoric opportunity with a full sense of responsibilityand wisdom.Let me take this opportunity to also state thatEthiopia  along with its Inter-Government Authority onDevelopment (IGAD) partners  will continue to do themaximum possible for peace and nationalreconciliation in the Sudan. It has always been our firmconviction that the Declaration of Principles provides ajust and realistic basis for reaching a settlement on thecrisis in southern Sudan. It is also our view that abroader national reconciliation in the Sudan can easilybe achieved on the basis of democratic principles andmutual accommodation. Ethiopia will continue to becommitted to peace in the Sudan on this basis and tocooperate with all those who have the goodwill tocontribute to peace in our subregion.Let me reiterate: Ethiopia will do the maximumpossible for peace and durable stability in Africa as awhole  with the full knowledge that without peace wein Africa will have little chance to ensure a betterfuture for our peoples.Before concluding  I would like to say a fewwords on how vital it is that the reform of the SecurityCouncil be completed as speedily as possible. Thereform of the Council is critical for the credibility ofthe United Nations and for its increased legitimacy. Asmatters stand now  it is only too obvious that not manybelieve that the work of the Security Council isconducted with sufficient transparency. In fact  there isa growing conviction that the Council is being less andless representative and more and more distant from thesentiments of the majority.This situation  we believe  needs to be rectified.This can be done in two ways. First  by ensuring thatthere is equitable representation of all regions of theworld on the Council. Secondly  it is also importantthat the work of the Council be made more open and itsdecision-making more transparent. The interests ofpeace and security will be better served if the Councilis more transparent and more open to the views ofothers  most particularly to the views of those directlyaffected by its decisions.It is our earnest hope that the United Nations willbe more relevant to all in the twenty-first century  andin equal measure  than it has been in the past 55 years.This is not an unrealistic objective  but it requires thecommitment of all  big and small."
"54",2336,"FIN",55,2000,"I will deliver this statementon behalf of Mr. Erkki Tuomioja  the Minister forForeign Affairs of Finland.The heads of State and Government have justcompleted the largest-ever United Nations gathering the Millennium Summit. They adopted a forward-looking and ambitious Millennium Declaration. This together with the Secretary-General's report for theSummit  sets a demanding agenda for the UnitedNations for the new millennium. A new spirit waskindled in the Summit. We need to keep that spirit alivein the Assembly  which now has the responsibility tostart the implementation of the MillenniumDeclaration.The President of Finland made a statement on theneed for the United Nations to be relevant for theMember States and their people. I should like toelaborate on some of her ideas a little further  fullysupporting the statement made by the French ForeignMinister  Mr. VÈdrine  on behalf of the EuropeanUnion.One of the most inspiring concepts that theSecretary-General has advocated is the culture ofprevention. If we want the United Nations to berelevant  we must equip it with the means to be onestep ahead of developments. Successful preventionrequires a profound understanding of underlyingcauses. By understanding these causes  we canestablish an early warning system that allows us to actin time  before the conflicts erupt.One of the root causes of conflicts is poverty. Asalmost half of the world's population still have to makedo with less than $2 dollars a day  and struggle forexistence  conflicts can flare up easily. Poverty is alsoan affront to human dignity. Trying to halve theproportion of people living in extreme poverty requirescommon efforts. Democracy and respect for humanrights are important preconditions for all developmentand for poverty eradication to be sustained. Withoutdemocratic decision-making  respect for the rule oflaw  human rights and fundamental freedoms  genderequality and good governance  it is unrealistic toexpect sustainable results in poverty reduction.Demand for respect for human rights willcontinue to shape the destiny of humankind in thefuture. One of the greatest achievements of the UnitedNations has been the codification of a core set ofhuman rights standards. Governments have theobligation to implement these standards. The UnitedNations is the only global organization primarilymandated to ensure respect for human rights. It shoulddevote more attention and resources to the fullrealization and enjoyment of these rights universally.Globalization is not only an unavoidable processbut also something which is on the whole beneficial forhuman development. Globalization today is not merelya continuation of the familiar process ofinternationalization of trade  market integration andgrowing interdependence. In these processes  weencounter the phenomenon of quantity changing intoquality. The development of new technologies greatlymultiplies the effects  both positive and negative  ofglobalization. I believe that the great majority of theworld's population have benefited from globalization.Some have certainly made vast profits from it. As such this is not to be deplored; but  at the same time  toomany people are losers in the same process. Manymore fear the potential threats and losses they perceiveas negative effects of globalization. Still more areanxious as to whether global processes are undercontrol any longer. For these reasons  it is of the utmostimportance for us to be able to face the challenges ofglobalization and to counter many of its negativeeffects.The United Nations  the Bretton Woodsinstitutions and the World Trade Organization (WTO) as well as other international actors  must join forces inadopting and implementing the common rules neededto harness the positive power of globalization. Tradeliberalization and trade rules under the auspices of theWTO should be implemented in such a way that theybenefit all  particularly the poorest  as well assafeguard our common environment.One aspect of managing globalization is the needto enhance stability  transparency and responsiblebehaviour in international financial markets. We mustcounter disturbances caused  for example  by short-term speculative capital movements. Initiatives such ascurrency transaction taxes  the so-called Tobin tax deserve careful consideration. If  as some studiesindicate  such a tax is unworkable  it is all the moreimportant to propose and adopt other means andinstruments to achieve the same aims.19One of the most recent challenges is the digitaldivide created by the revolution in information andcommunication technology. Computerization andInternet literacy are not an end as such. They shouldserve the purposes of development: education  literacy health care  empowerment and inclusion. By closingthe digital gap  we help developing countries join theknowledge-based global economy. In the long run  thedigital revolution has the greatest potential for thedeveloping countries. Information and communicationtechnology (ICT) will make technological leap-frogging possible for developing countries.The global agenda set in the United Nationsconferences and summits in the 1990s addressed manysuch basic needs of human life which need commonattention in the process of globalization. Progress wasmade on human rights  gender equality  population social development  sustainable development  drugs environmental issues and many others. In the newmillennium  we must focus on the acceleratedimplementation of the plans of action adopted at theseconferences. Still  our agenda keeps growing. Children HIV/AIDS  racism and racial discrimination  financingfor development  least developed countries as well assustainable development and the environment requiremore profound attention from the world community.Even with these issues  I am afraid that our agenda isnot exhausted. The growing agenda poses validdemands of coherence on the United Nations systemand its work  as well as on the Member States.No matter how well we implement the globalagenda and no matter how much we resort topreventive actions  we have to have improved means tosolve crises and conflicts as peacefully and rapidly aspossible. Finland welcomes the Secretary-General'sinitiative to take a critical look at the United Nationspeace operations by a Panel of eminent persons. TheBrahimi report suggests a comprehensive reform ofpeace operations. We need a detailed discussion on thereport without delay. There are lessons to be learnedfor the United Nations and its Member States. Weshould particularly learn from the failures so as not torepeat them  but we also must learn from successes andsee what works.We need to address the whole continuum of peaceoperations from the standpoint of prevention. It is mostimportant to try to prevent crises from erupting.Prevention is an important element during a crisis aswe try to stop its escalation. Prevention continues aftercrises in post-conflict peace-building  as we need tominimize their consequences and their duration  not tospeak of their repetition. Kosovo is a prime example ofthis.I am stating the obvious when I say that theUnited Nations needs a rapid-reaction capability qualified and experienced personnel to perform theoperations  as well as the money to pay for them. Thiswould make it easier to address an increased demandfor United Nations peacekeeping.The critical approach taken in the Brahimi reportshould also be extended to other fields and activities ofthe United Nations in order to attain efficiency withinthe Organization. Reorganization and prioritizationwould free both human and financial resources for thecore areas of our responsibilities.There have been positive developments in somecrises that have long been on the United Nationsagenda. A most encouraging example is therapprochement in the Korean peninsula. Finlandwelcomes the positive development to bring peace stability and reunification to the Korean peninsula andencourages the two parties to advance the process ofdialogue. Finland also welcomes the withdrawal ofIsraeli troops from southern Lebanon in accordancewith Security Council resolution 425 (1978). We hopethis leads to a just  comprehensive and lasting peace inthe Middle East.The nation-building process in East Timor hasstarted successfully. I hope that the present transitionperiod will soon lead to full independence for EastTimor. Recent incidents in West Timor against UnitedNations personnel  however  jeopardize the progressand the capabilities of the United Nations system tohelp. We also strongly support the Secretary-General'sefforts to achieve a comprehensive settlement of theCyprus problem.Developments in Africa have not beenencouraging. I regret deeply that the safety and securityof United Nations personnel have not been guaranteedin all United Nations operations  such as that in SierraLeone. However  Eritrea and Ethiopia have reached anagreement and international monitoring can start. I amhappy to announce that Finland will participate in theUnited Nations mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea.The continuum of multidimensional crises mustbe prevented  managed and solved with appropriate20multidimensional means. Addressing them requirescooperation among different organizations  such as theUnited Nations  the European Union  the Organizationfor Security and Cooperation in Europe  the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization  the Organization ofAfrican Unity and the Organization of AmericanStates  to mention but a few. The complexity of criseshas shown that no single organization is capable ofdealing with all aspects of a crisis  military  civilianand humanitarian. Sad experiences  for example fromthe Balkans  remind us that many weaknesses still existin the conflict-prevention and management capabilitiesof the international community. A clearer division oflabour between the organizations is needed. They mustconcentrate on what they can do best  following theprinciple of comparative advantage. Complementarityand cooperation are the friends  and rivalry the enemy of any operation.Coherent action is needed to address thesituations  bearing in mind the comprehensive conceptof security. I stress the need to enhance our civiliancrisis-management capabilities in all relevant fields.Complex crises need expertise in the fields of civilianpolice  the rule of law  human rights  justice  electoralassistance  institution-building  economic reconstructionand rehabilitation  as well as impartial media. As statedin the Brahimi report  doctrinal shifts and morethorough strategic planning are needed at the UnitedNations to address complex and often intrastateconflicts.Peace and security are indivisible. Disarmamentis a part of comprehensive and integrated action inpreventing conflicts and in promoting a global dialogueon peace and stability. Arms control agreements including the Treaty between the United States ofAmerica and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republicson the Limitation of Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems remain a cornerstone of international security. Thesuccessful outcome of the Review Conference of theStates Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons (NPT) created a new momentum innuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. TheComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty must beratified by all. We hope for a swift entry into force ofthe START II Treaty and we are looking forward to thecommencement of the START III negotiations.One of the main concerns is the regional armsrace. We need to ensure that the few countriesremaining outside the NPT regime do not developweapons of mass destruction. Also  conventional arms and in particular anti-personnel landmines  small armsand light weapons  remain a concern in regional andinternal conflicts. The United Nations Conference onthe Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons inAll Its Aspects should aim at achieving significantresults in adopting a comprehensive approachintegrating security and development.Enhanced international action is also needed inhumanitarian demining  particularly in post-conflictsituations where civilian populations continue to bevictims of anti-personnel landmines.I wish to join the Secretary-General's call on allStates to sign and ratify the Rome Statute of theInternational Criminal Court (ICC) at the earliestpossible date. It is important now to build on what hasbeen achieved in and after the Rome Conference and tosecure the early establishment of the ICC  fullyrespecting the integrity of its Statute. More and moreStates  including my own  are approaching the stage ofratification of the Rome Statute. We are confident that in the long run  all States will recognize the benefits ofa permanent International Criminal Court.Terrorism is an evil we must combat decisivelyand effectively so that everyone can live and travelfreely in the world without having to fear crime andkidnappings. We have negotiated 12 major anti-terrorism conventions within the United Nationsframework that make it clear that terrorist acts arecriminal and can never be justified by any ends. Thisobviously also applies to the means used to combatterrorism.Finland welcomes the initiative of the Secretary-General to offer an opportunity to sign any treaty orconvention of which the Secretary-General is thedepositary. In this connection  I should also like tomake reference to the Tampere Convention on theProvision of Telecommunication Resources forDisaster Mitigation and Relief Operations. As the hostcountry of the relevant conference  Finland would liketo encourage all States to sign and ratify theConvention in order to bring it into force as soon aspossible.The purposes enshrined in the Charter and thenew challenges the United Nations is facing requireunwavering support for the United Nations and formultilateralism from its Member States. The UnitedNations is an expression of the will of its Member21States to deliberate and act multilaterally. There aremany reasons why multilateralism is the preferred  aswell as perhaps the only sustainable  way to deal withproblems. It involves all the actors that are needed forthe long-term solution of conflicts. It provides thetransparency that modern conflict resolution requires.It strengthens respect for international law in general.Last but not least  it diminishes the possibility thatforce will be used unnecessarily or disproportionately.A tendency towards unilateralism would onlyreopen old divisions or create new ones. The UnitedNations is a stronghold of multilateralism  and itshould be used to safeguard the primacy of multilateralaction. In this respect  we must ensure that the UnitedNations is able to act effectively when the need arises.The role and ability of the Secretary-General must beenhanced to enable the Organization to act when it isotherwise threatened with paralysis.In this context  I want to make it clear that thecrisis management capacity under construction in theEuropean Union will be at the service of theinternational community. It is not intended forunilateral interventionism. The Union will contribute tointernational peace and security in accordance with theprinciples of the United Nations Charter and theprinciples and objectives of the Organization forSecurity and Cooperation in Europe Charter onEuropean Security.For this kind of a multilateralism to work  UnitedNations finances must be put on a sound  sustainableand equitable basis. This is crucial for its strength andcredibility. Charter obligations related to the paymentof contributions must be fulfilled by all  on time  in fulland without conditions.Cooperation between the United Nations Governments and non-governmental organizations hasbeen very successful  and it must be intensified andfacilitated. It has to be extended to cover the whole ofcivil society. Present challenges are too heavy for theUnited Nations to carry alone. I commend theSecretary-General for his several initiatives in thisrespect. In particular  I would mention his GlobalCompact initiative  which seeks to engage corporationsin the promotion of equitable labour standards  respectfor human rights and the protection of the environment.Cooperation with civil society is a necessity for thenew millennium. Strong partnerships are needed tomeet the challenges posed every day in the presentworld. This trend should be strengthened andencouraged."
"55",2380,"FJI",55,2000,"I bring you greetings from thepeople of the Fiji Islands.On their behalf  I also convey our warmcongratulations to you  Mr. President  along with thepledge of my delegation to support you and to closelycooperate with you in ensuring the success of thissession.To the Secretary-General  I would like to expressthe sincere gratitude of the people of Fiji for all that theUnited Nations family is doing every day  in every partof the globe  to bring relief to those in need  and topromote peace  security and development.I would like to take this opportunity to warmlywelcome our neighbour and close friend  Tuvalu  as thenewest Member of the United Nations. Fiji is veryproud to see the flag of this very important Pacificisland country taking its place alongside the other 188Members of the United Nations. We look forward tothe admission in the future of more Pacific islandStates.I address the Assembly today on behalf of theInterim Administration in Fiji  which I have beenentrusted by our President to lead.In the wake of the coup d'Ètat in my country on19 May this year  and the political crisis it triggered my Interim Administration has two very importanttasks to undertake within the two-year time frame wehave set for ourselves.First  it is to return Fiji to constitutionaldemocracy and  secondly  it is to stabilize our economyand to lay the foundation for a return to sustainedgrowth and expansion with increased investment.I would like to take this opportunity to thank allthose Governments who have shown sympathy andunderstanding  who recognize the complexities of thesituation in Fiji as a multi-ethnic and multi-culturalsociety  and who readily accept that solutions to thepresent political crisis can be developed within Fiji  bythe people of Fiji themselves  without externalinterference in any form.With the end of the cold war and of the dualdivision it created in world order  it would seem that a2new form of imperialism has emerged along with itstwin-brother  neo-colonialism. As if the corrosiveinfluence and impact of their mass culture ofconsumerism and materialism are not enough  this newform of domination is being propagated by the puristsof the liberal democracies  in the name of goodgovernance  human rights  accountability andtransparency. In themselves  these are importantgeneral standards to ensure the integrity of the systemof Government in a country  and the just and fairtreatment of its citizens. But what is of concern is thatwe are being told to apply these standards and valuesof liberal democracy strictly according to theirstandards  without regard for the particular or complexcircumstances in each country.Our concern is that some of the fundamentalprinciples upon which this unique world Organizationwas founded 55 years ago are being eroded andviolated  the principles of respect for nationalsovereignty and of non-interference in the internalaffairs of an independent State.We appreciate that we now live in a closely inter-linked global community  and we are all part of onehumankind; we are children of one divine Creator. Wemust  therefore  be concerned about each other  aboutour common well being  and common basic standardsof rights and freedoms.This  however  does not give a country the rightto impose on another  its standards of democraticgovernance and what it perceives or considers to beright and acceptable.If  within each of our countries  we believe andaccept that civilized behaviour among the citizenry canonly be one based on mutual respect  mutualunderstanding  and a willingness to assist and supporteach other  why is it that some countries today shouldthink that these rules of civilized and respectfulbehaviour within a country  should not apply in theirdealings with other members of the internationalcommunity of nations.I have raised this point not only because we hereat the United Nations should be ever watchful of thisdisturbing negative trend  but also to remind my owncountry's friends and neighbours that stridency ofpolitical rhetoric  smart sanctions and threats of moresanctions will not really assist us in bringing about aspeedy and amicable resolution to our politicalsituation. In fact  the very opposite is true; they haveonly served to harden attitudes of one communityagainst the other. I  therefore  make a plea to Membersof the United Nations to show greater understanding of and sensitivity to  the complexities of the situation inFiji.We are a country of many communities and manycultures. All have contributed to Fiji's development.We have all accepted each other as citizens and ascommunities  and Fiji is our common and permanenthome.But we also have peculiar features  which beardirectly on inter-communal relationships within oursociety.We have a total population of around 800 000.Indigenous Fijians and Rotumans make up 52 per centand are growing at 1.8 per cent every year. The secondmajor ethnic group is our Indian community. Theymake up 43 per cent of the population  but with a lowbirth rate and emigration  this is continuing to decreaseat 0.3 per cent each year. The other communities in Fijiare Europeans  Chinese and Pacific Islanders.Ethnicity is only one basis of distinction anddifference in Fiji. Then there is land ownership. Theindigenous Fijians and Rotumans own  by custom  84per cent of all land in Fiji. Much of the best of this however  is on lease for various purposes  residential commercial and agricultural  and more than 60 per centof the tenants are members of our Indian community.Most of the agricultural leases are sugar cane farmingleases  and more than 75 per cent of these are held byIndian tenants  and most of these tenants have lived ontheir leased land for three generations.In our urban areas  the situation is the reverse.The majority of property owners  of businesses  ofthose in the professions  of those working for a regularincome  are non-Fijians and mostly Indians.In religion  more than 57 per cent of thepopulation  the indigenous Fijians and Rotumans  andthe other minority communities  are mostly Christians.On the other hand  the remaining 43 per cent  themembers of the Indian community mostly belong to theHindu  Muslim and other faiths.Then there are our culture and value systems.Indigenous Fijians and Rotumans have a hierarchicalsocial structure. Traditional hereditary chiefs andcommoners alike have their place and role in societyand are bound together by reciprocal obligations of3loyalty  obedience  and of sharing with  and caring for each other and everyone in the community. Fijiansvalue their democratic rights as individuals  but as acommunity they know their place in their traditionalsociety.In our Indian and other communities people aremuch more individually based. There is  therefore  agreater consciousness of and emphasis on individualrights and freedoms  the right to equality  theimportance of education  success in professional lifeand the security of property rights.We all live together side by side in Fiji  yet weremain apart  separated by our ethnicity  religion cultural differences and value systems. Wecommunicate with each other  not through thelanguages of our communities  but through the Englishlanguage. With regard to our general standards ofliving  even though indigenous Fijians and Rotumansown 84 per cent of the land in Fiji  they have  onaverage  the lowest level of household income  andthey also lag well behind the other communities inalmost every aspect of life in a rapidly expandingmarket-based economy.I have explained all this to highlight the delicateand sensitive nature of our multi-ethnic andmulticultural society in Fiji. The crux of our politicalcrisis in Fiji is that the indigenous Fijian and Rotumancommunities felt threatened by certain policies whichthe non-indigenous leadership of the People's CoalitionGovernment had implemented following their decisivevictory in our national elections in May 1999. It wasthis fear and anxiety about their future as the world'sonly indigenous Fijian and Rotuman community of justover 420 000 people that led to mass demonstrationsand ultimately the coup d'Ètat on 19 May this year. Italso manifested itself in the mass looting of shops  thedestruction of property and threats to people and theirfamilies. Unfortunately  and tragically  the victimswere mainly members of our Indian community.It was in this serious and deteriorating law andorder situation that the Fiji military forces responded toa request from our police to take direct control of lawand order and the protection of citizens. To facilitatethis  on 29 May the Fiji military forces abrogated our1997 Constitution.However  as the civilian interim Administration we have ourselves taken over from the army  and  as Ihave said  we are firmly committed to returning Fiji toconstitutional parliamentary democracy. We intend topromulgate a new constitution in August next year.General elections will then follow within 12 months.The new constitution is to be prepared by a constitutioncommission  which we shall appoint early next month.It will be representative of all our communities andwill consult widely throughout the country  giving thepublic at large every opportunity to submit their adviceand recommendations on the new constitution.I should also mention a new initiative I havetaken to deal with the inter-ethnic crisis in Fiji: theestablishment of a Ministry of National Reconciliationand Unity  together with a Council for NationalReconciliation and Unity. It is my sincere hope that theCouncil will bring together the representatives of thevarious communities in our rich  multicultural society as well as representatives of the various sections of thewider community  including employers  trade unionsand civil society  to discuss and makerecommendations on various ways by which we canpromote greater intercommunal understanding andcooperation.What we have realized is that it is not enoughsimply to focus attention on the constitution as theframework for our different communities in Fiji to livetogether peacefully and harmoniously. We need to domore. We have to build and reinforce foundations forliving together in all aspects of our lives in our multi-ethnic and multicultural society. We are making goodprogress in education  and proposals are now underconsideration to broaden the curriculum in schools toinclude compulsory study of the Fijian language  Fijianculture and the ethno-history and ethno-geography ofFiji. We also need to encourage and promote moresocial interaction and cohesion at the neighbourhoodand community level. Most important  it is my sincerehope that the Council for National Reconciliation andUnity will develop a consensus on national leadershipand power-sharing in Fiji. I believe sincerely that themost enduring foundation for unity in Fiji is one that isbuilt in a spirit of give and take  of justice and fairnessfor all and of responsibility for one another.Very recently the United Nations launched aDecade  from January 1995 to December 2004  on thetheme  Indigenous people: a new partnership  whichseeks the formation of new relationships  founded onmutual respect and understanding between indigenouspeoples and States and the United Nations. In thecontext of Fiji  what we hope to build is a new4partnership between the indigenous Fijian andRotuman communities and the other communities  asthe basis of living together in our multi-ethnic andmulticultural society in the twenty-first century.I again assure the international community thatwithin the two years of our transitional Administrationwe shall return Fiji to constitutional democracy. A newconstitution will address the concerns of indigenousFijians and Rotumans about their future. At the sametime  however  it will also maintain and protect theequal fundamental rights and freedoms of all citizensand groups  without distinction on the basis ofethnicity  religion  culture  gender  or economic andsocial status.Indeed  as the interim Prime Minister in thetransitional Administration in Fiji  I am committed tobuilding a united Fiji with a multi-ethnic andmulticultural society in which all the differentcommunities can live together in peace  harmony andprosperity  in which the aspirations of the Fijians andRotumans are realized and the paramountcy of theirinterests is secure and in which the provision ofimportant social services  such as education and health to all our communities is a priority  so that the qualityof life and standard of living of all our people arecontinuously improving.Fiji commends and supports the Brahimi report(A/55/305) on peacekeeping. It is a timely andthoughtful report which  if implemented  willconsiderably enhance the ability of the United Nationsto carry out its peacekeeping tasks. With regard toFiji's continuing participation in United Nationspeacekeeping activities  I am pleased to confirm ourpositive response to the Secretary-General's request fora further increase in our troops serving in the UnitedNations Interim Force in Lebanon. In that connection  Icommend the efforts of all those involved in theMiddle East peace process. Fiji earnestly hopes that thenegotiations will be successful in resolvinglongstanding differences and bring about long-termpeace in the region.We in Fiji have been greatly inspired by thepositive developments on the Korean peninsula  withthe growing rapprochement between the South and theNorth. We express the hope that the same spirit ofgoodwill and readiness to enter into dialogue will alsospread to the great country of China  between thePeople's Republic of China and Taiwan. With regard tothe very important country of Japan  I reaffirm Fiji'ssupport for Japan's admission as a permanent memberof the Security Council.The Secretary-General's report (A/54/2000)  Wethe Peoples has inspired the entire United Nationscommunity with its vision of a more humane and moreholistic future for our children and our world. We agreeentirely that the United Nations should focus not juston the relationship between and among States  but increasingly  on the well-being and development of thepeoples of this world.Once again  I extend my congratulations to you Mr. President  and best wishes for a successfulMillennium Assembly."
"56",2427,"FRA",55,2000,"I havethe honour of speaking this year on behalf of theEuropean Union  which France is presiding over untilthe end of December.In this capacity  it is a great pleasure for me tocongratulate the President on his election. Itsymbolizes the respect the international community hasboth for his country and for himself.I would also like to thank your predecessor  Mr.Theo-Ben Gurirab  for his skill in guiding theproceedings of the fifty-fourth session of the GeneralAssembly  Mr. Sam Nujoma and Ms. Tarja Halonen fortheir work with you  Mr. President  as Co-Chairpersonsof the Millennium Summit.19I would like to commend the Secretary-Generalof the Organization  Mr. Kofi Annan. His internationalaction  his independence and his vision have made adecisive contribution to asserting the key role theUnited Nations plays and must continue to play. TheEuropean Union wishes to assure him of its support forhis work and for the Organization and itsrepresentatives.The Millennium Summit  an unprecedentedgathering of 155 heads of State and Government allowed us to address the main challenges facing theworld community and the role of the United Nations inthe twenty-first century  which will begin on 1 January2001.The Union notes with great satisfaction that theSummit produced a political document setting forth aroad-map for the Organization for the years to come.These guidelines are based on ideas outlined in theSecretary-General's report. It is now up to the GeneralAssembly to implement them. The Union willcontribute actively to this.Peacekeeping  strengthening internationalsecurity and defending human rights are the centralprinciples underpinning the European Union's foreignpolicy. Recent crises on Europe's very doorstep haveconvinced us that we cannot remain idle when thesefundamental principles are violated. In this regard  theEuropean Union approves of the priority given topeacekeeping during last week's meetings. Mr.Brahimi's report offers an in-depth analysis on thissubject. It presents useful recommendations for themandates of peacekeeping operations  operationalplanning in New York and deployment. It presents aunique opportunity to strengthen the United Nationscapacity for peace operations. The European Unionwill actively participate in considering theserecommendations.The Union has decided to equip itself to be amajor political actor and to play its full role on theinternational stage. To this end  and within a very shorttime-frame  it has undertaken decisive measures. Newdecision-making  action-oriented political and militarybodies have been set up: a political and securitycommittee  a military committee  a European Unionmilitary staff  a situation centre and a committee forcivilian crisis management. These bodies will enablethe European Union to intervene quickly and crediblyin the management of international crises.The European Union has also announced itsintention to establish by 2003 a force of 60 000 troopsfor international missions involving the whole range ofconflict-prevention and crisis-management operations with the requisite air and naval support for deploymentwithin 60 days for a period of at least one year. Thisautumn there will be a conference for the commitmentof capability at which each Member State shall pledgeits contribution to this joint endeavour.The Union has also set ambitious and realistictargets for developing collective capabilities. Inaddition to its military resources  it will developcivilian intervention capabilities  including a corps ofcivilian police  whose contribution to peacekeeping isinvaluable. In this connection  Member States have setthemselves the goal of being able  by 2003  to provideup to 5 000 police officers  1 000 of whom will bedeployment-ready within 30 days.These decisions now enable the European Unionto complement its already sizeable economic andhumanitarian programmes with the full range ofresources required for crisis management. Of course these activities are designed in full respect for theprinciples of the United Nations Charter. Now morethan ever  it is vital to establish working ties with theUnited Nations. To initiate this cooperation  theEuropean Union troika will discuss this issue for thefirst time with the Secretary-General. On behalf of theEuropean Union  I hereby invite Mr. Kofi Annan to goto Brussels for a working meeting with the organs ofthe Union.The European Union hails the considerableefforts and determination shown by the President of thePalestinian Authority and the Israeli Prime Ministerduring recent negotiations to reach a final agreementbetween the Israeli and Palestinian peoples. Wewelcome in particular the renewed vigour with whichvery sensitive issues have been addressed at this time.We commend President Clinton and the Secretaryof State for their unflagging efforts to facilitatenegotiations. Circumstances favourable to reconcilingpositions continue to exist. We urge the parties to seizethis historic opportunity  show courage in decisivechoices  take fully into account human realities and therecognized rights of all  and thereby achieve a finalagreement.The European Union welcomes Israel'swithdrawal from the zone it occupied in southern20Lebanon. It welcomes the redeployment of the UnitedNations Interim Force in Lebanon and the presence of ajoint security force  sent to the area by the LebaneseGovernment. It urges all parties to fulfil theirresponsibilities in order to defuse tensions. TheEuropean Union believes that only a comprehensivesettlement encompassing every track of the peaceprocess  including the Israeli-Syrian track  is likely toguarantee lasting stability in the region. It will continueto support the efforts of the parties to this end andcontribute to the implementation of any agreementsthat may be reached.Turning to Europe  the situation in the westernBalkans is a matter of serious concern to the entireinternational community. Ten years of conflict haveravaged the region  leading to severe human sufferingand to politically unstable and therefore dangeroussituations. But beyond accumulated hardships and thelagging economic and social development of many ofthose countries  all of the peoples and nearly all of theleaders of the region have realized that it does have afuture  and that future is Europe. Today  all Europeansnow share the belief that these countries are bound oneday to join the European Union.This is why the European Council has reiteratedthat its goal is to firmly attach the countries of theregion to Europe. This means the greatest possibleintegration into the political  economic and socialcurrents of Europe through the stabilization andassociation process  political dialogue  tradeliberalization  the harmonization of their laws withthose of the European Union  and cooperation in justiceand domestic affairs.The assistance provided by the European Unionto countries of the region over the last 10 years —nearly 8 billion euros — is considerable. The EuropeanUnion will continue to sustain this stabilization andassociation process by providing the western Balkancountries with massive technical  economic andfinancial assistance and by granting them asymmetricaltrade advantages in farming and industry very soon which will pave the way for the creation of a free tradezone with the European Union. In the context ofelections concerning almost the entire region  we willencourage them to develop regional cooperation and tocontinue to make determined efforts for political economic and social reform in order to consolidatedemocracy and human rights  to build the rule of lawand lay the groundwork for sustainable development.In this context  the European Union has reaffirmed itsdetermination to continue to be the driving force in theStability Pact for South-eastern Europe  whichrepresents a new vision of cooperation between thecountries of the region and the internationalcommunity.The summit to be held shortly in Croatia of theEuropean Union and the Western Balkan countries —on the basis of a French proposal — will signal ourcommon resolve to overcome the divisions of the past.The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will not beable to participate in the conference  as the nature of itspresent regime does not allow it to do so. But the Serbsknow that they have their place in the European familyand that the European Union is looking forward to theday when the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is in aposition to participate fully in the stabilization andassociation process and to recover its rightful place inEurope. The elections to be held on 24 Septembercould be decisive in this respect.In Kosovo the international community  acting onthe basis of Security Council resolution 1244 (1999) has achieved praiseworthy results. Thanks must begiven to all those who have made this possible in spiteof enormous difficulties  especially the SpecialRepresentative of the Secretary-General  the UnitedNations staff and the Kosovo Force soldiers  the manyinternational organizations there on the ground and thenon-governmental organizations. The first democraticmunicipal elections in Kosovo  to be held in a fewweeks' time  will constitute a major step in theimplementation of resolution 1244 (1999). I wouldforcefully reiterate that the international communitywill not allow unacceptable acts of violence  whatevertheir motivation  to cause the democratic electoralprocess under way to fail. We will not let extremistsfrom whatever faction sabotage the work accomplishedover the past year under the auspices of the UnitedNations.The European Union considers the status quo inCyprus unacceptable  and it supports the efforts of theSecretary-General to reach a negotiated comprehensive  fair and lasting settlement consistentwith relevant Security Council resolutions. It reiteratesits commitment to stability and prosperity throughoutthe Mediterranean region. With talks beginning righthere under the auspices of the Secretary-General  it21invites the parties concerned to enter into substantivetalks.The European Union is equally determined in itssupport for efforts to prevent and settle conflicts inAfrica  in close cooperation with the United Nations the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and othersubregional organizations and in accordance with theobjectives agreed at the Africa-Europe Summit  heldlast April in Cairo under the Portuguese presidency ofthe European Union. It will lend its backing to themeasures taken jointly by the OAU and the UnitedNations to implement the peace settlement betweenEthiopia and Eritrea. In supporting the deployment ofinternational observers  the European Union is alsowilling to lend its support to the establishment anddemarcation of borders  to demining and to assistanceto refugees and displaced persons. It is endeavouring toprovide assistance to the war-stricken populations ofboth countries  whose immense suffering has beencompounded by drought.The European Union is deeply concerned by thedevelopments in the Democratic Republic of theCongo. It calls on all parties to the Lusaka Agreementto implement their commitments  including those madeat Kampala. This will allow for progress with respectto the military and political provisions  all of which areunder threat due to the continued fighting and thedeadlock in preparing for a national dialogue. It alsourges them to abide by the relevant Security Councilresolutions  in particular resolution 1304 (2000)  whichcalls for an orderly withdrawal of foreign forces fromCongolese territory and for the cooperation of allparties in the deployment of the United NationsOrganization Mission in the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo (MONUC) through the lifting of restrictionson the freedom of movement of MONUC personneland by ensuring their security.The illegal exploitation of the natural resources ofthe Democratic Republic of the Congo  a violation ofthe country's sovereignty  is also unacceptable. TheEuropean Union therefore commends the establishmentby the Secretary-General on 15 August last of a groupof experts in charge of analysing ties between theillegal exploitation of those riches and the continuationof the conflict.We are pleased to note greater awareness aboutthe illicit trade in diamonds and other minerals  whichdirectly fuels conflicts. This is the case in particularwith the illicit trade in diamonds in Angola  wherebyUNITA has been funding its war effort. We underscorethe importance of complying with Security Councilresolutions on this matter. We welcome the decision toplace this important question on the GeneralAssembly's agenda. The discussion should be based onthe Kimberley process. It should reflect the work of thepreparatory conference co-chaired by the UnitedKingdom and Russia. Lastly  it should examine theproposal made at Miyazaki to establish a standinggroup of independent experts to formulate ways ofpreventing illicit trade.The European Union reiterates its support forresolution 1306 (2000) on Sierra Leone  whichtightened existing arms sanctions and established anembargo on raw diamonds illegally exported fromSierra Leone. The European Union calls on all theparties to the conflict to comply with the principles andobjectives of the Lomé Agreement and to be fullyinvolved in the re-establishment of peace and stabilityand compliance with human rights in Sierra Leone.The European Union and its member States willcontinue to contribute to African capacity and means ofaction in conflict prevention and resolution  inparticular through support for the OAU andsubregional organizations and initiatives.The European Union is deeply concerned at thesituation in Myanmar. It asks the Myanmar authoritiesto immediately restore Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi'sfreedom of speech  movement and communication withthe outside. It is urgent for dialogue to begin betweenthe Myanmar authorities and the democraticopposition  including the National League forDemocracy and national minorities. The Unionsupports the Secretary-General's Special Envoy forBurma  Mr. Razali  in his efforts to find a solution.The European Union expresses its solidarity withthe people of East Timor and commends the work doneby the United Nations Transitional Administration inEast Timor (UNTAET) in close cooperation with thepolitical authorities of East Timor. It is in favour ofaccelerating reconstruction assistance in order toguarantee a successful transition and avoid any delay inthe timetable leading to independence.We are extremely concerned by the instabilitycaused by the militias in both East and West Timor.The new outbreaks of violence by them have taken thelives of two “blue beret” peacekeepers and  more22recently  of three personnel of the Office of the UnitedNations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).The European Union calls on the Indonesian authoritiesto adopt effective measures to control the militiaswithout delay.The European Union also calls for the terminationof terrorist activity in Kashmir  the implementation ofconfidence- and security-building measures and strictrespect for the line of control in order to restore apeaceful local climate and enable the dialogue betweenPakistan and India to resume in the spirit of the LahoreDeclaration. The European Union will be lookingclosely for such signs from the parties involved andwill encourage initiatives likely to resolve all thedisputes between the two countries.It is important for the specific measures laiddown in Security Council resolution 1172 (1998) to beimplemented and for Pakistan and India to subscribe tothe international non-proliferation regime and sign theComprehensive Test Ban Treaty.Having advocated direct dialogue between thetwo Koreas for many years  the European Unionwelcomes the historic inter-Korean Summit that tookplace in Pyongyang from 13-15 June this year. This isan important step on the road to reconciliation betweenthe Republic of Korea and the Democratic People'sRepublic of Korea  opening bright prospects forstrengthening the stability of the region. We invite thetwo countries  who have been members of the UnitedNations since 1991  to continue this process in order tohelp the Korean people heal the wounds of the past.On the subject of Haiti  the European Unionrecalls that full respect for the constitutional provisionsconcerning the elections and electoral legislationcurrently in force is the basis of democracy and the ruleof law.The threat of proliferation of weapons of massdestruction and their delivery systems is a crucial issuethat the European Union — which shares the concernfor international peace and security that ought toinspire the nations represented here — is resolved tocombat relentlessly. To this end  internationalcooperation must be stressed  along with thedevelopment of multilateral standards for non-proliferation  arms control and disarmament.This is particularly true of chemical andbiological weapons  which have now been banned. TheUnion is working towards the early conclusion of aprotocol containing reliable and effective verificationmeasures to strengthen the 1972 Convention on theProhibition of the Development  Production andStockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and ToxinWeapons and on their Destruction. We are equallydetermined to ensure nuclear non-proliferation anddisarmament  where so much progress has been madesince the signing of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferationof Nuclear Weapons (NPT)  to which 187 States arenow parties.Since the end of the cold war  effectiveinstruments for ending the arms race and achievingdisarmament have begun to see the light of day  withthe halt to testing  the treaty enshrining it  the first twoSTART agreements to reduce the largest nucleararsenals and a host of unilateral decisions following thesame trend. Our priority must be to consolidate thismechanism. A start was made with the ReviewConferences of 1995 and 2000; the results  which wewelcome  must be fully implemented.We must give full weight to strengthening thesafeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency(IAEA) through the widespread implementation of themeasures contained in the 1997 Model Protocol and toremain alert to the issue of NPT compliance. We mustalso revive the momentum of the multilateralnegotiations.The entry into force of the Comprehensive TestBan Treaty  the completion of the operational readinessof the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization(CTBTO) and the negotiation at the DisarmamentConference of a fissile material cut-off treaty are allnecessary steps that are of concern and ought tomobilize all States  be they parties to the NPT or not.The start of this negotiation implies urgent negotiationson a working programme in the Conference onDisarmament. International standards in this field canonly be effective if they are universal. Arsenalreductions  which are the prime responsibility of thenuclear-weapon States  must also be continued. Thiswill enable us to move closer to our commonobjectives — namely  the elimination of nuclearweapons and general  comprehensive disarmamentunder strict and effective international control.The issue of small arms and light weapons is justas sensitive in many regions of the world. It deservesspecial attention. The 15 European Union members23will contribute to the preparation of the United NationsConference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms andLight Weapons in All Its Aspects  which will take placeduring the summer of 2001  with the objective ofobtaining a positive and enforceable plan of action tocombat the destabilizing accumulation and spread ofsmall arms and light weapons. At the same time  theUnion shall continue its drive for the implementationof the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use Stockpiling  Production and Transfer of Anti-PersonnelMines and on their Destruction. It will join in theefforts to achieve the total elimination of anti-personnel mines.On the very important subject of human rights the European Union will continue to support the effortsof the United Nations to reach the goal set by theSecretary-General to put human rights at the heart ofevery aspect of its work. The best guarantee of solidprogress in this area is each person's awareness of theimportance of human rights and democracy and theemergence of groups who actively promote them inevery country. In this connection  the European Unionwelcomes the designation  thanks to the support ofmany countries  of the Special Representative of theSecretary-General on Human Rights Defenders  Ms.Jilani; we welcome her appointment and assure her ofour full backing as she undertakes her duties.This year the United Nations has once againdemonstrated that it is the main forum of progress insetting standards for human rights  as witnessed by theadoption of two optional protocols to the Conventionon the Rights of the Child on the sexual exploitation ofchildren and on children in armed conflicts. Thisrepresents a major step forward in favour of theprotection of children. The European Union intends tocontribute actively to the special session of the UnitedNations General Assembly for the follow-up to theWorld Children's Summit  to be held next year  whichwill give the international community yet anotheropportunity to help this cause move forward.Another important task  the World ConferenceAgainst Racism  Racial Discrimination  Xenophobiaand Related Intolerance  lies ahead. At the EuropeanPreparatory Conference  to be held in October underthe auspices of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg the European Union will demonstrate its commitmentto combat all expressions of racism  whatever formthey take. The Union  all of whose members haveabolished the death penalty  calls on States that havenot yet done so to adopt a moratorium as a first steptowards the eventual abolition of this punishment which is contrary to human dignity.The European Union will endeavour to strengtheninternational cooperation in the fight against terrorismand will play an active role in the negotiations to beheld to that end. It earnestly hopes that this GeneralAssembly will adopt the Convention AgainstTransnational Organized Crime and its Protocols at thePalermo Conference next December. Given that suchcrime  that one of its most odious manifestations is thetrafficking in human beings  and that it poses an ever-growing threat to our societies  it is vital for theinternational community to develop the means tocooperate and fight against it effectively.Lastly  the European Union looks forward to theearly establishment of the International Criminal Court.I would like to recall that ratification by 42 States isstill needed for this.By way of conclusion  I would like to stress onelast point  and that is sustainable development. TheEuropean Union's contribution to internationalcooperation is substantial. With 30 per cent of theglobal gross domestic product  the Union contributes36 per cent of the United Nations regular budget and39 per cent of the peacekeeping budget. As you know it also contributes the rather large amount of around 55per cent of the world total of official developmentassistance. We are pleased with everything that wassaid last week on this extremely important matter  andwe will continue our exemplary work on sustainabledevelopment. Indeed  we believe that development isone of the key ways of resolving all of the problemsfacing us throughout the world  as outlined in mystatement  and the European Union wishes to expressits strong  continuing commitment to that end."
"57",2452,"FSM",55,2000,"I would like totake this opportunity to congratulate the President onhis assumption of the presidency of the fifty-fifthsession of the General Assembly.I have the honour to speak on behalf of themembers of the Pacific Island Forum group ofcountries at the United Nations  comprising Australia Fiji  Kiribati  Marshall Islands  Nauru  New Zealand Palau  Papua New Guinea  Samoa  the SolomonIslands  Tonga  Tuvalu  Vanuatu and my own country Micronesia.It is with pride that I congratulate and extend awarm welcome to our Pacific Island neighbour Tuvaluinto the United Nations family. The members of ourgroup may vary greatly in land and ocean areas population  resource endowment  economicdevelopment  social structures  languages and cultures but we share a common goal for the Pacific  based onsecurity and stability  as well as prosperity andeconomic opportunities for its peoples  and thesustainability of resources. Within the same context thePacific Islands Forum countries represented in NewYork reaffirm their commitment to play a supportiverole in the United Nations decolonization programmesin respect of the remaining non-self-governingterritories in the Pacific.The Pacific Ocean occupies a central place in thelives of the people of the Pacific Islands. Preservationof this resource — which contains the world's highestmarine diversity — is critical to our future economicdevelopment. The vast oceanic area under the controlof our members is rich in fishing potential but requirescareful management and monitoring to address illegal unregulated and unreported fishing and otherenvironmental threats. A major achievement for us andour distant-water fishing partners is the conventionrecently adopted by the Multilateral High-LevelConference on the Conservation and Management ofHighly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western andCentral Pacific  which will protect the world's lastgreat tuna fishery.The first meeting of the United Nations Open-ended Informal Consultative Process on Oceans andLaw of the Sea  under the co-chairmanship of theAmbassador of Samoa  promises to serve as a vital partof the preparatory process for the General Assembly'sconsideration of ocean issues. The ocean prioritiesidentified by the Pacific Island Forum includeratification of the United Nations Convention on theLaw of the Sea and the United Nations agreement onfish stocks; marine scientific research and technicalassistance; and the delimitation of maritime zones including continental shelves.The world's security environment has becomemore fluid and uncertain with new and emergingthreats. Events this year show that a reputation forstability and peace are by no means guaranteed in thePacific. In light of the political crisis in Fiji and thesocial unrest in the Solomon Islands  Foreign Ministersof the Forum met in Samoa in August. They recognizedthe need for regional action to be taken on the basis ofall members being part of the Pacific Islands extendedfamily. In doing so the Forum must demonstrate that itis prepared constructively to address difficult andsensitive issues  including the underlying causes oftensions and conflicts  such as ethnicity  socio-economic disparities  lack of good governance  landdisputes and erosion of cultural values. Accordingly they decided to recommend to the Pacific Island Forummeeting in Tarawa  Kiribati  that leaders committhemselves and their countries to a number offundamental principles and courses of actions including the following: belief in liberty of theindividual under the law  equal rights for all citizensregardless of gender  race  colour  creed  political beliefand in the individual's inalienable right to participateby means of a free and democratic political process inframing the society in which he or she lives; upholdingdemocratic processes and institutions which reflectnational and local circumstances  including thepeaceful transfer of power  the rule of law and theindependence of the judiciary  just and honestgovernment and recognizing the importance andurgency of equitable economic  social and culturaldevelopment to satisfy the basic needs and aspirationsof the people of the Forum.The ministers established a working group todevelop these principles  and options for action incases where the principles have been violated  forconsideration by Forum leaders when they meet inKiribati.In addition to increasing incidents of civil unrest the region is facing new threats from international financial and cyber crime and people-smuggling  as27well as the challenge of preventing and controllingcommunicable diseases and the HIV/AIDS pandemic.The threat associated with uncontrolled access to evena small number of weapons was brought into starkrelief in the region recently  adding weight to theForum leaders' decision in 1997 to put in placeregional cooperation and a legal framework to controlthe spread of weapons in the region. This approach isin step with international efforts to combat the illicittrade in small arms  particularly in the lead-up to the2001 United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade inSmall Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects.Work on a legal framework has progressed to a pointwhere we expect draft legislation to be circulatedamong Forum island countries before the end of thisyear.We in the Pacific retain a close relationship  inboth economic and cultural terms  with our naturalenvironment. We therefore maintain a keen interest inthe development of the Environmental VulnerabilityIndex. We thank the several Governments that havekindly committed substantial funds for the completionof the third phase of the studies being conducted by theSouth Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission(SOPAC)  and encourage its adoption by the UnitedNations so that the environmental and natural risks thatour members face are recognized when consideration isgiven to eligibility for concessional aid  trade treatmentand least-developed-country status.Agenda 21 and the Barbados Programme ofAction for the Sustainable Development of SmallIsland Developing States remain the basic guideline forprotecting the environment and achieving sustainabledevelopment. Steady progress is required in thepreparations for the 10-year review of the UnitedNations Conference on the Environment andDevelopment  to take place in 2002. We give highpriority to international efforts to have the KyotoProtocol come into force at the earliest possible date.We are thus committed to achieving a successfuloutcome to the sixth session of the Conference of theParties to the United Nations Framework Conventionon Climate Change  to be held in November. Wewelcome the formulation of specific tools  such as theClean Development Mechanism  which promise to beuseful in enabling island countries to do our part tocombat climate change and to adapt to its consequenceswithin the parameters of our own nationalcircumstances.Strengthened efforts are being made in the regionto build capacity to understand and respond to climatechange  including through observational networks. Thesmall island nations of the Pacific face uniqueconstraints on development. Most have smallsubsistence-based economies with a narrow exportbase. Forum economic ministers meeting in Julyreconfirmed their commitment to the process ofeconomic reform  based on the principle of goodgovernance  with the aim of providing a soundeconomic basis upon which social development cantake place.The World Trade Organization (WTO) remainsthe world's most significant international opportunityfor the negotiation of trade and commercial issues. ThePacific Island Forum has agreed to establish a Forumdelegation in Geneva and a working group of Forumtrade officials to improve cooperation in the WTO andto actively engage in the policy debate about the bestway to enhance the role of the WTO in contributing todevelopment. We recognize the importance of findingways to ensure that trade reform delivers outcomeswhich will contribute not only to economic growth  butalso to the advancement of development and socialequity objectives and improved environmentaloutcomes.The global information economy promises greatopportunities  particularly for those in isolated areassuch as the Pacific  but it also demands new skills andtechnology. Efficient and effective communicationsservices  including a dedicated modern network systemlike the Small Island Developing States Network(SIDSNET)  are of critical importance in achievingeconomic and social development and overcoming theconstraints resulting from the relatively high coststructures of telecommunication networks for Forumisland countries. A Forum vision for the Pacificinformation economy seeks to develop an appropriatemechanism for the cooperation of regional regulatorsand relevant organizations. Education and training areof fundamental importance to enhancing theadaptability of Pacific islanders to economic reform ina rapidly changing world and region. By supportingeducation  the United Nations can help overcome oneof the major obstacles to economic growth and povertyreduction.The United Nations system continues to play avital role in protecting the interests of small islandStates  such as most of the members of the Pacific28Island Forum. It is essential that the United Nationsremain strong by adapting to meet new challenges suchas globalization. At the same time  the central role ofthe General Assembly  with its universal membership should be strengthened. The Security Council shouldbe made more representative  transparent anddemocratic so as to be able to respond to therequirements of a fundamentally different internationalsetting. It needs to be reformed comprehensively tomeet contemporary demands and the conditions of theworld today.We welcome the Brahimi report (A/55/305) andlook forward to the strengthening of the ability of theUnited Nations to carry out its key peacekeeping role.To fulfil its collective security responsibilities  theUnited Nations must be afforded strong and sustainedpolitical support  together with financial andinstitutional resources. An integral element is a moreequitable scale for determining peacekeeping funding.The Pacific Island Forum group remainscommitted to ensuring an effective United Nations.Programme of work"
"58",2495,"GAB",55,2000,"I welcomethe opportunity and the honour afforded me to speak onbehalf of Gabon at this session of the Assembly which although a regular one  is no less an exceptional one.Indeed  not only does this session prepare us toenter fully into the third millennium but also  andabove all  it is being held at a time in the history ofhumankind that gives rise to new encouragingprospects in the minds of men throughout the world fora better future.This is why  Mr. President  we welcome yourelection to the presidency of the fifty-fifth session ofthe Assembly.We are in fact convinced that your qualities as astatesman and your wealth of personal experience are aguarantee for the success of our work.With this in view  Gabon  as a Vice-President will give you its full cooperation so that this sessionmight effectively meet our expectations.I am pleased to express my deep gratitude to yourpredecessor  Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  Minister forForeign Affairs of the Republic of Namibia  for theefficient way in which he discharged his mandate.We  in our turn  would like to warmly welcomethe State of Tuvalu  which has just joined the greatfamily of the United Nations.I should like to pay a sincere tribute to ourSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for his steadfastefforts to realize the ideals of our Organization.It has been 55 years since We the peoples of theUnited Nations decided to maintain internationalpeace and security  to achieve international cooperationin solving international economic and social problemsand in encouraging respect for human rights andfundamental freedoms without distinction as to race language or religion.These are the primary missions set out in theUnited Nations Charter  which  in Article 55 recommends the creation of conditions of stability andwell-being necessary for peaceful and friendly relationsamong  and  I would add  within  nations.The San Francisco Charter clearly established aclose correlation between peace and development.Indeed  without peace there can be no development and without development there can be no just andlasting peace. We acknowledge that it is difficult tocreate conditions of increased prosperity for thegreatest number in an environment where chaos anddisorder reign. In this regard  the case of Africa isparticularly revealing. When  after the end of the coldwar  the world seemed to be developing towards apromising situation because of the gradual reduction ofinter-State conflicts  the African continent suddenlyfell victim to armed confrontations of unprecedentedviolence. Dormant antagonisms have been reawakened with the primary manifestation being the clash of armsand disdain for fundamental humanitarian norms.Several of our countries have come under theyoke of warlords and become chaotic  ungovernableentities that now require humanitarian assistance.Despite the 50 or so peacekeeping operations that it hasundertaken since the creation of the United Nations the Security Council has shown its limitations in theface of crises  especially in Africa. The DemocraticRepublic of the Congo  Angola  Sierra Leone andSomalia are all cases that  in recent memory  have putthe solidarity of the United Nations to the test.In the area of development  the world has seenunprecedented economic progress in the past 55 years.Countries that were underdeveloped not very long agohave become dynamic centres of world economicactivity. But there is another fact: the vast majority ofour countries and peoples remain desperately poor.In his message to commemorate the World Day ofPeace  His Holiness Pope John Paul II wrote At the beginning of a new century  the oneissue which most challenges our human andChristian consciences is the poverty of countlessmillions of men and women.According to the report (A/55/1) of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization dated2030 August 2000  almost half of the world's populationmust content itself with living on less than $2 perperson per day. So it is that 300 million Africans do nothave even $1 a day on which to subsist. Furthermore this poverty is being made worse  in particular by therapid spread of AIDS  another scourge that hasravaged  brought suffering to  divided and decimatedentire families in Africa and throughout the world. Insome African countries  AIDS has even become themain cause of death.These are factors for destabilization. While theyare all different  together they create disorder and makeinternational relations uncertain. But I do not intendmerely to provide a list of all the evils with which theAssembly is only too well acquainted and the UnitedNations is constantly dealing. Nor should we neglectthe efforts undertaken and the progress achieved.Rather  I should like to stress  here I am inagreement with the Assembly  that the UnitedNations and the multilateral system do not havesufficient resources to face these major challenges. Wehave been working at this for a long time now. Wecannot now give in to discouragement. We are duty-bound to give the necessary impetus to our action.How are we to do this? First  by moving from aculture of war to a genuine culture of peace. Gabon'sdedication to the ideal of peace  which is a constantelement of its foreign policy  draws its strength fromthe same roots as the Bantu civilization. We have aduty to give pride of place to the virtues of dialogueand tolerance among peoples and nations  virtuesthat we practise in our homes and families  and that mycountry  through the personal intercession of PresidentOmar Bongo  a tireless mediator  has made into aprinciple of political and diplomatic culture.We must therefore return to our roots. That is  weshould go back to those traditional precepts that havegreater force today than ever before  given that today peace is most often threatened not from outside ourterritories but from within. We must adapt the UnitedNations Charter to these new situations  in particularby adjusting the mandate of the Security Council withregard to internal crises.It is in this context that we welcome the issuanceof the report of the Panel on United Nations PeaceOperations  presided over by Mr. Brahimi. We areconvinced that this report will help to promote a newapproach to peacekeeping operations. Althoughpeacekeeping operations are necessary as a means ofresponding  they are nevertheless insufficient. What isat stake in the third millennium is not simply theachievement of ceasefires among adversaries in openconflicts  but the ability to nip conflicts in the budthrough action designed to eliminate the deep-rootedcauses of violence.An important step would be the creation orstrengthening of regional security machinery to allowus to resolve conflicts through dialogue andnegotiation  thus enabling us to considerably reducemilitary expenditure and allocate the resources therebyreleased to other development needs.At the subregional level  therefore  Gabon iscontributing  in cooperation with the other States ofCentral Africa  to the establishment of a climate ofconfidence after implementing preventive diplomacy.The heads of State of our subregion have  forexample  set up the Council for Peace and Security inCentral Africa (COPAX)  a body for military andpolitical cooperation between the member States of theEconomic Community of Central African States  topromote measures to maintain and consolidate peaceand security. COPAX has a multinational force forCentral Africa and an early-warning mechanism forCentral Africa.The Gabonese Government has taken practicaland financial steps for the effective start of MARAC'sactivities  for which it is the headquarters. However  itgoes without saying that it is with the support of theUnited Nations and other partners that this instrumentwill play its role fully.In a broader regional context  a similarframework for joint action  cooperation  development prevention  management and conflict resolution  theGulf of Guinea commission  made up of neighbouringNigeria and seven coastal central African States  wascreated on 19 November 1999 in Libreville.Finally  it is important to strength the multilateraldisarmament and non-proliferation machinery. Gabon which ratified the Convention banning anti-personnellandmines  the Convention banning chemical weaponsand the Treaty banning nuclear testing  will continue toactively support international disarmament efforts byencouraging the process that has been set in motion ofcombating the illicit trade in light arms and smallweapons. The convening  in the summer of 2001  of an21international conference on that trade is important since it is quite clear that most conflicts in Africa andelsewhere in the world are fed by traffickers in arms drugs and diamonds  and are supported by  amongother things  a number of major multinationalcorporations that benefit from ill-gotten gains providing arms and drugs to the conflict zones andparticipating in money-laundering operations.We also unreservedly support the creation of theInternational Criminal Court  and strongly advocate therapid entry into force of the Rome Statute.With regard to strengthening the fight againstpoverty and the initiation of new cooperation in theservice of development  the African continent acceptsthat it bears the primary responsibility for its economicrecovery and that success in this task depends mainlyon its own efforts. But  at a time when the world ishappily entering the twenty-first century  Africa marginalized  is prey to destitution and poverty. Thescope of the crisis it is experiencing and the importanceof the resources to be made available require that theinternational community support its efforts throughincreased concessional resources  expansion ofcommerce and trade and debt relief.Cooperation on this painful issue of poverty wasdiscussed last January in Libreville by the heads ofState and Government of sub-Saharan Africa and theBretton Woods institutions  at a conference where anew approach to poverty eradication was proposed with a target date of 2015. During that economicsummit the heads of State and Government maderecommendations on considering the continent'sprospects at the dawn of the new millennium and onthe challenges to be faced in speeding up economicgrowth and eradicating poverty.There is no doubt that poverty eradicationrequires much quicker economic growth  with its fruitsbenefiting the greatest number. In this regard  socialjustice is a useful guide if we wish development andeconomic growth to produce beneficial results that aremore equitably shared.Our heads of State and Government committedthemselves to redoubling their efforts to promote solidand sustainable growth in order to reduce poverty.Furthermore  they reiterated their determination tospeed up the process of subregional and regionalintegration already begun with the creation of theAfrican Union this year in LomÈ.An open and interdependent world needsmechanisms to retain its balance and to help promotejustice by preventing aggression against individualsand nature. It also needs participation in developmentfor all countries and peoples and efficiency ineconomic relations by encouraging transparency predictability and stability in international relations.One solution would be  and on this point Iagree with the view of many experts  forinternational development cooperation to cover notonly assistance  but also all activities necessary toguarantee sustainable development throughout theworld based on the individual.We could then agree that development assistancefirst contributes to creating national conditions fordevelopment and to combating poverty  which isobviously incompatible with justice  popularparticipation and effectiveness.As necessary as the achievement of food self-sufficiency throughout the world may appear  thenational capacity of the developing world should bestrengthened in order to facilitate the effectiveimplementation of international agreements onenvironmental protection  trade liberalization macroeconomic management and banking supervision which are so essential to the proper functioning of aglobalized economy.Looking back at history  one can see that after theSecond World War development cooperation wassynonymous with solidarity and aid: assistance fromthe richest countries to the poorest. It is time for thiscooperation to be transformed  made more dynamicand  above all  become part of the new fact ofglobalization.The recent ministerial meeting initiated by Mr.Mark Malloch Brown  the Administrator of the UnitedNations Development Programme (UNDP)  highlightedthe need to strengthen the institution's capacity in orderto fulfil its mission more effectively. Thisstrengthening is particularly necessary  since today more than ever before  it is not possible to conceive ofdevelopment without taking environmentalrequirements duly into account. UNDP could  forinstance  intensify its assistance to countries that drawpart of their resources from forest products to achievesustainable and ecologically viable management of theforests.22With regard to strengthening protection of theenvironment  the debate under way in the UnitedNations  which consists of blaming only the forestcountries  is unjust  since we know that the greenhousegas emissions produced by the industrialized countriesare largely responsible for the harm done to our planet.Passing responsibility back and forth would not beconstructive. To the contrary  we should rather searchtogether  in the spirit of the 1992 Rio Conference  forways and means to enable us all to preserve the balanceof our natural ecosystem.I turn to the alleviation of the crushing externaldebt burden. On this crucial point  my country devotesnearly half its annual budget to repaying debt  therebycompromising its efforts and chances for development.The debt relief mechanisms advocated in recent yearshave been discriminatory with regard to our country byexcluding us from their application. We say that thereasoning is unfair  being based on our high per capitagross domestic product  without taking into accounteither our ability to pay or the seriouslydisproportionate distribution of national incomebetween capital  labour and taxation.A study carried out recently by a team ofuniversity specialists in Gabon shows that less than 40per cent of our gross domestic product is likely tocause a multiplier effect locally.The peculiar situation of Gabon  the only countryin the so-called intermediate-income category in sub-Saharan Africa  is due to the fact that its wealth isproduced by  and for  external protagonists.Thus the appeal made to the internationalcommunity for a fairer treatment of my country's debtand that of others is not simply a form of begging.What is at stake is the strengthening of theinternational trading system for the benefit of all  sothat globalization  as the Secretary-General has quiterightly said  might become a positive force for all ofhumankind. The debt problem remains a major sourceof concern for African countries  not just my own. Webelieve that our partners should show someimagination rather than coming up with the same tiredsolutions.That is why  in considering the debt problem account should be taken not only of socio-economicindicators but also of the efforts made by a State tocombat poverty and the deterioration of theenvironment. We will say it again: helping the Southhelps the North and helps everyone.The status of the developing countries particularly those of Africa  requires broad-basedaction on the part of the international community inorder to translate into reality our duties of solidaritytowards peoples.Official development assistance continues todecline. Following up on the recommendations of theCopenhagen World Summit for Social Development recently reaffirmed in Geneva  my country  in its fightagainst poverty  is now implementing the 20/20initiative  that is  20 per cent of its national budgetand 20 per cent of official development assistance areallocated to basic social services. We all know here thatthe 20/20 initiative is an excellent way to combatpoverty.Regrettably  Gabon's efforts have been hamperedby the dizzying decline in official developmentassistance and its exclusion from the benefits ofexternal concessional financing.I turn now to the protection of vulnerable peoplesand the fight against HIV/AIDS.Another aspect of political and social problems inAfrica and throughout the world is the status of womenand children in society. In my country  women have thesame rights as men. Our educational system ensuresfree schooling for all school-age children  in theinterests of the Gabonese nation as a whole. Schoolenrolment has risen from 27 per cent in 1950 to morethan 90 per cent today.Furthermore  my country is resolutely committedto promoting and protecting the rights of the child.Accordingly  we hosted in February 2000 in Librevillean international conference on trafficking in childrenand on child labour.We call for the implementation of therecommendations of that conference  which are a directfollow-up to the United Nations Convention on theRights of the Child and its two additional Protocols signed here by the head of State of Gabon.Regarding the campaign against HIV/AIDS  I ampleased to inform the Assembly that  at the initiative ofPresident Bongo  the Gabonese Government has justcreated a national solidarity fund to combat thispandemic. Gabon believes that the creation of an23international solidarity fund to combat AIDS would nodoubt help the 35 million people stricken with thisillness  the majority of whom are in developingcountries  especially in Africa.I turn now to the reform and restructuring of theUnited Nations system. In his report entitled We thepeoples: the role of the United Nations in the twenty-first century  the Secretary-General emphasized theneed to renew the United Nations. This renewalrequires that we identify the major assets of the UnitedNations  rebuild its infrastructure and information-technology capacities  and continue the peacefulrevolution  that is  the reforms begun in 1997.In this context  it is necessary to revise the scaleof assessments. It is in the interest of us all that wereadjust the scale of assessments  so that the burden ofthe Organization's expenditures  and thereby itsfreedom of action  does not rest on the shoulders ofonly a few Member States.The current millennium  a symbol of divinegenerosity and perfection to which we are bearingwitness  has the potential to give rise to furtherprogress in the building of a more just and peacefulworld. Every nation represented here is a reflection ofhumankind  whose common values were recalled bythe founders of the United Nations. Humanity is itselfin the image of God  and we must therefore togetherbring to fruition the precious gifts bestowed by ourCreator: love  peace and freedom.The United Nations must retain what has shownitself to be tried and true  adapt where necessary anddevise new forms of regulation."
"59",2542,"GBR",55,2000,"I am conscious thatthe central problem for all of us when we rise to speakto the General Assembly is that there are too manyissues of concern to hope to address them all in onespeech. There is no shortage of challenges to theUnited Nations as we meet for the first time in a newcentury to debate the issues of a modern world.It is a world united by the new technologies ofcommunication. We have never had so muchopportunity to share the know-how for economicgrowth. Yet our world has never before been so dividedbetween rich and poor. In the year ahead  we mustmake sure that all the United Nations agencies and itsinternational financial institutions work together in acoordinated way to promote development and to reducedebt.It is also a world bound together by growth intrade between our countries. But we failed at Seattle tomake further progress on removing the obstacles to thattrade. In the year ahead  we must launch a world tradedevelopment round which is fair to those countrieswhose main exports are agricultural rather thanindustrial.It is a world which faces a common threat to itsglobal climate. We are each learning the alarming rateat which that climate is changing as the result of ourown actions. Before the end of the year  we must try toreach agreement at the sixth Conference of the Partiesto the United Nations Framework Convention onClimate Change to bring into effect the Kyotomeasures to stabilize climate change.Each of these is an important challenge. Each ofthem is a strategic priority for our work programme forthe coming year. This morning  though  I wish to focusmy remarks on the central theme of the MillenniumSummit and of this fifty-fifth session of the GeneralAssembly.How do we equip the United Nations with thecapacity in peacekeeping that matches the realdemands for it around our world?In his opening address  the Secretary-Generalinvited us to give a swift response to the Brahimireport on peacekeeping (A/55/305). The UnitedKingdom is happy to respond to that invitation byoffering our support for the report's conclusions andpledging our commitment to its implementation. Thereport begins by reminding us that the United Nationswas founded  in the words of its Charter  to savesucceeding generations from the scourge of war'. Toooften  though  we have failed to save those who neededour protection from the suffering  the pain and theterror of brutal conflict. We must be frank in facing upto those failures if we are to learn their lessons. Andwe must be determined to improve the capacity of thisOrganization to keep the peace if we are to succeed inthe future.I want to set out six tasks which we must addressif we are not to repeat past failures. First  we mustequip the United Nations with a more effective andmore rapid capacity for peacekeeping. In the space ofabout one year  the number of troops on United Nationspeacekeeping missions around the globe has trebled.The United Kingdom has forces operating in eightdifferent theatres where peacekeeping has beenauthorized by the United Nations.8But it is not the new size of our peacekeepingeffort that demands changes. It is the differentcharacter of the peacekeeping challenge. It used to bethe case that United Nations forces were typicallydeployed to observe a ceasefire between two Statesboth of which wanted to end the fighting. Today  ourpeacekeepers are typically deployed within States  notbetween them  and often where one or more parties tothe conflict is not seriously committed to peace. Inthose circumstances  United Nations peacekeepers needa robust mandate. As the Brahimi report puts it  whereone side is violating a peace agreement  treating bothsides equally can amount to complicity with evil.United Nations peacekeepers who witness violenceagainst civilians should be presumed to be mandated tohalt it.But if those peacekeepers are to act withdetermination  then we must equip them with thecapacity to do so. The United Nations needs aHeadquarters unit capable of rapid deployment within afew weeks  not a few months  of a Security Councilresolution. And each of us must develop the number oftroops who are trained in the principles and practice ofpeacekeeping whom we can commit to the UnitedNations. That is why the United Kingdom has proposeda permanent staff college for United Nationspeacekeeping. The United Kingdom has offered to hostsuch a resource for United Nations peacekeeping  ifthat is welcome to other members of the GeneralAssembly.The second task is to be more rapid and moreimaginative in tackling tension before it results inconflict. By definition  any mission to restore peace isan admission of failure to prevent conflict. As well ascoping with the consequences of conflict  we need toaddress the root causes of conflict: poverty  badgovernance and the denial of freedom or of minorityrights. I welcome the Secretary-General's intention tosubmit a report on conflict prevention early next year.It will be a natural companion to the Brahimi report. Ihope it can enable us to develop an early warningsystem which will alert us to potential conflict and giveour agencies the chance to offer help before it becomesa real conflict.Too often  internal conflict is fuelled by theexternal demand for the illicit trade in diamonds or theevil trade in drugs. Measures to ban conflict diamondsfrom international sale or to defeat the drugs baronsmust be key elements of any comprehensive strategy ofconflict prevention.The third task is to take tighter control of theflows of arms which supply conflict. As aninternational community  we have put much effort intocontrolling weapons of mass destruction. The goodprogress we all made at the Review Conference of theStates Parties to the Treaty on the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) underlines theimportance which each of us attaches to this strategicissue. The United Kingdom has ratified theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  has reducedby half its planned strategic nuclear warheads  and hassupplied greater transparency on our nuclear arsenal.Yet  over the past decade  the true weapons ofmass destruction have been small arms  which havekilled 5 million people in conflicts around the globe.Overwhelmingly  those killed were civilians rather thansoldiers. And  overwhelmingly  they were killed incountries which do not manufacture firearms. We mustmake a success next year of the United NationsConference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms andLight Weapons in all its Aspects. We need to reachagreement to mark firearms at the point of productionso that they can be traced. The United Kingdom wouldsupport at that conference the presumption that militaryfirearms should not be licensed for sale other than tolegitimate Government bodies. And we must seek thehelp of the international economic agencies  includingthe World Bank  to fund and to reward withdevelopment aid the surrender of firearms.The fourth task is to provide the United Nationswith the civilian resources to promote reconciliationand reconstruction. In Kosovo  and again now in EastTimor  we have learned that the end of conflict is onlythe starting point. When the troops have brought peace we need judges and administrators to bring justice anddevelopment. The peacekeepers must be followed bypeace-builders. In particular  we need to muster thecivilian police who can establish law and order in placeof violence and conflict. I was astonished to read in theBrahimi report that this mighty internationalorganization has only nine civilian police on itsHeadquarters staff  administering 8 600 civilian policein the field around the world. I am confident that everyone of them is the very best  in keeping with thetradition of United Nations staff. But if we are seriousabout succeeding on the ground  we need a moreserious back-up at the centre. Four times in the past9decade  the United Nations has been called upon toundertake a transitional civilian administration. Weneed a better  permanent  capacity here at the centre tosupport our operations in the field.The fifth task is to enforce the international lawon crimes against humanity. If we are to haveinternational justice  we must have an internationalcourt. The United Kingdom has given strong support tothe International Criminal Court  and we have justpublished our draft legislation to ratify the treatysetting up such a Court. The International CriminalCourt will send a strong warning to any future tyrantsthat they will be called to account for their crimesbefore the bar of international justice. It will be one ofthe most powerful advances for human rights since weagreed 50 years ago to the Universal Declaration ofHuman Rights.And finally  we must strengthen the authority ofthe United Nations. In 50 years  there has been no newpermanent member of the Security Council. TheSecurity Council needs to represent the world as it is inthis century  not the world as it was in the middle of thelast century. It needs to be made representative of the100 or more countries that have joined as Memberssince the Security Council was set up. The UnitedKingdom supports a doubling of the permanentmembership to include Germany  Japan and threecountries from each of the continents of Asia  Africaand Latin America. We also want more membersamong those who are elected  in order that the SecurityCouncil can be more representative of the GeneralAssembly.For seven years  we have been debating thisquestion. It is becoming an issue of credibility for theUnited Nations. How can we pretend to end conflict ifwe cannot end this disagreement among ourselves? Amore representative  modern Security Council wouldspeak with more authority when it challenges thosewho breach the peace.I have been frank about where we must improveour capacity for peacekeeping and strengthen our willto halt conflict. But we should not underrate theimmense achievement of the United Nations. OurCharter begins by recalling the untold sorrow tomankind inflicted by two world wars. It was a Charterwritten by ministers and officials determined to endwar between States. And in this they were remarkablysuccessful. External aggression between States is nowunusual.But the benefits have been unevenly shared. Theindustrialized nations have enjoyed half a century ofpeace. That has provided the security and good order inwhich their prosperity has advanced at a rate withoutprecedent in history. Yet  in the same half century people elsewhere in the globe have lived throughviolence and conflict which have broken their humanrights and impoverished their standards of living. It islargely poor countries that now experience the scourgeof war which our Charter sought to banish.The challenge for the United Nations is to ensurethat the peace and security which have been enjoyed bymany Member States are shared by all. None of us canprevent humanitarian catastrophe by acting alone. Butthis United Nations can  if we act together.The Brahimi report tells us what we need to do.As an organization  we publish many reports. Nobodycould fault the capacity of the United Nations toproduce reports. But we are not always as good atimplementing them. Let us make sure that the Brahimireport does not gather dust on library shelves but is putinto practice before we meet again next year. Let usshow the determination and the conviction that theright in our Charter to be preserved from war is anequal right for the people of all our nations  large andsmall  rich and poor."
"60",2566,"GEO",55,2000,"At the outset allow me to extend my warmest congratulations to you Sir  on your election as President of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-fifth session. It is without doubt afitting recognition of your rich personal experience aswell as Finland's role in world affairs.The Millennium Summit has made it clear that  inthe words of the Secretary-General “the United Nations remains as much in demandas in need of change.” (Global Governance 4(1998)  p. 123)This is a formidable challenge  but also an opportunity and the cost of not rising to the new calls of the nextmillennium can be dangerous.I cannot but recall that many ideas onglobalization and governance generated and debated atthe current session echo the concept of “managementof interdependencies”  put forward by our President 12Mr. Eduard Shevardnadze  at the forty-seventh sessionin 1992. With this in mind  let me address some ofthose important issues from our standpoint.The end of totalitarian regimes set in motion awhole host of progressive changes within and amongcountries. However  we are still struggling with theadverse legacies of totalitarianism. The experience ofthe post-cold-war era clearly demonstrates that intra-State conflicts have become a major threat tointernational peace and security. The Secretary-General's report to the Millennium Summit called forreshaping of the United Nations approach topeacekeeping to meet the challenges of this new globalthreat. This very idea is particularly topical for theregion I represent. As my colleague  the ForeignMinister of Germany  said: “the triangle betweenCentral Asia  the Caucasus and the Middle East” being“full of destabilizing factors … is threatening tobecome the crisis region of the century ahead.”() Therefore  this region merits closerattention by the international community.In this context  I also endorse the appeal by theAustrian Foreign Minister  in her capacity asChairperson-in-Office of the Organization for Securityand Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)  for enhancedpolitical awareness by the world community of theseunresolved or potential conflicts and security risks which she said“are often outside the spotlight of broader publicattention  but nevertheless have a highlydestabilizing impact on the region andbeyond.”()Periodic failures of United Nations peace efforts manifested  for instance  in the “ethnic cleansing” ofthe predominantly Georgian population during thetragic developments in Abkhazia  Georgia  highlightedall the flaws of selective peacekeeping. Well-intentioned United Nations efforts have sometimesbeen delayed and ineffective in conflicts which theworld community regards as peripheral. I believe thatwe should make every effort to prevent conflictsbecoming “frozen”.Consequently  we support the Secretary-General'sproposal aimed at implementing necessary changes toincrease the effectiveness of United Nations peaceefforts in general. I cannot help but call for the morefrequent and firm application of the United Nationspeace-enforcement mechanisms envisioned in ChapterVII of the Charter  in particular those for coping withprotracted conflicts.The Charter calls for the consent of the partiesinvolved when launching peacekeeping operations orrenewing their mandate. However  peacekeepingpractices often play into the hands of separatists tryingto maintain the status quo. We believe that the UnitedNations should intensify its efforts to balance theinterests of all sides with the dynamics of the peaceprocess and the comprehensive resolution of conflicts.Moreover  we welcome the further enhancement of theUnited Nations standby arrangement system and theimprovement of the Organization's rapid-deploymentcapabilities.Georgia also expresses its agreement with theUnited States initiative to reconsider the scale ofassessments and the reallocation of the cost of UnitedNations peacekeeping. In the context of increasing theeffectiveness of United Nations peace operations  thisinitiative is of great significance.In addition  complex conflicts  such as that inAbkhazia  Georgia  which has left hundreds ofthousands of internally displaced persons deprived ofthe right to return to their permanent places ofresidence  must be addressed within a multifacetedframework  which entails social and economicapproaches  along with political ones.We are grateful to the United Nations for theinvaluable assistance it provides to the refugees andinternally displaced persons in Georgia. I also expressour special appreciation for the United NationsDevelopment Programme assistance programmes inGeorgia  particularly those aimed at improving theliving conditions of the internally displaced personsand increasing their self-reliance.I am stressing the issue of peacekeeping as it isdirectly related to the most sensitive problem for mycountry in the past seven years  since it fell victim toaggressive separatism in Abkhazia  Georgia. I reiteratethat a peaceful resolution of this conflict is the onlyacceptable option for the Georgian Government. In thisrespect  I extend our gratitude to the United Nationsand to the Group of Friends of the Secretary-Generalfor their efforts in support of the peace process. But weshould also admit that so far we have failed to achieveany tangible results here.13Recently  within the United Nations frameworkand in accordance with the relevant Security Councilresolution  a document on the distribution ofconstitutional competences between Tbilisi andSokhumi has been drafted. We support this initiativeand find it difficult to understand what stands in theway of its timely endorsement. We are convinced thatsubmission of the document for consideration by theSecurity Council should not be delayed; itsendorsement by the Security Council as a basis forpolitical negotiations will create a sound ground foradvancing the peace process in Abkhazia  Georgia.Furthermore  I reiterate that about 300 000predominantly Georgian refugees and internallydisplaced persons from that conflict zone are still beingsubjected to the continuous violation of their rights anddifficult living conditions. The return of the internallydisplaced persons to their rightful places of residence iscontinuously hampered by the Abkhaz side  withblatant disregard for internationally recognized norms as well as for a number of Security Council resolutions.We strongly believe that there is an urgent need for theSecurity Council to address those issues in a timelymanner.It has become apparent that at times the UnitedNations is not capable of handling conflicts on its own.I strongly believe that the key to more effective UnitedNations peace policies in our region lies in closercollaboration and synchronized action with suchregional organizations as the OSCE and other Europeanstructures. Regrettably  the reality remains different.Having established that “ethnic cleansing” wastaking place in Abkhazia  Georgia  the OSCE called forthe dispatch of a fact-finding mission to push forwardthe peace process. However  the United Nationsremains reluctant to accept the OSCE findings. While itis struggling with a variety of approaches  the “ethniccleansing” of the Georgian population in Abkhaziacontinues. There is therefore a great need to ensureconcerted action by the United Nations and regionalorganizations in the process of conflict managementand resolution.The dilemma of humanitarian intervention couldbe described as being inherent to the transition from aninternational to a global — and  hence  more human-centred — world. It has put in a new light thecorrelation between human rights and security. We arestrong proponents of a value-based  universal globalorder. Therefore  we are confident that the internationalcommunity should focus on establishing within thisOrganization strong and efficient preventivemechanisms  mechanisms to prevent gross andsystematic violations of human rights  in order toreduce the likelihood of “humanitarian intervention” an extreme measure. We believe that the InternationalCriminal Court will play an indispensable role in thisrespect as a deterrent and as a preventive mechanism.The dilemma of “humanitarian intervention” is alsodirectly related to United Nations reform  in regard toadapting the existing decision-making mechanism tothe timely and effective use of force.I believe that the primary purpose of the UnitedNations as a guarantor of international peace cannot besustained without also securing democracy on theglobal level. To set the developing world on the path toprosperity  United Nations activities should encompasspurposeful financial  economic and political measuresaimed at encouraging the democratic development ofthe newly independent States  which would securegood governance  the rule of law  the protection ofhuman rights and predictable administration. Securedemocratic development  not merely security ofdemocracies  is the main challenge to be addressed inthe course of shaping the global world.With regard to our region  in the context ofsupport to the new and restored democracies  weconsider the initiative of Azerbaijan  Georgia Moldova  Ukraine and Uzbekistan to establish an opengrouping  known as GUUAM  to be of particularimportance. Additional impetus to the manifoldcooperation within the grouping was given by themeeting of the heads of the GUUAM States during theMillennium Summit here in New York.Sometimes in newly established democracies aprotracted process towards material welfare callsdemocratic values into question. One of the mostburdensome problems in this respect is debtaccommodation. I am confident that it is imperative torelease poor and developing countries from thisconstraint. Writing off the debts will generate astronger impetus  and create the opportunity for theseStates to firmly remain on the chosen course ofdemocracy.We also believe that the all-encompassing processof globalization urgently calls for a dialogue ofcivilizations as a means of addressing the challenges of14the new millennium  as reaffirmed by the UnitedNations Educational  Scientific and CulturalOrganization (UNESCO) round table that preceded theMillennium Summit. I confirm Georgia's readiness expressed by President Eduard Shevardnadze  to playan active role in facilitating such a dialogue.Much has changed in the 55-year history of theOrganization  and today the world community is facedwith a new type of challenge requiring novelapproaches. In the past decade  there have beenrepeated calls for Security Council expansion. Wesupport the principle of expanding both permanent andnon-permanent membership in the Council bydeveloped as well as developing countries to ensureadequate regional representation. We believe that theseat of a non-permanent member should be allocatedfor the Group of Eastern European States  the numberof which has considerably increased. We are firmsupporters of permanent membership for Germany andJapan and hope this issue will find its resolution beforelong.Georgia welcomes the increased transparency inthe Security Council deliberations. We think that eachMember State should be permitted to participate in theinformal meetings of the Council  when the issuesdiscussed are of concern to them.Time and again United Nations actions have beenineffective due to protracted decision-making and lackof consensus in the Security Council. Therefore  thereform of the Security Council should encompass itsdecision-making procedure  including the veto rights aswell.Finally  I would reiterate that the challenges ofthe next millennium are myriad and complex. And it iscrystal-clear that only united can we address thedifficulties of the future and overcome the dividingbarriers in shaping a new  global world order. I wish toall of us success in this endeavour."
"61",2613,"GHA",55,2000,"On behalf of my delegation Sir  I wish to congratulate you sincerely on yourelection as President of the fifty-fifth session of theGeneral Assembly. This session is indeed historic coming as it does in the wake of a Millennium Summitthat witnessed the presence of the largest-evergathering of political leaders of the internationalcommunity. I also wish to commend the other membersof the Bureau on their election.May I also take this opportunity to pay a richlydeserved tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Theo-BenGurirab  Foreign Minister of Namibia  whose deepsense of duty and commitment to social justice helpedshape the United Nations agenda for the new century.Indeed  the General Assembly gave impetus to such anagenda when  in December 1998  it decided to hold theMillennium events  believing strongly that the turn ofthe century was a unique and symbolically compellingmoment to articulate and affirm an animating vision forthe United Nations in the new era.Barely a fortnight ago  world leaders met here inNew York  following that commitment  to address thechallenges of the new century  reaffirm theircommitment to the Charter of the United Nations andto demonstrate political will for the new process. Themessage that emerged from the statements made by theheads of State or Government at the MillenniumSummit was the reaffirmation of the unique role of theUnited Nations in offering the best  and only  universalframework for confronting the challenges of themillennium.It recognized a United Nations capable ofpromoting a new development agenda that is people-oriented and which also guarantees greaterparticipation of stakeholders  particularly women  theyouth  the private sector and civil society at large; aUnited Nations that has been revitalized to play a moremeaningful role in helping developing countries meetthe challenges of poverty reduction  political pluralismand the ongoing process of globalization; a UnitedNations that boldly plays its role as an Organizationworking for the good of all  with the confidence of theworld's people.The conjunction of the fifty-fifth session of theGeneral Assembly and the beginning of a newmillennium provides a symbolic departure point for theinternational community to seek to do better in allareas of its endeavour. Today  there is no greaterchallenge facing our world and no greater issuedefining this millennium than the debilitatinginhumanity of poverty  its heavy hand on wealthcreation  its fast spread across the world  the deadlyeffect of economic insecurity on peace and security andits impact on the environment. It is thus perplexing thatunder the effect of globalization  deprivation andinequality are accelerating globally with as much speedas innovation  technological progress and integration although in different directions. Our collectiveingenuity  that of both developed and developing  iscalled upon to produce answers that will bring uscloser than ever before to the purposes of the Charter.We have encountered disappointments as theinternational community has striven for peace  security development and respect for human rights. We havealso sought ways of dealing with the impact ofglobalization on international trade and investment. Weshould not resign ourselves to these reversals  norshould we accept living with them. To do so woulddefeat the objective of development. The way forward18is not only to revitalize the United Nations to enable itto strive more boldly for a more equitable globalsociety  but also to work together to ensure that equity fairness and solidarity characterize internationalrelations.On the important question of maintaininginternational peace and security  the role of the UnitedNations has been  without doubt  that of facilitatingconditions under which countries and peoples may livetogether securely and harmoniously in order to givefree rein to their creative talents. One important meansof achieving this objective in the midst of violentconflicts that keep erupting has been to undertakepeacekeeping all over the world. Ghana has been andwill continue to be a major contributor to this effort  asconflicts in Africa especially pose a major challenge tothe United Nations efforts to bring about global peaceand prosperity.The situations in the Democratic Republic of theCongo and Sierra Leone  to name only two examples amply demonstrate the complexities of the challengeswhich the United Nations must show it can handle. Inthe West African subregion  for example  we must allcooperate in imposing a ban on the purchase of smallarms and especially on the purchase of diamonds thatare not controlled by the Certificate of Origin regimefrom countries in conflict. Unless the internationalcommunity helps by implementing this aspect ofSecurity Council resolutions  international peace andsecurity will continue to be prejudiced by the greed andambition of individuals.Enhancing Africa's peacekeeping capacity tocope with challenging missions  through training logistics and financial support  as well as a strongerpartnership between the United Nations and theOrganization of African Unity (OAU) Mechanism forConflict Prevention  Management and Resolution  is acrucial goal if we are to return the continent to peaceand security. That is one of the reasons why Ghanaattaches importance to regional and subregionalpeacekeeping initiatives. However  such initiativesshould not become an excuse for the United Nations orthe Security Council to shirk their primaryresponsibility for the maintenance of peace andsecurity in Africa.Disarmament lies at the heart of the UnitedNations efforts to ensure and sustain internationalpeace and security  conditions necessary for allproductive human activity. The nuclear threat of thecold-war era still looms large over all of us and willcontinue to do so until the nuclear Powers andmilitarily significant countries disarm. It is thereforereassuring that  despite the gloom that has becloudedthe United Nations disarmament machinery over pastyears  positive results were achieved at the SixthReview Conference of the State Parties to the Treaty onthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).The United Nations must capitalize on thismomentum and continue its search for new ways andmeans to achieve nuclear disarmament and arms non-proliferation. It must also embark on confidence-building measures in order to enhance the process. Inthis regard  the Disarmament Commission and otherrelevant machinery on disarmament established by theGeneral Assembly should be given every opportunityto fulfil their mandates through the demonstration byMember States of commitment  flexibility and thenecessary political will.Ghana would therefore use this opportunity toreiterate its support for the proposal by the Secretary-General of convening a major international conferenceon the nuclear threat. We will also play an active partin the preparatory process leading to the UnitedNations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Armsand Light Weapons in All its Aspects  to be held in2001.Ghana believes that the efforts of the UnitedNations to promote and maintain international peaceand security should rest on a firm international legalframework  hence the need to maintain support for theuseful work being done by the International LawCommission and related institutions in the UnitedNations system. We believe that the tremendousprogress made in the establishment of legalframeworks for the pursuit of crimes against humanity for example  must continue if our societies are to bemaintained.In the particular case of Africa  support for theInternational Criminal Court is not only desirable; it isa must  since censure by the international community isnow very necessary in dissuading warlords and rebelsfrom committing the heinous crimes that we continueto witness in countries such as Sierra Leone  Rwandaand the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Ghanarecommends  therefore  that international law should19ensure that the perpetrators of such crimes are punishedand that they do not enjoy amnesty from any country.The spirit of compromise which led to theoverwhelming endorsement of the Rome Treatyestablishing the International Criminal Court  must bekept alive to achieve our objectives in this field.The situation in the Middle East continues toengage the serious attention of us all. Ghanaacknowledges the current propitious climate in theMiddle East as a result of the revival of contactsbetween Israel and the Palestinian Authority at thehighest levels. The withdrawal of Israeli DefenceForces from Southern Lebanon has given these talks asense of optimism  and so have the meetings betweenChairman Arafat and Mr. Ehud Barak. While wecommend President Clinton's efforts  the two leaders ofthe Middle East are urged to show flexibility and staythe course  as the obstacles to peace cannot be removedwithout compromise  painful sacrifices  diplomacy anda strong desire for durable peace. Both sides shouldremember that this is perhaps the finest hour forreaching agreement. The negative forces in Israel especially  are regrouping  while the youngergeneration in Palestine are growing more and moreimpatient. No sacrifice should therefore be too greatfor success.In this new era we must have the boldness to endattitudes and situations that are no longer helpful to theprocess of globalization. In spite of the regularacknowledgement by world leaders and otherinfluential policy makers of the need for povertyalleviation  those in a position to do so have failed tooffer credible arrangements for debt relief  marketaccess and financing for development which would goa long way in enabling developing countries to buildviable socio-economic systems capable of overcomingthe fragmentation and marginalization being sufferedas a result of globalization. On the contrary  they areusing their pre-eminent political and economicpositions to try to control and manipulate developingcountries  especially countries whose Governmentsthey do not support.It seems to me that the world community is yet totranslate the traditional parochial affirmation of theneed for equity  fairness and solidarity for nationaldevelopment into concrete international actions.Furthermore  the United Nations will be able to teachlessons of equality and justice to its members onlywhen it practises those norms itself.At the end of the cold war the peoples of theworld heard a lot about the peace dividend. Only adecade after this new concept was trumpeted from therooftops  it has turned out to be non-existent. But thatconcept can be real if the tenor of our negotiationsreflects an awareness of our common humanity and itshighest values rather than the diplomatic stock-in-tradeof an era shaped by competitive warfare and anunequal advantage of the rich and powerful over thepoor and militarily insignificant countries.International cooperation for development must replaceinequity and war.Transforming the context of internationalcooperation for development depends as much on thelevel of commitment of individuals and groups in ourrespective countries as it does on what we do aspolitical leaders and policy makers. In this connection reinforcing and enhancing the network of linkagesbetween the United Nations and civil society is afundamental necessity. Unless our actions reflect thisstrategic understanding of the nature of decision-making in the world today  we are unlikely to benefitfrom the mistakes of our past efforts.We accordingly urge the Secretary-General toexamine ways of ensuring common  acceptablestandards for accountability and transparency  even inthe operations of non-governmental organizations withrespect to their participation in the United Nations. Inaddition  a greater effort should be made to build thecapacity of non-governmental organizations indeveloping countries so that non-governmentalorganization participation in the United Nations couldreflect the diversity of interests across the world.Ghana welcomes the contribution of non-governmental organizations to the work of the UnitedNations and individual countries  but must at the sametime caution against replacing the genuine anddemocratic voice of a people with those of externallycontrolled non-governmental organizations and theprivate sector. Non-governmental organizations and theprivate sector are vital agents of change in developingcountries  but they should not replace the voice of apeople  if democracy is to retain credibility.In an age of globalization and of our increasinglyknowledge-based society  we feel that the United20Nations has a major responsibility to support thedevelopment efforts of the developing countries  andthat the international community should provide thenecessary resources for it to do so. We therefore callonce again on all Member States to fulfil their financialobligations under the Charter in full and on time.The challenges facing the internationalcommunity  such as the growing income andtechnology gaps between the North and the South poverty and deprivation  point to the need for strongercooperation between the developed and developingcountries. A concerted effort will be required topromote a systematic dialogue between the two groupsto find solutions to these problems.It must be the vocation — indeed  thecommitment — of the North-South partnership toensure that in the new millennium governance nationally and globally  rests on the recognition that thewealth of some must not lead to the impoverishment ofothers  and that every person on this earth must haveaccess to certain basic social services  such as healthcare  education  food and safe water  no matter whichcorner of the earth he or she inhabits. Thus the richcountries have an indispensable role to play by furtheropening their markets  by providing larger and fasterdebt relief and by giving more and better focuseddevelopment assistance  which would enable poorercountries to sustain a meaningful level of development.It is only fitting that as a developing economy Ghana identifies itself with the cause of the leastdeveloped countries  most of which are in Africa. Inthis connection  we fully subscribe to the preparatorywork for the Third United Nations Conference on theLeast Developed Countries. We expect consensus to bereached on the accessibility of products of leastdeveloped countries to the developed markets.Our comments on this occasion would beincomplete without touching upon the crucial questionof the empowerment of women and the attainment ofgender balance. We also wish to express concern aboutthe persistence of discrimination against women inmost parts of the world in spite of the progressachieved since the Fourth World Conference onWomen  held in 1995. The challenges to theachievement of gender balance can be eliminatedthrough a renewed commitment to the implementationof the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms ofDiscrimination against Women. We therefore call on allcountries which have not yet ratified the Convention totake steps to do so  and urge prompt implementation ofthe provisions of the Convention. We also urge thosewho have entered reservations incompatible with thepurpose of the Convention to reconsider their stance  inthe interest of advancing the cause of women.The promotion and protection of the rights ofchildren are of equal concern to my delegation. Theyare the compelling reasons for our co-hosting jointlywith the Government of Canada a workshop onchildren in armed conflicts. It is our expectation thatMember States will endeavour to ratify the OptionalProtocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Childbefore the General Assembly's special session in 2001that will review the implementation of the WorldDeclaration on the Survival  Protection andDevelopment of Children and of the Plan of Action. Itis also our hope that the positive outcome of the justended International Conference on War-affectedChildren  held in Winnipeg  Canada  will be fullyimplemented to ensure the worldwide protection ofchildren during conflicts.I now turn to the HIV/AIDS pandemic  whoseimpact has been greatest in sub-Saharan Africa  whereit is estimated to have affected the modest gains insocial development. Statistics released during the XIIIInternational AIDS Conference in South Africa in Julythis year showed that almost a third of all people withHIV/AIDS are between the ages of 15 and 24 years.Every minute six people under the age of 25 catch HIV with girls more than 50 per cent more likely to contractthe virus than boys. Based on this data  the UnitedNations Children's Fund (UNICEF) has emphasizedthat to defeat the disease  Governments must committhemselves to “the largest mobilization of resources intheir history” and organize themselves as if they werefighting “a full-blown war of liberation”  with youngpeople in the forefront.This staggering situation must prick theconscience of the entire international community intorendering full support for efforts to control andminimize the spread of the disease. Ghana supports theSecretary-General's proposal for the adoption of 2005and 2010 respectively as deadlines by which to reducethe rate of infection of young persons through theassurance by the developed partners and theirpharmaceutical industries of the easy availability ofinexpensive vaccines. To reach that goal  we must alsoinvest in education  publicity  open discussions and21moral counselling of our youth  in particular. Theymust understand that it is indeed possible to avoid thedisease by exercising care  since this fatal disease istransmitted in a very limited number of ways. Weappeal to our developed partners for their fullcooperation.Finally  there is no doubt that the United Nationsremains the only instrument for confronting thechallenges of this millennium. However  it cansurmount these challenges only by sustaining the goodwill and credibility it enjoys among Member States andthis can be achieved only by expediting thedemocratization of the Organization. May the newvision which our leaders have charted for theOrganization in this new century spur us all to concreteaction to free our peoples  whose faith and trust residein us  from fear  want and exclusion."
"62",2659,"GIN",55,2000,"I amvery pleased on behalf of the people and theGovernment of Guinea to convey to Mr. Harri Holkeriof Finland our warmest congratulations on hisunanimous election to preside over our deliberations atthe fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly. Hiselection highlighted his merits  his personal qualitiesand his rich experience in international affairs. It alsoreflected the high esteem in which the internationalcommunity holds his great country  Finland  whosecommitment to the ideals of peace  justice  progressand the advancement of women is well known andappreciated by one and all. As a member of the GeneralCommittee at this session  my delegation wishes toassure the President of its support and full cooperation.It gives me pleasure also to pay tribute to thePresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourthsession  Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab of Namibia  whohonourably carried out his weighty responsibilities inthe service of the Organization.Let me also pay tribute to the Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  whose exemplary work at the helm ofthe Organization merits our highest appreciation andour support. I take this opportunity moreover to thankthe Secretary-General for his report (A/54/2000)entitled “We the peoples: the role of the United Nationsin the twenty-first century”. That remarkable documenttakes account of all the current concerns of MemberStates.I welcome the admission of the State of Tuvalu asthe one hundred eighty-ninth Member of theOrganization. This reinforces the universality of theUnited Nations.This session of the General Assembly is a historicone. It is taking place just as the Organization hassuccessfully concluded the Millennium Summit  whichbrought together in this Hall nearly all the world'sleaders. The outcome of that important Summit is asource of hope for our peoples at the dawn of the newmillennium.Just one week ago  from this very rostrum  thePrime Minister of Guinea informed the internationalcommunity of a barbarous act of aggression against theRepublic of Guinea  an act of aggression whose soleaim was to destabilize my country. Deadly  devastatingattacks have been carried out against the peacefulpopulation of Guinea. These were led by armed gangsfrom Liberia  but it is regrettable to have to note thatanother fraternal African country  Burkina Faso  hasalso been involved in the aggression. The Republic ofGuinea  a land of peace and hospitality  which has paidan enormous price by receiving hundreds of thousandsof refugees and which is working for the restoration ofpeace and harmony in West Africa  has thus been thevictim of aggression by the same people who causedthe genocide and mutilations in Liberia and in SierraLeone.41I urgently call on the international communitystrongly to condemn this aggression  which is part of aplan to destabilize the subregion. It is this that justifiesmy Government's request to the Security Council thatvigorous measures be taken to guarantee peace security and stability in the West African region.The Government of Guinea has had to face thesevere consequences of the massive presence of800 000 on its territory for the past decade  and it hasbeen obliged to divert resources from our country'seconomic development programmes. That is why myGovernment is most grateful for the United Nationsinitiative to convene a conference for support andsolidarity with respect to Guinea. On behalf of myGovernment  I wish once again to convey mydelegation's sincere thanks to the Secretary-Generaland to all others who have contributed to this importantinitiative. My country looks forward with great interestto the completion of this initiative with the conveningof a second meeting  scheduled to be held in Novemberat Geneva.This is the proper moment for my delegation toturn to the thorny question of conflict in Africa.Indeed  many of the crises that have emerged on ourcontinent pose a threat to peace and constitute a graveviolation of the principles and purposes of the UnitedNations. The scope of these crises and their proliferationjeopardizes all efforts at national development and atachieving subregional integration. I take this opportunity towelcome the report (A/55/305) of the Panel on UnitedNations Peace Operations  chaired by Mr. LakhdarBrahimi. Its recommendations enabled the SecurityCouncil to adopt an important resolution on ensuring aneffective role for the Council in the maintenance ofinternational peace and security  particularly in Africa. Mydelegation hopes that the new provisions of that resolutionwill be used to guarantee the effectiveness of UnitedNations peacekeeping operations.Among the central priorities of Africa  whichremains the theatre of many conflicts  is thestrengthening of its capacity to prevent  manage andresolve conflicts. Thus  whether it be the conflictbetween Ethiopia and Eritrea or the situation in theGreat Lakes region  in Angola or in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo  there have been significantbreakthroughs in the pursuit of peaceful  just andlasting solutions  thanks to concerted action by theOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and the UnitedNations.In the West African region  the quest for peace inSierra Leone is continuing with the commendableassistance of States members of the EconomicCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) andwith the active support of the United Nations  throughthe deployment of the United Nations Mission in SierraLeone (UNAMSIL). My delegation expresses its fullsupport for Security Council resolution 1306 (2000) which placed an embargo on the illegal sale ofdiamonds from conflict zones. We appeal urgently toall States and to all specialized agencies to cooperateactively in the effective implementation of thatresolution.The proliferation and uncontrolled distribution oflight weapons is another subject of grave concern  andis a major factor complicating and prolonging conflictsin Africa and  more tragically  encouraging therecruitment of child soldiers. Indeed  the resurgence ofrebel movements and the expansion of large-scalebanditry in our countries have been made possible bythat phenomenon. The firm support of the internationalcommunity is required to eradicate it. In thatconnection  my delegation is pleased at the initiativestaken by the United Nations and by the OAU to supportthe efforts of our States to combat this scourge  whichthreatens the stability of our continent.The beginning of the third millennium bringsmany challenges and hopes. It brings the hope ofseeing a plan for the settlement to the conflict inWestern Sahara  thanks to the joint efforts of the OAUand the United Nations  and the hope of finally seeingIsrael and its Arab neighbours give peace a chancethrough a just and lasting settlement to the crisis taking into account the legitimate aspirations of thePalestinian people  as well as the respect for the rightsand dignity of all peoples in the region.The question of development remains one of themajor challenges of this century  and as such it mustremain at the centre of our Organization's concerns.At a time when a portion of the planet hascontentedly crossed the threshold of this newmillennium and is embarking  under the rubric ofglobalization  on what is called “the new economy”  amajor portion of the world — indeed  the largestportion — continues to live in poverty  suffering theperverse effects of this globalization.With regard to the alarming situation prevailingon the African continent  the main concern of the42peoples of the United Nations must be Africa  so thatthe root causes of its non-development can beeradicated and so that it can be enabled to eliminatepoverty and enhance its capacities in order for it tohave better access to markets. To do that  debtcancellation  an increase in official developmentassistance and better attention to its specific needsshould make it possible to integrate the Africancontinent into the world economy. That is why mydelegation  based on the correlation between peace anddevelopment  is pleased at the recent decisions takenby the G-8 in Okinawa  aimed at more effectivelycombating poverty and at bridging the digital gapbetween the North and the South and at humanizingglobalization.In that respect  my country calls for moresolidarity on the part of the rich countries  and wedeeply hope that — over and above professions ofgood faith — concrete measures will be taken to allowthe developing countries  particularly those in Africa to experience sustained growth leading to sustainabledevelopment.With that in mind  my delegation appeals to all itsdevelopment partners to contribute  by means of moregenerous and better-targeted aid  to strengthening theinstitutional capacities of our States and to creatingadequate infrastructures  which guarantee balanceddevelopment and success in the struggle againstpoverty.The Republic of Guinea is very much concernedby the ravages of the AIDS virus. We believe that thisbattle must further mobilize the internationalcommunity so that the necessary sacrifices can be madeto halt this scourge  which has taken more victims inAfrica than anywhere else in the world. That is why mydelegation supports the important decisions thatresulted from the recent International Conference heldin Durban  South Africa.The protection of fundamental human rights  thesatisfaction of priority human needs and social justicemust remain at the forefront of United Nationsconcerns. The United Nations  in its irreplaceable roleas an instrument for the promotion of cooperation andunderstanding between peoples  must strengthen theculture of peace and sharing.Today it is unanimously acknowledged that theUnited Nations can continue to play an effective roleonly if there is a necessary reform of its organs  inparticular the Security Council  which has the primaryresponsibility for the maintenance of internationalpeace and security. The aspirations of strengthening itsauthority and ensuring more equitable representation inthe Council for the Organization's Members have beenreiterated many times by the overwhelming majority ofUnited Nations Members  and recently by virtually allof the heads of State or Government during theMillennium Summit. We must also restore to theGeneral Assembly its central role as the maindeliberative body and  finally  reform the other organs with a view to a greater revitalization of the entireUnited Nations system. These are the aspirations of thepeoples of the United Nations — to enable thisOrganization to face the challenges of the twenty-firstcentury.In his statement at the Millennium Summit  thePrime Minister of the Republic of Guinea reiterated thetotal commitment of our country to the principles ofthe United Nations and to the Charter. In thisAssembly  I would like to reaffirm this commitment which has never been found wanting in the history ofmy country. Under the leadership of its President General Lansana Conté  a man of peace and dialogue Guinea has always struggled to uplift human dignity  todefend freedom  to restore peace and to cultivateharmony among peoples.Guinea will continue  side by side with otherMember States of our Organization  to work resolutelyto free humankind from the spectre of war  violence exclusion and intolerance  and for a world of peace justice and solidarity for all."
"63",2698,"GMB",55,2000,"Allow me first of all tocongratulate Mr. Holkeri on his election as President ofthe General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session and tocommend him for the able leadership he has shownsince the beginning of our session. With his wisdomand vast experience  there is no doubt that he willguide our deliberations to a successful conclusion.In the same vein  I would also like to commendMr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  the outgoing President  for theprofessional and efficient manner in which heconducted the affairs of this Assembly.Last but by no means least  I pay tribute to theSecretary-General for the dynamic and visionarymanner in which he has been carrying out his mandate.I would also like to seize this opportunity tocongratulate him for his forward-looking millenniumreport  entitled  “We the peoples: the role of the UnitedNations in the twenty-first century”.May I also join previous speakers incongratulating Tuvalu on its admission as the newestMember of the United Nations.The Millennium Summit that has just ended was ahistoric event that brought together world leaders of thehighest political echelon who rededicated themselvesto the principles of the United Nations. As theSummit's political declaration and outcome documentindicate  our leaders considered the various challengesfaced by the United Nations  exchanged views andexplored ideas on the role that the Organization isexpected to play in the twenty-first century. I amconfident that  through concerted efforts  we  theservants of the people  will energize our UnitedNations to enable it to tackle the challenges of thiscentury.Some of the important issues that were raisedduring the recently concluded Summit  such as conflictresolution  poverty eradication  accessibility to healthcare and debt relief  to mention only a few  have beenechoed by many speakers since the general debatebegan. An issue that is of particular concern to thePresident of the Republic of the Gambia and to mydelegation is that of conflict situations  particularlythose in Africa. I am referring to situations such asthose that currently prevail in Angola  the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo  Ethiopia and Eritrea  SierraLeone  the Comoros  Somalia  Guinea and Liberia.In Angola  we are concerned about the continuingcivil strife and its negative impact on the well-being ofthe brotherly people of that country. It is an open secretthat the intransigence of UNITA is largely responsiblefor the present state of affairs. We therefore commendthe Security Council sanctions Committee on Angola especially the work done by Ambassador Fowler andhis Panel of Experts  to show the way forward on howto reduce UNITA's capacity to wage war. We hope that29the recommendations contained in the Panel's reportwill be fully and scrupulously implemented  and thatthis will force UNITA to return to the negotiating table.We are equally alarmed at the volatile situation inthe Democratic Republic of the Congo and itsrepercussions throughout the Great Lakes region. Mydelegation therefore strongly urges the belligerents signatories of the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement  toadhere to the Agreement's terms and conditions  with aview to accelerating the peace process.Regarding Ethiopia and Eritrea  we are heartenedby the current adherence to the June 2000 ceasefire andstrongly urge the two brotherly countries to acceleratenegotiations on a comprehensive peace agreement thatwould hopefully lead to a definitive conclusion of theregrettable two-year-long border conflict. In thisconnection  my delegation strongly supports the speedydeployment of a peacekeeping mission to the disputedarea.Somalia also continues to attract our attention.We therefore commend President Ismail Omar Guellehfor his relentless endeavour to broker the Djiboutiprocess that culminated in the recent election ofPresident Abdikassim Salad Hassan. We wish PresidentSalad Hassan all the best in his onerous task of forminga representative Government  a Government of nationalunity  and in the uphill task of rebuilding his war-torncountry. We also appeal to all the Somali factions toput their differences aside  to put their country first andto join in the concerted effort to achieve the nationalunity that has eluded Somalia since 1991. We allwelcome Somalia into the international communityonce more  as it has now started occupying its seats ininternational meetings.Nearer to home  the volatile situations in thebrotherly countries of Sierra Leone  Guinea and Liberiacontinue to be of great concern to us. My delegation however  takes heart in the Security Council's decision by its resolution 1317 (2000)  to extend the mandate ofthe United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone. This together with the efforts being deployed by theEconomic Community of West African States  willdefinitely bring about positive results very soon.At this point  we also want to commend theGovernment of the United Kingdom for stepping inwith military assistance to bolster the United Nationstroops there  showing courage and leadership when itwas most needed. Other members of the SecurityCouncil should emulate that example and showleadership by example.My delegation welcomes the establishment of thespecial court for Sierra Leone to try war crimes andother atrocities. Our only disappointment is that  unlikethe case of other tribunals  funding is based onvoluntary contributions. How  then  do we expect theSierra Leone special court to function effectively andefficiently? Are we serious about the need to eradicatethe culture of impunity? We also appreciate the workbeing done by the Security Council to ban the trade inconflict diamonds.At the national  regional and subregional levels the Secretary-General's 1998 report (A/52/871) on thecauses of conflict and the promotion of durable peaceand sustainable development in Africa remains a usefulguide in our collective efforts to resolve conflictsaround the continent and at the same time address theproblem of development.In addition to that  the Brahimi report on UnitedNations peace and security activities is indeed verytimely  but we will be doing justice to the report only ifwe implement the recommendations contained in it anddo so as soon as possible.Apart from the conflicts in Africa  we are alsoclosely monitoring conflict situations in other parts ofthe world  such as the Middle East  the Koreanpeninsula and the Taiwan Strait. In the Middle East  mydelegation strongly supports the peace process and theindefatigable efforts of President Bill Clinton to helpthe parties concerned to reach an agreementsatisfactory to all sides. We must always bear in mind however  that the relevant Security Council resolutions especially resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) remain the most credible basis for a just and lastingpeace in the Middle East.If we unanimously agree that might is not right inone part of the world  we should apply the sameprinciple in any other part of the world. I will refer to anumber of situations.In regard to the situation between Kuwait andIraq  we in the Gambia have always maintained that theinternational community should  as a matter ofurgency  find ways of alleviating the suffering of theIraqi people. But  at the same time  the Iraqi leadershipmust be accountable for the Kuwaiti prisoners of warand missing persons. The families of the prisoners of30war and missing persons have also been suffering fortoo long. Furthermore  we cannot treat lightly the issueof the Kuwaiti national archives  still in Iraqi hands.They must be returned  as must all other propertyremoved illegally from Kuwait at the time of theinvasion. Let us be fair to the people of Kuwait. Theylook to the international community for the justice thatthey so rightly deserve.Let justice prevail everywhere. The sanctionsimposed on Libya have been suspended  but what isstopping the Security Council from lifting themaltogether? Libya has complied with all the conditionslaid down by the Security Council. We therefore call onthe Council to keep its part of the bargain. Still on thesubject of Libya  the Government of the Gambia wouldlike to congratulate President Muammar Al-Qadhafi forthe preponderant role that he played to defuse thehostage crisis in the Philippines  in the spirit ofgoodwill and respect for human rights.We also hope that the differences between theUnited States of America and the Republic of theSudan over the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical plant will soonhave a peaceful solution in the interests of all.We also believe that the people of the Comorosshould be listening  too  so that  through the effortsthey are making to resolve locally the division existingin their country they will reach a definitive solution  inthe interests of the continent of Africa as well as of theinternational community as a whole  that will make usall proud.Let me come back to the issue of sanctions  butthis time I want to talk about Cuba. The unjustsanctions imposed on Cuba for over 30 years should belifted  as called for by many people of good willaround the world  including some lawmakers here inthe United States who believe that such sanctions areof another age and are not conducive to good-neighbourliness and international cooperation. It is ourfervent hope that common sense will soon prevail sothat at long last we will see the normalization ofrelations between the United States and Cuba  twoneighbours  two great countries that have a lot to offerto their peoples and to the rest of the world.It is in this spirit that my delegation hails thethaw in relations between North and South Koreasignalled by the June 2000 Summit in Pyongyangbetween Presidents Kim Jong Il and Kim Dae-jung. Weencourage the two brotherly countries to continue onthe path of reconciliation  which we hope will lead tothe eventual reunification of the two Koreas.Meanwhile  we are here yet again to reason withthe Assembly about the pressing need to reconsider itsposition with regard to the case of the Republic ofChina on Taiwan. At this moment  when we the UnitedNations are at a crossroads  when history is in themaking  when we are talking about inclusiveness universality  globalization  democratization — and thelist goes on — it defies logic that a country of 23million people  with all that they have to offer to therest of mankind  is continuously barred fromparticipating in the work and activities of the UnitedNations. The Republic of China has a national flag national ceremonies and systems that are recognized allover the world. It is also one of the most advanced inthe field of technology and electronics  agriculture andmedicine.Here is a country relatively small in size  but interms of social  economic  financial  cultural technological and scientific achievements  the Republicof China on Taiwan is indeed a force to be reckonedwith  a formidable powerhouse. This country hasalways espoused everything that our Organizationstands for: its purposes and principles  its aims andobjectives  its shared values and dreams. The Republicof China is not discouraged. We must in the spirit ofdemocracy and justice allow it to hoist its flag as anindependent nation in this edifice of the UnitedNations.It is my delegation's firm belief that this historicoccasion of the Millennium Summit is the time toembrace opportunities  make progress on issues thatdivide us  move forward and look to the future withconfidence  rather than living in the past  burying ourheads in the sand or turning the other way. If we lookclosely at the documents prepared for the MillenniumSummit — whether the one introduced by theSecretary-General or the working draft prepared by theGeneral Assembly President — it will be seen that onalmost all the issues raised in these importantdocuments the Republic of China has much to offer.Let us take human rights  democracy and goodgovernance. It will be recalled that on 18 March thisyear  the Republic of China held its second presidentialelection. Nearly 12.8 million people  approximately 83per cent of all eligible voters in Taiwan  participated inthe election  vigorously contested by candidates from31all political parties. The opposition won the election which resulted in an unprecedented transition of powerfrom one political party to another  in an orderly andpeaceful process. After that result the country stillseeks to be a part of this house.In the area of development and povertyeradication  we have witnessed on a number ofoccasions how the Republic of China has  through itsInternational Economic Cooperation and DevelopmentFund  been collaborating with such agencies as theAsian Development Bank  the Central American Bankfor Economic Integration and the European Bank forReconstruction and Development to supportdevelopment projects around the world.As for the crucial sector of information andcommunications technology and the revolution in thisfield  it is an open secret that the Republic of China isin the vanguard. We will be talking a great deal aboutthe growing digital divide. We have to bridge thisdivide  and it goes without saying that one of the majorpillars of this bridge is the Republic of China.How  then  can this country be excluded from theUnited Nations family? Furthermore  in this era ofglobalization and liberalization  it is impossible tounderstand how a leading trading nation like theRepublic of China could be excluded from playing itsrightful role in the comity of nations. The Republic ofChina is one of the most successful examples ofeconomic development in the twentieth century and isnow the world's nineteenth largest economy in terms ofgross domestic product and the fourteenth mostimportant trading nation. And  yes  it possesses thethird largest amount of foreign reserves in the world.What is even more praiseworthy is that theRepublic of China has over the years sent more than10 000 experts to train technicians in countries all overthe world  especially in developing countries. Inaddition  it has also been providing disaster reliefaround the world amounting to billions of dollars. Thiscountry continues to respond promptly and positivelyto United Nations appeals for emergency relief andrehabilitation for countries suffering from naturaldisasters and wars.It will also be useful and helpful to talk aboutcross-strait relations just to show that the door todialogue is not completely shut between the Republicof China and the People's Republic of China. In factsince 1987 more than 12 million visits have beenarranged and 100 million letters and phone callsexchanged. Last year alone some 2 million visits wereexchanged. We note with a sense of great satisfactionthat cross-strait trade totalled $27 billion. These figuresspeak volumes. This is why we believe that we shouldnot only take note of  but also support  the conciliatorygestures of the Republic of China towards the People'sRepublic of China  especially the request for a summitto pursue cross-strait reconciliation efforts withoutspecifying any preconditions  format or location. Thenewly elected President of the Republic of China evenwent further  by expressing the hope that the leaders ofthe Republic of China and the People's Republic ofChina would respect the free choice of the people onboth sides and work together to resolve the question ofa future one China.While working to achieve that goal  we  theUnited Nations  should help the process by consideringhow both sides of the Taiwan Strait can participate atthe same time in the United Nations. We are confidentthat  as was the case with the former East Germany andthe former West Germany  parallel representation ofdivided nations in the United Nations — in addition tocontributing to regional peace and security — can leadto their peaceful unification.Other than conflict situations in the world poverty eradication is a matter that is close to ourheart. Indeed  as we begin the twenty-first century poverty remains our number one challenge tosustainable human development. In this connection  Iwould like to mention that about three weeks ago theGambia launched the 1998 National Household PovertySurvey and the 1999-2000 Participatory AssessmentNational Summary reports. The poverty surveyrevealed that households engaged in farming and theinformal sectors record the highest poverty incidence at 80 per cent and 85 per cent respectively. Some of thecauses identified were low crop yields  inaccessibilityto credit  low rainfall  poor soil fertility unemployment  insufficient food  lack of income forbasic needs  poor health and lack of education. Weintend to address these causes within the framework ofThe Gambia's Vision 2020  our national blueprint forsocio-economic development. The President of theRepublic of The Gambia has thus reinforced the use oftractors and mechanized ploughing and modernagriculture techniques in order to increase theproduction of rice  groundnuts and other agriculturalcommodities  in an effort to achieve self-sufficiency.32Efforts to eradicate poverty should also include ahealth component. Indeed  as the World Bank rightlyputs it  a major acceleration of growth is unlikelywithout a dramatic improvement in human capital particularly public health. This is why my delegationfinds the concept of the Global Alliance for Vaccinesand Immunization very attractive indeed  especially inits strategic objectives. Let me at this juncturecommend the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation forits generous contribution towards the delivery ofvaccines in the poorest countries and for supportingresearch with a view to developing vaccines.Referring specifically to research in the area ofmalaria  I am proud to state that the Medical ResearchCouncil in the Gambia has always enjoyed the supportand encouragement of my Government. The MedicalResearch Council has over the years accumulated a lotof experience and expertise. I am sure that the GlobalAlliance can make use of such experience and expertisein carrying out its own mandate.For us in West Africa  the eradication of malariais among our highest priorities. We  particularly theGambia  Senegal  Guinea-Bissau and the Republic ofGuinea  have been meeting at the subregional level togive effect to the World Health Organization's RollBack Malaria strategy and to develop other preventiveand curative remedies for implementation at thenational level.The recent breakthrough in human sciencethrough the successful decoding of the human genome and the bright prospects for genome science  will allowfor the development of vaccines and medicines asremedies for deadly diseases all over the world. Whatis even more amazing about that major scientificbreakthrough is its reaffirmation of our commonhumanity. The language of the book of life is in fact thesame for all peoples  irrespective of race  religion orregion.In efforts to make the world a better place forhumankind  we also need to adopt a fresher approachregarding economic development issues  such as thedebt burden and trade access  official developmentassistance and financing for development  to mentiononly a few. As one of the least developed countries  theGambia looks forward to the forthcoming Third UnitedNations Conference on the Least Developed Countries to be held in March 2001. My delegation fully supportsthe Secretary-General's proposal to urge industrializedcountries to consider granting duty-free and quota-freeaccess for essentially all exports from least developedcountries.I must add that in addressing the specificproblems of least developed countries  extra effortsshould be made to tackle the excruciating debt burdenacross the board  rather than limiting the approach to aselect number of countries as provided for under theHeavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) DebtInitiative. We note  sadly  that the internationalcommunity's effort to resolve Africa's external debtproblems continues to fall short of the desired results.The adoption of the HIPC initiative by the World Bankand the International Monetary Fund  whilecomplementing global efforts  also falls short of theexpected target: complete cancellation of the debt stockof all developing countries is what should happen.Unless that is done  the debt burden will continue tohave a negative impact on the availability of adequateresources to finance Africa's economic recovery andsocial development.The task of peace-building and peacemaking atthe national and international levels and the other taskswithin the United Nations mandate are facilitatedbecause we are fortunate to have an organization suchas the United Nations to provide the framework forsuch efforts. As the Secretary-General aptly puts it inhis “We the peoples” report  the United Nations is“the only body of its kind with universalmembership and comprehensive scope  andencompassing so many areas of humanendeavour. These features make it a uniquelyuseful forum — for sharing information conducting negotiations  elaborating norms andvoicing expectations  coordinating the behaviourof States and other actors  and pursuing commonplans of action.” (A/54/2000  para. 8)Regrettably  the Organization has not always beenin a position to carry out its peacekeeping and otherimportant roles effectively. This is due mainly to adearth of financial resources. Therefore  if it is toassume the important role the founding fathersassigned it in the first place  that of meeting the needsof the world's peoples  we the Member States have toprovide it with the necessary financial and otherresources. The United Nations is expected to play aneven greater role in the twenty-first century.33Quite apart from providing the Organization withthe necessary resources  there will be a need to carryout some reforms  especially of the Security Council.We must begin by making its membership morereflective of present-day realities. Any reform of theSecurity Council must first and foremost address theserious anomaly which excludes Africa from thepresent permanent membership category. This must becorrected; Africa must be given a minimum of twopermanent seats if and when the Council is everreformed. In an organization like ours  the right of vetois a rebellion against democracy. For the fivepermanent members of the Security Council tounderstand the present situation as being unfair will bea mark of their sense of equity and justice. We willthen know that they too want a Council based onmutual respect and fraternal cooperation in the serviceof humanity at large.In conclusion  I would like to emphasize onceagain that the United Nations is the best legacy that thefounding fathers could have left for the peoples of theworld. It has served us reasonably well for the past 55years  nations big and small  rich and poor. It can serveus even better in the twenty-first century provided thatwe have the political will to strengthen theOrganization so that it can carry on with the difficultbut not impossible task of making this world a betterplace for all nations. That is the hope of my country.We are certain that all together we will be able toachieve it.We should remain optimistic  because we knowthat  as Professor Pierre-Henri Simon was wont to sayin his lectures at the Sorbonne  life begins on the otherside of despair. The United Nations was created in themidst of despair as a haven of hope  peace  progressand justice for all. It should also be  for all of us  injustice and in truth  an asylum from the cruelty andpain of the outside world."
"64",2738,"GNB",55,2000,"I wish at theoutset to convey my warm congratulations to Mr. HarriHolkeri of Finland on his election to the presidency ofthe General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session and toreaffirm our confidence in his ability to guide our workat this session. The delegation of Guinea-Bissau  whichit is my privilege to head  assures the President of itsfull cooperation. Our congratulations go also to hispredecessor  Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  who fulfilled hismandate in a constructive manner  thus making animportant contribution to the work of the GeneralAssembly.We wish also to express our trust andappreciation to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan and to thank him for the important steps that have beentaken on his initiative towards substantive reform ofthe United Nations and towards bolstering theOrganization's international credibility.The universality of the United Nations gainswhenever a new Member State is admitted. By joiningthe United Nations  Tuvalu has affirmed to theinternational community that it will shoulderresponsibility for the full exercise of its sovereignty. Itsaccession to membership has reinforced therepresentative nature of this world forum.In the third millennium  with our eyes focused ona new century  we are passing through a historic periodin which new and significant events give rise to newhopes on the international scene.This diagnosis  however  encompasses both hopeand scepticism  for it shows that the transitional periodwe are living through involves factors of bothintegration and disaggregation.If  on the one hand  the end of bipolarism thatdominated international relations diminishedideological antagonisms  this new and unprecedentedprocess  by undoing old political and strategicbalances  is promoting democratic impulses  freeingthe energy of States and creating space for a newinternational order more in line with our times.On the other hand  the rise of nationalistaspirations  supported by the yearning for the right tofree evolution  has had the effect of triggering oldconflicts  some of them forgotten in time. Thisphenomenon has led to an exponential growth ofconflicts that menaces the internal cohesion of States aswell as international peace and security.It was predicted  and legitimately so  that theinternational economy would be able to take advantageof the peace dividend resulting from the end of thearms race. It had been expected that those resourceswould be invested in the poorest countries and  thus would have contributed to the acceleration of globaleconomic growth and development. Our perception however  is that  due to the present state ofinternational economic relations  those optimisticexpectations have not come to fruition.As the international balance of power haschanged  the relative position that placed differentcountries in the international  political and economicpecking order has also changed. The very nature ofrelations among States has also been transformed.However  the rules and practices giving structure to anew international order are yet to be defined. Ourperception is that this is the main unresolved issue.This calls for the community of nations  through ourcommon institutions  to work determinedly together inorder to bring the present transition to a successful end.To do so  it will be essential to empower thesystem of collective security embodied in the UnitedNations. In particular  we attach great importance tothe revitalization of the General Assembly and therationalization of its agenda. We also feel there is aneed to reform the Security Council so that that organ which has special responsibilities  will be able to fulfilits original mission and be reborn as the main politicalinstrument for action in the United Nations.Expectations without precedent devolve upon theUnited Nations. We should all strive to find a solutionto the present structural and financial crises faced bythe Organization. It will be necessary to reactivate itsdynamism in order to implement the 'Agenda forPeace' and to make the 'Agenda for Development' areality.It is widely known that Guinea-Bissau has justovercome the gravest crisis the country hasexperienced in its recent history. We are stillconvalescing from the terrible effects of an absurd anddisastrous war. In addition to irreparable loss of life Guinea-Bissau society was deeply traumatized by aconflict that almost destroyed the entire existinginfrastructure. Guinea-Bissau was made moreimpoverished and more vulnerable. Its reconstruction the foundations of which are fragile  will be verydifficult  because even simple tasks have assumedurgent priority. The urgency and the sheer volume ofthe effort needed to rebuild the country go far beyondthe limited possibilities of a Government that is nearexhaustion. In order to succeed  that effort will need tobe supplemented by the effective participation of everypartner of Guinea-Bissau.In this new period of the restoration ofdemocratic legality  the people of Guinea-Bissau haveelected their new Government within the framework ofa pluralist democracy. The new National People'sAssembly has approved a general programme of action prepared by the Government  which defines a strategyfor sustainable development aimed at implementing thepriorities identified  in cooperation with Guinea-Bissau's partners. This programme of action and theproject of building a new society  required by theevolution of the situation in Guinea-Bissau  have beenset out by Guinea-Bissau's new President  who wasfreely elected by the people. Aware of the sacredresponsibility incumbent upon him  President KumbaYal· has committed himself to upholding theprogramme of action.As on past occasions when we were beneficiariesof timely and precious solidarity extended by theinternational community  we are hopeful that thepolitical  economic and social progress of Guinea-Bissau will be further supported and maintained.Amilcar Cabral  the founder of our nation considered himself and the other Guinea-Bissaufreedom fighters to be combatants for the noble causesupheld by the United Nations. Today  after the heroicstruggle that led to our independence  and thanks alsoto the support received from the internationalcommunity and the United Nations  Guinea-Bissau isparticipating in the highest world diplomatic forumswith serenity and determination  embarking on anunrelenting search to improve on the heritage of ourforebears.Therefore  acting with responsibility andspecificity  Guinea-Bissau has undertaken its owninitiatives  as well as presenting proposals aimed at thedefence of its interests and at contributing to theadvancement of the causes of peace and internationalcooperation. We recognize that in today's internationalsituation  rife with conflicts and contradictions  theUnited Nations remains  without a doubt  the necessaryforum for the development of the activities undertakenby our Government to affirm the international presenceof Guinea-Bissau.The five African Portuguese-speaking countries joined with Brazil  Portugal and Timor Lorosae  thelatter still being an observer  to form the Communityof Portuguese-Speaking Countries. This LusophoneCommunity is characterized by solidarity andtolerance  based upon shared sentiments andperceptions rooted in a melding of cultures thatexpresses the experience of our respective peoples.We would like to salute the development in theprocesses of democratization of Government structuresthat is now occurring in Sao Tome and Principe Mozambique and Cape Verde  similar to whathappened in Guinea-Bissau. This will allow ourGovernments to better respond to the legitimateaspirations of our peoples.We wish to express our solidarity with theAngolan Government and people  which haveexperienced the nightmare of almost 40 years of war.We support the efforts in search of peace and nationalreconciliation. We strongly favour the implementationby the United Nations of the Lusaka Protocol and thefull implementation of the sanctions established by theSecurity Council.In our West African subregion  Guinea-Bissau hastried  and to a certain extent has attained  in terms of itswill for integration  a political commitment aimed atimproving our relations with neighbouring countries soas to promote the cause of peace. In this spirit  werecognize that in its essence the conflict of Casamanceis an internal issue of Senegal. As such  we alsoperceive its negative consequences on the neighbouringStates. Our country is ready to work in the search for ajust solution to and peaceful resolution of that conflict.40We feel  however  that we are neither a part of theproblem nor its source of origin. The constructiveactions undertaken by Presidents Kumba Yal· ofGuinea-Bissau and Wade of Senegal  with the supportof President Jammeh of the Gambia  allow us to lookwith optimism to the future evolution of that issue.We deeply deplore the tragedy that has befallenSierra Leone  a country of our subregion. Theincreased violence in that country has resulted in ahumanitarian disaster. We urge the belligerent factionsand the Government of Sierra Leone to cooperate withthe international community in order to find adefinitive solution to that fratricidal conflict.The situation in the Democratic Republic of theCongo and in the Great Lakes region continues to be asource of concern to Guinea-Bissau. It is necessary tosummon the political will of the countries of the regionto diminish the tension and to continue to search for ajust solution.The Lusaka accords are the result of theperseverance of the parties involved and should beimplemented rapidly and comprehensively. They arethe essential framework for the resolution of theconflict. We are convinced that the implementation ofSecurity Council resolution 1291 (2000)  whichestablished the United Nations Organization Mission inthe Democratic Republic of the Congo  represents theroad to peace.In the Horn of Africa  Guinea-Bissau welcomesthe acceptance by Ethiopia and Eritrea of the peaceplan put forward by the Organization of African Unity.We encourage both parties to persist on the path ofdialog and negotiation and to continue to cooperatewith our continental organization.In the immediate vicinity of our continent  theMiddle East peace process is entering a decisiveperiod. This process and the quest for equanimityshould be accelerated in order to ensure a lasting andjust peace that respects the inalienable right of thePalestinian people to an independent State of its own as well as the right of all States of the region  includingIsrael  to national independence.Far from the African continent  Guinea-Bissaucontinues to pay special attention to the issue of EastTimor. We are linked to that territory by specialhistoric and cultural bonds and we are therefore closelyfollowing the work of the United Nations TransitionalAdministration in East Timor and the recentestablishment of a transitional Government. We hopethat the process will culminate in the full independenceof Timor Lorosae and with its admission as a fullMember of the United Nations.Finally  we believe that the situations created bythe imposition of embargoes against certain countries in which sanctions affect the poorer sectors of thepopulations  particularly women and children  shouldbe addressed through dialogue and negotiation with aview to finding a definitive solution.In the age of globalization  we should not losesight of the human being and its vital needs. If it islegitimate that all parties have the right to expect profitfrom progress  it is also correct that we should seekeconomic growth with social equity. Mankind facesmany challenges  among which achievingcomprehensive development is without doubt the mostimportant  because the lack of development is the mainsource of the conflicts that lead to the crises afflictingour planet. Therefore  if we wish globalization to liveup to its promise  we should learn better to work and toact together in order to correct its negative effects.It is urgently necessary to give momentum to theNorth-South dialogue on the basis of equality and todevelop a wide network of South-South cooperationwith a view to minimizing the risks of globalization.That effort must be fully supported by the internationalcommunity with a view to a true partnership fordevelopment. Such partnership  in our view  shouldenable us to find the modalities of a coherentinternational action to ensure sustainable economicgrowth in the context of true development.The structural adjustment policies adopted by themajority of African countries are  per se  clear proof oftheir willingness to improve the management of theirnational economies. Nevertheless  in most cases  theresponse of our development partners has not been inline with the sacrifices demanded and the urgency ofthe problems identified. From our point of view  it isnecessary to identify the mechanisms needed topromote a true social adjustment  keeping the humanindividual as its central point of reference.In this context  the collective challenge we face isto stress a dynamic image of international solidarity which may be translated into effective action for socialand economic cooperation in favour of developingcountries.41Our gathering here at the General Assemblyrepresents the best opportunity to correct theimbalances that destabilize the global process. We needto muster the determination of all our countries in orderto raise relations among States to the high level ofdignity required by our shared future."
"65",2777,"GNQ",55,2000,"As head of the delegation of theRepublic of Equatorial Guinea  and on behalf of HisExcellency Don Santiago Nsobeya Efuman  Ministerfor Foreign Affairs  International Cooperation andFrancophone Affairs  I am honoured to address theAssembly.First  I congratulate you  Sir  former PrimeMinister of Finland  on your election to preside overthe deliberations of the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session. We also sincerely congratulate Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  Minister for Foreign Affairs of our sisterRepublic of Namibia  on the excellent workaccomplished during the previous session and on hisacclaimed activities in coordinating the preparationsfor the Millennium Summit  which has just ended.I also take this opportunity to extend particularcongratulations to the Secretary-General  Mr. KofiAnnan  and his team for their full commitment topromoting the mandate of the United Nations  as wellas for the plan to strengthen its future work  asreflected in his outstanding report.We warmly welcome the Republic of Tuvalu tothe United Nations.Just two weeks ago we celebrated within thesefour walls the most important event in the history ofhumankind  when our heads of State and Governmentestablished general guidelines that must govern thefuture of our Organization  and that form a strongfoundation on which we can  and must  work. We mustnow follow up all the proposals and recommendationsmade by our leaders  with the firm goal ofimplementing them  which would result in a promisingfuture for all nations — those of the North and Southand East and West.His Excellency Obiang Nguema Mbasogo President of the Republic  head of State and foundingchairman of the Democratic Party of EquatorialGuinea  in his address on the first day of theMillennium Summit  affirmed that the turn of thecentury showed us a threatened world  one constantlyin danger of collapse and in a permanent state ofuncertainty about its destiny and the survival ofhumankind  one that conveyed an apocalyptic feelingthat was shared by all alike — nations large and small rich and poor.In order to follow up the proposals andrecommendations of the Millennium Summit  we muststart with the fact that democracy begins at home. Inour specific case  that means the United Nations  whichis our shared home  where the voice of the majoritymust prevail; that is a basic principle of the historicSan Francisco Charter of 1945.Equatorial Guinea therefore joins the call forurgent  much needed reform and empowerment of theUnited Nations — an appropriate formula for achievingthe fair and just representation of the African continentand other regions of the world  which we regard as afundamental issue  particularly with regard to theSecurity Council. If this is not achieved  anenvironment of distrust may result  as well as aweakening of the role of our great Organization and itsall-important task of promoting and ensuringinternational peace and security.At present  some individuals enjoy a level ofwealth which in the past was inconceivable  while the22victims of poverty continue to suffer intolerable formsof deprivation. The poor remain marginalized andexcluded  and day by day their ranks are increasingconsiderably. Almost a quarter of the world'spopulation now lives in poverty.Today  pensions and social security protect manyindividuals from poverty  but poverty in old ageremains prevalent around the world. Poverty must bethe main concern in United Nations endeavours. Thestruggle against poverty must be strengthened  and ifpossible poverty must be eradicated  because thesubject of poverty eradication is an ethical  social political and economic imperative of humankind  as isfinding solutions to the conflicts and fratricidal warsthat take millions of victims in different parts of theworld.Poverty eradication requires an improvement ineconomic growth and in employment opportunities.The causes of poverty must also be tackled in thecontext of sectoral strategies  such as strategies for theenvironment  food security  health  education population  immigration  housing  development ofhuman resources  rural development  drinking waterand sanitation.Poverty eradication is therefore one of theprimary tasks to which the peoples of the twenty-firstcentury aspire  as an action which will promote thedevelopment and prosperity of the human being andwill consolidate the culture of democracy and therespect for human rights.Other problems that need analysis and solutionsfrom the international community are the rights of thechild  the integration of women in development and thethorny issue of the foreign debt. As for the rights of thechild  we must see to it that the activities and thefollow-up of the World Summit for Children areintegrated with economic actions to be implemented asa result of the other United Nations conferences held inthe 1990s. In this respect  we must see to it that there isrenewed thinking about the obligations stemming fromthe ratification of the Convention on the Rights of theChild by each country and a renewed commitment tothem. This must guide our actions in the future.As for the subject of women  we must eliminateall discriminatory practices against women and respectthe procedures and the provisions that are inherent inthe convention on this subject  as well as therecommendations stemming from the Fourth WorldConference on Women held in Beijing in 1995 andfrom the special session of the General Assembly heldin June 2000.On foreign debt  we fervently appeal to donorsthat they cancel the foreign debt of the developingcountries with the understanding that the fundsreleased will be injected into the most vulnerablesectors in the economies of those countries  such aseducation  health  water and sanitation.We are gratified that among the major areas ofprogress in the twentieth century we see a growingawareness in humankind regarding respect for andpromotion of human rights  democracy and goodgovernance. In our country  because of the imperativeof survival and the objectives of well-being andprogress  we will continue on the agreed path towardsthe necessary restoration of all the rights to which ourvulnerable and marginal groups aspire  in other wordswomen  children  the disabled  refugees and thosepersons displaced by crisis and disasters. At the presenttime in Malabo  the capital of our nation  we haveofficially established the Centre for the Promotion ofHuman Rights and the Committee in Support of theEquatorial Guinean Child. This Committee wasestablished under the chairmanship of the First Lady ofthe nation  Her Excellency Mrs. Constancia Mangue deObiang.We have also experienced democracy in a spiritof joy with fraternity and without divisiveness  as isdescribed by our national anthem  and also withoutinternal upheaval. The national constitution  known asthe Magna Carta of Akonibe  clearly stipulates theestablishment and institutionalization of politicalpluralism in Equatorial Guinea. This has made itpossible for a number of political parties to beestablished. These parties have signed a nationalcovenant with the political party which is in powerwith the purpose of establishing and strengtheningmechanisms for dialogue among the parties. At thepresent time  all are participating actively in aspiring topolitical power in the country. In this respect we thankGod  the Creator  for having inspired us in this modelof participatory and peaceful democracy.In September 1997 at the Congressional Palace ofBata  the National Economic Conference was held withthe participation of all social sectors in our country. Inthe final report of this important event  we find therecommendations for programmes and projects to be23implemented by the Government in the short  mediumand long-term as our economic development strategy.We cannot conceal our concern at the steadydecline in international cooperation resources towardsEquatorial Guinea  as we have recently seen in many ofthe projects and programmes that are implemented inthe country with external resources. In this respect wewant to avail ourselves of this forum to invite theinternational community to steadily increase thevolume of international cooperation activities inEquatorial Guinea.With the primary purpose of ensuring peace andsecurity in our subregion  we hope that the UnitedNations will support the appropriate mechanisms forthe maintenance of peace  security  stability cooperation and development in the Central Africansubregion  following the political will of the heads ofState of that subregion  inspired by the establishmentof the Council of Peace and Security in Central Africa(COPAX)  a body for political and military agreementamong the member countries of the EconomicCommunity of Central African States (ECCAS).As regards the promotion of measures for themaintenance and the strengthening of peace andsecurity  we have  within COPAX  a Central AfricanMultinational Force (FOMAC) and an Early WarningMechanism for Central Africa (MARAC). TheGovernment of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea hascontributed with determination to financing theseinstitutions so that they can function properly.We sincerely regret the armed conflicts that existat the present time on the African continent and inother parts of the world  for example  the case ofAngola  the situation of the countries in the GreatLakes region and the crisis in Sierra Leone. Wewelcome the ceasefire in the conflict between Ethiopiaand Eritrea  and it is our hope that the parties willundertake dialogue with a view to a lasting peace.Likewise  we view with satisfaction the restoration ofpeace and authority in the sister republic of Somalia. Inthis respect  we commend the United Nations  theOrganization of African Unity  the League of ArabStates  the Islamic Conference and all of those whodirectly or indirectly contributed to the arduous task ofrestoring peace to that country.We strongly condemn the proliferation ofweapons of mass destruction. We support the struggleagainst crime and the struggle against the globalproblem of drugs and related crimes and against illicitarms trafficking and international terrorism. We fullysupport the initiative reaffirmed by the CentralAmerican countries in their commitment to makeCentral America a region of peace  freedom democracy and development and particularly togradually and progressively stimulate the CentralAmerican Union to ensure a promising future for thatregion.In the Middle East  we congratulate thecommendable political work done by the President ofthe United States Bill Clinton to mediate a lastingpeace in the region. We hope that a properinterpretation and implementation of the proposals andrecommendations of our leaders at the Summit  as wellas the outstanding statements made at thisdistinguished Assembly  will guide us towards a betterand more prosperous future for all the nations of theworld."
"66",2823,"GRC",55,2000,"I express my sincerecongratulations to the President on his election. I amcertain his qualities and skills will bring a successfulconclusion to the fifty-fifth session. May I also extendcongratulations to Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  hispredecessor  on what he achieved. Finally  I endorsethe European Union's priorities paper  which wasdeveloped by Hubert Vedrine  the President of theCouncil of the European Union.Some believe that violence might be an intrinsicpart of humanity. But so are humanity's relentlessefforts to rule out violence  regulate antagonism peacefully resolve confrontational situations andprevent hatred and prejudice. Whether we cometogether to understand each other or to debate eachother  our goal has always been to better our lives andbuild a more secure future.Since ancient times  we have attempted toestablish norms of peaceful coexistence. In this effort we have built traditions and religions  as well aspolitical structures. Through these norms we have triedto battle a fate seemingly dictated by force  poverty oppression  prejudice  chronic and communicablediseases  inequality and a withering environment.Throughout history  our efforts have takenvarious forms. But they have all commenced with aunique first step: the overriding principle that  in orderto solve our problems  we need to work together.This month is being marked by two events thatwill bring the peoples of our world much closer: theMillennium Assembly and the Olympic Games. At thedawn of the twenty-first century  nations will meet compete  clash  differ and disagree. Yet our world hasnever looked more united or more determined to tackleits problems as one  indivisible community.In the current environment  our efforts to build abetter world for our children can and ought to be pan-cosmic. We can all contribute to a future that inspiresour children and inspires the will to grow and to create.As the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  has verywisely said “We face global challenges which oblige usto work together. If that is true in the economicand social sphere  it applies even more to thechallenge of massacre and war”.These words command even more authority comingfrom a man whose political skill  moral authority anddevotion have contributed  in numerous cases  to theresolution of conflicting issues.When a child misses its childhood and itseducation because it is in a dark prison cell  when achild is maimed from the explosion of a mine or whena child dies of hunger  of AIDS or in war  we do notwitness just a tragic event. We do not witness only thesad state of some distant community. In today's world when we see a child die  we lose another ray of hopethat our global community will come together as one that we shall live in peace and that we will finallytackle the challenges we all face together.In Greece  we have become deeply conscious ofthis reality. What goes on in our neighbourhooddirectly affects the way in which our children will growand develop. So we have made a commitment to ourworld and  more specifically  to our region  and it isthis commitment that I have come to share with theAssembly today.The two global events of this September — thisAssembly and the Olympic Games — symbolize thebeginning of an era for my country. After thisministerial week of the General Assembly  Greece willraise the Olympic flag in Sydney. For the second timein almost a century  the international community willbestow upon Athens the responsibility of theOlympiad.Over the next four years  Athens has committeditself to run both an athletic and a cultural Olympiad.Today  I commit our county to an Olympiad for peace:four years of the most relentless efforts and acommitment to the international community to fightagainst the evils that have kept our community ofnations at war  under totalitarianism and underoppression.I pledge today that when the Olympic flame ofour ancestors rises over the Athenian sky  it will lightup more than a shiny stadium. It will light up a wholearea of fighting for peace  democracy and justice. Thenext four years — the years that coincide with thisGreek Olympiad — will set of the stage upon which33the future event will unfold. The globalization of theeconomy  the increased power of the media and rapiddevelopments in information technology communications and biotechnology are just some ofthese new challenges.Globalization  while creating incredible wealthfor many  fosters conditions for conflict and poverty.The new economy cannot be dominated by interests and must be monitored to promote both democracy andhuman security. For the next four years  Greece willtake an active role in international forums to do its partin dealing with this problem of globalization. That iswhy Greece has also enthusiastically accepted aninvitation to join the Human Security Network.Human rights laws alone cannot provide forhuman rights; they must be strengthened by civicresponsibility and democratic institutions. We need tocreate structures that will reach beyond the democraticdeficits of the global community. We need to createregional cooperation  build civic structures andcommunity services and work with non-governmentalorganizations. We need to educate our citizens and oursocieties in making this process their own and allowtheir voice to be heard.This  in our view  is the role of the UnitedNations. This honourable Organization can and mustbridge the gap between the global challenges we faceand the democratic deficits that exist in our globalculture. We believe that now is the time to turn theUnited Nations from an Organization working toglobalize democracy into an Organization that is alsoable to democratize the process of globalization. TheMillennium Summit agenda is proof that theinternational community shares these views.Initiatives taken within the United Nations canmake our world a better place. Let me use a single butpowerful example. On 7 September  nations wereinvited to sign and ratify the Optional Protocol to theConvention on the Rights of the Child on theinvolvement of children in armed conflicts.Whatever the causes of modern-day brutalitytowards children  the time has come to call for a halt —to call for a truce. The most fundamental principle isthat children should have no part in war. This is onlyone of the initiatives that Greece will actively supportin the international arena in the coming years.At the same time  our view of the purpose ofinternational organizations comes from the richexperience we have amassed in our region. Startingwith the war in Kosovo  my country has been deeplyinvolved in the events unfolding in the area. Webelieve that the lessons of this involvement can greatlycontribute to the work of these organizations. We areeager to share our experience with the internationalcommunity.We believe that stability in our region is aprerequisite for Greek security  and we define stabilityto mean the practice of democracy  the strengthening ofinstitutions that provide transparency andaccountability  the reduction of economic inequalitiesand the rule of law in our societies and between ourcountries. Our security lies in being a member of theEuropean Union and of the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization  and we work so that countries in theregion may benefit from the stabilizing influence oftheir future membership in these institutions.During the Kosovo war  my colleagues inneighbouring countries and I decided to cooperateclosely to alleviate human suffering and avoid furtherinstability in our region. We grew to understand thatour fates were intrinsically linked. As a result  we werecompelled to discover ways to increase our cooperationand effectiveness in dealing with our problems. Wewould otherwise have been condemned to constantstrife  conflict and isolation in the world. In the nextfour years  Greece will build upon this base. We aredetermined to transform the plight of a war and itsbrutal memories into an opportunity for generations tocome.Through this process  I hope that Greece hasmanaged to inspire in the international community theimportance of a consistent  universal and unifyingpolicy towards South-Eastern Europe. From Bosnia toCyprus  we have the same objectives: we want thecountries in the region to be integral  peaceful anddemocratic; we want them to remain multicultural; andwe want them to join the European Union. Yugoslavia too  is an essential part of this political framework. Westrongly desire to see the return of Yugoslavia toEurope. I would like to endorse my Romaniancolleague's call to rethink our policy on sanctions which often do more to serve purposes contrary tothose for which we are striving.34That is our message. Even though it is simplesounding  our message is a radical break from the past when favouritism  cold-war intricacies and doublestandards consistently broke the spirit of the people inthe region. Now is the time to put an end to that. Wemust stop redrawing borders around ethnicallyhomogeneous communities while compelling them toseek the favours of greater Powers. In the next fouryears  we will commit Greece to an effort to transformthe multitude of races  religions and ethnicities in theregion into an instrument of solidarity and stability —a beautiful kaleidoscope of creative  multiculturalcooperation.Greece's vision for the Balkans is one of a regionin which democracy finally becomes the norm; wherecitizens' aspirations can finally be realized throughpeaceful and democratic practices; where the rights ofminorities are respected; and where Governments areaccountable  economies are transparent and politicsallow for the fullest participation of all elements ofsociety.The world has a responsibility in supporting thisvision for our region. We need to empower the region which has historically been handicapped  dependentand divided by a world community of competinginterests and a babble of conflicting signals. Thisbalkanization of the region must be replaced bycoordination of international efforts.This is why we have actively supported andpromoted this new vision within the internationalcommunity. Last year our efforts helped more than 40countries develop a unique contract between theinternational community and south-eastern Europe. Thecontract was coined the Stability Pact. We have a clearsense of how the Stability Pact can achieve its goalsand it is an optimistic sign that the European Union the United States and Russia cooperate closely withinits framework. Regional integration can also beachieved as the Stability Pact promotes investment ininfrastructure projects. Education is a primary goal anda strategy for democratic leadership and institution-building  which will stimulate economic growth andwill bring us together. The pact actively promotesrespect for the rule law among States and peoples inthe region.Our stand in international organizations and ouragenda for the next four years is coloured also by ourrecent experience with Turkey. The earthquakes thatshook Greece and Turkey a year ago created a newclimate for the first time in our recent history. Tragedygenerated a genuine feeling of human warmth.Spontaneous and dramatic acts of fraternity andsolidarity were expressed. Our mandate was clear. Ourpeoples desire to live in peace together.Since the earthquakes  Greeks and Turks areusing every opportunity to explore their newly foundneighbours  and to come together  meet  exchangeexperiences and make up for lost time. On a bilaterallevel we have signed 10 agreements that will radicallychange the environment in which we interact; in oneyear  10 agreements. We do not view thesedevelopments as a momentary result of what was latelycoined as seismic diplomacy. We view them as thebeginning of a long process that will radically affectour lives in the coming years.We have opened a dialogue; one that is honest.And although we may differ and do differ on manyissues  such as how we see Cyprus or how we approachour bilateral relations  this open approach can only leadto a progressive resolution of our problems. When Ispeak today I know that those of the Turkish side willnot or may not agree on many issues. But they knowwe are honest. We are honest in what we say and in ourdesire for a new and peaceful relation.I believe that Greece and Turkey have no choicebut to explore new avenues for cooperation. I believeour mutual interests can outweigh our politicaldifferences. We can and must resolve these differencesthrough peaceful means; peaceful means of that of theInternational Court of Justice.The European Union's decision to upgradeTurkey's status to that of a candidate country inHelsinki in December marked an historic turning pointin Greek-Turkish relations. Helsinki does not signal theend of Greece's efforts; it represents the beginning of anew and equally courageous Greek initiative. In thiscontext  we are ready also to further discussconfidence-building measures between Greece andTurkey.I do not want to give the false impression that allour problems have suddenly been resolved. It is alsomost distressing that a variety of statements and actsstill undermine this genuine and difficult effort  andthere are those who certainly may wish that our effortswill fail. It is our historical duty to overcome these35difficulties and maintain the momentum in response toour peoples' mandate for peace.I would like to thank the Secretary-General andall those who labour with him towards a just solution inCyprus: a solution based on United Nations resolutionsfor a bi-zonal  bi-communal federation in oneinternational personality  one citizenship and onesovereignty.At this time  I would appeal to him to moveforward with the peace talks on this basis. Theimplementation of United Nations resolutions is notonly important for Cyprus. It is important for the moralstanding of this all-important Organization. Doublestandards and inaction only serve to undermine thecredibility of this Organization in the eyes of so manycountries and peoples.One cannot accept developments such as thosethat recently took place in Strovilia. This responsibilityrests with the United Nations  with the guarantorpowers and all those who have a say in internationaldevelopments. It has become obvious that the currentsituation in Cyprus and its occupation by foreign forceschallenges the integrity and credibility of thishonourable Organization. I know this term may bepainful  but Cyprus is an occupied island  and this mustend. We need to go beyond the situation and it will takecourage; courage from all involved.A solution to the Cyprus problem can and shouldbe seen as a win-win situation. It is vital for peace stability and security in our region. I truly believe thatthe Greek-Cypriot and the Turkish-Cypriotcommunities can find solutions  and we must allowthem to live together peacefully. We can aid them inthis process. Greece and Turkey can aid them. Cypruswill either unite us or divide us  Greece and Turkey.We have a responsibility to cooperate on Cyprus and tofacilitate the solution to this process. Greece andTurkey  through their rapprochement  share a rareopportunity to help the citizens of Cyprus rebuild theirisland  their homes and their dreams. The outcome ofthese efforts should be that every Cypriot enjoys safety equality under the law  protection of their humanrights  appropriate representation and security under aEuropean roof.Cyprus  Turkey and Greece: for anyone willing toenvision the future  our futures are as interwoven asour histories. A reunified federal Cyprus  member ofthe European Union  will not only serve the Europeanaspiration for stability in the region  but the aspirationsof every citizen in every one of the countries involved.I extend my appeal to the Turkish Cypriots. Wewant them near us  in our wider European family. Inthis family we do not only guarantee them thesolidarity of the Greek people  but also thecommitment of the Greek Government. Our citizenswill only master the great possibilities that lie ahead ifthis last wall in Cyprus comes tumbling down.Our experience in our region  our rapprochementwith Turkey and our consistent efforts for a justsolution in Cyprus have given Greece a new voice inthe international community. We treasure our newcapacity and intend to grow it further. During ourOlympiad for Peace we plan to keep a close eye ondevelopments in the Middle East  always seekingmethods to facilitate the hopeful process. We shallfollow closely developments in the South andparticularly in Africa  a continent for which the Greekpeople share a special place in their hearts. Ouremphasis will be on children: their rights  their right toavoid a violent life.Our concentration in our Olympiad for Peace willbe on international initiatives in which our country canplay a role. Drawing on our ancient traditions  we areworking to re-establish the practice of Olympic Truce.We aspire to the day when the tradition of suspendingall hostilities during the Olympic Games becomes theseed for a more lasting peace. Huge amounts ofresources are wasted on military procurements and war and they must be channelled into health  education culture and sport. To this end and in close cooperationwith the International Olympic Committee andPresident Samaranch  we have established theInternational Centre for Olympic Truce in Greece.In both ancient and modern Greek  the word fortruce is ekecheiria. It has a dual meaning. It meanssetting one's weapons aside  but it also means reachingout one's hand in friendship. We do not simply aspireto a momentary truce  but to a continuous truce  anactive truce.The concept of Olympic Truce can complementthe work of national and international organizationsspecializing in conflict prevention and resolution andintergovernmental and non-governmental organizationssharing similar objectives. The Centre in Olympia willoffer a sanctuary to support peace-building. This yearwe hosted children from war-torn areas in the Balkans.36Truce in Bosnia in 1992 allowed for children to beinoculated. Truce in Sidney this year will allow forNorth and South Korean teams to march under thesame flags: an historic moment.I started my address by saying that people comingtogether has always been the prerequisite for building abetter world and a more secure future. I conclude byappeal to members. Take this ancient tradition  whichby now is no longer exclusively Greek. It has becomeuniversal. Use this tool to complement efforts andinspire the younger generation for peace andcooperation  going beyond ethnic  racial  religious orother divisions.This is the objective of the Olympic Truce. Andthis is the foundation upon which Greece shall build itsfour-year Olympiad for Peace."
"67",2864,"GRD",55,2000,"My delegation greets andcongratulates you  Sir  for presiding over thedeliberations of the fifty-fifth session of the UnitedNations General Assembly — the MillenniumAssembly.We pay tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Theo-BenGurirab  the distinguished Foreign Minister ofNamibia  for his effective and dynamic conduct of thefifty-fourth session of the United Nations GeneralAssembly  including the preparations for theMillennium Summit and the President's Report.Congratulations are also extended to ourdistinguished Secretary-General  who with great visionconceptualized the Millennium Summit  the executionof which was a great triumph for the United Nations.A hearty welcome is extended to the smallsovereign State of Tuvalu  as it joins the family ofnations.The Millennium Summit and this fifty-fifthsession of the United Nations General Assembly arehistoric events that provide a unique opportunity toview humanity's progress and face the challengesbefore us.Indeed  the Summit Declaration sets out a globalvision for the twenty-first century. My delegationwelcomes the inclusion of commitments to fightpoverty  disease  ignorance  injustice  violence anddegradation of the environment  among others.In the matter of poverty and disease  the UnitedNations must address the inequalities that exist aroundthe world. In this twenty-first century  more than 1.2billion people live on less than one dollar a day.Millions of children and the elderly go to bed hungry.Disease and sickness wreak havoc on the lives ofchildren  men and women. Today the HIV/AIDSpandemic cuts short the lives of millions of people whocould be making useful and productive contributions toour world.Trade is vital to the livelihood of Grenadians. Forthe banana-exporting countries of the Caribbeansubregion  which includes Grenada  the export ofbananas accounts for a significant percentage offoreign exchange. However  our economies arethreatened by the callous ruling of the World TradeOrganization (WTO) against the European Unionbanana regime of assistance to our small growers.Our struggling farmers  with limited acreage  findit difficult  if not impossible  to compete with atransnational corporation. Our farmers need anadjustment period in order to effect the requisitestructural changes needed by the new trade regime. Welook to the United Nations to call upon the WTO totake into consideration the special structural problemsfaced by the small banana producers of the Caribbean.2We call for corporate responsibility. We appealfor measures to encourage the sustainability of smalleconomies and economies in transition. We urge amore equitable global partnership.You may recall that the Heads of State andGovernment  including the Prime Minister of Grenada stressed recently in this very hall the urgency ofreleasing poor developing countries from their debtburden. The leaders expressed an interest in findingnew approaches and new thinking with respect to thisproblem. A solution should be vigorously pursued withdeliberate speed.Debt forgiveness is not a financial loss to theglobal economy. Rather  it provides an opportunity forstimulation in the depressed and stagnant parts of theworld's economy. Investing the dividends realized bydebt forgiveness in the economy of the debtordeveloping countries — especially the least developedand those with economies in transition — would be amajor investment in global development.Another area that needs urgent and immediateassistance from the international community is that ofnatural disasters. The costly restoration ofinfrastructure and rehabilitation of the productivesectors  especially agriculture and tourism  and thehigh cost of recovering and rebuilding make theattainment of sustainable development a monumentaltask.My delegation calls upon the United Nations andits agencies  the International Monetary Fund  theWorld Bank and other international agencies  as well asthe private and public sectors in global partnership including the Global Compact  to contribute to a wellstructured disaster relief fund  a relief fund that canrespond quickly and effectively.A large percentage of the needs of the developingcountries in the Caribbean subregion and elsewhere canbe met. We look forward to positive developmentsenvisaged from globalization  trade liberalization information technology and sustainable development.These and other well-conceived programmes must beseriously pursued. Lip service is not enough.As the Secretary-General noted in his report tothe fifty-fifth General Assembly on the work of theOrganization: “To some  globalization is imbued withgreat promise; to others  it appears deeply threatening.”(A/55/1  para. 13)The international community must help to ensurethat the have-nots are on board this fast-moving trainof globalization. All Member States need to share inthe opportunities provided by globalization. This wouldact as a vehicle for international peace and economicsecurity.Removing some of the barriers to trade andcapital flow are prerequisites to successful reduction ofpoverty and disease in the developing countries. Thiscan be mutually beneficial to developed anddeveloping countries.Trade has been the engine of economic growthand development from the days of bartering to thepresent day of e-commerce and globalization. Wetherefore regard the unilateral interference in ouroffshore services sector as an attempt to hinder ourtrade in services and our role in the global economy.In that connection  my delegation recalls thewords of my Prime Minister about the unfair chargeslevelled against our offshore financial-services sector.“A cartel of high-tax nations  comprisingthe richest and most powerful countries  haslaunched a destructive and high-powered attackon our country  accusing us of anti-competitivetax practices. Threats  imperialistic pressures andabuse of power in multilateral organizations arebeing used to force many small States  includingGrenada  to give up our fiscal sovereignty. Theyhave used adverse publicity techniquesdeliberately to condemn and harm our economies.They have threatened various sanctions  sought toblock access to capital funds in multinationalorganizations and to impose financialprotectionism and total ostracism.”That is fiscal imperialism. It tramples on the principleof sovereign equality. It is contrary to international law and it undermines freedom of competition  globalinvestment and trade liberalization.The role of education in poverty alleviation  inthe application of science and technology and in thevast area of information sharing and communications isvital. The Government of Grenada  recognizing thesocial  cultural and economic potential of education  isinvesting an increasing proportion of its limitedresources to prepare its people to participate in  andbenefit from  the information and technologyrevolution. Towards that end  the Government of3Grenada is seeking the assistance of the United NationsDevelopment Programme  the World Bank andagencies and donors of goodwill to establish a newprogramme of distance learning by means of globalcomputer interconnectivity.Grenada attaches great importance to theconvening in 2001 of the United Nations High-levelIntergovernmental Event on Financing forDevelopment. My delegation welcomes the attempt toaddress monetary  trade and financial issues in aholistic manner and in the context of globalization andsustainable development. The international communityshould not miss this opportunity to focus attention andresources on the pursuit of development  peace andstability.And here  my delegation reaffirms that the rootcause of conflict within nations and among nations canbe found in some of the injustice done to the weakermembers of the international community by thestronger ones. Unless the basics of life — food clothing  shelter  health and employment — areattained  human rights and the Universal Declaration ofHuman Rights will be meaningless to those who suffersuch extreme deprivations. This is especially so in thecontext of economic  social and cultural rights  whichare downplayed in favour of civil and political rights.Since all human rights are universal  indivisible interdependent and interrelated  attention to the fullrange of rights will contribute better to the observanceand enjoyment of this noble goal.I join my Prime Minister in paying tribute to  andpublicly thanking  the Government and the people ofthe Republic of China on Taiwan for the assistancegiven to Grenada with respect to agriculture  marineresources  education  health  culture and infrastructure.The friendship and sincerity of the Republic of Chinaon Taiwan have been a source of strength andendurance for our two countries. 1t is in this spirit thatGrenada calls once more for the return of the Republicof China on Taiwan to full membership of the UnitedNations. A people that diligently works to achieve suchhigh levels of human and technological developmentand a people that makes such positive contributions tothe global economy must become a full Member of thisgreat organization  the United Nations.Finally  we must seek to ensure that theOrganization is responsive to the ever-changing globalenvironment. Let us ensure that we address the needsof our peoples. And let us move forward with a UnitedNations that is prepared to fuel the engine that wouldbring about more equitable participation in the globalcommunity. Let us always put people first and beguided by God."
"68",2911,"GTM",55,2000,"Lessthan a week ago  in this same Hall  the President of theRepublic of Guatemala  Alfonso Portillo Cabrera addressed the Millennium Summit. On that occasionthe President underscored our commitment to thepurposes  principles and values of the Charter of theUnited Nations  and presented a summary of our viewof the role of this universal Organization in the twenty-first century. In closing  he stated:“In the course of the general debate that willbegin in the General Assembly next week  wewill elaborate further on this vision and how it isreflected in the efforts we are makingdomestically.” (A/55/PV.3)I am honoured and pleased to deliver what ourPresident promised.I shall address two issues: first  our Governmentprogramme and the implementation of the peaceagreements  and secondly  our position vis-à-vis someof the items on the agenda for this session. Beforedoing so  I wish to pay tribute to the Minister forForeign Affairs of Namibia  Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  forhis vigorous conduct of the last session  andparticularly for his resolute work in the preparation forthe Millennium Summit. We are pleased thatGuatemala had an opportunity to cooperate in thisundertaking.I also wish to congratulate the President verywarmly on his election to preside over our debates. Ihave no doubt that his recognized diplomatic andpolitical experience will enable us to obtain the bestresults.16I begin with a few words on the peace process inmy country  to which the United Nations has madesuch a significant contribution. December 1996 saw thesigning  following a protracted period of arduousnegotiations of Agreements that brought to an end fourdecades of a fratricidal war that had tragic and lastingconsequences. Our political party was not a signatory.However  during the electoral campaign it affirmed that it accepted the Agreements as a State commitment and President Portillo confirmed that in the speech hemade on taking office. Similarly  our Government isfully committed to complying with the provisions ofthe Agreements  and indeed to extend their scope toincorporate new matters  such as democratizing accessto credit.We value highly the presence in our country ofthe United Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala and request the Assembly's cooperation for theextension  in due course  of its mandate until the end of2003.It is important to note that the purpose of thePeace Agreements coincides with our own Governmentprogramme in many areas  such as unrestricted respectfor human rights; consolidation of a full  participatorydemocracy; subordination of the armed forces to thecivil power; development of a multi-ethnic multicultural and multilingual society; strengtheningand modernization of the justice system; reform of theState; and  above all  an adequate response to theunsatisfied demands of the majority of Guatemalans formore and better social services  adequate incomes better-paid jobs and equality of opportunity. In otherwords  the Peace Agreements constitute a suitableframe of reference for the programme of ourGovernment  which aims not only to fulfil  but toimprove on them.Our economic and social programmes for theperiod 2000-2004 fit within this frame of reference  asdoes the political covenant  which seeks to increase theparticipation of all sections of civil society in thepublic policy decision-making process. Theseprogrammes also seek to reconcile the difficulteconomic situation that we face with our commitmentto carry forward a vigorous process of economicexpansion for the benefit of all Guatemalans — aboveall  the neediest. We are  in other words  grappling withthe classic dilemma of having to meet the requirementsof a macroeconomic adjustment while coping with theimperative need to reactivate the economy.At the centre of the national debate about how toovercome this dilemma is a process of intersectoralaccommodation that we call the “fiscal covenant” which aims to fulfil one of the commitments in thePeace Agreements  namely  raising the tax take inGuatemala by 50 per cent between 1995 and 2000.The arduous and lengthy negotiations that havebeen conducted in this connection are about to come tofruition with the adoption of a set of measures which once the commitment has been honoured — admittedly a couple of years late — will provide financial supportfor implementing the other undertakings laid down inthe Peace Agreements.We intend to establish the necessary bases so thatin the period 2001-2004 we may secure dynamicgrowth of the economy  with the resulting generation ofdecent  gainful productive employment together withhigher levels of savings and investment.We shall invest in the future by according priorityto the work force  particularly in the areas of health andeducation  including multilingual education.We shall carry out new productive activities inthose areas where we feel that we have comparativeadvantages to offer at the international level.We shall stimulate the institutional environmentnecessary to facilitate the efficient functioning of themarket through competition without privileges and thecompetitiveness of enterprises  all within theframework of absolute respect for labour law.We shall devote special attention to combatingpoverty  by decentralizing the public administrationand working closely with those who are to be the targetof our policies.Now turning to our international relations  andbearing in mind those issues dealt with at theMillennium Summit  I wish to mention the significantadvance achieved in the process as we seek to resolveour historic dispute with Belize. With full regard forthe principles of peaceful settlement of disputesbetween or among States  we have reached a new stagewhereby dialogue has been chosen as the means tosettle differences. On 31 August  within the frameworkof the regional body to which both States belong namely the Organization of American States (OAS)  abody of facilitators  appointed by each party  has beenset up. The facilitators enjoy full independence in theperformance of their duties. Their chief aim is to work17out and propose courses of action to advance the legalresolution of the dispute. These are significant stepstowards creating a peaceful environment  the adoptionof confidence-building measures and a future-orientedor forward-looking outlook.Similarly  we ratify  our deep commitment tosupporting Central American integration  as well as ourcommitment to the rest of Latin America and theCaribbean. Our Government has taken importantinitiatives in the area of regional and subregionalintegration. Evidence of this is the tripartite declarationadopted last May by Guatemala  El Salvador andNicaragua in order to give fresh impetus to CentralAmerican integration.The question of migrations is also an importantbranch of our international relations  one whereGuatemala bases its policy on the principle thatwhatever the legal status of migrants may be  they arehuman beings fully entitled to rights under the law and as such  capable of invoking the full range of humanrights. Evidence of this is the fact that during his visitto the United Nations in connection with theMillennium Summit  the President of the Republic signed the International Convention on the Protectionof the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members oftheir Families. The best way to discourage migration isto create sources of employment in the countries oforigin. The industrial countries  therefore  mustdismantle all kinds of barriers so that developingcountries are enabled to export commodities and notpeople.I should now like briefly to explain our thinkingon those main items that will be discussed in theAssembly at its fifty-fifth regular session.First  I wish to restate our full backing for theUnited Nations  as expressed by President Portillo lastweek  since the Organization is the highestembodiment of multilateralism. We are persuaded thatthe Organization will have a crucial role to play in thetwenty-first century. I attest to the tangible contributionthat the United Nations has recently made in mycountry as regards both the consolidation of peace andin cooperation for development through the UnitedNations Development Programme (UNDP) and UnitedNations agencies.Secondly  we also wish to observe that it isnecessary to adapt the Organization to the exigenciesof globalization and to this post-cold war era. It is up tous  as member Governments  to promote thisadaptation in various spheres such asintergovernmental bodies  efficiency and effectivenessof the Secretariat  the setting of priorities in theprogramme of activities and the financial strengtheningof the Organization.Of the pending reforms  the one which hasreceived most attention is the Security Council. Canthere be any doubt that its membership or its methodsof work must reflect the prevailing circumstances of acontemporary world? There is no need to be frustratedat the lack of progress in prior sessions of the GeneralAssembly in connection with the reform of the SecurityCouncil. We appreciate that there are differingviewpoints in this regard and  of course  differencestend to stalemate or paralyse action. But this should notprevent us from redoubling our efforts to make thisabsolutely vital organ of the United Nations moreeffective  more representative of the Members of theOrganization as a whole and more transparent in theway it operates. To achieve those ends we advocate among other things  expansion of the membership ofthe Council as well as an exercise of the veto in strictconformity with the Charter. We feel that  at any rate regular use should be subject to review by the GeneralAssembly and  in extreme instances  by theInternational Court of Justice in the interests of agenuine rule of law of an international character  thusavoiding abuses.Thirdly  we are convinced that we need tostrengthen our collective capacity to prevent and settleconflicts  both across borders and domestically. Webelieve that the recently submitted report by the Panelon United Nations peacekeeping operations offers anexcellent point of departure for this purpose. Our onlypreliminary observation on the matter is thatstrengthening the United Nations capacity in this areashould not be carried out at the expense of oureconomic and social activities. Rather  should wedecide to implement the recommendations of the Groupof Experts  then the time will have come to put an endto an ill-conceived policy of zero growth of the UnitedNations budget. As President Portillo stated:“If we want the United Nations to be a firstclass institution  we must learn to provide it withthe necessary financial support.” (A/55/PV.3)This brings me to a fourth point that has gainedconsiderable prominence in the agenda for this session.18I refer to the controversial question of revising thescale of assessments both for the regular budget and forthe peacekeeping counterpart. Our position is verystraightforward. We agree that the relative situation ofmany countries has developed over the years and thiswarrants a revision of the way in which we share theburden of financially maintaining the United Nations.At the same time  however  we feel that the mostimportant criterion for fixing the scale of assessmentsis ability to pay. The relative participation of countriesin the gross domestic product of the world continues toprovide a basic yardstick. There is also justification forweighting this yardstick on the basis of certain specialconsiderations  such as  for instance  recognition of thespecial situation of the least-developed countries on theone hand  and  on the other  of the specialresponsibility that should be assumed by the permanentmembers of the Security Council for maintainingpeace.In fifth place  as regards general disarmament  weemphasize the need to advance towards totalelimination of nuclear  chemical and bacteriologicalweapons; illicit trafficking in small arms  and the useof anti-personnel mines and explosive devices. Inrespect of these matters we strongly support allpractical action being undertaken by the UnitedNations to achieve these aims as well as those designedto establish nuclear-weapon-free zones in all parts ofthe world.In the sixth place  we offer our full support forand active participation in the main events scheduled inthe coming years. Among them  I wish to single out thehigh-level intergovernmental event on financing fordevelopment and the World Conference on Racism Racial Discrimination  Xenophobia and RelatedIntolerance.In the seventh place  in an increasinglyinterdependent world  multilateral diplomacy has acrucial role to play in the struggle againstenvironmental degradation. As Guatemala is a party tothe main global environmental treaties  we reaffirm ourcommitment to the maintenance of ecological balance.Finally  we feel the United Nations shouldcontinue to concern itself with what we have called thegreat unfinished task of the twentieth century:eradicating world poverty. Together with themultilateral financial institutions  our Organizationshould play a crucial role in ensuring that the benefitsof globalization are widely shared by all countries.This calls for action at the level of each country  butalso at the international level.Similarly  by way of general comment  we wishto reiterate  before this Assembly  that Guatemala  inits very flesh  has experienced fratricidal confrontation.That is why Guatemala has the moral authority toinsist  before God and man  that peace reign among allthe peoples of the world  particularly between theseparated brothers of China and Taiwan. We thereforeappeal for the continuation of talks in order to achievean outcome that will fulfil the aspirations of theChinese people on both sides of the Strait  reachedthrough peaceful  free and democratic means.Likewise  we trust that a prompt solution to theMiddle East conflict will be found and that situationsof tension in the African continent and other parts ofEurope will be overcome  as well as among any otherfraternal people of the world who are victims ofviolence and discord.I wish to conclude my statement by expressing apersonal conviction. I am persuaded that all humanbeings are equal in the eyes of the Almighty  withoutdistinction as to race  language or creed. I trust that inthat same spirit we shall be able to beginning from thissession to give effect to the guidelines enshrined in theMillennium Declaration adopted last week."
"69",2954,"GUY",55,2000,"Still fresh in our minds isthe strong plea made by the leaders of the world attheir historic meeting on the eve of this fifty-fifthAssembly for a universal recommitment tomultilateralism and to the purposes and principles ofthe United Nations. Their Declaration at the Summit'send was unanimous and unambiguous. Humanity'sfuture lies in the hands of this Organization and itsability to create a new global order for the promotionof peace and development. It is a conclusion which theAssembly must take to heart if it is to fulfil this urgentmandate.I am confident that our task will be facilitated byour President's skilful direction. Coming from Finland a country that has been forged by history on the anvilof political  economic and social endurance  he willundoubtedly bring to bear on our deliberations a senseof purpose and urgency. In congratulating him on hiselection  Guyana pledges a readiness to cooperate tomake this Assembly abundantly successful.My delegation also offers its appreciation andthanks to His Excellency Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab for theable leadership he provided the fifty-fourth GeneralAssembly.Our gratitude is also due to Secretary-GeneralKofi Annan  who continues to manage the Organizationwith a sure and steady hand. The report that hesubmitted to the Assembly  “We the peoples — the roleof the United Nations in the twenty-first century” amply addresses the many important challenges that lieahead of us. It is well worth our study to see whatmeasures the Assembly can take to promote globalpeace and development through strengthening of theOrganization.As the report demonstrates  a high level oftension now exists in the governance of the globaleconomy. While it has been generally acknowledgedthat markets offer opportunities for growth anddevelopment  there is still the caveat against excessivereliance on them. As many developing countries havediscovered  the market is often blind to their particularcircumstances and needs. Their concerns have raisedserious questions about the fairness of the tradingsystem  leading to much public protest  as wasdramatically expressed in Seattle and almost every citywhere the Bretton Woods institutions and the WorldTrade Organization (WTO) have tried to hold meetings.The message is clear: the internationalcommunity must find a consensus on ways and meansto ensure more democratic governance in internationalaffairs so that the developing countries can have agreater say in shaping their own future.The gap between the richest and poorest countrieshas widened so dramatically during recent years thatstrong and urgent action must be taken to avoid a majorhuman disaster. For most developing countries such asmy own  a scarcity of financial and human resourcesplaces serious constraints on the policy options theyare able to exercise. Despite the fact that many haveembraced market-based reforms and democraticgovernance  they have had limited success inimproving the socio-economic conditions of theirpeople.Their efforts to undertake important reforms andto lift themselves up by their boot-straps have beenrewarded by a denial of much-needed assistance tosustain the progress achieved. The hostile internationalenvironment in which they find themselves not only21frustrates their economic and social development butalso renders the strengthening of the democraticprocess extremely difficult.Thus  while globalization has benefited strongeconomies  it has weakened many developing countriesand forced them into the backwaters of development.Severe economic and social dislocation has followed inmany cases  accentuating the particular vulnerabilitiesof small economies  many of which are oftendependent on a single agriculture crop for thelivelihood of their peoples. While the proponents ofeconomic liberalization contend that the market offers“a level playing field”  they conveniently forget andfail to realize that the players are not equally matchedand that the rules of the game are stacked in favour ofthe strong. The weak can hardly compete and areeventually marginalized. Indeed  it is a zero-sum game where both winners and losers are known in advance.The majority of developing countries continue tobe crippled by weak infrastructure such as roads communications and other physical requirements andthe inadequacy of skilled labour to take advantage ofopportunities in the market. Moreover  they must facenot only high production costs but also low prices andinadequate access to markets. Trade liberalization hasalso led to a rapid growth in imports by developingcountries  while their own exports remain sluggish andtheir trade deficit widens. In the process  Governmentslose much-needed revenues from duties and taxes which hitherto made an appreciable contribution to thenational budget.Meanwhile  official development assistance hasfallen to its lowest since the target of 0.7 per cent ofGross National Product (GNP) was established by theUnited Nations in 1970. Only four countries —Denmark  the Netherlands  Norway and Sweden —have reached the mark. On average  developedcountries contribute less than a third of this targetfigure  with the richest countries contributing even less.Assistance is now apparently seen by some as bothwasteful and wasted  a perception which may serve toexplain this rapid decline. Yet for many of the poordeveloping countries  such assistance is indispensableif they are to improve their economic performance. Tomake matters worse  they find it difficult without therequisite technology and human resource base to attractforeign direct investment  which is increasinglyconcentrated in a small number of emergingeconomies.The challenge facing the international communityand policy-makers in the new millennium  therefore  isto redress these inequities in the global economy in acomprehensive and sustainable manner so as to ensurethe smooth integration of developing countries  inparticular the smaller economies  into the globalizingworld economy. Developing countries are not askingfor charity — merely the opportunity to develop theirpotential and to take their rightful place in theinternational community. As they have said  theyrecognize their primary responsibility for their owndevelopment. They ask only for assistance in creating adomestic environment that will enable them toparticipate fairly in the global economy.A helpful measure would be to integratetransition periods into current economic models andmake provisions for targeted assistance to smalleconomies. Another would be to provide significantdebt relief and debt cancellation as necessary  togetherwith development assistance to boost the overallproductive capability of developing countries.Developed countries could also assist inpromoting regional integration  as well as South-Southcooperation  to allow developing countries to benefitfrom the many complementarities that they possess.Equally indispensable is the provision of new andadditional resources through the establishment of aglobal development fund that would help to bridge thegap between the developed and developing worlds. Anaction-oriented programme  somewhat along the linesof the post-Second World War Marshall Plan  isnecessary to achieve meaningful progress.Policies aimed merely at creating unsustainablesocial safety nets are hardly lasting solutions. The rootcauses of the social and endemic problems of thedeveloping countries  which ultimately lead to globalinstability  must be addressed. To this end  we mustfind a way to direct aid and investment into buildingcapital  both human and physical. We cannot speakseriously of closing the digital divide in anenvironment in which many Governments arestruggling to meet even the most basic needs of theirpopulations and where degraded infrastructure does notsupport a “communications revolution”.In this context  we have noted the Secretary-General's initiative to forge a global compact betweenthe United Nations  the private sector and non-governmental organizations in an effort to maximize22the development effort. Such a strategic alliance canindeed enhance cooperation on a wide array of globalissues  including aid  trade and investment  andprotection of the environment as well as satisfy urgenteducation  health and housing needs. To succeed however  such a compact must be based on mutualunderstanding and respect through a clear definition ofthe respective roles of the partners. There must becommon objectives and agendas  as well as a cleardefinition of the roles of each partner.Finally  the international community  and moreparticularly the developed North  must recognize theclose link between freedom from want and freedomfrom fear — between development  peace and stability.At the national level  we know that good governancemust be practised to ensure that the population areprotected from all forms of oppression and allowed toenjoy their inalienable human rights. Correspondingly at the international level  the principles of the Charter as well as the laws which we  as civilized nations  havecome to accept  must be respected to provide anenvironment conducive to development.In chapter IV of his report the Secretary-Generalremarks:“Economic globalization has largely eliminatedthe benefits of territorial acquisition  while thedestructiveness of modern warfare has increasedits costs.” (A/54/2000  para. 192)This lesson must be learned by States which  despitetheir professed commitment to the Charter  often resortto various forms of coercion in international relations.The United Nations  and more particularly the SecurityCouncil  should not — and  indeed  must not —tolerate such actions. All disputes must be resolvedthrough peaceful means.While many of the proposals made by theSecretary-General in his report will undoubtedly helpto contain the threats to peace and development in thetwenty-first century  we rather fear that they will beinsufficient to meet our requirements if they arepursued in a piecemeal fashion without a morecomprehensive and holistic framework. It is for thisreason that Guyana sought the inclusion on this year'sagenda of an item on promoting a new global humanorder. Time does not allow me to provide the details ofthis initiative. However  so that the concept may bemore fully understood and widely supported  I haveasked that  along with copies of my statement  anexplanatory memorandum outlining the aim of ourproposal be circulated. Very shortly we will also makeavailable a more extensive document that could serveas the basis for discussion in plenary session. It is ourhope that out of this consideration will emerge aresolution that expresses the determination of theinternational community to find a consensus on theway forward to securing global peace anddevelopment.The time is now opportune  I believe  for us tosummon up our collective political will to devise acommon and cogent strategy for managing the globalagenda in the twenty-first century. Should we fail toheed this imperative  we will continue to plough thesea and reap only disillusionment and despair. ThisMillennium Assembly affords us a singular opportunityto define the terms and conditions of a new globalpartnership. Let us not waste it in futile debate  but rather  use it to give new hope to our peoples for abetter future."
"70",3000,"HND",55,2000,"It is an honour for me to address the GeneralAssembly  which will complement the recentMillennium Summit by providing a fundamentalcontribution to the current stage of transition towards aUnited Nations in tune with reality.International peace and security  along withcooperation and solidarity for sustainable humandevelopment  must become the fundamentalinstruments of our new Organization in the newmillennium. Peace and security require a renewedcommitment to international law  full respect for andfaithful  prompt compliance with the decisions of theInternational Court of Justice  national compliancewith the standards imposed by treaties and good faithin the application of laws  uncompromised by domesticpolitical agendas.Honduras  a founding Member of the UnitedNations  considers that the decisions of theInternational Court of Justice are a solid basis for theresolution of international conflicts and that theyrepresent the fundamental norms for coexistenceamong States  with the support of the Security Councilas the guarantor of their implementation.Peace and security among nations require thedelimitation of land and maritime areas  in keepingwith the rules of international law. They require respectfor historical rights and the non-use of force. Only withdefined boundaries can we determine clearly whatcontribution everyone can make to our common causesand promote the development of borders of solidarityon the basis of a culture of peace.The 1 000 years that now lie behind us producedextraordinary advances in the history of humanity. Butthey also left us tasks to be completed relating toproblems such as racism  xenophobia  an arsenal ofweapons of various magnitudes and the effects of aculture of violence and destruction. This is why wefirmly support the consolidation of the peace process inthe Middle East. We welcome the constructive dialoguelaunched by the two Koreas in an effort to normalize22their relations  as we welcome peaceful solutions forany divided society.As regards globalization  we must tackle not onlythe economic aspect  but also social well-being.Education is a passport to the future  but only if theeducation provided is the same for all  and not just fora minority  and only if education is life-affirming andpromotes change so as to teach all human beings on theearth to live together.For this purpose  as the United NationsEducational  Scientific and Cultural Organization  haspointed out  we must learn to know  we must learn todo  we must learn to be. In this area  we believe thatthe Economic and Social Council of our Organizationmust promote and pursue its initiative for greaterdissemination of technological information  asproposed by its members during the high-level segmentthis year. It must try to prevent disparities intechnological development that benefit onlyindustrialized countries.Millions of human beings are noting withamazement that there exist realities very different fromtheir own harsh conditions. When they try to travel tothat fantastic world  to that dream of hope  they findout that borders do exist and that they are free only tocontinue dreaming.Globalization is a coin with two faces. On the onehand  it creates wealth  benefits  possibilities  but onthe other  poverty  problems  inequity and even newforms of exclusion. Instead  globalization should createfor the benefit of all a world without any exclusions.Our responsibility is to bring about the globalization ofthe development of the human being.Honduras is participating in the Central Americanintegration process. We see this as a way of having agreater presence and being more active in thisglobalized world. This is why we actively support thestrengthening of the institutional process of CentralAmerican integration.Despite the advances that occurred in the pastmillennium  the terms of trade continue to work againstthe development of many of our countries. Theincrease in oil prices has a devastating effect on theweakest economies  and  paradoxically  the more weincrease production  the more we open our doors tointernational trade and eliminate barriers  the moreobstacles we encounter to gaining access tointernational markets. This creates a crisis for ourexport capacity. Trade globalization must producebenefits in both directions.In addition to the asymmetries and disparities towhich I have referred  there are also threats of differenttypes that no State  however powerful or strong  cansuccessfully confront in isolation. The report of theSecretary-General to the Millennium Summit attachedas much importance to the topic of the environment asit did to peace and development. This demonstrates thatin the year 2000 we recognize that  in addition toachieving peace and economic development  we musttake care of our environment. If we do not  the futureof humanity will continue to be threatened. Every daywe are increasingly threatened by the lack of drinkingwater  desertification  the destruction of the ozonelayer and climate change. These processes haveproduced an increase in natural disasters. Honduras my country  was the victim of a disaster of catastrophicproportions. This is why we attach such priority tocaring for the environment and to education on how topromote and preserve it.The need to control the production of greenhousegases  the widening of the hole in the ozone layer  thedrop in oxygen production  the pollution of fresh andsalt water  the extinction of thousands of species  allthese form part of that greater concern that we mustconfront jointly.Similarly  terrorism  organized crime and drugtrafficking can be combated effectively only if we actjointly and in coordination. If we do not  we will bejointly responsible as accomplices in the destruction ofthe hopes of the future youth and children.Our Organization should make a greater effort toovercome the disparity between abundance and want of which very concrete examples abound. For instance today hundreds of thousands of medicines areproduced  but the millions of human beings affected byHIV/AIDS need access to these medicines if their painis to be relieved. It is truly horrifying that the worldproduces thousands of metric tons more food than isneeded to feed its population  and yet people are dyingof hunger and malnutrition. The poverty and hunger ofmillions of human beings is an insult to humanity andan affront to the dignity of individuals. Here there isroom for improved coordination.Our Organization continues its important effortsto prevent world conflicts. There have been many23achievements in implementing machinery for worldorder and peace  including peacekeeping activities andthe work of the international tribunals. We have alsoseen progress in disarmament  particularly in terms ofweapons of mass destruction. Aware of its internationalresponsibilities  Honduras  to the extent that itsresources permit  has also contributed to internationalpeace and security  participating in the missions inHaiti and Western Sahara.The United Nations Development Programme(UNDP) has also acted as a partner in the developmentprocess in many countries around the world. It hasworked with national Governments  with society andlocal communities. UNDP is a trustworthy  activepartner in the elaboration and implementation ofmedium- and long-term national strategies tocontribute to the reduction of poverty. The ExecutiveBoard meeting of UNDP  held yesterday  was verysuccessful in advancing UNDP reform. Honduras isactively participating in this process.The world of bipolar confrontation is no longer and the era of cooperation is under way. Nevertheless our Organization is still leaving out States that havecontributed to development  that represent millions ofbeings and that participate actively in the worldeconomy. For these and other reasons  which we haveoften cited in this General Assembly and in otherinternational forums  these States should beparticipating in our debates and decisions. One suchState is the Republic of China.At the dawning of the new millennium we muststrengthen our membership  expand our representationof peoples and nations and ensure fairer and morebalanced representation in the discussions anddecisions of the Security Council. To this end Honduras believes that the Security Council shouldmake room for important development partners andrepresentatives of the developing world  on the basis ofequitable geographical representation and with theconsensus of the existing regional groups.We also believe that the right to exercise the vetopresently enjoyed by a limited number of States shouldbe confined to specific topics and circumstances  sothat it is not used merely to protect vested interests.The new vision we have of a renewed UnitedNations requires that our Organization become morecompetent  more agile and more responsible; that it bebetter administered  with a healthy financial system;and that it produce more tangible results for thepeoples of the world. This is why we support theresults of the Working Group of the General Assemblyand believe that reforming and expanding the Councilmust be based on the broadest possible consensus andbe in keeping with fair and equitable geographicalrepresentation  by which developing countries will beable to make substantial contributions to the decision-making process so as to solidify world peace andsecurity.Our Organization must engage in self-criticismand be the first to propose changes to its workingmethods. Thematic dialogues designed to produceconsensus and plans of action should replace the long costly world conferences  the concrete results of whichare not always easy to see. These lofty conferencesshould be replaced by a genuine debate in the GeneralAssembly  and the procedures should be simplified soas to save the Organization the large sums that we arepresently wasting because of duplication of efforts.I conclude by referring to the Millennium Summitheld just last week. I would like to recall the idea of thePresident of the Republic of Honduras  Mr. CarlosFlores  that the United Nations can and must work tobring about the required coexistence of the poor andthe rich  the large and the small  by means of aplatform of sovereign equality and human solidarity.And our President said `More than a world pained by poverty andinequity for the overwhelming majority  the worldshould be the sum of its peoples with at least theirbasic needs and essential requirements met."
"71",3024,"HRV",55,2000,"Year after year  we gatherunder this universal roof to join our minds andresources in order to make the world a safer and moreprosperous place  or  at least  one a little lessburdened with all the troubles we have been trying toresolve for decades but have so far not succeeded ineradicating. Never before have we assembled in suchnumbers and extent in the span of just a few weeks first the religious leaders  then the Parliamentarians then the heads of State and Government and  finally the representatives to the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session. Let us hope that this unprecedentedcongregation will not remain just a tribute to the dawnof the twenty-first century  but will emerge as afoundation for a better United Nations and a betterworld it has to serve.When our heads of State met at the MillenniumSummit earlier this month  they unanimously agreed onthe importance of the United Nations for our commonfuture. To say that the United Nations is the onlyOrganization that brings together all the countries ofthe world would be stating the obvious  but we mustnever underestimate the simple fact that this is the onlyglobal Organization with universal membership andcomprehensive scope that indeed belongs to all ofus  to all the peoples of the world. This is where theultimate strength of the United Nations lies.Unfortunately  we have too often failed to recognizethis.Some haunting facts should not be forgotten: thefact that 1 billion people in this world of ours live onless than $1 a day; the fact that 1 billion people do nothave access to clean water; the fact that the last timethe number of Security Council members wasexpanded was nearly four decades ago  at a time whenthe overall United Nations membership was almost halfof its current size.The United Nations must amount to more than aresolution or a decision  a plenary meeting or informalconsultations. We all have to work together  to spare noeffort to make the Organization more proficient  moreeffective and fully at the disposal of all its MemberStates. That is why Croatia welcomes the millenniumreport of the Secretary-General and shares his views onthe need for action to adapt the functioning of theOrganization to the challenges of the new century.There is a growing need and plenty of room forimprovement along the lines of efficiency transparency  equality and good governance. There isno room for excuses or for delaying reforms anyfurther. The time for reform is now.Croatia has been an active Member of theOrganization since its international recognition as asovereign State in the early 1990s. At that time  in spiteof all our activities  Croatia was primarily the object ofnumerous peacekeeping operations and endless debateswithin the Security Council. Today  Croatia is a majorgenerator of peace and stability in South-East Europe an active promoter and facilitator of democracy in theregion  a reliable partner and a member of numerousregional organizations and initiatives. We have notforgotten the difficult years when Croatia was on thereceiving end of United Nations activities. Today  westand ready to put our expertise gained in peacekeepingand other fields to the service of peace and democracy.The experience of the homeland war  as well asthe lessons learned during peacekeeping operations inCroatia  have served us well in Croatia's activeengagement in the United Nations peacekeepingmission in Sierra Leone. We are ready to expand ourrole in peacekeeping and to actively participate in itsconceptual development. Croatia welcomes and willcarefully study the recently published report of theSecretary-General on the reform of peace operationsand the recommendations proposed.Unfortunately  the number of incidents with tragicconsequences involving members of peace missions allover the world is constantly increasing. Just few daysago  three members of the Office of the United NationsHigh Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) inAtambua in West Timor were brutally killed. One ofthem was Pero äimundûa  a citizen of Croatia. I wouldlike to use this opportunity to pay tribute to himpersonally and to all peacekeepers whose tirelessefforts cost them their lives in performing their nobletasks in the line of duty.Croatia is currently a member of the Economicand Social Council  the central body of the UnitedNations. The increasing development of the Council asa forum for policy dialogue  together with its follow-updimension of the major world conferences  addsimportant value to its work and puts a heavy workloadon its members.Croatia's international responsibilities start withthose towards the region of South-East Europe. At theJanuary elections  citizens of Croatia demonstratedtheir strong commitment to democratic values  respectfor human and minority rights  the rule of law andeconomic reforms. They opted for broad changes thatwill bring them into the mainstream of the Europeanintegration processes.The new Croatian Government is well aware ofall the responsibilities it has undertaken and all theopportunities that are arising. We firmly believe thatCroatia's leading role as a contributor to peace andsecurity in the region of South-East Europe willconsiderably contribute to turning this part of Europeinto an area of peace and prosperity.In February  the Croatian Government adopted aprogramme that  as its primary goals  stressesdemocratic values  respect for human and minorityrights  the return of refugees and displaced persons good-neighbourly relations and integration into theEuropean Union and the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization. The new Government is determined tofulfil all Croatia's ongoing international commitmentsand to assume new ones  if the need arises.The elections in Croatia at the beginning of thisyear resulted in important changes. They provided foran increased level of human rights protection andmedia freedom  as well as the acceleration of the returnprocess. Important legislative revisions in the field ofthe return of refugees have opened the door for theunimpeded return of all Croatian citizens  regardless oftheir ethnicity and without condition of reciprocity. Allthe citizens of Croatia stand equal before the law interms of the reconstruction of their houses and all otherreturn-related rights. The Government of Croatia willdo its best to fully implement those laws.Croatia is mindful of the fact that the return ofrefugees represents a necessary prerequisite for lastingstability in the region. In order to accelerate the processof return  the Croatian Government  in cooperationwith UNHCR  has prepared a special return project for16 500 persons  tailored to their needs. The necessaryarrangements for the return of refugees to both Croatiaand Bosnia and Herzegovina are to be made throughcentral institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina  in linewith the new Croatian policy towards that country.Additionally  to speed up the process of two-way returnwith Republika Srpska  the former Prime Minister ofthe Republika Srpska and I have signed a jointdeclaration on the facilitation of the return of refugees.Through this document  we have committed ourselvesto enabling the return of 2 000 people from each side as well as to exchanging information and adjustingprocedures in that regard. I can proudly say that realprogress in the return process has been achieved.3At the same time  I have to stress that the numberof returns to Croatia by far exceeds the number ofreturns of Croats to Bosnia and Herzegovina.Additional efforts have to be invested to speed up thereturn process of Croats and all others to Bosnia andHerzegovina. All the refugees have the right to return but they also have a right to stay in the areas wherethey presently reside. For all those Bosnian Croats whowish to stay in Croatia  we have to provide appropriatehelp in finding new housing facilities.The success of the return of refugees does notdepend solely on political and legal parameters. It hasto be accompanied by the development of the Stateeconomy and the local economy. The return processmust be sustained by job opportunities  small- andmedium-size enterprises  strengthening of the socialfabric and adequate schools and health institutions  aswell as better living conditions generally. Otherwise we shall just turn returnees into economic migrants andthey will be on the road once again.Not a small part of legislative changes relates tothe protection of human and minority rights in Croatia.The Croatian Government is of the opinion that thenecessary preconditions have been met for excludingCroatia from the omnibus resolutions on the situationof human rights in Bosnia and Herzegovina  theRepublic of Croatia and the Federal Republic ofYugoslavia  which have been adopted by both theGeneral Assembly and the Commission on HumanRights  and for the exclusion of Croatia from themandate of the Special Rapporteur derived from theCommission's resolution.Important recognition of the progress Croatia hasmade in respecting fundamental values of democracy human rights and rule of law came recently from theCouncil of Europe. The Monitoring Committee of itsParliamentary Assembly concluded last Friday thatCroatia has honoured its obligations and most of itscommitments undertaken at the time of its accession tothe Council of Europe in 1996. Consequently  weexpect that the monitoring procedure will be formallyclosed at the plenary session of the ParliamentaryAssembly  at the end of this month.For the Croatian Government  cooperation withthe International Tribunal in The Hague remainsprimarily a legal issue  not a political one. TheCroatian State Parliament adopted the Declaration onCooperation with the International Criminal Tribunalfor the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in April unambiguously affirming its support for the Tribunal and this important document remains a framework forCroatia's policy towards the ICTY. It is our firmposition that the guilt for the crimes committed must beindividualized: no nation can be held collectivelyresponsible for the crimes committed by war criminalsclaiming to act in its name. In order to improve thequality of cooperation with the ICTY  the GovernmentCouncil for cooperation with the ICTY has beenconstituted and close working relations with theTribunal established.Promotion of good relations with its neighboursis Croatia's high-priority goal. In its programme  theCroatian Government clearly stipulated that itsrelations with Bosnia and Herzegovina are based ongood-neighbourliness  equality and transparency.Croatia will continue to cooperate with Bosnia andHerzegovina and the international community in theimplementation of the Dayton Agreement  whichremains the foundation of Bosnia and Herzegovina'sself-sustainability and the guarantee of the preservationof the national interests of its three constituent peoples.Croatia's policy towards Bosnia and Herzegovina restson full respect for the independence and sovereignty ofthat country.Croatia sees this as the only way to a prosperousfuture for the Croatian people in Bosnia andHerzegovina  the care for whom remains ourconstitutional obligation. Croatia will continue tosupport Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina  but itforesees doing this in a transparent way  in accordancewith the Dayton Agreement and with a clear Euro-Atlantic orientation.Transparent financing of the Croatian componentof the Federation Army through the StandingCommittee on Military Matters is only one of the stepsaimed at enhancing the central institutions and concreteproof of the new Croatian policy towards Croats inBosnia and Herzegovina.The relations between Croatia and Serbia cannotbe regarded outside the framework of the internationalisolation of the Milosevi? regime. Croatia is notquestioning at all the need to continue thenormalization process with the Federal Republic ofYugoslavia  but its dynamics and substance will dependon the democratization of Serbia  which remains one ofthe necessary conditions for international and4economic stability in the region. Croatia hopes that theforthcoming elections in the Federal Republic ofYugoslavia will be conducted in a democratic way thatreflects the true will of the people and that they willresult in democratic changes. Bearing in mind the factthat the Organization for Security and Cooperation inEurope has been denied an opportunity to monitor theelections means that the elections could lose theirinternational credibility. Still  Croatia wants to believethat Serbia will find a way to end the present situationand join the mainstream of the political and economicintegration process in the region and Europe as awhole.Croatia supports democratic developments in theYugoslav Republic of Montenegro. An open democratic  multi-ethnic  stable and economicallyviable Montenegro is in the interest of Croatia and ofthe region at large. In the course of this year a numberof meetings have been held between the Croatian andMontenegrin officials at various levels  including thehighest level. Two border crossings between Croatiaand Montenegro are operating without impediment  andfurther steps for enhanced cooperation  especiallyeconomic ones  are under way. Croatia will continue tosupport the process of democratization that has alreadybegan in Montenegro and help in its opening towardsEurope  firmly in line with the efforts of theinternational community.Croatia remains seriously concerned about thepresent situation in Kosovo and continued violence whose victims are both Albanians and the Serbs. Wehope that efforts of the United Nations InterimAdministration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) forcesand civilian administration will be successful inbringing peace and stability to the region  as well asfacilitating preconditions for the return of refugees.One issue  however  stands out in regard to thestability and lasting security of the whole region. It isthe question of succession of States created after thedissolution of the former Socialist Federal Republic ofYugoslavia.An important aspect of the succession problem isthe question of membership of the Federal Republic ofYugoslavia in the United Nations and otherinternational organizations. The four successor Statesare of the opinion that this must be resolved in linewith the already existing Security Council and GeneralAssembly resolutions. That means that the FederalRepublic of Yugoslavia cannot automatically continuethe membership of the former State in the UnitedNations  and therefore  that it should do what othersuccessor States have done  apply for membership asthe fifth successor. Moreover  the four successor Statesare of the opinion that the current practice in theUnited Nations should reflect the above-mentionedresolutions and be more consistent in that regard.Therefore  we call for immediate implementation ofthose resolutions and emphasize once again theimportance of resolving the question of succession despite the rejection by the present Federal Republic ofYugoslavia regime.There are still a small number of United Nationsmilitary observers within the international borders ofCroatia. Their performance in Prevlaka  thesouthernmost part of my country  has considerablycontributed to the lasting solution to this problem which is definitely one of security  not one of aterritorial nature. Since 1992  Croatia has accepted theUnited Nations mandate on Prevlaka  with the last six-month extension on 15 July this year. The steadynormalization of relations between Croatia and thedemocratic Government of Montenegro hasconsiderably improved the situation on the ground andshould serve as a bedrock for a lasting solution forPrevlaka. In approaching the Prevlaka issue one has torespect existing international borders  as well aslegitimate security concerns  land ownership rights andthe need for economic cooperation and development inthe region.The stability of South-East Europe is aninseparable part of the overall European stabilityarchitecture. Being at the same time a CentralEuropean  Mediterranean  Danubian and South-EastEuropean country  Croatia plays an active role inseveral regional initiatives that serve as a foundationfor stabilization  cooperation and development in ourpart of the world. Let me mention in this regard theCentral European Initiative  one of the oldest regionalinitiatives  and the Adriatic-Ionian Initiative  thenewest.During its chairmanship of the WorkingCommunity of the Danube Region this year  Croatiawill host the traditional Conference of the heads of theregional Governments as well as the Economic andCultural Forum. Alpe Adria is another subregionalinitiative in which Croatia plays an active role.Croatia's role as an active observer in the South-East5Europe Cooperation Initiative additionally emphasizesour intention to contribute to regional security andstability.From the very outset  Croatia has activelyengaged in the creation and implementation of theStability Pact for South-Eastern Europe. This strategicprocess represents a comprehensive approach towardsthe region in which the concept of stability includesdemocratization and human rights  economicdevelopment and security issues. Croatia has presentedseveral project proposals to all three working tables ofthe Stability Pact  the construction of the Adriatic-Ionian highway being the most important of them. Theconstruction of this highway  stretching along thecoastline from the Italian to the Greek border  wouldmean a significant improvement in road travel betweenthe countries of the region  and would also bringeconomic development to the very part of the regionthat most dearly needs it.I have the satisfaction of informing the Assemblythat at the beginning of this week Croatia hosted theparliamentary summit of the Stability Pact  which hadcomplete success in strengthening the importantparliamentary dimensions of the Pact.The Stability Pact also serves as a mechanism forfacilitating the European Union (EU) and the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) membershipprospects for all those countries of South-East Europethat wish to pursue this path. Croatia is one of them.Full integration into the EU and NATO is the prioritystrategic objective of Croatian foreign policy.In a brief span of six months Croatia'sinternational position regarding the European Unionhas thoroughly changed. It has gone from being acountry with no institutional relations with theEuropean Union to a country awaiting the start ofnegotiations on a stabilization and associationagreement and  consequently  candidacy for EUmembership. Croatia is very pleased with the results ofthe joint consultative task force  whoserecommendations helped us to prepare the start of thenegotiations on the stabilization and associationagreement. We are encouraged by the EuropeanCommission high representative's statements that thisgeneration of agreements will be tailored according tothe present needs and achievements of the stabilizationand association process countries  and that countries'further progress towards European Union membershipwill be assessed on their individual merits.In late November Croatia will host a summit ofthe European Union member States and thestabilization and association process countries Albania  Bosnia and Herzegovina  and Macedonia. Wefeel privileged to host such a historic meeting  one thatwill signify the importance that the European Unionattaches to the region within the framework of theUnion's enlargement process. At the top of the Zagrebsummit's agenda will be the issue of opening EUprospects to the region and the countries of South-EastEurope. This is firmly in line with the policy ofcreating one Europe without walls or curtains ofdivision. We see the arrival of the EU heads of State orGovernment to Zagreb as a tribute to Croatia'sdemocratic achievements and a harbinger of our statusof country associated with the European Union.In May Croatia entered the Partnership for Peace.This provided Croatia with an opportunity to contributemore actively to the peace and security of the regionand to strengthen its democracy and stability at thesame time. In parallel  Croatia has begun thesubstantial reconstruction and modernization of itsarmed forces  aiming to meet all NATO requirementsas well as democratic standards.Croatia continues its active engagement in thepivotal European organizations  such as theOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe(OSCE) and the Council of Europe. It has achievedsignificant progress in working together with the OSCEon the improvement of security in the Danubian regionthrough the engagement of OSCE civilian policemonitors there  as well as in other fields ofcooperation  such as the improvement of democraticstandards in Croatia.World peace does not depend solely on peace andsecurity in Europe. It is with concern that we look atthe ongoing threat of new crises on the Africancontinent  where tremendous amounts of humanresources and money are feeding the war machines instead of serving to fuel development. The cause ofour special concern lies in the fact that many armedconflicts in Africa erupt encouraged by and with theparticipation of neighbouring countries  often usingforeign mercenaries who sometimes come even fromEastern European countries. Croatia sees theimplementation of the Non-Aligned Movement6principles  as well as of the principles of theOrganization of African Unity and other  subregionalorganizations  as an important element in the politicaldevelopments in that part of the world.These organizations undertake commendableefforts in order to establish mechanisms for conflictprevention  as well as to find the ways to end theongoing crises. These efforts include the establishmentof their own peacekeeping forces. In this regard Croatia welcomes the determination of the Africancountries to solve their problems regionally and withsupport from the United Nations.The situation in the Middle East continues to shiftbetween the brink of war and the brink of peace. Thepeace process between the Israeli and Palestinian sidesmust be maintained  and all of us should spare no effortto extend assistance and support to the accomplishmentof this paramount task. From its own experience Croatia is well aware of how important it is tostrengthen the peace process through Security Counciland General Assembly resolutions that are supportiveof it  both in language and in political substance. Thus Croatia advocates that forthcoming resolutions on theMiddle East reflect all the aspects of the ongoing peaceprocess  serving as an important impetus for itssuccessful completion.Croatia is a country highly contaminated byantipersonnel landmines  with about 1 millionlandmines scattered over many parts of its territory.Their presence poses serious obstacle to the economicdevelopment of the country  and even more so to thereturn of people to their homes. The mine-clearingprocess is under way  but it has to be intensified if realprogress is to be seen anytime soon. Many of theongoing activities are performed in cooperation withdonor countries  to which we extend our sinceregratitude; but maximum efforts have to be made toeliminate this evil completely and for good. In thisconnection  Croatia calls for further internationalassistance so as to enable the unimpeded developmentof the country at large.Let me briefly address the issue of the reform ofthe Security Council. Croatia holds the view that thepresent structure and functioning of the SecurityCouncil does not properly reflect the reality ofinternational relations in the twenty-first century  or theneed for universal democratization. We supportincreasing the number of permanent and non-permanent seats in the Council  taking into accountequitable geographical distribution as well ascontributions to the United Nations budget. However reform must go beyond the sole issue of membershipenlargement. The Council's methods of work should bemade more transparent  in particular regarding informalconsultations  which have proved to be anything butinformal.The subject of greatest concern is that  with theadvent of globalization  the number of people that aremarginalized and strongly affected by its negativeeffects is growing. Therefore  we have to minimize thenegative impacts of globalization and  at the same time make its benefits available to all.The effects of globalization on the internationaleconomy are significant and call for enhancedcooperation through multilateral institutions. Inaddition to the efforts aimed at avoidingmarginalization and at ensuring full integration into theworld economy  the countries with economies intransition face challenges associated with privatizationand structural and macroeconomic reforms. In the caseof Croatia there is an additional challenge  that of thepost-war recovery. In such circumstances  our pivotalgoal is to consolidate economic recovery and createconditions for sound and sustainable economic andsocial development. Our overall economic programmeand policy measures are designed to support furthereconomic stability  with stable prices and low inflation concurrent economic growth  a faster rate ofemployment and more exports.To attract foreign investments that are soimportant for the ongoing process of development  anew Investment Law has been adopted. Constructiveeconomic cooperation on bilateral  regional and globallevels remains Croatia's firm goal. Croatia has recentlysigned the Protocol of Accession to the World TradeOrganization (WTO) and  within a few months  oncethe process of ratification is completed  Croatia willbecome a full member of the WTO.The challenges facing the Organization arenumerous. Answers will have to be found for questionsregarding how to renew the structure and mandates ofthe main United Nations bodies  how to ensure bettermanagement and mobilization of new resources  howto define new forms of partnership  both with theprivate sector and with non-governmentalorganizations  how to make cooperation more effective7and  above all  how to turn the United Nations into aresult-based Organization. Croatia believes in thepotentials of the United Nations and considers that itwill be made truly efficient if we  the MemberStates  accept our responsibilities towards it.Croatia is ready to work together with allinternational actors in searching for the right answersto the challenges that lie ahead. Stability and prosperityof the world will become possible only if we never stoplooking for ways to improve them. Croatia willcontinue to use its best efforts to preserve the positivetrends in its general achievements and to contribute toEuropean and world stability.In conclusion  allow me to congratulateMr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  the Foreign Minister ofNamibia and the President of the fifty-fourth session ofthe Assembly  on his dedicated work and on the greatskills with which he performed his demanding job. Iwould also like to congratulate Mr. Harri Holkeri Foreign Minister of Finland  on his election asPresident of the fifty-fifth session and to wish him allsuccess in his future work.Finally  I would like to express the hope that thisMillennium Assembly will result in new commitmentsthat will bring progress in responding to the challengesof the new century."
"72",3069,"HTI",55,2000,"TheRepublic of Haiti wishes to add its voice to all thosewho have already congratulated Mr. Harri Holkeri ofFinland on his election to the presidency of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-fifth session. We take thisopportunity also to pay tribute to Mr. Theo-BenGurirab for the success with which he guided the workof the fifty-fourth session.I convey warm regards to the Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  who has made a remarkablecontribution to enhancing the confidence placed in theOrganization.The Republic of Haiti welcomes the admission ofTuvalu to membership of the United Nations.There is no question but that this session shouldfocus on how to implement the decisions taken by ourheads of State or Government during the MillenniumSummit with a view to forging a policy of effectiveglobal cooperation for the twenty-first century. Despiteall the criticism one could legitimately level at theOrganization after 55 years  the United Nations systemremains the sole worldwide structure that can providecollective solutions to the problems facing us in thespheres of international security  the environment andeconomic and social development.The Organization is often found lacking in termsof solutions to problems. But we know very well thatthis lack of effectiveness is the result of several factors including a lack of resources and poor management ofthose that are available  and overlap in the functions ofUnited Nations institutions and agencies. We think it isimportant to continue to rationalize the functioning ofthe Organization in order to secure the best resultsfrom existing resources. We must remember thatentrusting the United Nations with a mandate withoutproviding it with the proper means for fulfilling it hasthe inevitable and negative consequence ofundermining the Organization's credibility.Last June in Geneva  we took stock of theoutcome of the Copenhagen World Summit for SocialDevelopment. The assessment was very mixed  not tosay negative. The fact is that the CopenhagenDeclaration on Social Development and Programme ofAction were formulated in response to a world socio-historical situation marked both by a widening gapbetween North and South and by a distinct incongruitybetween the positive economic aspects and the negativesocial aspects of globalization. Social developmenttherefore gains in urgency as the process ofglobalization accelerates.In spite of all the political and economicdifficulties facing the Republic of Haiti  it has madeconstant efforts to attain the goals of the CopenhagenSummit  as witnessed by the seemingly minor butactually important fact that between 1997 and 2000Haiti's ranking in the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme human development index rose from 156to 150. But we know that we are far from reachingacceptable levels of social development. That is whythe Haitian Government continues to devote specialattention to implementing the Programme of Action forthe Least Developed Countries for the 1990s.The Third United Nations Conference on theLeast Developed Countries will be held at Brussels inMay 2001. It will  inter alia  assess what has been doneto strengthen the human and institutional capacities ofthe least developed countries. Unless these arestrengthened  it will be extremely difficult for leastdeveloped countries fully to attain goals of theCopenhagen Programme of Action.Beyond its social aspects  the question ofdevelopment will be decisive for the peaceful future ofinternational relations. Statistics remind us daily thatthe countries of the North and the countries of theSouth are moving further apart as the changes broughtabout by globalization continue swiftly. This situationis politically  economically and ecologically dangerous20for the stability of the international system; this couldlead in the long term to the spread of areas bereft oflaw  to sudden migratory flows and to the continueduse of armed conflicts and violence as a way ofconducting relations between and within nations.Haiti therefore welcomes the fact that a centraltheme of next year's second high-level dialogue onstrengthening international economic cooperation fordevelopment through partnership will be theidentification of ways to integrate developing countriesinto the world economy in the twenty-first century.The economy of the twenty-first century willincreasingly be based on new information technologiesand this will be an enormous challenge for thedeveloping countries. Because of this  maximizingcultural resources and local genetic resources fordevelopment and for preserving traditional knowledgewill become essential for sustainable development since it offers an appropriate legal framework to enablecountries of the South to preserve their intellectualproperty rights to their genetic resources.Implementation of a global policy for economicdevelopment will have no really significant effect onreal development of the human being if the question ofpeace is neglected. Peace and development areinterdependent and mutually reinforcing. The UnitedNations Educational  Scientific and CulturalOrganization's constitution states explicitly that “sincewars begin in the minds of men  it is in the minds ofmen that the defences of peace must be constructed”. Itis therefore essential that the concept and the practiceof peace become a real culture so as to enable societiesand individuals to develop and enrich themselvesthrough their cultural diversity. We welcome theproclamation of 2001 as the “Year of Dialogue amongCivilizations”.Social development and the worldwidedissemination of a culture of peace are definitely basicelements here. However  we think that it is important towelcome the idea of integrating them into a widerconceptual and operational dimension — the dimensionof human security which places the human being at thevery heart of international priorities. Far from harmingthe interests of the nation-State  human security fullymeets its concerns. In fact  human security goesbeyond  formally speaking  the natural sphere of actionof nation-States to deal with transnational phenomenasuch as the degradation of the environment  naturaldisasters and international crime in all of its manyaspects which pose serious threats to the control over and managing of  national affairs. The great challengetoday is to work out and implement a programme forhuman security that establishes  as a yardstick for itssuccess  its ability to release men and women in ourworld from the slavery of poverty.In our search for solutions to current problems we need to envisage the reform of our Organizationand  in particular  the reform of the Security Counciland the Economic and Social Council.Questions of development are linked to questionsof international security and therefore neither of thesereforms should be neglected. After years of negotiationand debate  it is time now for the internationalcommunity to reach a consensus on thedemocratization of the Security Council to make itbetter adapted to the new international realities. Itwould also be an ideal time to give thought to athorough reassessment of the veto  which is no longerin keeping with the current state of internationalrelations.The attainment of these goals will make itpossible for our Organization to discharge its twofoldmission: guaranteeing peace among nations andassisting the peoples of the earth to develop theirpotential.Likewise  the reform of the Economic and SocialCouncil is essential if we want to give the UnitedNations the tools it needs to confront the challenges ofthe twenty-first century. This reform should seek toavoid or eliminate the functional overlapping ofprogrammes of action of the agencies of the UnitedNations system  while developing a policy ofpartnership for development. Accordingly  it isessential to strengthen the functions of the Economicand Social Council that relate to the coordination offunds and programmes. The strengthening of the roleof  and the functioning of  the Economic and SocialCouncil is particularly crucial in this era ofglobalization. Only the definition and implementationat the multilateral level of coordinated plans of actionwill make it possible to help  in a meaningful way  theefforts of States to eradicate poverty and to establish asolid basis for comprehensive sustainable development.Our Organization is rightly called a universalOrganization. This is why the Republic of Haitiwelcomed enthusiastically our unanimous decision to21admit Tuvalu as the 189th Member. It is only right thatthe 9 000 inhabitants of that country be properlyrepresented in our world Organization.Therefore the situation of the 23 million Chineseof Taiwan is a matter of concern to us. We welcome thefact that the dialogue-based approach continues toprevail on both sides of the Straits of Taiwan. While wewait for the dialogue to produce satisfactory results forboth sides  we think that the question of therepresentation of these 23 million people deserves theattention of the United Nations.Allow me to conclude by referring to a fewfigures. According to the latest report on development produced by the World Bank  one fifth of the world'spopulation  no less than 1.2 billion people  are livingon less than one dollar a day. One out of five childrendie before reaching the age of five. The World Banktells us also that the 20 richest countries have anaverage income which is 37 times higher than that ofthe 20 poorest countries and this gap is twice what itwas 40 years ago.And yet  these last 40 years were all decadesdevoted to development by the internationalcommunity. There is  therefore  a problem here that Iwould call the paradox of the twentieth century. Neverhas humanity attained such a capacity to produce allkinds of goods and riches  and yet never have therebeen so many people unjustifiably going hungry.The essential challenge today is for the twenty-first century not to resemble the twentieth in thisrespect. To make this happen  the mind-bogglingconstant increase in scientific knowledge must beproperly harnessed to the fight against poverty in all ofits various manifestations.The United Nations cannot spend another 55years talking about development: it is time now  it ishigh time to make development a reality. The entirecredibility of the Organization hinges on this issuebecause  basically  development is another name forpeace.Despite the many obstacles we face  Haiti hopesthat the community of States will manage to build inthis century and in this millennium a world where basicneeds will be met  where nature will be protected where the scourge of drugs and organized crime will becontrolled  with opportunities for all  with hopes for amore promising future  in particular for young peopleand for the disadvantaged."
"73",3115,"HUN",55,2000,"﻿Iwould like to sincerely congratulate you  Sir  on yourelection to the presidency of this  the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-fifth session  which serves as abridge between two millennia. I would like to assureyou that you will have the full cooperation of mydelegation. I would also like to pay homage to yourpredecessor  Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  for the valuablecontribution he made to the work of this Assembly  aswell as for his contribution to the preparations for theMillennium Summit.14During that Summit  less than one week ago  theheads of State and Government of the Member Statesof the United Nations adopted a Declaration. Thespecific commitments and objectives contained in thatDeclaration pose a complex challenge. Theirimplementation will require sustained efforts on thepart of each of the members of the internationalcommunity. In making those efforts  all of us  smalland large  rich and poor  should keep in mind thecommon responsibility we bear for the future of ourcivilization.The Secretary-General's millennium report andthe Declaration it inspired reflect with the greatesteloquence the tasks and the requirements  as well as theworries and fears  facing our planet. And those ideashave been expressed at an opportune moment: thethreshold of the new millennium. By taking up thework of implementing this major programme of action we will be undertaking the indispensable process ofaddressing the increasingly pressing global problemswe are facing.One of the great lessons of the decade that hasjust passed  and also of the Millennium Summit  is thatwith the vanishing of the bipolar world order  East-West confrontation has been replaced by North-Southproblems. We believe that everything possible must bedone so that this divide does not become rigid and sothat the problems and difficulties it poses do not persistfor too long. The Secretary-General's millenniumreport  the document adopted during the Summit ofheads of State and Government  the many speeches weheard during the Summit  they all show that theinternational community recognizes and has assessedthe scale of the challenges that globalization is forcingit to take up  and they show that the internationalcommunity is searching for solutions to pressingissues  with the goal of reducing the appallingdisparities in the world. There are many such issuesand problems. They include poverty  the increasingeconomic and social gaps between the developed anddeveloping countries  environmental issues  organizedcrime  international terrorism  AIDS and otherdiseases  drugs  human migration  the use of theInternet to sow intolerance and extremist ideas  and soforth. It is no exaggeration to say that  in order toensure a stable  just and prosperous future for allhumanity  we must  as soon as possible  get down towork on following up on the decisions that have beentaken and on creating international legal standards tothe extent necessary. These standards should also bedeveloped in the fields of trade  finance and humanrights  most specifically to protect the rights ofethnic  linguistic or religious minorities. As part of thisundertaking  it is important to reinforce goodgovernance and solidarity.Let us recall that the great transformation of theworld's political  security  socio-economic andscientific landscape has been accompanied by aremarkable evolution  the return of man to thecentral place that is properly his on the internationalchessboard  and by a rediscovery of the purpose ofgovernmental action at the national and internationallevels. It is not a question of safeguarding States andGovernments but of protecting people andcommunities  human beings  men and women whocompose our societies. We must thus realize thatpolitical and legislative practices and our futureactivities in the codification of international law mustadequately reflect that fundamental fact that we nowsee re-emerging.In this context  the millions of victims of theconflicts afflicting the world and the daily tragedies wecontinually see mean that we cannot stand with ourarms crossed  that we must try to find as quickly aspossible a response to the practical and theoreticaldilemmas that have been haunting us for some time.There are conflicts within States accompanied byserious violations of the human rights and genuinehumanitarian crises. The national authorities  whereverthey may be  must not be allowed to systematicallypersecute their own populations on a massive scalewith complete impunity while taking shelter behindcertain principles of the Charter of the United Nations.The international community must deal with thesesituations with a new vision and philosophy that reflectthe realities and the spirit of our contemporary world.As a result of our proximity to the ex-Yugoslavia my country  Hungary  has felt the whole weight ofthese problems over the last decade. We have beenwitness to the serious delays on the part of thecommunity of nations that has prevented it from actingin time in Bosnia and Rwanda  and elsewhere  with theappropriate means on the basis of a mandatecorresponding to the real nature of the situation andwith the necessary political will. That is why wewelcome Mr. Brahimi's report on peacekeepingoperations. We are ready to begin without delay the15necessary work to examine and implement theserecommendations.With regard to the Balkan region  the StabilityPact for South-Eastern Europe that came into being oneyear ago is an initiative for prevention andreconstruction which offers the countries and thepeoples of that part of the continent the possibility toleave their conflicts behind  to settle their differencesand to open up new prospects for cooperation. Hungaryattaches great importance to this and will make its owncontribution to this vital enterprise  particularly in thefield of strengthening democratic forces in the regionand in human rights  including the rights of minorities.Within this context  a democratic evolution in theFederal Republic of Yugoslavia will undoubtedly havea stabilizing effect on the region as a whole and willmake it possible to bring to an end the isolation ofSerbia from the major European and internationalcurrents. The elections scheduled for the end ofSeptember offer us an occasion to set this processunder way. Such an evolution will enable us tonormalize relations between Serbia and Montenegro.One of the global problems facing us isundoubtedly the question of conventional weapons andweapons of mass destruction. We appeal for newprogress in the field of light weapons and anti-personnel mines  the victims of which are basicallyinnocent civilians.The 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to theTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of nuclear weaponsmarked an important step forward in the search for asafer future for humanity. The document adopted therereaffirms the central role of the treaty in the field ofnon-proliferation and the need for internationalagreement to this end. We hope that between now andthe next review conference  to be held in 2005  we willbe able to undertake the process of implementing theprogramme of action which was adopted to promotenon-proliferation and nuclear disarmament. From thispoint of view we attach particular importance to theinitiation of work towards a treaty on the prohibition offissile materials for military purposes.We have also been following very closely thenegotiations designed to draw up a verificationprotocol on the Biological Weapons Convention  whichwill enter a decisive phase on the eve of the reviewconference set for 2001. Hungary will chair the ad hocgroup charged with formulating a mechanism in thatconnection and will do everything in its power toachieve the objective over the course of next year.Hungary considers the adoption of the Statute ofthe International Criminal Court one of the mostimportant international achievements in the field ofinternational law. This Statute is aimed at imposingrules of international humanitarian law and at endingan era of impunity. Nineteen States have alreadyratified the Statute  and the number of signatures isnow 112. Hungary views this with pleasure and willpursue its own preparations for ratification of theStatute. We will continue to participate actively innegotiations to bring about universal acceptance of theCourt while preserving the integrity of its Statute.The reform of our world Organization has beenon the agenda for some time. Recent events throughoutthe world  particularly unprecedented changes in thepolitical and military order  economic evolution progress in the fields of science and informatics  andthe end of the century that symbolizes very tangibly thedawn of a new era full of both promises anduncertainty  have transformed the desire to see theUnited Nations adapt to the realities of our time into animperative that will no longer tolerate any deviations orhesitation. Consequently  our first task is to face in adetermined way the tremendous challenges awaiting usin the twenty-first century. The political will ofMember States cannot be lacking if we really wish tomake every effort to support the laudable efforts of theSecretary-General to achieve this adaptation process.This will involve  among other things  reforming theSecurity Council and the budgetary system  which isnecessary to strengthen the credibility and efficacy ofour world Organization.The more quickly we can reform the Organizationaccording to the requirements of this critical period  themore reassured people throughout the world will be asto the future of the planet."
"74",3162,"IDN",55,2000,"It gives me greatpleasure to congratulate Mr. Holkeri on his assumptionof the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session. I am confident that under his most ableguidance we will make substantive progress in ourdeliberations. I also pay tribute to his predecessor Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  the esteemed Foreign Ministerof Namibia  for the skilful manner in which he guidedour work during a busy year.I also take this opportunity to commend theSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for his report onthe work of the Organization. I also take this occasionto welcome the new Member  Tuvalu  to our midst.The fifty-fifth session opened with the historicMillennium Summit and the adoption of a visionaryDeclaration offering the cardinal principles that shouldgovern relations among nations. It charted a coursethat  if followed  will ensure durable peace and securityas well as common progress and prosperity for allhumanity. It  hopefully  began a new chapter in thehistory of the United Nations. Undeniably  expectationsare raised that the Organization will overcome thepervasive and interrelated obstacles to peace anddevelopment  while strongly reaffirming andpreserving the purposes and principles of the UnitedNations Charter. We know that these goals can beachieved  but it is crucial that Member States  civilsociety  international organizations and the privatesector cooperate and work together for that purpose.These efforts must be supported by theempowerment of the Organization  entailing more thancharting a new structure and new mechanisms  orproviding additional resources. It demands awillingness to provide genuine authority andlegitimacy to the United Nations by setting new normsand agendas as needed. It also urgently calls for reformof the Security Council. New prospects for that effortmay have emerged in the joint statement of the Headsof State or Government of the permanent members ofthe Council on 7 September. In that statement theypledged to foster a more transparent and broadlyrepresentative Council to enhance its effectiveness forpeace and security.One major issue confronting us is the lack ofprogress on the elimination of nuclear weapons. We areeven more concerned to see a new rationalization fortheir continued use  coupled with repeated assertions oftheir legitimacy and necessity  and to see the danger ofthe deployment of anti-ballistic missile defencesystems. This lack of progress increases the prospectsof a new nuclear arms race which will threaten theexisting arms control agreements and the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). Riddingthe world of the dangers posed by nuclear weapons pending their total abolition  is the greatest challengeof our time.In contributing to peace and security  Indonesiahas since 1957 actively participated in and contributedto the various peacekeeping operations of the UnitedNations. In anticipating the new and emergingproblems identified by the Secretary-General and  inparticular  the report (A/55/305) of the Brahimi panel we are in the process of responding to the newrequirements with a view to bolstering the numbers quality and effectiveness of our participation in futureUnited Nations missions.Armed conflict and tensions persist in many partsof the world. In the Middle East we must continue tofocus our attention on the core of the conflict  namely the legitimate struggle of the Palestinian people tosecure their inalienable rights to self-determination andsovereign statehood in their own homeland  withJerusalem as its capital. In this context  my delegationcommends the Palestinian leaders for theirstatesmanlike approach. They have demonstrated theircommitment to peace through the decision to share thecity of Jerusalem  while remaining committed to theirnational rights  in order to reach a compromise. Hence it behoves Israel to make a similar compromise so thata final settlement can be achieved. The withdrawal ofIsrael last June from southern Lebanon  following morethan two decades of occupation  has finally restored theterritorial integrity and sovereignty of Lebanon withinits internationally recognized boundaries. Mydelegation also hopes for a resumption of the Israeli-Syrian peace talks  based on the Madrid peace formula.In various regions of the world  however  we seemany positive developments which reflect a new spiritof cooperation and compromise. These are exemplifiedby  among other things  the summit meeting of the twoleaders of North and South Korea  the formation of anew Government in Somalia  and the ceasefireagreement between Eritrea and Ethiopia. It is mydelegation's expectation that the same spirit ofcooperation and compromise will prevail in easing theimpact of sanctions on the people of Iraq. It is also animperative on humanitarian grounds to address theissue of missing persons of the parties concernedduring the Gulf war.In the afterglow of the Millennium Summit andthe first South Summit  which took place in August inHavana  there was a distinct sense of optimism that theenormous power and promise of globalization and theinformation revolution could be harnessed in theservice of development and in combating poverty. Inthis regard  the declarations and programmes of actionprovide us with an excellent blueprint for charting thepath ahead. Today  particularly in the developingcountries  millions remain untouched by the benefits ofglobalization and the information revolution and  beingbypassed and marginalized  can greatly provokeinstability. Thus  rather than enjoying generalizedpeace and prosperity  the world at the turn of thecentury continues to be disfigured by ruthless conflicts wrenching poverty  blatant inequalities and problemsincluding hunger  illiteracy and disease. Whiledeclarations and programmes of action are of criticalimportance for changing this reality  theirimplementation is the key. I am convinced that therecan be no alternative to productive dialogue to achievethis aim; such dialogue must be based on mutualinterests and benefits  shared responsibility andgenuine partnership.One of the core issues of development on whichglobalization has had a great impact and which requiressuch dialogue is that of financing for development  anissue that has assumed immense importance in the newglobal economy. While enormous financial flows havecharacterized the global financial system  the basicproblem for the majority of developing countries is thatthey are not in a position to benefit from such flowsand must instead depend on official developmentassistance  which has sharply declined. Hence theimportance of the forthcoming international high-level12event on financing for development that is to be held in2001.Another area in which globalization has had agreat impact  one closely associated with financing fordevelopment  is the issue of the indebtedness of thedeveloping countries which often seriously underminestheir development efforts  particularly in this era ofglobalization. Regrettably  the numerous debt strategiesand initiatives employed over the years have failed toresolve this problem.Equally important in this age of information is theneed to harness the potential of the information andcommunication technologies in the service ofdevelopment. Progress was made in placing this criticalissue on the agenda of the United Nations when for thefirst time the high-level segment of the Economic andSocial Council this year considered information andcommunication technologies (ICT) for development asits major theme. The outcome  particularly theministerial declaration  underlined the criticalimportance of unlocking the vast potential ofinformation and communication technologies for allhumanity.More than ever before  due largely toglobalization  we must strive for sustainabledevelopment as set out in Agenda 21  adopted in Riode Janeiro in 1992. The outcome of that Conferencecommitted the international community to meet theeconomic needs of the present generation withoutcompromising the ability of the planet to provide forthe needs of future generations. But almost a decadelater  with the exception of a number of conventionsthat have been enacted  relatively little has beenachieved in fully implementing Agenda 21  known asRio+10. It is therefore important that we seriouslyprepare for the ten-year review of its implementation.In doing so we should be able to generate the highestpolitical commitment to help to ensure the fullimplementation of the Agenda. In this regard  I ampleased to inform the Assembly that Indonesia's offerto host Rio+10 has been strongly supported by theMinisterial Conference on Environment andDevelopment of Asia and the Pacific.Only a short time ago the five-year reviews wereheld on the Copenhagen conference on socialdevelopment and the Beijing conference on women.From those two special sessions we learned valuablelessons. We learned that for many people socialdevelopment remains an elusive goal and that onlythrough gender equality and women's empowermentcan true prosperity be achieved.Clearly the time has come to move beyondrhetoric and fully implement the commitments of thevarious international conferences of the 1990s. Wemust also work towards eradicating ethnic and racialdiscrimination  religious intolerance and xenophobia which threaten to undermine all progress — political economic and social. The forthcoming WorldConference against Racism in 2001 therefore presentsan opportunity that must be seized.We are committed to ensuring that humanitarianassistance is available wherever and whenever neededthroughout the world. The plight of refugees anddisplaced persons must continue to hold a prominentposition on the global agenda  with each nationmeeting its responsibilities to render aid and assistancein times of natural disaster  civil conflict or otheremergency situations.We must work also to ensure the integrity ofhumanitarian missions. The murder of staff of theOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner forRefugees (UNHCR) in Atambua  West Timor  hasshocked and saddened the world  and nowhere morethan Indonesia. That humanitarian workers shouldbecome victims in the performance of their work isunacceptable. Let me be clear in stating that this crimeshould not go unpunished. The necessary measuresmust be taken to ensure that such a heinous crime isnever again repeated. This tragedy should not however  result in a withdrawal of humanitarianassistance  thus compounding the loss. We should worktogether to resolve any and all obstacles to the safedelivery of humanitarian assistance.International cooperation in the millennium isunavoidable and indispensable. The quality  extent andtimeliness of such cooperation will make the differencebetween despair and progress. In this setting  thesignificance of the United Nations should be evidentand accepted. Preserving the role of the Organizationrequires the participation of all Member States  largeand small. Beyond declarations  it is time to translateour ideas into action. Achievement is required in thetwenty-first century. That was the message of theMillennium Summit."
"75",3209,"IND",55,2000,"India congratulates Mr. HarriHolkeri on his election as President of the first GeneralAssembly of this millennium. We are encouraged thathe intends to take the Millennium Declaration as themandate for the work of the Organization during hispresidency.I take this opportunity to sincerely complimentand to place on record our high appreciation of ForeignMinister Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab of Namibia for hisguidance of the General Assembly in the past year which included three special sessions and  of course meticulous preparations for and a successfulconclusion to the Millennium Summit.I join India's voice to those of other delegationsin noting with appreciation the dedication with whichSecretary-General Kofi Annan has served the UnitedNations at a critical point.I am delighted on this occasion to warmlywelcome Tuvalu as the newest Member of the UnitedNations.Just 10 days ago  almost 150 heads of State andGovernment assembled here for the MillenniumSummit. Their assembly in such large numbers was asunique as was the occasion itself. The MillenniumDeclaration that was then adopted encapsulates ashared vision that the international community worktogether in constructive cooperation to meet collectivechallenges  within the framework of the UnitedNations. It was in this spirit that my Prime Ministerspoke  as did many others  of the need for the UnitedNations to truly reflect the world of the twenty-firstcentury  to make it an effective instrument to translate17our vision into reality. The United Nations is the housethat we all share. We must strengthen it and ensure thatit is equal to our collective expectations and our jointaspirations.Peace  collective security and developmentinspire the spirit of the United Nations. We enter thetwenty-first century with extraordinary collectiveintellectual and technical capabilities. These are ourglobal tools for overcoming the challenges before us.Peace and security for all is not just possible but is wellwithin our grasp. Stability and development are theessential building blocks for the maintenance of peaceand security. Threats to peace can and do arise fromdifferent sources. It is not just weapons of massdestruction or an arms race that endanger peace  butalso dehumanizing poverty and lack of development.We must act as confident nation States committedto collective action and international cooperation  forthese are our means to provide wider effects of peaceand progress. We must reaffirm the principle of respectfor State sovereignty and non-interference in internalaffairs of countries. Thus  self-evidently  we mustabjure unilateral action. Whenever circumstanceswarrant action by the Security Council  that actionmust be firmly rooted in Charter provisions.The Brahimi Panel's report contains a number ofproposals. We recommend that the General Assemblyexamine this important report carefully and takeappropriate decisions to strengthen this vital UnitedNations function of peacekeeping.We support the Middle East peace process andfind the trend encouraging.The historic summit between the Republic ofKorea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea too  augurs well for peace in the Korean peninsula.Disarmament — global nuclear disarmament inparticular — is essential to engender a greater sense ofsecurity among Member States. India has been and willcontinue to be in the forefront of efforts towards globalnuclear disarmament and genuine non-proliferation.We welcome the recommendation of the Secretary-General in his report to the Millennium Summit toconvene an international conference on eliminatingnuclear danger. We urge commencement ofnegotiations on a nuclear-weapons convention to bringabout a nuclear-weapon-free world. India remainsready to participate in agreed and irreversible steps such as de-alerting of nuclear forces  thus loweringnuclear danger  through accidental use or otherwise  aswell as a global agreement on no-first-use and on non-use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weaponStates.The situation with regard to the entry into forceof the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty(CTBT) and the lack of progress on a programme ofwork at the Conference on Disarmament in Genevashow the importance of building a consensus  bothwithin and amongst nations  on issues that affectnational and international security. We are consciousthat 155 countries are at present signatories of theCTBT. We reiterate to them our continuingcommitment that India does not wish to stand in theway of entry into force of the CTBT. India volunteeredto observe  and continues to observe  a moratorium onfurther explosive nuclear testing. This meets the basicobligations of the CTBT. India also remains ready toengage in meaningful negotiations in the Conferenceon Disarmament  including on a global treaty to banthe future production of fissile material for weaponspurposes.The illicit transfer  manufacture and circulation ofsmall arms  particularly by States to non-State actorsand to terrorist groups  and their intrinsic linkage withterrorism and narco-trafficking are matters of very deepconcern to the world community. When they arecombined with religious fanaticism and militaryadventurism  a threat is posed to the global civilizednorms to which we strive to adhere. The internationalcommunity can no longer afford to permit thesepurveyors of death  outrage and destruction to continueto inflict untold suffering upon innocents. We lookforward to a successful outcome of the United NationsConference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms andLight Weapons in All Its Aspects  to be held next year.Terrorism is the global menace of our age. Forsome  it tends to replace ideology and policy. India hasbeen the object of State-sponsored  cross-borderterrorism in its most inhuman manifestations for morethan a decade. Even as the international communityworks together to curb  control and stamp out the illicittrade in small arms and light weapons  we need tocontinually focus our attention on the users of suchweapons — the terrorists. Terrorism is an assault onhuman decency  a violation of the basic precepts ofdemocracy and the very antithesis of what the UnitedNations represents and stands for. Because its principal18targets are the innocent  it is indeed the most flagrantviolation of basic human rights. It constitutes a crimeagainst humanity. It is also a threat to internationalpeace and security  especially when terrorists arearmed  financed and backed by Governments or theiragencies.I urge all Members to work to strengthen theinternational consensus and legal regimes againstterrorism. We have proposed the draft of acomprehensive convention on international terrorism. Iurge all Members of the United Nations to give theirtotal support to this initiative.Let me now dwell briefly on the instrument of ourchoice to accomplish our global agenda: the UnitedNations. There is but one United Nations; nonereplicate it  nor can any replace it.The membership of the United Nations hasincreased manifold in the last half century  and todaystands at 189. Yet the Security Council continues tohave the same basic structure as in the colonized worldof 1945. The need for expansion of the membership ofthe Security Council in both permanent and non-permanent categories is self-evident. The impact ofactions of the Security Council is felt  with near totalexclusivity  by the developing countries. Yet they havelittle influence in its decision-making. We have aglobal consensus that the form taken by the SecurityCouncil in the aftermath of the Second World War isoutmoded and that it must reflect the logic of anenlarged membership. At the Millennium Summit morethan 150 States  at the highest level  endorsed the needfor a Council reformed in its representation. Anunrepresentative Security Council will lack the rangeand depth of sensitivity  perceptiveness andunderstanding of the realities that it will have to dealwith or the moral authority to take decisions. I reaffirmIndia's willingness to take on the responsibilities ofpermanent membership.The General Assembly is the most importantorgan of the United Nations. It is here that all States irrespective of considerations of strength  economy orsize  sit together as equals  embodying the democraticprinciple of sovereign equality. There is a growingfeeling among Member States that the functioning androle of the General Assembly has to be made moreeffective. As the revolutions of the digital age reducedistance to the click of a mouse  bringing us togetherinto a new global neighbourhood as never before inhistory  and as forces of globalization inexorably leadus to increasing interdependence  our canvas ofinternational cooperation and collective action hasrapidly expanded. It has also become vastly morecomplex. The General Assembly has therefore to becentral in accepting this new responsibility  this newchallenge.Even as we week to strengthen democraticprinciples and practices in the United Nations  andeven as the spreading sweep of democracy casts asidedictatorships and authoritarian regimes  we haveunfortunately witnessed some instances of regressionas well. Such acts move against the currents of ourtimes. The international community should opposethese assaults on the spirit of our times anduncompromisingly support and strengthen democraticimpulses  practices and norms. It should show itssolidarity with the people of such countries. TheOrganization of African Unity and the Commonwealthdeserve our commendation for the steps they havetaken in this regard.Developments in Fiji since 19 May this year havecaused us deep concern. We appreciate the action takenby the Commonwealth after the overthrow of theconstitutionally elected democratic Government there.We hope that Fiji will return immediately to theconstitutional base of 1997 and restore the rule by lawat the earliest opportunity by putting an end to racialdiscrimination. This is in Fiji's own long-term interest.We hope that the international community will exerciseits collective authority and influence to bring Fiji backto the road of democracy and the rule of law.It appears  sadly  that the world has forgottenAfghanistan. The fratricidal conflict in that countrycontinues on account of the Taliban's pursuit of themirage of military success. It also continues because ofoutside support  military and financial  to the Taliban.This conflict and the Taliban's mediaeval obscurantistideologies continue to cause untold suffering to theAfghan people. This adversely affects the peace andsecurity of the entire neighbourhood  from West toCentral Asia to South Asia. The negatives that emanatefrom the Taliban-controlled areas of Afghanistan  inthe shape of terrorism  drug trafficking and the flow ofarms  cause justifiable concern all over the world. TheTaliban and their mentor must heed the world'sdemands and abandon the path of conflict. We stand fora comprehensive settlement in Afghanistan that19restores peace at the earliest and ensures the interestsand aspirations of all sections of that society.We have consistently called upon the UnitedNations to increase its development orientation andengagement  which is a core responsibility. Wewelcome and support the declaration of the Secretary-General last week to the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme's ministerial meeting that deficit indevelopment will put in jeopardy all other goals of theUnited Nations. To address the root causes of povertymeaningfully  we need firm international commitmentsto re-order and reshape international relations  inconsequence providing for equitable opportunities todeveloping countries for resource earnings. Our call iseven more relevant in today's fast integrating world.Developing countries and their people cannotthrive on a diet of advice and goodwill alone. Wetherefore hope that the forthcoming conference onfinancing for development would endorse concreteinitiatives for mobilization of the required externalresources for development  whether from trade orconcessional flows  and treat this as a shared globalgoal. In this context  it would be useful to establish thedifference that would be made if there was universaladherence to the agreed official developmentassistance(ODA) target of 0.7 per cent of GrossNational Product(GNP)  within a specified time frame.Nowhere is this more important than in thecontinent of Africa. Africa's efforts need to beadequately supported by the international community.We believe that issues relating to the development ofAfrican countries must remain at the forefront of thework of the General Assembly.The process of globalization  with revolutionaryleaps in communications and the great advance ininformation technology and increased mobility ofcapital  trade and technology  has produced newpotential for sustained economic growth. The benefitsof globalization have  however  not percolated to thevast sections who live mired in poverty  withoutshelter  in hunger and in deprivation. Globalization hasoften been accompanied by enhanced poverty unemployment and consequent social disintegration.This poses a major challenge. We have to determine aninclusive concept of growth and development. We haveto strive for the uplifting of people in the largest sense and not simply in terms of sectoral advances. WhileGDP growth rates and selective indicators may point togrowth in an economy  the elimination of poverty andenhancement of the quality of life and creation of realchoices must be integral to the process of assessing thesuccess of development efforts.In India  we have formulated developmentstrategies on the premise that economic and socialpolicies must subserve the primacy of the human being and in particular the poorest. Market forces and growthalone are not the answer. Intervention to guaranteesocial justice is crucial. Development based on unevenrewards will not be supported by those who are not itsbeneficiaries. It places great stress on the social fabric.The fullest possible participation of the people in thedevelopment process is the best guarantee for thesuccess of any growth strategy.Many challenges lie ahead of us. Impediments tosustained economic growth for developing countriesabound. Protectionist tendencies in developedcountries  a lack of political will to implementcommitments undertaken regarding developmentfinance and tardy alleviation of the debt burden ofdeveloping countries aggravate the situation. Specialand differential treatment for developing countriesguaranteed under World Trade Organization (WTO)provisions must be translated into operational reality.Developed countries should not seek to restrict marketaccess to goods and services and free movement ofnatural persons  especially at a time when developingcountries are being asked to open up their economiesand compete in the international economic domain.Another challenge relates to reconciling the needsof economic and industrial growth with the need forpreservation and protection of the environment. A safeand healthy environment for our peoples is animperative. At the same time  all development cannotbe sacrificed at the absolutist altar of environmentalpreservation. Sustainability of growth strategy andenvironmental conservation cannot and should notimply maintenance of poverty.Developing countries have done commendablework in the implementation of Agenda 21  in thecontext of an exceptionally difficult globalenvironment. The promised resources from developedcountries have failed to materialize. The transfer oftechnologies on preferential and concessional terms hasnot been forthcoming. Indeed  impediments are placedon technology transfer even on commercial terms. Thespecial session of the United Nations General20Assembly on the review and appraisal of theimplementation of Agenda 21 in 2002 shouldconcentrate on finding solutions in addressing suchunfulfilled commitments and providing reality andoperational content to the declaration that “eradicationof poverty is the over-riding priority of developingcountries”.Children and issues relating to them are a priority.We hope that the special session of the GeneralAssembly next year will concentrate on theimplementation of the Declaration of the WorldSummit on Children.Advancement of the democratic spirit andovercoming challenges to it  growth with equity economic development with social justice and  as theprize that we seek  the creation of a world whereinjustice and deprivation give way to fulfilment andwelfare for all are among the goals that we should setfor ourselves at the dawn of this new century. Thechallenge is nothing less than collective enlightenedglobal ownership.The General Assembly once again faces a heavyand challenging agenda on this long road before us. Letus wish ourselves success in our endeavours."
"76",3255,"IRL",55,2000,"Your election  Sir  asPresident of the Millennium Assembly is fittingrecognition of your great dedication to internationalpeace. Ireland is especially grateful for youroutstanding contribution to the Good Friday agreementsigned in Belfast in 1998. We are sure that the qualitiesthat you displayed then will serve you well in guidingthe work of this session.Our thanks are due also to Foreign MinisterTheo-Ben Gurirab of Namibia  the wise and thoughtfulPresident of the fifty-fourth session of the GeneralAssembly. We are happy also to welcome Tuvalu as anew Member of the Organization.My colleague  Foreign Minister VÈdrine ofFrance  has already addressed the Assembly on behalfof the European Union. Ireland is fully associated withhis remarks.The Declaration adopted at the historicMillennium Summit sets out the principles  objectivesand targets which should inspire the work of thissession. Ireland is fully committed to these principlesand objectives  and we are determined to workvigorously to achieve real results. Critics of the UnitedNations may doubt our ability to achieve such results;we are determined to prove them wrong. Such criticsignore the considerable achievements of theOrganization in recent years. Major reform of allaspects of the Organization has resulted in a moreefficient  streamlined operation. We will work withothers to strengthen the United Nations in order tofulfil the commitment made in the Declaration  toensure a more effective instrument for pursuing thefight for peace and development and against poverty ignorance and disease.The cause of peace transcends all otherchallenges. Whether in the Middle East  the WesternBalkans  Africa or  indeed  in our own island ofIreland  determined efforts to build a secure anddurable peace must be tirelessly pursued. Our ownexperience in Ireland has taught us that there is nogreater prize  no more difficult task and no greatersatisfaction than to begin to heal the wounds of historyand the scars of intolerance.Our own efforts at building peace have convincedus that to be effective  such efforts require internationalsupport and validation. We have also learned thateconomic development goes hand in hand withbuilding a society with hope in its own future andpledged to overcome the bitterness of the past. It is thisexperience which helps guide our approach to peace-building in the wider world. It is this experience ofpeace-building and development which we will bringto the deliberations of the Security Council if electedby the membership in the coming weeks.Security and development are indivisible andinterrelated. Yet too often we in the internationalcommunity stand aside as hapless witnesses  hesitatingto become involved  while the innocent suffer. We needto strengthen the capacity and commitment of theOrganization to fulfil its mandates. I therefore stronglywelcome the exercise of its authority by the UnitedNations in East Timor last year and  more recently  inSierra Leone. It is our duty as Governments tounderpin that authority.We must address those issues which prolongconflict  even when root causes become blurred. Letme give two examples. First  the illicit flow of smallarms and light weapons into areas of conflict must bestopped; and secondly  trafficking in high-valuecommodities  particularly the trade in so-called blooddiamonds'  which has exacerbated conflicts in Africa must be prevented. Carefully targeted  time-limitedsanctions will help to counter this menace.Enhancing the role of the United Nations inpeacekeeping is a priority for this session. To broadenthat role  we urge an integrated approach combiningprevention  settlement and post-conflict peace-building. While the Security Council has a global remitto maintain international peace and security in everyregion of the world  it is right that it pay specialattention at this time to the promotion of durable peacein Africa. We therefore welcome the declared intentionof the Security Council at the Millennium Summit toensure that it plays a more effective role in this urgentand necessary task.Peacekeeping is at the heart of Ireland'scontribution to the United Nations. For more than 40years we have participated continuously in United21Nations peacekeeping operations. Irish personnel haveserved under United Nations command in the MiddleEast  Africa  the Americas  Asia and Europe. We areproud of the contribution which our peacekeepers havemade in so many areas of the world. At the same time we deeply regret that 82 of our Irish soldiers have diedin the service of the United Nations. Other MemberStates have also sustained losses  and I would like toexpress my deep regret at the brutal attack last week onUnited Nations personnel in West Timor as well as atthe recent outrages in Sierra Leone.It is because of our own long  and at timesfrustrating  experience of peacekeeping that Irelandwelcomes the publication of the Brahimi report. In thelight of this experience  I will focus in particular onthree aspects.First  the United Nations must have the resourcesand capacity to deliver well-planned and effectivepeace support operations. The Member States mustgive the Secretary-General and his staff the means todo the job.Secondly  if the United Nations is to save lives  itmust be capable of deploying into conflict areasrapidly. This requires rapid decision-making.Thirdly  effective operations depend on well-trained peacekeepers. A more integrated approach mustbe taken to develop training and equipment of UnitedNations peacekeeping personnel. Ireland's own UnitedNations Training School has provided such training toover 170 officers from 40 countries  and we intend toenhance this role in cooperation with like-mindedcountries.To those ends  we will contribute actively in thisAssembly to the urgent follow-up of the proposals thathave been put forward.Progress in disarmament remains cruciallyimportant both to the maintenance of peace and todevelopment. At the sixth Review Conference of theParties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons  very considerable efforts were madeby all the States parties to ensure a successful outcome.That reflects the central role of the Treaty in theachievement of a world free of nuclear weapons. Theoutcome highlights the underlying premise of the Non-Proliferation Treaty: that these weapons do not provideassurances of peace and security. The threat tohumanity posed by their continued existence willremain until we achieve an effective and global ban.There have been welcome and significantreductions by the nuclear-weapon States of theirarsenals. But defence strategies based on nuclearweapons continue to include the possible use  even thefirst use  of those weapons. The Non-ProliferationTreaty is not a charter for the indefinite retention ofnuclear weapons by any State. It represents a clearobligation to make nuclear disarmament a reality. Atthe Review Conference  the parties to the Non-Proliferation Treaty came closer in their commonunderstanding of what is demanded by the Treaty. Inthat connection  the unequivocal commitment to thetotal elimination of their nuclear weapons made by thenuclear-weapon States is of fundamental significance.However  let us not lull ourselves intocomplacency because we have reached agreement on aprogramme of action. We now have an opportunity tobegin the root-and-branch elimination of theseweapons. Progress is primarily dependent on action bythe five nuclear-weapon States. States whichparticipate in security arrangements involving nuclearweapons have a particular responsibility to diminishthe role of nuclear weapons in security policies. AllStates share a responsibility to advance negotiation onthose measures needed to guarantee a world free ofnuclear weapons. For our part  Ireland and our partnersin the New Agenda Coalition are determined to workvigorously for the achievement of that goal.I referred earlier to the role of conventional armsin conflict situations. The ravages and suffering causedby small arms as well as by landmines are immense.We are  at least in the case of landmines  beginning tosee positive results from the implementation of theOttawa Convention on the Prohibition of the Use Stockpiling  Production and Transfer of Anti-personnelMines and on Their Destruction. The practical outcomehas been the destruction of over 22 million mines bysome 50 States; expenditure on mine clearance hasmore than doubled  and countless lives have beensaved.Next year  the United Nations will focus on smallarms with the first international conference specificallyaddressing that issue. We must set ambitious goals forthe conference so that we may have a basis for makinggenuine inroads on the culture of violence fostered bythe dissemination of those weapons.22Peace and development are essential to eachother. Without peace  there can be no development.Without development  peace is hard to sustain. Withoutfreedom from the threat of war  from human rightsabuse and from famine  there can be no lasting humanprogress. The elimination of poverty and access tobasic health care and education are crucial tosustainable development. Nonetheless  we witnesstoday an unprecedented contrast between the prosperityof developed countries and the poverty of those thathave been left behind. And yet  at the same time  weare witnessing an actual decline in the internationalcommunity's development aid levels. Clearly  thattrend must be reversed.It has long been an objective of IrishGovernments to bring our development cooperationeffort into line with our national economic growth andto meet the United Nations development cooperationtarget. Last week our Government took an importantstep forward by when our Taoiseach  our PrimeMinister  Bertie Ahern  speaking at the MillenniumSummit  committed Ireland to meet the United Nationstarget of 0.7 per cent of gross national product by theend of 2007  and to reach the level of 0.45 per cent bythe end of 2002. This will clearly represent asignificant increase in volume terms. Indeed  inmeeting our targets  we anticipate a fourfold increaseby Ireland in our aid over the next seven years. Thatwill greatly increase our ability to make a real impacton the lives of some of the poorest people on earth. Ouraid budget is both a test and a reflection of ourcommitment to the values and principles set out in theMillennium Summit Declaration. We shall not fail inthis task we have set ourselves as a country: to be anexample to all who could contribute more.As we enter the new millennium  we are facedwith several development issues which requireimmediate attention. We must begin to address thequestion of debt relief in a more coherent manner. Themost heavily indebted countries need a sound basis forthe achievement of acceptable levels of growth freefrom grinding debt. We must recognize that the burdenon those States is unsustainable in the face of thechallenges of poverty alleviation and AIDS.Speed is essential in delivering results from theEnhanced Debt Initiative if it is to remain credible. Inaddition to a European Union contribution of almost$1 billion  Ireland has bilaterally contributed over$40 million in debt relief  although as a matter ofprinciple we have never extended loans in the guise ofdevelopment assistance. That is why our aid has alwaysbeen in grant form  and why all of our development aidis also untied.Greater market access by the least developedcountries must be a priority. With the earlyimplementation of the European Union's commitmentto grant duty-free and quota-free access to its marketby the least developed countries by 2005  a major stepin this direction will have been taken.One of the greatest challenges to development isHIV/AIDS. If the spread of AIDS is to be arrested  weneed: strong political will in the leadership of the mostaffected countries; we need greater internationalresources; we need greater access to essential drugs atprices that are affordable; and we need more researchfunds for the development of vaccines. The fightagainst AIDS is now an integral part of all Irishdevelopment activities  with funding budgeted for bothprevention and the search for vaccines.Respect for human rights is central to themaintenance of peace and the promotion ofdevelopment. It underpins all the activities of theUnited Nations. Putting weapons in the hands ofchildren and sending them into conflict undermines themost basic rights and the innocence of the child. Thatis a scandal which cannot be allowed to continue.Through the Optional Protocol to the Convention onthe Rights of the Child on the involvement of childrenin armed conflicts  which Ireland was among the firstto sign  a start has been made in addressing this issue.But much more must be done.The establishment of an International CriminalCourt offers a unique opportunity to bring to justice theperpetrators of crimes against humanity and otherserious violations of international law. Ireland ismoving rapidly to ratify the Statute. The internationalcriminal tribunals for former Yugoslavia and forRwanda demonstrate how necessary it is to exerciseinternational jurisdiction to end the culture of impunitywhere violations of basic human rights occur.Racism  racial discrimination  xenophobia andintolerance persist in all our societies. The 2001 WorldConference against Racism  Racial Discrimination Xenophobia and Related Intolerance will provide anopportunity to create a vision for the fight againstracism and all intolerance for the coming century. I paytribute here to the United Nations High Commissioner23for Human Rights  Mary Robinson. Taoiseach BertieAhern  TD  our Prime Minister  was pleased to beamongst the first to sign the declaration entitled:Tolerance and diversity: a vision for the twenty-firstcentury'  which was presented at the MillenniumSummit. I believe that it will generate a positiveapproach to the World Conference.I know that our friends in the internationalcommunity continue to follow developments in thepeace process in Ireland with close interest. Indeed  theGovernments of many Member States have played animportant and concrete part in the successes we haveachieved to date. I am particularly pleased therefore tobe able to report that in the past year  in the face ofmany difficulties  we have made real progress towardsthe full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.The new political institutions are up and workingwell. In Northern Ireland there is an Executive onwhich all parts of the community  nationalist unionist and republican  are represented as of right and where Ministers are working constructivelytogether to improve the quality of life for all thepeople. The North/South Ministerial Council  whichbrings together Ministers from both jurisdictions on theisland  and the Implementation Bodies which itoversees  are developing new ways of workingtogether  delivering tangible benefits in areas of mutualimportance and interest. In the British-Irish Council we are forging new relationships  including with thedevolved administrations in Scotland and Wales.We are firmly committed to ensuring that allother aspects of the Agreement are implemented in full.Policing reform is a vital part of the newdispensation we are striving to create in NorthernIreland. All sides of the community want to see aneffective  accountable policing service to which theycan give allegiance and which young people  whatevertheir background  can join. The Agreement promised anew beginning in this area  and the Patten Report setout how it can be achieved. It is now cruciallyimportant that the legislative proposals currently beforeParliament at Westminster secure that outcome.The Agreement also contains extensivecommitments in the area of human rights  and we areworking to ensure that they are delivered. MyGovernment has established an independent HumanRights Commission  with a mandate and remit thatsurpass the standards set in the Paris Principles. We arein the process of appointing its members. We lookforward to the Commission working closely with itscounterpart in the North for the protection andpromotion of human rights throughout the island ofIreland.We also need to see continued progress towardssecurity and justice arrangements appropriate to asociety in which peace will become the norm  and tosee the question of arms resolved for all time. To thisend  we have made great strides forward in recentmonths.Our task in the peace process has always beenmore than the putting in place of a new set ofinstitutions and arrangements  important though theyundoubtedly are. We are endeavouring to create a newbeginning for what has been a deeply divided society  anew beginning where the divisions of the past areovercome. The task which the Irish Government has setitself is to work with others in peace and partnership and in a spirit of mutual tolerance and respect  buildingtogether a better future for all of the people of Ireland.This demands patience  persistence and perseverance.A great deal remains to be done.Far too many people continue to have their livesblighted by sectarianism and hatred. There are stillthose who prefer to foster division  retarding ratherthan advancing the cause of reconciliation. On bothsides there are still small groups of dissidents preparedto use violence to bring down the Agreement and tofrustrate the democratically expressed wishes of thepeople. They have nothing to offer  and they will not beallowed to succeed.In Northern Ireland many people have yet toexperience the full benefits of change and the return ofhope and normality to their lives. Some remainsceptical about the benefits of the Agreement. But working together with the British Government and withthe representatives of all sides of the community  wewill continue to do all in our power to convince themthat the Agreement represents not only a balanced andhonourable accommodation  but also the only wayforward.The international community has made animportant contribution to our achievements to date.Without the support and encouragement of theinternational community  we could not have come sofar. When we embarked on our journey towards peace we knew that it would take a great deal of time and of24work to see the Agreement implemented in full. Weremain firmly committed to the task and take heartfrom the substantial progress we have made and drawcourage from the international community's continuedsupport.In the course of my statement I have set out myGovernment's position on the key issues facing theUnited Nations. It is this approach and commitmentthat will inform our actions if we are elected to theSecurity Council. Ireland is standing for election after20 years absence from the Council. We do so as a smallState which has already made a significant contributionto the work of this Organization. Faithful to theprinciples and purposes of the Charter  we have facedand tried to overcome the legacies of strife andunderdevelopment that have marked our own history.Membership of the Security Council will allow us tobring to the service of all the lessons of our ownexperience  as well as our full commitment to theUnited Nations."
"77",3302,"IRN",55,2000,"Allow me at the outset to congratulate Mr. Holkeri onhis election to the presidency of the General Assemblyand to assure him of the full cooperation of thedelegation of the Islamic Republic of Iran in thedischarge of his important responsibilities. I wish alsoto register our appreciation for the efforts of hispredecessor  Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  the ForeignMinister of Namibia. My thanks and gratitude also goto our Secretary-General for his tireless andconstructive endeavours on behalf of the Organization.The world is currently undergoing the mostradical changes ever experienced by mankind. In sucha rapidly changing environment  the main challengefacing the United Nations is to keep pace with eventsand try to play a leading role in directing their coursein a way more compatible with the interests of theoverwhelming majority of the world's population. Therecently concluded Millennium Summit provided aunique opportunity for global leaders to draw up acollective agenda for addressing this historic challenge.As the sole universal body  the United Nations isuniquely positioned to be the instrument of democraticglobal change. It can help to ensure that the process ofchange and transformation in the global system isparticipatory and fair. The focus of our attention at theglobal level over the past 55 years has been on thepreservation of international peace  security andstability. Despite the tremendous economic andtechnological progress that has been achieved  justice29and universal participation in decision-making and inthe benefits of peace and progress have attracted lessglobal attention and fewer resources.As the Secretary-General points out in hismillennium report  the benefits and costs ofglobalization have not been evenly distributed. Whileworld trade has increased more than ten-fold since1950  over half of the world population continues tolive on less than $2 a day and three quarters of theworld population earn less than 20 per cent of totalglobal income. The common destiny of humanity in theage of globalization requires us to reject the illusion ofbuilding islands of affluence  prosperity and stability ina turbulent sea of war  poverty  disease  ignorance andinsecurity.Globalization is an economic  social and culturalreality. It should not just be allowed to happen — it is areality that we can and should collectively manage.One key task is to ensure that the benefits ofglobalization are more evenly distributed. Themillennium report of the Secretary-General sets out anumber of realistic and quantifiable targets. Necessaryresources need to be committed and those who havebeen mostly on the receiving end of the benefits ofglobalization have an added responsibility. The UnitedNations machinery should direct and coordinatebilateral and multilateral efforts in this regard.Globalization has also further complicated theglobal menaces of terrorism  organized crime and drugtrafficking  necessitating the adoption of common andrule-based strategies to fight and eradicate them.Terrorism afflicts the entire international communityand must thus be combated in its entirety  regardless ofwho its victims or perpetrators may be. In a globalizedworld  nothing can justify harbouring or providing safehaven to terrorists or condoning their activities. Nonation can fight terrorism unilaterally. We needuniversal  non-discriminatory and comprehensivemechanisms to fight terrorism wherever it occurs andto deprive terrorists of their means of recruitment operation and funding.The role of the United Nations in this regard isindispensable. In this context  particular attentionneeds to be focused on cooperation in the field oftransnational organized crime and drug trafficking which  in addition to inflicting their own banes onhumanity  increasingly provide income to terroristorganizations. We are prepared to participate activelyin any endeavour to combat this scourge.The menace of drug abuse and traffickingcontinues to take a heavy social  economic andpolitical toll. It particularly afflicts young people  whoembody the future. Combating drug trafficking is acostly exercise and requires international political willand serious burden-sharing. The provision ofmeaningful financial resources and modern equipmentby target countries can enable transit countries  such asours  to combat the problem at a fraction of the cost.The Islamic Republic of Iran has done more thanits fair share in preventing transit  seizing more than 70per cent of all narcotics confiscated worldwide. Thefinancial burden and  more importantly  the humansacrifice are unsustainable. More than 2 900 Iraniandrug enforcement personnel have been martyred in thefight against drug traffickers. We appreciate thecooperation and support extended to Iran by the UnitedNations International Drug Control Programme in thisregard  although its limited resources cannot cover theprogrammes it wants and needs to implement. It isimportant to stress that  in the absence of meaningfulbilateral and multilateral assistance  the IslamicRepublic of Iran will have to allocate most resources tocombating domestic consumption and will not be ableto sustain its fight against drug trafficking with thesame vigour and energy.As underlined by President Khatami here lastweek  the emergence of a world culture is anotherreality. But such a culture should not overlook nativelocal cultures with the aim of imposing itself uponthem. National cultures have gradually evolved in aprocess ensuring coherence in spite of the plurality anddiversity that is found in many of them. This processcreates a sense of belonging.We need the same harmony and sense ofbelonging for the emerging world culture. The answeris participation and not assimilation and imposition.Last year  I proposed recognition of the right of nationsand peoples to preserve and nourish their culture andcultural identity. The General Assembly adoptedresolution 54/160 in this regard. We continue to believethat in the process of globalization  it is essential torecognize and respect cultural rights of individuals andcommunities.We should transform globalization  particularly inthe area of culture  into a democratic  participatory and30natural process of globality. The United Nations canfacilitate this process by promoting dialogue for theexchange of knowledge  experience and understandingin diverse areas of culture and civilization. Thepromotion of global participation in the process willprevent a sense of alienation and “culturalhomelessness” in major parts of the world.The designation of the year 2001 as the UnitedNations Year of Dialogue among Civilizations is thefirst step in this direction. The unprecedentedworldwide reception of this proposal indicates first andforemost a general need for dialogue. The round tableon dialogue among civilizations  which was held herein New York on the eve of the Millennium Summitwith the participation of a significant number of headsof State  Foreign Ministers and prominent scholars andthinkers  underlined that dialogue should become thenew paradigm of international relations. Thisconstituted a proper launching of the United NationsYear of Dialogue. It must be augmented by seriousprogrammes and the commitment of all to make this ameaningful reality which should persist in humanexperience long after the United Nations Year ofDialogue ends. In this context  the Organization of theIslamic Conference (OIC)  which is currently chairedby President Khatami  has recently adopted a draft“global agenda on dialogue among civilizations”  to besubmitted to the General Assembly at its fifty-sixthsession. We hope that in the course of the next severalmonths  consultations between various delegations willlead to further enrichment and the adoption of this draftat the next General Assembly.The United Nations can naturally play a leadingrole in the democratic global change in the politicalscene. Crises in disparate parts of the world challengethe relevance of the United Nations  requiring it not totake the back seat.The situation of Palestine represents a vividillustration of the failure of the internationalcommunity to provide justice to millions of peopledeprived of their homeland and the most fundamentalhuman rights through State terrorism  aggression andforeign occupation. Of over 7.5 million Palestinians  4million live in diaspora  and many of the rest underforeign domination. This lies at the heart of thePalestinian question. Disregarding the joint processesof expulsion and occupation cannot lead to therestoration of peace and tranquillity in that volatileregion. In fact  Israel's persistent disregard for therights of the Palestinian people  coupled with Zionistpolicies of aggression  State terrorism and acquisitionof weapons of mass destruction  continue to pose thegreatest threat to regional peace  security and stability.Palestine belongs to all Palestinians irrespective oftheir creed. Peace can return to the region only throughan end to the occupation of all Arab and Muslimterritories  including the Golan Heights  the restorationof the rights of Palestinian people  including their rightto return to their homeland  the exercise of theirinalienable right to self-determination throughdemocratic means and the establishment of theirindependent State with Al-Quds al-Sharif as its capital.The persistence of the tragic fratricide inAfghanistan  along with the dire humanitariansituation  violations of human rights  particularly thoseof women and girls  the production and trafficking ofnarcotics and the harbouring and training of terroristshave created a human catastrophe. Peace and nationalreconciliation can be attained only through abandoningthe illusion of a military solution and the domination ofone ethnic group. The United Nations  through theSpecial Representative of the Secretary-General andthe “six plus two” Group  continues to provide themost suitable mechanism to facilitate intra-Afghandialogue aimed at a responsible  broad-based  multi-ethnic and fully representative government. TheIslamic Republic of Iran has played an active role inthis process. Also  in his capacity as Chairman of theOIC  President Khatami has undertaken an initiative tobring the warring factions to negotiations. We areprepared to continue this exercise in close coordinationwith the United Nations.There are other humanitarian challenges emergingglobally  requiring the United Nations to respond.Failure to act may bring about arbitrary andselective — and  naturally  politically motivated —responses from States and non-universal organizations.The articulation of the criteria for rule-based reactionand the allocation of necessary resources and capacity-building in the United Nations for timely responseconstitute two major tasks ahead. As the Secretary-General has pointed out  prevention through diplomacyand economic development is the most effective andleast costly type of global engagement.Good-governance at the international levelrequires the provision of rational and comprehensivemechanisms to ensure security for all. Nucleardisarmament is the most fundamental priority in this31regard. It is imperative to initiate multilateralnegotiations for the elimination of all nuclear weapons within a time-bound framework and through acomprehensive and universal convention. The proposalof the Secretary-General to convene an internationalconference on nuclear weapons is a valuablecontribution; such a conference could build upon ourcollective achievement during the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) Review Conference.Furthermore  following the outcome of the NPTReview Conference  serious and comprehensiveinternational pressure should come to bear on Israel toaccede to the Treaty and to put its installations underInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)safeguards. This would pave the way for theestablishment of a zone free from weapons of massdestruction in the Middle East.Finally  in reforming global governance  the roleand efficiency of the General Assembly  as the soledemocratic  universal and transparent organ of theUnited Nations  must be augmented. It should focus itsdeliberations on contemporary challenges rather thanhold outdated debates  coupled with effective responsesto the reports of other organs of the United Nations particularly the Security Council.Efforts to work out a special political role for theUnited Nations come at a time when the Organizationis in one of the worst periods of its existence from afinancial perspective. The tasks that the internationalcommunity expects the United Nations to fulfil requiremore innovative ways of raising money for the smoothfunctioning of the Organization.In this context  it may be instructive to rememberthat if only a tiny percentage of the militaryexpenditures of the Member States were allocated tothe specific activities of the United Nations  the goal ofcreating a more secure global environment would bemuch more efficiently achieved.The current session of the General Assemblyfollows the Millennium Summit  the Inter-Parliamentary Union summit  the global gathering ofreligious leaders and the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization roundtable ondialogue among civilizations. As such  it represents atremendous and historic opportunity to take advantageof the political will expressed in those unprecedentedgatherings  to operationalize their declarations anddecisions  and to move the United Nations forward toan era of stability  justice  peace and good governance through participation and the rule of law.Commensurate with such a historic opportunity  we areall accountable before our own people and the peopleof the world."
"78",3349,"IRQ",55,2000,"It is mypleasure to congratulate Mr. Harri Holkeri on hisassumption of the presidency of the fifty-fifth sessionof the General Assembly  and I should like to convey tohim our best wishes for a successful accomplishment ofhis tasks. I should also like to express our high esteemto his predecessor  the Minister of Foreign Affairs ofNamibia  who conducted the work of the previoussession with notable skill.The Millennium Summit came to an end just afew days ago. From a certain point of view  it was anoccasion for reviewing the state of internationalrelations following the collapse of the bipolarinternational order. We have taken note of theincreasing number of States complaining of theunipolar control over international affairs and theextent of the current and future dangers that thissituation can give rise to.More than 10 years ago  Iraq drew attention to thefirst signs of many dangers and basic problems thathave since grown worse and become the focus of asignificant part of the discussions of the MillenniumSummit. In February 1990  President Saddam Husseinwarned against the grave dangers resulting from theunilateral control assumed by the United States ofAmerica and its headlong rush to impose its hegemonyon the world in general and on the Arab Gulf regionand other Arab countries in particular. He also warnedagainst the dangers posed by that State's recourse toillegitimate and immoral ways and means of achievingthat goal  including the use of brute force; the exerciseof pressure; political and economic blackmail;interference in the internal affairs of States; thefomenting of racial  religious and sectarian conflicts;and the use of international institutions to serve theinterests of American policy.Iraq also drew attention to the followingsituations at an early stage.The first was the exploitation by theindustrialized countries  the United States in particular of scientific and technological progress for politicalpurposes  with a view to engulfing all other countries8of the world in a wave of capitalistic globalization claiming that globalization is an inevitable fate towhich all must submit  regardless of the negativeconsequences and dangers it entails for the lives of thevast majority of humankind.Secondly  it drew attention to the adoption of adouble standard as far as political positions areconcerned  and it noted an indifference to the legal andpolitical standards imposed by internationally bindingagreements  where a balance is struck between rightsand obligations in the process of the coexistence ofinterests among various countries  without anydistinction or discrimination.Thirdly  it noted the prevalence of the logic of“power and opportunity” in the exploitation of UnitedNations mechanisms to ensure the adoption ofresolutions supporting the selfish political aims of onecountry or a few countries at the expense of commonprinciples in international relations  without first givingconsideration to obligations undertaken under theCharter of the United Nations and the principles ofjustice and equity — hence the recourse to mandatoryembargoes and comprehensive economic sanctions as agoal in and of itself  as well as the continuation of thepolicies of starvation and destruction of the economiesof various countries and societies.Fourthly  it drew attention to the imposition onthe international community of unilateral policiesthrough mechanisms and arrangements outside theinternational system  and to the fact that sucharrangements were treated as substitutes for the UnitedNations in those cases where the hegemonic Powers headed by the United States  expected to meet withstrong opposition by the United Nations to thoseunilaterally determined policies  as we saw in the caseof the aggression launched by the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization (NATO) against the Federal Republic ofYugoslavia.Fifthly  it noted the phenomenon of the forcibleadjustment and adaptation of established rules ofinternational law to serve the unilateral policies of thehegemonic Powers  headed by the United States ofAmerica  through the imposition of strange and bizarreinterpretations of the contents of such rules  or eventotal disregard for them when said Powers were unableto impose their strange interpretations thereon. Anexample of this dangerous phenomenon can be foundin the feverish attempts to minimize the importance ofthe principles of State sovereignty  nationalindependence and non-interference in the internalaffairs of States.Sixthly  it noted the phenomenon of evadingresponsibility in cases where the assumption ofresponsibility would not be profitable from aneconomic point of view  as is the case in questionsrelated to environmental pollution  the expansion of thesphere of poverty in the world and the obstruction ofthe development of the States of the South  all of whichare cases where the responsibility of the advancedindustrialized countries is quite obvious.The dangers  challenges and negative phenomenato which I have referred  as have many other speakersin the course of this general debate  have led to broadreflection on the solutions needed to overcome thosedifficulties and problematic issues. Iraq is of the viewthat the starting point is for United Nations actions tobe a true expression of the will of all peoples andnations. That is how the Charter of the United Nationswas drawn up  in order to establish a system ofcollective security based on common collectiveinterests. The stability and effectiveness of the systemof collective security is based on cooperation amongpartners and on the basis of specific obligations  notunilateral action and domination  as is the case today.The right of nations and peoples to live in peace andstability is the essential requirement for themaintenance of international peace and security. Thisright can be guaranteed only if it is firmly linked to theright to economic and social development and tofreedom from any kind of pressure or interference.This noble collective goal can be achieved onlyby upholding the United Nations system and byreforming and developing that system in order to investit with the ability and competence to achieve that goal.Reform is particularly called for in the case of theSecurity Council  which must respect its obligationstowards the community of States and must comply withthe correct interpretation of the purposes and principlesof the Charter in the performance of its functions andthe use of its powers. It is also necessary to restore therole of the General Assembly in the maintenance ofinternational peace and security  so as to ensure thenecessary balance if the Security Council fails toassume its basic responsibilities under the Charterbecause of the unilateral and abusive exercise of itspowers.9The wave of capitalistic globalization sweepingover today's world continues to widen the gap betweenthe rich and the poor in the world. This dangerousphenomenon requires a forceful call to lay thefoundations of a true international partnership in orderto re-establish economic and social justice at both theinternational and national levels  upholding theprinciple of equitable sharing by all of the fruits ofscientific and technological progress  and stopping richcountries from using science and technology as toolsfor imposing their policies of exploitation on thecountries and peoples of the world. A dynamicpartnership between the countries of the North and thecountries of the South is fundamentally opposed to thelogic of domination and unilateral power and to thetransformation of science and technology into politicaltools for the subjugation of others. On the other hand the call for democratization within countries willremain spurious unless its advocates adhere to ademocratic course at the level of dealings with otherStates and with international organizations.Furthermore  the call for respect for international lawand its primacy at the national level will remain devoidof credibility unless it is associated with the kind ofconduct that calls for respect for the letter and spirit ofthe Charter of the United Nations and the rules ofinternational law  and with the possibility of recourseto international judiciary bodies  with regard to theinterpretation and application of legal provisions toensure a delicate balance between powers andresponsibilities  rights and obligations. Any affirmationof respect for human rights should not overlook thefact that civil  political  economic  social and culturalrights should  as a matter of equal importance andurgency  enjoy the same respect. Nor should such anaffirmation overlook the fact that the world ischaracterized by cultural and civilizational diversity and that the cultural and social assumptions tacitlyaccepted by a given culture cannot be imposed on othernations and peoples.What I have just stated does not belong to therealm of theory. We in Iraq continue to suffer from thedomination and abusive actions of the hegemonicpowers headed by the United States of America. Ourdeep faith in the righteousness of our position explainsthe steadfastness shown by our country and our peoplein the face of the might of the unipolar Power.The comprehensive sanctions imposed on Iraqhave entered their eleventh year. By all standards  thesesanctions amount to genocide and involve a brutalapplication of collective punishment and revengeagainst an entire people. There is no longer any doubtthat these sanctions constitute a continued  flagrantviolation of the United Nations Charter  ofinternational law and of international humanitarian law.This matter has been confirmed by the reports ofUnited Nations agencies and humanitarian and humanrights organizations. The most recent testimony to thateffect is to be found in the working paper adopted bythe Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protectionof Human Rights at its fifty-second session  held inGeneva from 31 July to 25 August 2000. The paperaffirmed that the comprehensive sanctions against Iraqare unequivocally illegal under existing internationalhumanitarian law and human rights laws.It is well known that both the United States andGreat Britain claim that the oil-for-food programme agreed to between the United Nations and Iraq alleviates the impact of the unjust sanctions imposedagainst Iraq. Such a claim  however  is quickly provedto have no basis when set against the figures publishedby the United Nations itself. More than three and a halfyears have now passed since the inception of theprogramme  during which Iraq has exported $31.6billion worth of oil. Of this total  $9.5 billion has beenallocated to the Compensation Fund in Geneva and $1billion allocated for operational administrativeexpenses of the United Nations while  in the course ofthree and a half years  only $8.3 billion has beendisbursed for purchases to cover the needs of the Iraqipeople.There are also floating and semi-frozenallocations for certain needs of Iraq amounting to $10billion that have not been disbursed owing toobstructions placed by the Americans and the British.Such egregious obstructions include the suspension of1173 contracts  valued at more than $2 billion  relatingto construction materials and humanitarian needs.Despite increasing pressure on the internationalcommunity to put an end to this ongoing genocide  twopermanent members of the Security Council — theUnited States of America and Britain — insist onperpetuating this crime to further their plans todestabilize the Arabian Gulf region and preserve itshotbeds of tension with a view to prolonging theirhegemony over and military occupation of the regionand to plundering its wealth.10The United States openly declares that it isprepared to use the veto against any attempt to lift thesanctions imposed on Iraq. It is indeed shameful for theUnited States that its Secretary of State  MadeleineAlbright  has declared on television that thecontinuation of sanctions is worth the death of 500 000Iraqi children.Just to clarify the matter  although the StatesMembers of the United Nations have authorized theSecurity Council to act on their behalf provided that itdo so in accordance with the purposes and principles ofthe United Nations  pursuant to Article 24 of theCharter  the Security Council has  in the case of thecomprehensive sanctions imposed on Iraq  gone so farbeyond the purposes and principles of the Charter as toturn itself into a cover for perpetrating a policy ofgenocide against an entire people. Therefore  itbehoves the States Members of the United Nations tovoice their opinion as to the extent of the SecurityCouncil's faithful compliance with such authorization.In this connection  it is worth mentioning that  underArticle 25 of the Charter  Members of the UnitedNations agree to accept and carry out the decisions ofthe Security Council in accordance with the Charter.This means that implementation of the comprehensivesanctions imposed on Iraq  which have become illegalunder international humanitarian law and human rightslaw  is no longer binding on States Members of theUnited Nations.I must also point out that my country is beingsubjected to ongoing daily aggression by American andBritish aircraft in the no-fly zone imposed on northernand southern Iraq by unilateral decision of theWashington and London Governments. The aircraftlaunching the aggression take off from their bases inSaudi  Kuwaiti and Turkish territory. This continuousmilitary action  which violates the integrity andsovereignty of Iraq's airspace  has no basis in law or inany binding resolution adopted by any competent organof the United Nations. It constitutes instead anillegitimate unilateral action undertaken by the UnitedStates of America and the United Kingdom.These belligerent acts constitute both interferencein the internal affairs of Iraq and ongoing militaryaggression against Iraq through the imposition of thetwo no-fly zones. The illegal character of theimposition of those two no-fly zones has beenconfirmed by official statements issued by the RussianFederation  France and China  which have from thevery outset declared their position that the impositionof those zones has no basis in law. This position is alsosupported by a former Secretary-General of the UnitedNations who  in his book entitled Unvanquished: aU.S.-U.N. Saga  makes it clear that the American claimthat Security Council resolution 688 (1991) authorizesthe launching of attacks against Iraq in order to enforcethe no-fly zone is baseless and that the enforcement ofthe no-fly zones  far from having been endorsed by theSecurity Council  is no more than a unilateral act bythe Governments of Washington and London.The American and British acts of aggression haveinflicted enormous material and moral losses on Iraqand gravely damaged its civilian infrastructure. Theloss of human life to date has amounted to more than300 martyrs  while more than 900 civilians have beenwounded. The United States of America and Britainbear responsibility for these acts of aggression and forall their consequences  in accordance with the rules ofstate responsibility under international law. By thesame rules  that responsibility is shared by SaudiArabia  Kuwait and Turkey by virtue of theirparticipation  support and assistance in carrying outthese acts of aggression. The Saudi Governmentprovides American and British aggressors with militaryfacilities and the bases of Rafha  Dhahran  KhamisMushait  Al-Jauf and Tabuk  from which scores ofAmerican and British planes take off to attack Iraq. InKuwait  the rulers provide services  facilities andfinancing to the American and British aggressors at theair bases of Ali Al Salim and Ahmed Al Jaber.Iraq has discharged its obligations under relevantSecurity Council resolutions. Consequently  the logicalresult would be for the embargo imposed on Iraq to belifted. Moreover  the Charter requires that theAmerican-British aggression against Iraq becondemned and that its perpetrators and those whoparticipate in it — Saudi Arabia  Kuwait and Turkey —bear the international responsibility  with all its legalimplications.We cannot  under any circumstances  deal with anunjust position that ignores the record of our fulfilmentof our obligations and that denies us our legitimateright to have the embargo lifted  as required by theCharter and the correct interpretation of relevantSecurity Council resolutions. A flagrant example ofhow the record of the fulfilment of our obligations hasbeen flouted and how our right to have the embargolifted has been denied is to be found in theunderhanded way by which the United States ofAmerica and Britain have made Security Councilresolution 1284 (1999) a vehicle for defrauding Iraq ofits rights and for misrepresenting its full discharge ofits obligations under relevant Security Councilresolutions  including in particular resolution 687(1991). Resolution 1284 (1999) does not represent asolution at all  nor is it  in essence  anything other thana deliberate ploy to further American anti-Iraq policy as embodied in the indefinite perpetuation of theembargo. We have therefore clearly declared that weshall have nothing to do with that resolution.The Middle East region is suffering from a gravesituation caused by the fact that the Zionist entity thatoccupies the Arab Palestinian territories possesses ahuge arsenal of weapons of mass destruction of allkinds — nuclear  chemical and biological — and longrange ballistic missiles. The Zionist entity occupyingArab Palestine refuses to accede to the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and refuses toplace all its nuclear installations under thecomprehensive safeguards regime of the InternationalAtomic Energy Agency.Besides being a threat to peace and security in theMiddle East region and the world  such a positionexposes the double standard applied by the UnitedStates  which at once arms the Zionist entity and givesit unlimited support and deliberately ignores theprovisions of paragraph 14 of Security Councilresolution 687 (1991). This paragraph specifies that themeasures imposed on Iraq should be applied to othercountries in the region in order to make the MiddleEast a zone free of weapons of mass destruction and ofall systems of delivery of such weapons  as well as topursue the goal of imposing international prohibitionsagainst chemical weapons. The Security Council hastaken no action in this regard  despite the fact that Iraqhas implemented all the required measures.Consequently  the way in which the Security Councilhas acted under American pressure in this context is aflagrant example of a double-standard policy."
"79",3396,"ISL",55,2000,"Allow me  Sir  at theoutset to congratulate you heartily on your election tothe Presidency of this General Assembly. Finland is aclose friend and partner within the Nordic community.We wish you success with this challenging task andpledge to you the full support of the Icelandicdelegation.The Millennium Declaration provides thecommitments of the world community in the newcentury. To prevent conflicts  maintain internationalpeace and security and make peace an achievable goalat the end of armed conflicts  we need to continuestrengthening the United Nations and the internationallegal system as a whole. Iceland has always supportedverifiable arms control and arms reduction measuresand will continue to support realistic disarmamentproposals aiming at maximum security with aminimum of weapons. It is appalling to note theenormous sums being spent on weapons  while themoney could be used to significantly improve the livesof millions.Today  when there is an obvious need to assessthe United Nations ability to conduct peacekeepingoperations  it has proved extremely important to have aSecretary-General who has such a deep knowledge ofthe matter through his own experience. I would like tocommend the Secretary-General for taking theinitiative to ask a panel of prominent experts in thefield to assess the situation. I welcome the Brahimireport. Its recommendations should be implemented assoon as possible.Even though my country does not have a military it has been able to participate in peacekeepingoperations. It has done so in the Balkans by providingmedical staff  policemen and experts in the fields oflaw  the media and women's rights. We have noted withinterest the recommendations made in the Brahimireport concerning the non-military aspects of peaceoperations. We will be studying them carefully nowthat we are in the process of looking into how we canstrengthen our contribution to peacekeeping in thefuture.The report states that expressions of generalsupport in the form of statements and resolutions mustbe followed up with tangible actions. We will be takingthese words of wisdom seriously in our policy-making.In the preparations for the Millennium Assembly the Secretary-General encouraged Member States toengage more effectively in the international legalframework by acceding to a number of legalinstruments. One to which Iceland has decided toaccede is the Convention on the Safety of UnitedNations and Associated Personnel.The Security Council has the primaryresponsibility for the maintenance of internationalpeace and security. Unfortunately  it has not succeededin reflecting the tremendous changes in theinternational arena which have taken place since itsestablishment. In order to ensure its credibility in yearsto come  the reform process has to be accelerated.The rules of international law governing therelations between States are now well established; thisalso applies in the fields of human rights andhumanitarian law. These rules set out the rights andobligations of States and individuals. But ground rulesdo not suffice if it is not possible to enforce them.There are mechanisms to ensure respect andcompliance with these rules  such as the GeneralAssembly  the Security Council and peacekeepingmissions. As a complement to these mechanisms  aneffective international court system should be availableto bring those who breach these rules to justice  at thesame time serving to deter potential perpetrators.With this in mind  I believe that the greatestachievements towards strengthening the internationallegal system in recent years have been theestablishment of the International Criminal Tribunalsfor the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and for Rwandaand the adoption of the Rome Statute of theInternational Criminal Court. Iceland has ratified theRome Statute and encourages all other States to do so.I welcome the proposal to include cooperationbetween the United Nations and the Council of Europein the agenda of this session of the General Assembly. Ihad the honour of chairing the Council of Ministers ofthe Council of Europe last year. I am therefore wellaware of the important contribution made by theCouncil to peace and stability in Europe  especially inthe field of human rights. The United Nations  theOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe(OSCE)  the North Atlantic Treaty Organization(NATO)  the Council of Europe and other organizations14responded to the serious situation in the Balkans byjoining forces and working together to makereconstruction achievable.In Kosovo  the politically motivated and inter-ethnic violence must be stopped. Rogue elementscannot be allowed to destroy possibilities created bythe international community. One ethnic group mustnot be allowed to win at the expense of another. TheKosovars have been provided with a uniqueopportunity to build a just community in the region —a community where the fundamental freedoms andrights of every individual and minority group arerespected. Only by utilizing this opportunity areKosovars going to be able to build a stable foundationfor lasting peace and stability for future generations.The same can be said about similar situationselsewhere in the Balkans  such as in Bosnia andHerzegovina.The international community has taken on anenormous task in building a whole new civic structurewithin Kosovo. The development of a legal system andfree media have been two challenging tasks. Theelections to take place in October are also going to bechallenging. Hopefully  they can be carried out in anorderly and peaceful manner.It is very important to include women in thepolitical process. In this respect  I would like tocommend the United Nations Development Fund forWomen (UNIFEM) for the good work carried out inKosovo  not only in the political field but also infighting violence against women and in promotingwomen's participation in economic activities.The importance of human rights in securing long-term stability and security  both within and betweencountries  cannot be overestimated. It is thereforeessential that no compromises be accepted in this field and our aims should remain high.The Security Council should be commended fordiscussing the grave humanitarian crisis and securitythreat posed by the HIV/AIDS epidemic  particularly insub-Saharan Africa  and also for discussing the issue ofchildren and armed conflict. The discussion in theCouncil has served to concentrate the attention of theinternational community on these issues and led theway for others to take the measures required. Bothissues affect children in a very serious manner. I expectthem to feature prominently on the agenda of nextyear's special session to follow up the World Summitfor Children. I also welcome the decision to hold aspecial session of the General Assembly on theenormous problem of HIV/AIDS and internationalefforts to combat it.The rights of women were significantly enhancedwith the adoption last year of the Optional Protocol tothe Convention on the Elimination of All Forms ofDiscrimination against Women. Iceland has signed theProtocol and is preparing its ratification.I cannot fail to condemn the terrible plight ofthose women around the world who are still enduringmajor human rights abuses  including female genitalmutilation and trafficking  as well as severe restrictionson their freedom of movement and the right to work.During the Millennium Summit  the PrimeMinister of Iceland signed the two Optional Protocolsto the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Icelandwelcomes their adoption and hopes that they willfurther secure the human rights of children.We have to put extra effort into working towardsthe elimination of racial discrimination. It is worryingto note the trend towards increasing racism andxenophobia in certain parts of the world  includingEurope. This needs to be fought at all levels. TheWorld Conference to be held in South Africa next yearwill without doubt play an important role. Icelandwelcomes this Conference and feels that  in the light ofhistory  South Africa is a very appropriate venue for it.As reflected in the report of the Secretary-General  “We the peoples”  fighting poverty remainsone of the main challenges to the United Nations.People living in poverty do not have the opportunity toexercise many of their fundamental rights andfreedoms. They cannot benefit from the possibilities ofglobalization. We need to reverse the current trend  asdecided at the Millennium Summit. But more needs tobe done. Globalization and new technologies offermany opportunities to reduce poverty at a faster ratethan in the past.We have been strengthening our developmentcooperation  both bilaterally and multilaterally. At thebilateral level  we have concentrated on a group ofAfrican countries with a focus on strengthening theirfishing industry and education and health areas  withthe potential to positively alter the lives of people inneed. On the multilateral level  we will be contributingto the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative15through the World Bank and the International MonetaryFund.Most of our decisions are based on compromises in which each and every one of us has to give a little inorder to reach an agreement. It is very important tokeep this in mind  not only when we discuss substance but also when the time comes for us to pay our dues both to the regular budget and to the peacekeepingbudget. It is crucial for the good functioning of thisOrganization that all Members pay their contributionsfully  on time and without any conditions.In recent years  the oceans of the world havereceived increased attention in the General Assembly.We welcome this development. Iceland's economy isbased on the sustainable harvest of living marineresources. The health and responsible stewardship ofthe oceans are therefore of critical importance to us.Last year  we resolved to improve United Nationscoordination in the area of ocean affairs. Towards thatend  we established an Informal Consultative Processto discuss the Secretary-General's report on the oceansand the law of the sea. I was pleased with theimplementation of this decision of the first Meeting ofthis Process last spring.However  we must act carefully when seeking toimprove our coordination and cooperation in this area.Ocean issues must be addressed at the appropriate leveland be consistent with the rights and obligations laiddown in the Convention on the Law of the Sea. Wemust fully respect the sovereign right of States overtheir natural resources and the competence of existinginternational organizations. Above all  the integrity ofthe Convention must be preserved. We must be mindfulthat the Convention provides the legal frameworkwithin which all activities in the oceans and seas mustbe carried out.The United Nations specialized agencies have animportant role to play in promoting the conservationand sustainable use of the oceans. A key area in thisrespect is marine scientific research. We need moreaccurate and policy-oriented information on the state ofthe oceans. Coordination towards that end would be aworthy task for the new Informal Consultative Processon Ocean Affairs.At the onset of a new millennium  it is morepressing than ever before to ensure the access of peoplein the developing countries  especially in rural areas  toreadily available and sustainable energy. Today  aboutone third of the world's population does not have suchaccess  and this situation is obviously a seriousobstacle to the development of these communities. Inmy country  we have been able to bring sustainableenergy to all households in the country. We are sharingour experience and knowledge with the developingcountries through the United Nations UniversityGeothermal Training Programme  which is located inIceland and funded by my Government.The 1992 Earth Summit in Rio created amomentum for building a secure future for humankindand life on Earth under the banner of sustainabledevelopment. Soon  world leaders will meet again at aglobal conference to take stock of the progress made inmeeting these challenges  laid down in Agenda 21 andthe other Rio agreements. It is indeed true that we havenot been able to live up to all the expectations raised inRio  but we should not fail to acknowledge theprogress that we have made.The concept of sustainable development has trulybecome accepted as a fundamental guiding strategy inenvironmental and socio-economic affairs. In my owncountry  which is dependent on fisheries  we believethat we are reaping the benefits of the sustainable-useregime for our fish stocks in the form of a healthyecosystem and a robust economy. Regional andinternational efforts to prevent the pollution of theoceans have continued to gather strength and we canexpect further efforts  in particular to control pollutionfrom land-based sources.It is my belief that  in charting a course for thefuture  we should be looking at success stories andlearning from them  rather than concentrating on theobstacles we face. Let us be guided by the doers  butnot the doom-sayers."
"80",3443,"ISR",55,2000,"I stand here today asIsrael's messenger of peace. The establishment of theState of Israel was the fulfilment of the dream of apeople forced into exile 2 000 years ago. Thedestruction of the Second Temple and the dissolutionof Jewish statehood were the result of our failure as anation to assume the proper political course  to opt foraccommodation with reality instead of engaging inmessianic hallucinations. Our punishment was verysevere indeed  but maybe it can serve as a lesson tothose nations and leaders who today may be tragicallyled to believe that the dangerous inertia of romanticmythology and unrealistic dreams is preferable to thebanality of a wise and prudent political course.Most revolts are uprisings against a system.Zionism was a revolt against destiny. It is thisexpression of our re-encounter with the world ofpolitical realities that eventually led us to therestoration of Jewish statehood in 1948. Tragically however  historical and geopolitical circumstanceshave put us in a prolonged  bitter conflict with thePalestinian people.It was thanks to the leadership of Prime MinisterRabin and Chairman Arafat that  seven years ago Palestinians and Israelis were put on a track leading topeace and reconciliation. We have been engaged in thepast seven years  but more intensely in the last year  ina major effort  unprecedented in both scope and depth to resolve this 100-year-old conflict. This negotiatingprocess  and it alone  should be the foundation of apeace agreement.At this point  I would like to address mycolleagues from the Arab and Muslim world. I hopethat my words will convince them of the IsraeliGovernment's sincere intentions to achieve acomprehensive peace based on respect  dignity andfairness  which will end the Middle East conflict andbest serve the vital interests of the entire region.The Jewish people have no quarrel with Islam.On the contrary  we have the deepest respect for thatgreat Islamic civilization under whose wings Jewishhistory — from Al-Andalus to Turkey  from Egypt toIraq  from the Jewish quarters of Tangier to Aleppo inSyria — has known some of its finest hours and mostglorious cultural achievements. But even at the heightof the “Golden Age”  in the midst of the delights andwonders of Muslim Spain  our people never abandonedtheir dream of and yearning for Jerusalem  as expressedin the words of the poet Yehuda Halevi more than 800years ago:“My heart is in the East  and I am in the furthestreaches of the West. To thee my soul yearns fromthe depth of the West.”We are a small nation decimated by holocaust anddispersion  but our heritage is rich. It was from oureternal capital  Jerusalem — which  according to aMuslim source “in the days of the people of Israel  was an arealarger than Cairo and Baghdad” —that the message of monotheism was projected tohumanity. The Jewish holy sites and shrines inJerusalem are the very heart of the Jewish faith identity and history. For the past 2 000 years  Jewshave turned towards Temple Mount in prayer threetimes a day.“If I forget thee  O Jerusalem  let my right handforget its cunning. Let my tongue cleave to theroof of my mouth if I do not recall thee” they pledged in joy and in sorrow.For the past 30 years  Israel has consistentlydemonstrated its commitment to freedom of religion10and worship in Jerusalem. Heads of the variousreligious denominations in Jerusalem will attest to thefact that the city has never been so open to allbelievers. During the last month of Ramadan  a recordnumber  unheard of in the annals of Islam in Jerusalem of more than 400 000 Muslim worshippers attendedFriday prayers at the Al-Aqsa Mosque.I note this as an example of the deep respectwhich Israel has for Islam and its followers. Just as wedo not question the sincerity of the sentiments of otherstowards their holy sites in Jerusalem  we expect thatothers will not question the Jewish people's deep  awe-inspired attachment to Jerusalem and its holy sites from which we will never again be parted.Politicians need not distort God's intentions forthe sake of negotiations. How refreshing it is that agreat number of Muslim scholars should attest to thefact that  as the Supreme Court Judge Mujir el-din al-Hanbali wrote in his History of Jerusalem and Hebron “David reigned for 40 years and before he died hepassed the monarchy on to his son Solomon andtold him to build the beit al-miqdas —  theTemple”.The expression beit al-miqdas —  that is  the House ofthe Temple — became in many Muslim sources asynonym of the word “Jerusalem”.It is a travesty of historical truth to present thePalestinian refugee problem as the result of massexpulsion. There is no denying  however  that once theJews — who for thousands of years waited withhumility for their redemption — made their re-encounter with history as a sovereign nation  they hadto assume the inherent immorality of war. Thesuffering of the civilian population will always be aburden on the conscience of any nation at war. TheArab-Israeli conflict has no monopoly on this maxim.Clearly  the Palestinian refugees were victims of theArab-Israeli conflict. Israel  however  can assumeneither political nor moral responsibility for thistragedy that was the direct result of the all-outonslaught against reborn Israel — an onslaughtlaunched by the Arab armies in 1948. The Palestinianrefugee problem was born as the land was bisected bythe sword — not by design  Jewish or Arab. Theproblem was largely the inevitable by-product of Araband Jewish fears and the protracted bitter fighting.We believe that  once established  it is thePalestinian State that should provide for the vindicationof the Palestinian claim for the right of return. Thenotion is preposterous that a nation should create aState only in order to gather its exiles in aneighbouring State. Israel  however  has expressed itswillingness to actively participate in any internationaleffort and fund aimed at providing the financialfoundations for the resolution of the refugee problem.Out of humanitarian considerations  Israel may alsoaccept a small and limited number of refugees within ascheme of family reunification.Let there be no doubt. The peace process is notthe objective  we need not sanctify the process. Peace not the process  is the objective. Peace is not aboutmore conventions  summits and resolutions; it is aboutthe future of our children  and about the seeminglyunattractive banalities of building the mechanisms ofcohabitation.To the Palestinians we say: we need todisentangle ourselves from this seemingly insolubleconundrum. We know that unless your and our woundsare healed  peace — not only the political peace butalso that of the mind and the conscience — will not becomplete. Yet  at the same time we realize that the totalsatisfaction of our respective dreams or presumedrights will lead us to perdition. Hence it is incumbenton us to devise realistic ways to heal without openingnew wounds  to dignify our existence as free peopleswithout putting into jeopardy the collective existenceof each other. Peace is not about twisting each other'sarms; it is about defining a common interest. I believethat such an ideal compromise is not impossible toachieve  while banishing the sword from this land ofGod.Peace has not materialized in full yet  but Ibelieve that we are moving in the right direction. In thepast year the Government of Prime Minister EhudBarak has made bold  courageous and unprecedentedmoves towards peace. At Camp David we havecontemplated ideas and explored concepts relating tothe most sensitive and supposedly intractable issues.Our sense is that breakthrough is possible  just asfailure may lead to breakdown. We have turned the seathat separated us into a river. But  do we have thecourage and the determination to cross it?I know I may not sound too objective byvouching for Prime Minister Barak. But  I have comehere with the power of conviction that no PrimeMinister before him — and let no illusions beharboured  no Prime Minister after him — will touch ashe has the outer limits of his options as an Israeli and aJew.I do not underestimate the dilemmas facingChairman Arafat. He is the great leader of thePalestinian people  and I know that the decision is noteasy for him either. But this is the destiny of leaders: toalways be prophets without honour. They should notexpect the applause of their constituencies  what reallymatters is the judgement of future generations. I callupon our Palestinian partners to realize that history hasbrought us to a moment of truth and decision fromwhich we are not allowed to escape empty-handedwithout inflicting severe punishments on our ownpeoples.Israel aspires to achieve a comprehensive peacein the region and help move it into the future. Twentyone years ago we signed a cornerstone peace treatywith Egypt  followed by a peace treaty with Jordan andan incipient but promising process of normalizationwith the Maghreb and Gulf States. Eighteen years ofIsraeli military presence in Lebanon have beenterminated by the Barak Government  in closecooperation with the United Nations  and thanksespecially to the efforts and dedication of Secretary-General Kofi Annan. We have also delved into thepossibilities of reaching peace with Syria. We hope thattalks with Syria will resume as soon as possible andthat a fair and equitable agreement can be achieved.Israel is determined to pursue peace and take thecalculated risks attached to it. But Israel will notcompromise — not now and not ever — on thosesecurity and national interests that we deem vital.While building our peace with the Palestinians wecannot ignore security concerns inherent in the fact thatpeace with the Palestinians is not our last peace. Westill have a dispute pending with Syria  and we are stillexposed to the most serious regional threats emanatingfrom revolutionary powers in the area.Peace requires the active involvement of theinternational community. The critical role played bythe United States  and especially the relentlessdedication and unequivocal commitment of PresidentBill Clinton  has been massive and constructive. Onceagain the United States has proven to be theindispensable nation. We have also seen the EuropeanUnion rising to the task  and we commend the role ofthe French Presidency and that of other key EuropeanGovernments. Peace needs the advice of theinternational community and it will need that supportto cement peace once it is achieved.We expect also to work closely with the EgyptianGovernment for the cause of regional peace. I believethat it is also important that Russia and the Arab worldexpress their opinions that now is the time to makehistorical decisions. Time is an elusive and perishablecommodity. We are all running out of it.We are open to developing wide spaces ofcooperation with our Palestinian neighbours and indeedwith all the countries of the Middle East  with dignityand mutuality. But  we do not intend to impose ourexperience on anybody  nor is it our intention to assertour economic or technological presence amidst those ofour neighbours who do not want it. The leaders and theelites throughout the Middle East do not need ouradvice to know what are the real challenges ahead of usall: modernizing the economy and combating disease hunger  poverty and illiteracy. Indeed  small islands ofexcellence notwithstanding  the Middle East is in gravedanger of being on the wrong side of the digital divide.In his inaugural speech in 1961  the late PresidentKennedy invited his generation to join him in astruggle:“Now the trumpet summons us again — not as acall to bear arms  though arms we need; not as acall to battle  though embattled we are — but acall to bear the burden of a long twilightstruggle  ... a struggle against the commonenemies of man: tyranny  poverty  disease andwar itself.”Nothing will make us happier than joining handswith our Arab neighbours with dignity and mutuality inthis most noble of struggles.The Middle East is not tranquil yet. It is stillreplete with armed conflicts  political hostilities andanimosities. Israel believes that regional arrangementsare crucial for arms control. A step-by-step approach commensurate with progress towards comprehensivepeace  is the right approach.We are concerned by the expanding stockpiles ofconventional weapons in the region  as well as byattempts made by Iran and Iraq to acquire and develop12non-conventional weapons  and by an increasingmissile threat.Israel attaches great importance to the eventualestablishment of a zone free of weapons of massdestruction in the region. In order to reach that goal direct negotiations between all States of the regionmust be held.Last year saw a turnaround in Israel's relationswith the United Nations. After years of anomaly  Israelwas temporarily admitted to the Western European andOther Group (WEOG) in New York. We hope thatIsrael's admission to the Western Group ininternational organizations based outside New Yorkwill soon be secured.The United Nations  and indeed most of itsMember States  played a major role in demanding thatIran treat fairly the 13 Jews falsely accused  convictedand sentenced for ludicrous charges of espionage. It isin such instances that the international community hasthe opportunity to express its discontent and exertpressure on countries that break the norms ofbehaviour.On the issue of the reform of the SecurityCouncil  is our opinion that the Security Councilshould faithfully reflect the present geopoliticalpicture  a picture that has changed beyond recognitionsince the last enlargement of the Council in 1965. Wesubscribe to the view that the right of veto — a safetynet against the possible arbitrariness of the GeneralAssembly — should remain in the hands of a limitednumber of States.Allow me a final reflection on the Israeli-Palestinian dilemma.The tragedy of the Israeli-Palestinian conflictstemmed from discrepant historical rhythms. Thehistory of our modern national movement has beencharacterized by realistic responses to objectivehistorical conditions. The Palestinians haveconsistently fought for the solutions of yesterday —those they had rejected a generation or two earlier. Thispersistent attempt to turn back the clock of history liesat the root of many of the misfortunes that havebefallen the peoples of the region. Now it is time for allof us to overcome dire memories and look forward.Neither the physical nor the rhetorical war of imageswill bring us any closer to peace and reconciliation. Noone has a monopoly on the mythology of suffering andatrocities. In this tragic dispute we have all committedacts of violence that we ought not to be proud of. Tothe Palestinians we say  we are excited by the prospectsto overcome the troubled history of our relations inorder to shape our dreams of peace. Let us then joinhands in asking the world  which has been watching perplexed at  and sometimes even fuelling our wars  tomobilize its resources for the benefit of our peoples.And  let us be full partners in this international effort tolay down the foundations of the Middle East of thefuture. The creative energies of our peoples should atlong last be put to work in the service of peace  for asthe wisest of kings  King Solomon  the builder of theTemple in Jerusalem  wrote thousands of years ago there is:“A time for slaying and a time for healing ... atime for war and a time for peace”. (The HolyBible  Ecclesiastes 3:3-8)"
"81",3490,"ITA",55,2000,"I wish to congratulate theMinister of Foreign Affairs of Namibia  Theo-BenGurirab  on his wise leadership of the fifty-fourthGeneral Assembly and his able preparation of theMillennium Summit. I would also like to offer theincoming President  Harri Holkeri  my best wishesupon your assumption of this high office. Yourcommitment and experience will be invaluable inensuring the success of the fifty-fifth session of theGeneral Assembly.Italy fully supports the statement made on behalfof the European Union by the current President  FrenchForeign Minister Hubert Védrine  and will make adecided contribution to the objectives he has indicated.Allow me to add that it is also in order to step up ourcommitment to achieving common goals that Italy ispresenting its candidature for the Security Council forthe next biennium.The year 2001 will be the United Nations Year ofDialogue among Civilizations. By unanimouslyadopting the relevant resolution in its fifty-thirdsession  the General Assembly demonstrated its greatsensitivity and attention to the profound structuralchanges under way in our national societies. It therebysent a strong signal on a number of themes that theSecretary-General has put forth in his report on the roleof the Organization in the twenty-first century. Thesethemes cannot fail to include the new face ofinternational migration  whose gravest aspects includeillegal immigration and the trampling of humandignity.Dialogue among civilizations should not beaddressed in the abstract  academically. It demands realcontact and a bond between individuals and peoples.To ensure that these contacts and this bond do notmutate into tensions and strife  the community ofStates must try to understand and manage migratoryphenomena. We must work together to preventmigration flows from plunging into chaos  a chaos forwhich the human person ultimately has to pay thehighest price.Migration needs to be governed by fixed transparent rules. The source  the rationale of theserules is the United Nations  to which the San FranciscoCharter in Article I  paragraph 3  entrusts thefundamental role:“To achieve international cooperation in solvinginternational problems of an economic  social cultural  or humanitarian character.”I submit to you that today migration between orwithin continents has become an international problemwith an economic  social  cultural and humanitariancharacter.Any solution to the problems connected withmigration must come to terms with the globalizationprocess. Globalization has reduced distance and time.To an unprecedented degree it has linked countries atopposite ends of the earth. There are even those whospeak  perhaps not wrongly  of “the end of geography”.The paradox facing us stems from the realdifficulties of globalization extending not only to theeconomy  finance and information but also to themovements of peoples. Most of these difficulties canbe ascribed to the complex transition of many advancedcountries to multi-ethnic and multicultural societies.Human beings are not commodities. Whenindividuals move  they preserve their roots  theirspecificity and their experience  even when they comeinto permanent contact with societies different fromtheir own. Hence the need for mutual tolerance  tosafeguard our respective customs and traditions.9The growing dimensions of migration havewidened the gap between individual government'smanagement capabilities and the individual person'sability to move  which is heavily influenced byprogress in communications. All too often this gap isfilled by organized crime  by ruthless criminals who  insome cases  traffic in human beings  in what amountsto a modern form of slavery.We need to ask how we can safeguard freedomwhile impeding slavery; how we can prevent globaleconomic development from sparking social tensions;how we can ensure that the growing contact betweendifferent civilizations will produce dialogue rather thanintolerance. It will take a strong  determinedcommitment from all of us to draft rules that  ifapplied  can have a positive impact on internationalmigration flows  to the benefit of both home and hostcountries.Improving millions of human lives is thefundamental challenge of development: we need aclear  explicit and effective commitment to eradicatepoverty. We must realize that in a globalized world migration can gradually impoverish areas that arealready economically and socially disadvantaged.Development assistance initiatives fromindustrialized countries and non-governmentalorganizations alike cannot defeat misery and poverty unless they are accompanied by an awareness thatforeign debt is a huge burden for Governments families and individuals. Generous remission of thepoorest countries' debt is not just an option: I feel it isa must. This is why the Italian Parliament recentlyapproved a law to reduce foreign debt owed to Italy bya total of $6 billion over the next three years.Italy will also play a pro-active role in urging theleading actors in the field of development assistance toshow determination in preparing the conference onless-developed countries scheduled to take place inBrussels next May. Moreover  my country confirms itssupport for the needs and aspirations of the small-island States and the landlocked countries  as it hasemphasized in the Economic and Social Council andother forums.But debt reduction is not enough. It should becoupled with sound government policies in thebeneficiary countries  as part of an integrated strategyunderlying a new international social contract. In otherwords  we must promote a package that combinesresponsible political  economic and social reforms withan opening-up of international markets. The 2001 high-level intergovernmental meeting on financing fordevelopment will provide us with a close opportunityto finalize a strategy.The fears that immigration sometimes generatesshould not lead industrialized countries to build newwalls and fences. Such fears reject contact withdiversity and make some feel as if they were strangersin their own country. A Europe built on fear  forexample  would ultimately cast immigrants as theimaginary enemy  as a race apart. Any effort toovercome such negative stereotyping should beapplauded  such as the Conference against Racism scheduled for 2001 in Pretoria.The European Union has a great capacity to takein people  and already has large immigrantcommunities. But only now is it developing a commonapproach to immigration. The European Union'sstrategy relies on cooperation with other countries since the issue cannot be addressed solely throughborder patrols and tougher repression of illegalimmigration  regardless of the cost.For many years Europe did not have to worryabout the long-term consequences of immigration. Buttoday  with a declining birth rate and an ageingpopulation  Europe needs a strategy that embraces thecomplex process of integrating people from differentregions of the world.Then  there is the tragic  heinous trafficking inhuman beings. As the United States Secretary of StateMadeleine Albright stated in this Assembly  we mustput a stop to this trafficking  a stop to boats being castinto the sea  filled with sadness and desperation  drivenby hopes in a promised land. The pictures of theseillegal crossings have become unbearable. Theyepitomize a state of affairs governed by the blackmarket  where there is an over-abundance of illegallabour. This new form of piracy would be impossible ifthose involved knew that they could not count oncollusion  safe havens and  all too often  impunity.For example  the Mediterranean Sea  aroundwhich great civilizations have prospered  is beingcrossed by people who pay ruthless exploiters andsometimes become their victims. In many cases  illegalimmigrants find it hard to gain access to the rule-of-law society  and end up being treated as commodities.10As we know  immigration has various causes:poverty  ethnic and religious strife  the repression oftotalitarian regimes  and the demands of more affluenteconomies. Today  as never before  immigration isdriven by broadcast images that often distort honesthopes for a better life. Moreover  it has reachedunprecedented proportions. In fact  since the earlyeighties the number of countries that receiveimmigrants has risen from 39 to 67  while the numberof countries of emigration has risen from 29 to 55. Wewould be fooling ourselves to think that a phenomenonof such proportions could be brought under controlsolely through bilateral agreements.The European Union has made cooperationbetween national Governments a priority since theEuropean Council meeting of October 1999. But recentexperience points to the need for an approach in whichonly the United Nations can confer the indispensablecharacter of universality.Italy has much to share in this regard. Until a fewdecades ago  large sections of our population wereforced to seek work in distant lands with differentlanguages and traditions. Their lives were often markedby hardship  want and family separation. This chapterof social history had points of light and of darkness but on the whole it was a source of great moral andspiritual wealth.Starting in the early 1970s  Italy became a land ofimmigration  although it could not yet provide fullemployment for all its people. As a land of bothemigration and immigration  Italy is well situated toaddress in a constructive manner global migrationtoday. Italian domestic law is based on the principle of“soft integration”  designed to provide permanentresidents with an opportunity that does not force themto renounce the rich heritage of their native cultures.It is on these grounds that  here before theGeneral Assembly  I urge the United Nations to raisethe awareness of the community of States andintroduce appropriate instruments. Three instruments in my view. deserve to be coordinated and integrated.First is assistance to the developing countries;assistance in preventing and quelling the tensions that at least in part  give rise to migration flows  as well asassistance in easing the integration of their economieswith those of the more advanced countries. As we allknow  this is a priority that the United Nations ispursuing through various committees and through theenhanced role of the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme. We must strive to improve the instrumentsalready available to us  responding to the visionaryproposals of Secretary-General Kofi Annan.Secondly  as a deterrent to illegal entry  we needstricter and more consistent law enforcement. Successdepends on effective cooperation between the countriesof origin  the countries of transit and the countries ofarrival. Such efforts should also aim to prevent thespread of pockets of illegality and organized crime bypromoting greater stability  moral authority and controlin fledgling democracies. This would be invaluable tosecuring the support of public opinion in industrializedcountries for cooperation policies.Thirdly  we need to manage migration so that it isa source of stability and wealth  to the benefit of all.For this to happen  migration must take place legally. Ifeveryone complies with the law  immigrants will bewelcomed in their host countries and become fullyintegrated into society.These three guidelines must be set within a globalframework. There are plenty of organizations that dealwith migration at the international level. Yet while theyprovide praiseworthy services  their sectorial naturemeans that they cannot have the kind of overall visionthat only effective coordination can guarantee.A solidarity pact  therefore  is needed to find thebest and most effective way of balancing the supply ofand demand for labour  while fully respecting thediversity of the people concerned. The greatestchallenge in the age of globalization is to design newforms of cooperation between Governments that willenable each to see that its interests are reflected ininternational policy decisions. The United Nationscontinues to be the most natural forum for adoptingsuch decisions and ensuring their implementation.I want to conclude my message today by recallingthe words of a great American President  JohnFitzgerald Kennedy. Almost 40 years ago he said “Now the trumpet summons us again ... tobear the burden of a long twilight struggle ...against the common enemies of man: tyranny poverty  disease and war itself.“Can we forge against these enemies agrand and global alliance  North and South  Eastand West  that can ensure a more fruitful life forall mankind? Will you join in that historiceffort?” (Inaugural Address  20 January 1961)That is what he said  and this is the wish that Ishould like to make here: that the United Nations through its indispensable role  may strengthen itscontribution to creating a better and more just worldwith the unflagging support of its membership."
"82",3536,"JAM",55,2000,"Sir  I offer youJamaica's warmest congratulations as you assume thehigh honour of the presidency of the MillenniumAssembly of the United Nations.At the same time  I wish to express ourappreciation to the outgoing President  Mr. Theo-BenGurirab  Foreign Minister of Namibia  who  by hisastute and judicious leadership  brought to a successfulconclusion the work of the fifty-fourth session.I also take this opportunity to welcome Tuvalu  afellow small island State  to the United Nations family.We meet in the wake of the historic gathering ofworld leaders last week  when the internationalcommunity sought to redefine and articulate a commonvision for the future of all its citizens. We now have theopportunity — indeed  the responsibility — to evaluatejust how far we have come in the mission we set forourselves through this Organization; to addresshonestly our shortcomings in commitment and action;and to examine practical  realistic strategies that willresult in measurable progress in areas identified forurgent action.The Secretary-General  whom we commend forhis stewardship during the past year  has urged us toconsider a world in the future free from poverty.Indeed  promoting development that ensures the well-being of all peoples is one of the fundamental goals ofthis Organization. However  a review of our efforts toachieve this ideal shows uneven progress through anincreasingly diffused institutional structure.Over the past decade  we have sought to refocusand articulate the development agenda by addressingkey issues in a series of special global conferences.Through the respective political commitments andplans of action which we agreed to implement  we havesought to devise a network of policies and programmesto promote people-centred  sustainable development.Yet economic strategies embracing these goalshave brought little tangible benefit to the majority ofcitizens of the international community. Nearly half ofthe world's people languish in extreme poverty  andstill more remain on the fringes of the global economy.Development efforts have been frustrated by thechallenges posed by globalization and tradeliberalization. Sustainable development ultimatelyinvolves an enhanced capacity for income andemployment generation  as well as the provision ofequitable health  education and other social benefits.But this cannot be achieved without economic growthand expansion. It is this opportunity that globalization which indeed carries the potential  has so far failed todeliver to the majority of developing countries.For small island States like Jamaica  there isanother dimension to the development challenge. Thisis because of the well-known economic limitations ofsize  market and resource base  a fragile ecosystem andsusceptibility to natural disasters. Decades ofinvestment in infrastructure and industry can be wipedout during a single hurricane  destroying the economyand diverting resources to reconstruction andrehabilitation for a number of years.Small economies attempting to competeeffectively in the international trading system are justas vulnerable. There is a need for an urgent review ofthe inequities in the global trading system wherebyselective application of the regulations permitsdeveloped countries to maintain protectionist policiesand subsidies that work against developing countryexports  while stripping the more vulnerable ofpreferential market access. We are deeply concernedthat a mechanism established to promote free trade forgrowth and development could be so manipulated thatit exposes the smallest and weakest to a hostile tradingenvironment while removing their means of survival.6Special and differential treatment provisions have notbeen implemented  and the request for duty-free  quota-free treatment for the least developed countries has notbeen agreed to.We are particularly disappointed that  in ongoingnegotiations to reach agreement on a marketing regimefor bananas that is compatible with the World TradeOrganization (WTO)  we have found little flexibility no empathy and an unwillingness to compromise on thepart of those challenging the regime. Meanwhile implementation of the WTO panel ruling has resultedin a dramatic loss of export markets in some CaribbeanCommunity (CARICOM) States  spirallingunemployment  increasing poverty and many othersocial ills. For there can be no development withoutgrowth  and no growth without trade.Deteriorating terms of trade adversely affect thebalance of payments  exacerbating external debt. Manydeveloping countries continue to experience severedebt burdens  and  in some cases  the debt problem hasworsened over the past decade  trapping thosecountries in a vicious circle of poverty andunderdevelopment. We must address the debilitatingeffect of debt servicing  which undermines growthprospects and compromises governments' capacity tofinance basic social programmes. The internationalcommunity should implement the debt-relief schemesalready agreed to and design new mechanismsappropriate to different countries' circumstances.The globalization of trade  finance and swiftlyadvancing information technology will presentunprecedented opportunities well into the twenty-firstcentury. For developing countries  however  thechallenges of the trading system  limited access tointernational financial flows  a crippling debt burdenand a low capacity to assimilate informationtechnology will prevent meaningful participation in theinternational marketplace. Hence  the widening gapbetween rich and poor nations in the face of unlimitedopportunity is the disturbing irony that we nowcontemplate.If we are now to lay the foundation for a worldfree from poverty  then a new ethos in globalgovernance must prevail: one that gives more than lipservice to the development aspirations of developingcountries; one that addresses responsibly the need foreconomic adjustment  reform and closer monitoring ofthe international financial infrastructure; and one thatpromotes greater coordination and cooperation betweenthe major institutions and intergovernmentalorganizations responsible for international trade finance and development.That such cooperation is already being exploredis indeed encouraging. But we will need seriouscommitment. Until now  there have been no paralleldiscussions on reforming the international financialarchitecture and the international trading system. Thework of the Preparatory Committee for the High-levelInternational Intergovernmental Event on Financing forDevelopment  including consultations with the BrettonWoods institutions  has progressed uneasily  leavinguncertainty regarding the outcome and likely success ofthat landmark meeting. We will wait to see whethermeaningful World Trade Organization (WTO)participation will take place  as we consider itimportant to successful deliberations.Of course  we applaud the evolving relationshipbetween the Bretton Woods institutions and theEconomic and Social Council. Each brings to thepartnership its unique characteristics and strengths which should make for successful collaboration.Perhaps similar relationships might also be establishedwith the World Trade Organization. That cooperation long overdue  reinforces the integral role that webelieve the United Nations should play in keyinternational decision-making on all issues whichaffect sustainable human development. We lookforward to the extension of this cooperation beyond theco-financing of development projects  towards theharmonization of mechanisms and policies.The importance of South-South cooperation as aneffective instrument for the promotion of developmentamong developing countries cannot beoveremphasized. The historic meeting of the leaders ofthe South  held at Havana this year  strengthened ourcommitment to forge a common strategy for our future sharing resources  expertise and best practices inpartnership with one another. We strongly urge thecontinued strengthening of mechanisms that advanceSouth-South relations and promote self-reliance.Increasingly  we must look to each other for oursurvival in the existing global environment.We continue to look to the organs and agencies ofthe United Nations system to play a central role insupporting and advancing the development efforts ofMember States. We are deeply concerned at the decline7in contributions to core resources for operationalactivities  and at the effect this has had in thenarrowing and re-ordering of priorities in programmedelivery. It is impossible to reconcile the contraction incore contributions with the donor community'sexpressed commitment to multilateral developmentassistance. The capacity of United Nations funds andprogrammes to maintain current levels of programmedelivery is a matter deserving the urgent attention ofMember States. We take this opportunity to place onrecord our appreciation for the valuable work of UnitedNations operational agencies in Jamaica.Next year's special session of the GeneralAssembly on children will give the internationalcommunity an opportunity to renew its commitmentand to consider further action to improve the quality oflife for the world's children in the next decade.The role of the United Nations as defender ofinternational peace and security has undergone majortransformation in the past decade. As inter-Statetensions dissolved with the end of the cold war  civilconflicts developed in Africa  Asia and Eastern Europeto take their place. The Security Council is nowsearching to adjust and redefine an effective strategy todeal with the new imperatives of peacekeeping andpeace-building. This has meant seeking a delicatebalance between respect for sovereignty and the urgentneed for humanitarian intervention.In too many cases the resolution of conflict hasremained elusive owing to political ambitions or toracial or ethnic intolerance. Furthermore  the brutalityand violence of conflict have often taken their toll oninnocent civilians and children  creating still more newchallenges with an increasing number of refugees andinternally displaced persons. Humanitarian interventionin such cases is imperative.The effectiveness of peacekeeping missions isunder scrutiny in the face of sharply escalatingpeacekeeping budgets. Rather than waiting untilconflicts spiral out of control  we need to place moreemphasis on conflict prevention. Jamaica thereforestrongly supports the formulation of a comprehensiveUnited Nations strategy to address the root causes ofconflict.It is time that we acknowledged that economicdeprivation and social injustice lead to political andeconomic instability. Therefore  effective conflictprevention  peacekeeping and peace building mustincorporate a development component  and provide forthe strengthening of civil institutions  particularly inpost-conflict reconstruction.And we must not forget the importance ofadequately equipping the United Nations machinery toensure robust intervention at every stage of thepeacekeeping process  particularly for rapiddeployment when necessary. This should also includeresources adequate to ensure the safety of our troopsdeployed in missions across the world. It is the veryleast that we owe them. Jamaica pays tribute today tothose who have paid the ultimate price in the service ofpeace.The deadly flow of illegal small arms around theworld continues unabated  sustained by greed andlawlessness. This illicit arms trade contributessignificantly to the escalation and perpetuation ofviolence in conflict and post-conflict areas undermining peacekeeping operations and frustratingefforts at disarmament  demobilization and therestoration of civil order. But this phenomenon is notunique to countries in a state of war. The illegal trafficin weapons is also linked to the illicit trade innarcotics  and this undermines stable democracies likeJamaica  destroying the social fabric of ourcommunities.This situation simply cannot stand. Urgent actionis needed. Global interdependence warrants collectiveaction to stem the flow of these guns from producer toreceiving States. The responsibility to curb this illicittraffic cannot rest with the receiving States alone.Jamaica looks with anticipation to the conveningof the first International Conference on the Illicit Tradein Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspectsnext year. It is our hope that this meeting will addresscomprehensively and decisively national  regional andinternational measures to regulate and control the legalmanufacture  acquisition and transfer of small arms;measures related to the marking  registration andtracing of these weapons; and mechanisms for thesystematic exchange of information.The transhipment of nuclear and other hazardouswaste through the Caribbean Sea poses yet anotherkind of danger to the security of small island States ofthe subregion. The Caribbean Community hasrepeatedly expressed concern at the threat to the fragilemarine and coastal environment of the Caribbean posedby this continued practice. A single nuclear accident in8this semi-enclosed sea would have consequences wedare not even contemplate.This concern was again brought to the attentionof the international community during the 2000 ReviewConference of the Parties to the Treaty on NuclearNon-Proliferation  held earlier this year. We lookforward to cooperating with like-minded States  and wepropose to work towards ensuring that a regime isestablished for liability and compensation to ourcountries in the event of an accident.On Friday  8 September  Jamaica signed theRome Statute of the International Criminal Court. Wenow look forward to the contribution that the Courtwill ultimately make to the strengthening ofinternational jurisprudence  by addressing the seriouscrimes of global concern committed by individualswho hitherto escaped the reach of the law.We are also very pleased to report that theInternational Seabed Authority has completed itsdrafting of the Mining Code. This marks an importantfirst step in the process toward the full establishment ofoperations of the Authority that will ultimately enableall nations to share in exploitation of the resources ofthe seabed. Jamaica encourages wider participation inthe work of the International Seabed Authority andurges Member States to act to ensure its continuedfinancial viability.While the United Nations is by no means perfect we still meet here because we hold an enduring faith inthe principles and ideals that it represents. We areconvinced that it remains the best forum for dialogueand resolution of disputes. Let us now face the futuretogether responsibly  with full respect for the needs aspirations and rights of our fellow man. This may wellbe difficult to achieve  but shared objectives  sharedcommitment and shared responsibilities will ensure abetter world for all humankind.As we contemplate the challenges for the future let us resolve to begin a new dialogue within theUnited Nations system to forge a global partnership forpeace  democracy and economic progress."
"83",3582,"JOR",55,2000,"At theoutset  I would like to extend my congratulations to HisExcellency on his election as President of the currentsession of the General Assembly  wishing him allsuccess in conducting its deliberations and in arrivingat conclusions beneficial to the internationalcommunity. I would like also to express our deepthanks to his predecessor  Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  onhis successful efforts in conducting the business of thefifty-fourth session. Furthermore  I would like toexpress my appreciation to Mr. Kofi Annan  theSecretary-General of our Organization  for his reportand his incessant efforts in the service of the purposesand principles of the Organization  with a view toenhancing its role and increasing its effectiveness inthe international arena.The General Assembly holds its fifty-fifth sessionin the wake of the Millennium Summit  whichwitnessed a historic meeting of world leaders heldunder the auspices of the United Nations. Thesignificance and meaning of the Summit affirm thecommitment of the international community to theprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations. Thisshould lead to the enhancement of its role as the bestframework for providing Member States with suitablemechanisms to organize and regulate internationalrelations on the basis of cooperative partnership particularly after the end of the cold war era and itsconcepts of polarization and balance of power  whichhad in the past instituted division and confrontation depleted huge resources and caused widespreadsuffering in vast areas of the world.Since the establishment of the United Nations theworld has witnessed developments that require areview of the methods and policies adopted so far.First  calls for democracy and efforts to establish it andmake it a way of life within States should be consistentwith the establishment of democracy in internationalrelations and within the United Nations itself. It is notlogical to continue urging and calling for theestablishment of democracy on one level whilerejecting it on the international arena  where in factthere is a dire need for democracy in order to achieveequality among the Members of this organization —rich and poor  strong and weak.During the past few years the United Nations haswitnessed some changes in its methods of work. Firstand foremost we must emphasize the need to preservethe role of the General Assembly. The power of theSecurity Council  the executive arm of the Assemblyfor peace and security issues  should not be increasedat the expense of the role of the General Assembly andits various other organs  which are supposed to providebalance and collective representation of theinternational will.Clearly  there is international consensus that thepresent composition of the Security Council does notprovide equitable representation of the internationalcommunity and that there is a need to correct this29situation. Since all States have expressed theirpositions through extended debates  the actionsrequired have become clearer and more specific.All Member States  both developed anddeveloping  agree that globalization and the abolitionof borders and obstacles to economic exchangespresent opportunities and pose risks. Althoughglobalization facilitates the flow of goods and servicesas well as of ideas  it has presented the developingworld with challenges related to deepening the gapbetween it and the developed world  particularly inview of differences in their respective levels ofscientific and technological development.Globalization has also put the identity andsovereignty of developing States and peoples to apainful test. Additionally  it has shown how difficult itis for developing countries to meet the requirements ofintegration into the world economy. While a majorityof developing countries were struggling to enter theindustrial era  they witnessed the entry of thedeveloped world into an era of information technology.While they were striving to provide basic services  likeinfrastructure  health care  social welfare andeducation  they witnessed the frightening accelerationof technological and economic changes — aphenomenon that thwarted their hopes of catching upwith developed countries.While globalization  openness and economicintegration make the world a unified economicenvironment  widening differences and deepeninginequalities will inescapably cause damage to all in thelong run. This situation makes it imperative toreformulate economic relations on the basis ofcooperation and partnership. It also requires action toreduce differences  rectify economic imbalances andhelp developing countries adjust their economies tomeet the requirements of globalization and integration.Furthermore  the experience of mankind has provedthat poverty and huge economic and social disparitieshave always been the root causes of instability andconfrontation.The Middle East peace process is going throughan extremely sensitive phase. During the past fewweeks and months  major  commendable efforts havebeen made to make Palestinian-Israeli negotiationsbear fruit — arriving at a lasting settlement betweenthe two parties.Jordan has made an essential contribution in allphases of the peace process. This contribution wasmotivated by Jordan's conviction that peace is the onlyreal option for all States and peoples of the region.Indeed  geographic and demographic realities make itimpossible for any party to settle the conflict byimposing its will or consecrating the status quo in itsfavour. Therefore  there is no alternative to establishingpeace on the basis of law  international legitimacy justice and equality.Despite the failure of the recent Camp Davidsummit to produce an agreement between thePalestinians and the Israelis  it has enabled the partiesto narrow the gap dividing their positions and made therequirements for reaching a settlement clearer. Thisconfirms the need to continue the efforts by the UnitedStates in particular and the international community ingeneral to build on what has been achieved so far.The achievement of lasting peace in the regionrequires the realization of the national rights of thePalestinian people  primarily the right to independenceand the establishment of their State on their nationalterritory  with the Holy City of Jerusalem as its capital.This means reaching implementable andsustainable solutions to the main issues  which are thesubject of the permanent-status negotiations. Regardingthe issue of territory  Israeli forces must withdraw fromthe Palestinian territories occupied in 1967  inaccordance with Security Council resolution 242(1967)  so that a Palestinian state may be establishedon those territories  with internationally recognizedborders. Any security arrangements that may be agreedupon must not be based on any claim of sovereignty asa result of occupation.The solution of the refugee problem must also bebased on rules of international law and the variousinternational conventions and on the basis of GeneralAssembly resolution 194 (III)  which emphasizes theright of return and compensation to the refugees.Persons who were displaced as a result of the June1967 war must be able to return to their homes inimplementation of Security Council resolution 237(1967).The issue of Jerusalem is the key to peace in theregion  and it must be solved on the premise that EastJerusalem is Palestinian territory occupied since 1967to which resolution 242 (1967) applies. East Jerusalemshould be under Palestinian sovereignty so that it may30become the capital of the independent State ofPalestine. Arab and Muslim rights to the Islamic andChristian holy places in Jerusalem must be preserved.In no way can Israeli sovereignty over these holyplaces be accepted.The status of Jerusalem and its spiritual andreligious importance make it imperative that the city bean open city where freedom of worship and access tothe holy places is guaranteed for all believers in God.Jordan has suffered immensely during the pastfive decades as a result of the situation arising from thePalestine question  particularly the refugee problem.There are more than 1.5 million refugees living inJordan. This amounts to 41 per cent of all refugeesregistered with the United Nations Relief and WorksAgency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East(UNRWA). This is in addition to the people displacedas a result of the June 1967 war. As a result of therefugee situation  Jordan has shouldered heavyfinancial  economic and social burdens.Jordan will be subject to pressures that willthreaten its stability and that of the region if thesettlement does not satisfy its legitimate vital interests.Refugees and displaced persons in Jordan will onlyaccept a settlement that recognizes their fundamentalrights to return and to compensation.It is well known that the vast majority of theserefugees have Jordanian citizenship as a result of theunity that was established between the HashemiteKingdom of Jordan and the West Bank in 1950. Thedeclaration of unity at the time provided for thepreservation of all Arab rights in Palestine and for theinalienability of the rights of the refugees.Upholding the right of return will  therefore enable every refugee to exercise freely his or herpersonal choice. Jordan must safeguard and preservethe rights of its citizens  which is its responsibilityunder national and international laws. Any solution thatdoes not satisfy the rights of Jordan and its citizens willnot lead to the establishment of a just and lastingpeace.Since the question of the refugees and theircontinued suffering has caused grave damage to Jordanand placed heavy burdens on it  Jordan demandsrectification of the damage and losses that it hasincurred. This rectification needs to include suitableand adequate compensation. Jordan will endeavour  byall possible means  to ensure that its legitimate claimswith regard to this issue are considered.It is worth mentioning that the Jordanian-Israelipeace treaty stipulates that the solution of the refugeeproblem must be based on international law and that itshould be dealt with bilaterally and in parallel with thepermanent status negotiations. It also established amechanism to deal with all financial claims betweenthe two parties.The rights of refugees and displaced persons toreturn and to compensation  and the rights of Jordanunder international law and the resolutions ofinternational legitimacy  take precedence over otherconsiderations. Jordan  therefore  will only accept asettlement that will preserve its legitimate rights andensure a lasting and comprehensive peace in the region.Otherwise  the conflict will remain open and volatile perpetuating the seeds of instability in the region. Theposition of the refugees in Jordan is vital to the successof any settlement to be reached.Also on the question of refugees  Jordan onceagain emphasizes the importance of supportingUNRWA to enable it to carry out its mandate  whichmust continue until a solution to this question is fullyimplemented. Jordan  as host to the largest number ofrefugees and the largest donor to UNWRA  expressesits appreciation of the Agency's role and calls upon theinternational community to provide it with the neededfinancial resources to carry out its humanitarian tasks particularly at this sensitive phase of the peace process.It also expresses appreciation to the donor States fortheir contributions.Peace in the Middle East cannot last unless it iscomprehensive. This makes the establishment of peaceon the Syrian track essential and a sine qua non forpeace in the region as a whole. Negotiations on thistrack must  therefore  resume in order to reach anagreement ensuring the return to Syria of the occupiedGolan Heights to the line of 4 June 1967 inimplementation of Security Council resolutions 242(1967) and 338 (1973).Israel's withdrawal from southern Lebanon on thebasis of Security Council resolution 425 (1978) is apositive development that will hopefully serve as afoundation for the implementation of other SecurityCouncil resolutions  leading to the achievement of acomprehensive peace in the region  which has sufferedfor many decades from the depletion of its resources31and the energies of its peoples. Only peace will providesecurity for all. It should lead to ending the arms raceand to using the resources for the development of theregion and making it free from weapons of massdestruction.Ten years have passed since the beginning of theGulf crisis caused by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. As aresult  the region as a whole continues to suffer. Iraqcontinues to pay a heavy price as a result of continuedcomprehensive sanctions imposed on it  which causedand continue to cause unprecedented mass suffering forthe Iraqi people.Jordan calls for launching a new thinking and anew look at the situation in Iraq in order to put an endto the suffering of the Iraqi people  especially since thecollective sanctions  which are the severest of theirkind in United Nations history  have not achieved theirgoal of consolidating peace and security. They haveinstead led to results that  in the long run  will give riseto dangers threatening the region as a whole. The needto implement and comply with Security Councilresolutions does not conflict with the maintenance ofIraq's sovereignty and territorial integrity  nor withrefraining from action that violates those resolutions.Iraq is an integral part of the region and its continuedsubjugation affects security and stability in the regionas a whole. Jordan calls for the settlement of all mattersrelated to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on the basis of fullimplementation of relevant Security Councilresolutions  including those dealing with Kuwaiti andother prisoners of war  and missing persons.Jordan continues to suffer severe economichardships as a result of compliance with relevantSecurity Council resolutions. Large segments ofJordan's economy have  as a result  sustained hugelosses. It is  therefore  imperative to put an end to thenegative effects of the sanctions on Jordan by showingbetter understanding of its situation  reviewing thepolicies and methods used in dealing with the sanctionsregime and giving a more just interpretation to therelevant resolutions.Because of our strong belief in the role of theUnited Nations  Jordanian armed forces participateeffectively in its peacekeeping operations in severalareas around the world. As a result  Jordan today is thesecond largest troop contributor to peacekeepingoperations. While commending the report (A/55/305)of Mr. Brahimi's Panel on United Nations peaceoperations  Jordan wishes to reiterate the need for theprovision of adequate means and resources to enablepeacekeepers to achieve their noble objectives. We callfor a constructive and thorough discussion of the reportin order to produce the best possible means to attainthat goal. In this spirit  we underscore the importanceof conducting consultations with States that contributeto peacekeeping operations  before the adoption ofmajor decisions concerning and affecting the status oftheir forces.On another note  we feel that the startlingdevelopments witnessed by our world today  at variouslevels  make it increasingly necessary to rely on theUnited Nations to develop and establish norms in allmatters pertaining to human security. The ongoingdialogue on the need to establish complementarity andbalance between State sovereignty and human rightsonly reflects the importance of this issue. Sovereigntyshould not provide a cover for violating human rights.Hence  greater emphasis should be placed on theimportance of objectivity  non-selectivity andimpartiality when dealing with human rights issues.It is illogical to continue to keep silent about thesuffering of whole nations whose dignity is beingundermined and whose human rights are beingviolated  while prominence is almost always given toother partial issues for purely political considerations.With the onset of the third millennium the worldis entering a new epoch that necessitates the formationof a new pattern of relations in the international arenabased on our collective responsibility to develop andsafeguard what has been achieved so far. Our worldneeds to establish a new paradigm of internationalrelations based not on confrontation and exclusion  buton new foundations of openness and real partnership.Integration  which encompasses the overlappingand interdependence of interests  presupposespartnership and solidarity among nations to help themmanage change and ease the lack of confidence andhesitation associated with the fear of failure. Theinternational community's willingness to encourageand support the will to change will certainly reinforcethe capacity to deal with such change with minimumlosses and convince those taking such a risk thattoday's world is not based on a zero-sum option andthat the challenge that we all face is: How can man regardless of ethnic background  economic situation orreligious belief be the primary beneficiary of the32development achieved by humanity in modern times?This is the acid test we all face today. Will we succeed?"
"84",3629,"JPN",55,2000,"First  I would like toextend my heartfelt congratulations to you  Sir  aformer Prime Minister of the Republic of Finland  onyour assumption of the office of President of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-fifth session.I would also like to pay my respects to Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  Foreign Minister of the Republic ofNamibia  for all his efforts during his tenure asPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourthsession.It is also my great pleasure to welcome theadmission of Tuvalu as a new Member of the UnitedNations.Before proceeding to my main topic  I would liketo mention two important developments that took placein the international community in recent months.Concerning the situation on the Korean peninsula  therecent inter-Korean summit was indeed epoch-makingand I strongly hope that this positive development willcontinue  advance in the future and lead to peace andstability in North-East Asia. With regard to the MiddleEast peace process  Japan is very much encouraged bythe commitment of both parties to continuing theirnegotiations and  together with the internationalcommunity  will strongly support the efforts of theparties to achieve a lasting peace in the region.In order to ensure that the twenty-first century istruly a century of peace  it is of the greatest importancethat the international community make united efforts toaddress the issues of disarmament and non-proliferation.In 1945  Hiroshima and Nagasaki became the firsttwo cities in human history to suffer indescribablenuclear devastation. That experience is the startingpoint of Japan's actions aimed at the realization of aworld free of nuclear weapons. With succeedinggenerations in this half-century  the extremely shockingexperiences of Hiroshima and Nagasaki might verywell be pushed to the edge of our memory. In suchcircumstances  new signs of proliferation of nuclearweapons and missiles are arousing our concern. Ibelieve  however  that engraving the tragic experiencesof Hiroshima and Nagasaki in our minds is the firststep toward the creation of a world free from thenuclear threat  which is one of the biggest challengesfacing the United Nations. In light of such experiences Japan has maintained the three non-nuclear principlesas its fundamental national policy and has focusedparticular attention on nuclear issues. It will continueto stress the importance of this issue.Since the Second World War  we have adopted asthe basic ideas of our nation: democracy  commitmentto peace and respect for fundamental human rights which are enshrined in the Japanese Constitution.Moreover  under its basic policy of not becoming amilitary power  Japan has mobilized all its availableresources for the prosperity of its people and achievedeconomic development. It hopes to utilize thatexperience and make a further contribution to theeconomic development and enhancement of the welfareof developing countries.Throughout my political career  I have beendeeply committed to nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation issues. A senior politician for whom Ihave great respect once told me with great fervour:I hope that somebody among the peoplesof the world will take the lead in advocatingpeace  and that all others will cooperate for thatcause  so that the earth will avoid a crisis. Ibelieve that Japan must play the role of thatsomebody.These words have become my political credo  aswell as the resolve of many Japanese people. When Iwas Foreign Minister in 1994  Japan submitted to theGeneral Assembly for the first time a resolutionentitled Nuclear disarmament with a view to theultimate elimination of nuclear weapons (49/75 H) which gained the support of an overwhelming majorityof Member States. Japan's support of the indefiniteextension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons (NPT) in 1995 is attributed to thestrong will of the Japanese people. I highly appreciatethe final document adopted at the 2000 NPT ReviewConference this spring  since it contains practical stepsto be taken in the future in the fields of nucleardisarmament and non-proliferation  including anunequivocal undertaking to accomplish the totalelimination of nuclear arsenals. I also appreciate thepostponement by the United States Government of itsdecision to deploy a national missile defence  as aresult of prudent consideration with an emphasis onfurther dialogue on this important issue. Japan hopesthat this announcement will inspire a further deepeningof the discussion on issues surrounding national missiledefence. I hope other countries respond to this move bytaking actions to avoid a vicious circle of an arms raceand to create a beneficent circle toward nucleardisarmament. The international community mustcontinue its efforts aimed at non-proliferation ofweapons of mass destruction and demand that thenuclear weapon States further reduce their nucleararsenals. This will definitely require a further reduction14by the United States and Russia in their nuclearweapons through the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks(START)  as well as efforts by other nuclear weaponStates  unilaterally or through their negotiations  toreduce their nuclear arsenals. I also believe that wemust seriously consider what kind of practical paths weshould take to realize a world free from the fear ofnuclear weapons. A world free of nuclear weapons isnot a dream; it is within our reach.To that end Japan will submit to this session ofthe General Assembly a draft resolution on theelimination of nuclear weapons  which sets forth a pathtowards the realization of a world free of nuclearweapons  while ensuring the non-proliferation ofweapons of mass-destruction. It does so throughmeasures such as the early entry into force of theComprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) andthe immediate commencement and early conclusion ofnegotiations on the fissile material cut-off treaty  aswell as the promotion of the Strategic Arms ReductionTreaty III negotiations  and through further  deeperreductions at a later stage in nuclear arsenals  leadingin the final stage to total elimination. Japan expectsthat this resolution will gain wide support from theinternational community.Further  I would like to point out the importanceof concluding negotiations on the protocol to theBiological Weapons Convention (BWC) by the year2001  and strengthening efforts to cope with missileproliferation.Now I would like to discuss international effortsfor conflict prevention. For the effective prevention ofconflicts  it is important to employ various policymeasures in a comprehensive and effective manner. AsSecretary-General Kofi Annan advocates  it isincumbent upon the international community to nurturea culture of prevention. The G-8 Miyazaki Initiativesfor Conflict Prevention  which was drawn up at the G-8Foreign Ministers meeting in Miyazaki  over which Ipresided  embodies this idea of a culture ofprevention.On the issue of small arms and light weapons  inwhich Japan has been actively engaged  the G-8countries made clear for the first time that they will notauthorize the export of small arms if there is a clearrisk that these might be used for repression oraggression against another country. I hope thisachievement will lead to the success of next summer'sUnited Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in SmallArms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects. Moreover at Japan's initiative  a fund relating to small arms wasestablished at the United Nations this spring. Thepurpose of this fund is to extend assistance for thecollection of small arms and the reintegration of ex-combatants into civilian society.Under the G-8 Miyazaki Initiatives for ConflictPrevention  we will actively work to strengthen suchdevelopment assistance that contributes to preventingthe outbreak or recurrence of conflicts. For thispurpose  Japan will promote its collaboration with non-governmental organizations by  for example  providingassistance for their emergency humanitarian activitiesand dispatching joint study missions for emergencyrehabilitation.In recent years  United Nations peacekeepingoperations have had to be deployed more rapidly.Moreover  as the examples of Kosovo and East Timorhave shown  peacekeeping operations are now requiredto carry out diverse mandates that include humanitarianassistance  emergency rehabilitation and even civiladministration. To make possible the rapid andeffective deployment of such peacekeeping operations strengthening the Secretariat's functions as well asmore  quick-response cooperation on the part of theinternational community are all the more important.Japan welcomes the report and recommendations bythe Panel on United Nations Peace Operationsestablished at the initiative of the Secretary-General.The continued high toll in human life amongUnited Nations personnel taking part in peacekeepingoperations and humanitarian missions is a matter ofprofound concern. Recently there was an unforgivablemilitia attack on the local office of the United NationsHigh Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in WestTimor. Measures must be taken to ensure the safety ofUnited Nations personnel through close cooperationbetween the United Nations  the country concerned and its neighbouring countries.With regard to United Nations peace operations Japan intends to continue to do its best  includingpersonnel and financial contributions to peacekeepingoperations and assistance for emergency rehabilitation democratization and the establishment of legal15frameworks  as well as assistance to internationalorganizations.Poverty reduction is a high-priority issue for theleader of every country. Japan  consistently aware ofthe importance of this issue  has been providing moreaid than any country in the world for nine consecutiveyears  since 1991. Henceforth  considering what wouldbe most effective for the development of developingcountries  Japan will continue to make active efforts ondevelopment issues in cooperation with thosecountries. It accordingly intends to contribute towardsthe success of the high-level international andintergovernmental event on financing for developmentexpected to be held in 2001 under the aegis of theUnited Nations and others.Moreover  it is extremely valuable thatdeveloping countries that have achieved certain levelsof development put their own experience and know-how to use in providing assistance to other developingcountries. Japan  in collaboration with the UnitedNations and other organizations  will strengthen itsendeavours for South-South cooperation.Concerning Africa  where poverty is an especiallyserious issue  Japan twice hosted the TokyoInternational Conference on African Development(TICAD)  in 1993 and 1998. It intends to continue toactively cooperate for African development through theTICAD process. Bearing in mind the possibility of alsohosting a third such conference  Japan is consideringholding a ministerial-level meeting before the end offiscal year 2001  and would like to ask for thecooperation of the countries and organizationsconcerned.In April Japan hosted the second Japan-SouthPacific Forum summit meeting  at which it  togetherwith small island States burdened with geographicallydisadvantageous conditions  put forward a commonvision and a course for mid- and long-termcooperation. Moreover  this fall Japan will hold thefirst ministerial-level conference with the countries ofthe Caribbean Community (CARICOM). As for theissue of sustainable development in landlocked States it is Japan's policy to extend active cooperation for theimprovement and development of their transportationinfrastructure  and other matters.Regarding the debt problem of the heavilyindebted poor countries  Japan has decided tocontribute up to a total of $200 million to the TrustFund of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt(HIPC) Initiative of the World Bank. It will continue tomake its utmost efforts for the speedy and effectiveimplementation of the enhanced HIPC Initiative  forexample  by extending technical assistance to heavilyindebted poor countries as they prepare their poverty-reduction strategies.As we enter the twenty-first century we are facedwith various issues  such as conflicts  poverty refugees  human rights violations  health  crime terrorism and environmental degradation. Also we needto build communities in which the rights of women children and various vulnerable members of society areprotected  in which they can demonstrate their talents and in which all people can live together. In addressingsuch issues  it is increasingly important from theviewpoint of securing the existence  life and dignity ofeach individual to strengthen efforts that place humanbeings at the centre. This is the concept of humansecurity.I would like first of all to touch upon the issue ofinfectious diseases  which are not only a threat to thelife of the individual  but also a serious obstacle todevelopment and nation-building. Japan will extendassistance to the efforts of developing countries tocombat infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS  malariaand tuberculosis. It will also actively support theactivities of non-governmental organizations indeveloping countries working in this area.Moreover  Japan believes that the development ofa United Nations-centred legal framework forcombating transnational organized crime and terrorismis urgently required.Efforts to address global environmental issues arebecoming increasingly important from the viewpoint ofhuman security as well. Attaching greater importanceto development assistance that takes the environmentinto consideration  Japan has allocated approximately40 per cent of its official development assistance toenvironmental cooperation. The primary tasks at thismoment on the environmental agenda are the successof the sixth session of the Conference of the Parties tothe United Nations Framework Convention on ClimateChange and the entry into force no later than 2002 ofthe Kyoto Protocol on global warming issues.Concerning the Rio+10 event to be held in 2002 Japan believes that an agenda looking to the futureshould be set  taking into account the debates on the16effective implementation of many internationalenvironmental conventions  as well as globalizationand the technological innovations that have occurredsince the Earth Summit in 1992. Mapping out strategiesto implement more effectively the large number ofenvironmental conventions concluded in recent yearswill also be important. Japan strongly supports holdingthe Rio+10 conference in Asia and welcomesIndonesia's candidacy to host the conference.Further endeavours must be made to solve theproblems confronting women  children and variousvulnerable members of society. Japan highlyappreciates efforts made in this regard by the UnitedNations  including its convening in June of the specialsession of the General Assembly entitled Women2000: gender equality  development and peace for thetwenty-first century. Furthermore  Japan will host theSecond World Congress against Commercial SexualExploitation of Children  and will advance its effortsfor the protection of the rights of the child.I have touched upon only a limited part of theefforts focusing upon human security. Japan hascontributed more than 9 billion yen  well over $80million  to the human security fund that wasestablished at the United Nations last year  and in thenear future intends to make a further contribution ofapproximately 10 billion yen ó or roughly $100million  to this fund. The fund has borne fruit inassisting efforts particularly in such areas as post-conflict emergency assistance and reconstruction health and medical care  and basic education. Tofurther develop and deepen the concept of humansecurity and to study ways to strengthen efforts in thiscontext  Japan intends to establish an internationalcommittee on human security  with the participation ofleaders of opinion.As I have stated  issues requiring action by theinternational community are becoming ever morediverse and complex. We must urgently strengthen theUnited Nations system to enable it to deal with theseissues.First of all  this requires  as a matter of urgency that the Security Council be re-created as a body thatreflects the tremendous changes in the internationalcommunity. At the Millennium Summit held last weekthe representatives of approximately a hundredMember States referred to this issue in their speecheswithin the limited time. The Millennium Declaration expressing the determination to intensify our efforts toachieve a comprehensive reform of the SecurityCouncil  reflects the overall views of the heads of Stateand Government of Member States. In particular  thereis a need for reform that reflects the views ofdeveloping countries  which are playing an ever moreimportant role in the international community  and thatfosters the participation of those countries with thecapability to contribute to the solution of various issuesfacing the developing countries.I believe that both the representativeness andeffectiveness of the Security Council can be enhancedthrough an expansion of both the permanent and non-permanent membership  and the inclusion of bothdeveloping and developed countries in the newpermanent membership. Although we have alreadyspent seven years discussing reform  during whichrelevant aspects of the issue have been exhaustivelyexplored  we have yet to see the reform materialize.Even during the discussions  conflicts have broken out and poverty is worsening in various parts of the world.I would like to emphasize that the time has come toseek a convergence of views among Member States onthe concrete form of Security Council reform.Today the maintenance of international peace andsecurity requires action  not only in political andsecurity areas  but also in economic  social and variousother areas.When the reform of the Security Council isrealized  Japan would like to assume a greaterresponsibility as a permanent member of the Council mobilizing its capabilities and its experiences invarious areas  such as disarmament and non-proliferation  development and human security  andbased upon the ideas which I have discussed today.A prerequisite for the strengthening of UnitedNations functions is securing a sound financial base. Inaddition to streamlining as well as improving theefficiency and transparency of United Nations finances achieving a balance in financial burden-sharing isespecially important. Today's financial burden sharingcannot be considered to reflect the economic strengthof respective countries or their positions andresponsibilities within the United Nations. Japan wouldlike to appeal for its urgent revision. I strongly hopethat an agreement can be reached on a more equitablescale of assessments for the regular budget at thissession  as an important step towards the establishment17of a more stable financial base. Moreover  I hope thatthe substantive discussions for peacekeeping operationsbudgets  which are rapidly increasing  will also beconducted during this session and that a more equitablescale of assessments for these budgets can be agreed.As we welcome the twenty-first century  whilerespecting diversity  we must transcend the differencesthat arise out of our sense of belonging to an ethnic religious or cultural group. The foundation for theseendeavours is provided by international relationshipsbased on universal values common to all humankind such as democracy  human rights and freedom. TheUnited Nations must play a central role in our efforts toconstruct such international relationships.In order to achieve peace  we must engage indialogue with each other in a spirit of tolerance  andjoin hands in tackling various challenges. At the UnitedNations this year is designated the International Yearfor the Culture of Peace  and next year  2001  isdesignated the United Nations Year of Dialogueamong Civilizations. These designations and theimplementation of related substantive activities reflecta growing recognition of this idea.As globalization progresses and economy-oriented rationalism prevails  we should pay specialattention to the task of raising awareness of culturaldiversity  nurturing the special character of respectivecountries and regions  and preserving historical andcultural heritage. The United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) shouldplay a central role in this regard. Every country shouldrecognize the role of UNESCO  and join together inextending assistance to strengthen its activities.I believe that this Millennium Assembly  whichbegan with the Millennium Summit  should be anepochal starting point of meaningful progress in thetwenty-first century  both in consolidating our efforts totackle various challenges and in strengthening UnitedNations functions through Security Council andfinancial reform. Towards that end  I should like toconclude by underscoring once again the growingimportance of cooperation among all Member States."
"85",3654,"KAZ",55,2000,"The current politicaldebate is taking place against the background that isnot quite usual. This Hall just heard statements by theparticipants in the Millennium Summit. Unprecedentedround tables have just been conducted. The last severaldays have brought unusual hectic activity to the UnitedNations and the city that hosts the headquarters of ourOrganization.The most spectacular thing  however  is that theSummit has triggered an intellectual burst  anexplosion of collective thinking. Apparently  this hasbeen predetermined by a special quality of thisparticular moment in time  as we find ourselves at thethreshold not just of a new century  but of a newmillennium. Our acquisitive mind tries to look forwardas far as possible and aspires to see there  against allodds  a better future. Such is the predominant humantrait  to look forward with optimism.Our past experience  however  warns us againstexcessive euphoria and illusions. We realize that theworld is still full of threats  and our common impulse isto understand these threats and their causes and to findways to overcome them collectively.This is what I felt during the days I spent at theSummit. I am probably not the only one who thinks thesame way. But let us hope that the intellectual tidegenerated by the Summit will not just die down in thehumdrum of everyday life  but will force us to getdown to business in order to make our planet a safe andprosperous place.As we approach the new millennium  we surelywant to take a fresh look at the road we have travelledso far. At the threshold of a new century  we are in aposition to say that our most important achievement isthat the world has become freer. I believe that the keyword explaining the substance of the changes that aretaking place today should be the word renewal. By ourdefinition  it means an absolutely new era of relationsbetween nations  free of the vestiges of the past:pressure and diktat. It should be a triumph of theprinciple of genuine democracy and justice when allStates have equal rights and obligations  irrespective oftheir economic and political differences.The renewal of international relations should beguided by the understanding that we live now in aglobal and interdependent world whose overridingprinciple is global partnership. The United NationsSecretary-General has rightly proclaimed a three-pronged task: freedom from fear  freedom from wantand saving the human environment  precisely in thecontext of globalization. It is also true thatglobalization should not overshadow the problems andconcerns of the ordinary man. Our efforts will be futileif we do not address the issues we face today in thislogical sequence.Let me dwell on the three main components ofour common goal: making the world a safe  free andprosperous place.While recognizing that global security andstability increasingly depend on economic environmental and humanitarian aspects ofdevelopment  we should not belittle the importance ofthe military and political dimension of security. Afundamental issue of the elimination of weapons ofmass destruction continues to be a matter of ourcommon concern. International instruments in thisfield  first of all the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons  the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and the Chemical Weapons Conventionhave not yet gained universal support and  thus  cannotbe fully effective. The situation with regard to the Anti-12Ballistic Missile Treaty is also a cause for concern. Wecall on all countries to radically change this state ofaffairs and to support the Secretary-General's proposalto hold an international conference to find ways toavert the nuclear threat.Kazakhstan  having been the epicentre of cold-war nuclear confrontation and having resolutelyresisted the temptation to turn into a nuclear powerafter it gained independence  has every right to raisethis issue with vigour.As for Kazakhstan  it continues to contribute toefforts to ensure global security. Fully respecting itsobligations under the above-mentioned internationalinstruments  Kazakhstan has been consistentlypromoting its initiatives with regard to the Conferenceon Interaction and Confidence-building Measures inAsia (CICA) and the establishment of a nuclear-freezone in Central Asia. We are convinced that the CICAinitiative has a rational kernel  and we call on theUnited Nations and the Asian States to continue theirsupport of the CICA process in the interests of Asianand global security.We should be no less and  probably  moreconcerned by new threats: international terrorism extremism  illegal trafficking in arms and drugs  andorganized crime. Our newly independent State hascome into direct contact with these threats. We areseriously alarmed by the situation in Central Asia andview the conflict in Afghanistan  the bandit groups'infiltrations in Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan  and thesituation in Chechnya in Russia as links in one and thesame chain. Members have heard our neighbours -Uzbekistan  Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan - talking hereabout the same thing.I want to emphasize again that the way we see it the root of the evil is the prolonged war in Afghanistan and we urge the Security Council to seriously addressthe problem in that country on a long-term basis.Without addressing it  it would be naÔve to hope for theelimination of the threat to stability in our region and thus  in the whole world. At the same time  we believethat the key to the solution of the Afghan problem is inthe economic revival of Afghanistan. Our commonexperience points to the futility of palliative measuresand attempts to bring the conflicting sides to thenegotiation table without a clear economic plan. Thereshould be a comprehensive plan for the economicrehabilitation of Afghanistan which  together witheconomic measures  should incorporate the fightagainst the production of drugs  illegal arms trade terrorism and extremism  and should take into accountthe specificity of the ethnic and religious situation inAfghanistan. Of course  adequate financial resourcesshould bolster this comprehensive approach. The priceof peace and human life is worth it.I would like now to look at the threat to thestability in our region through the prism of the CaspianSea. The Caspian treasure-trove has turned now intothe centre of attention. The interests of many States not just of our region  converge there. The recentdiscovery in Kazakhstan's part of the Caspian Sea ofthe Kashagan oilfield  which is the largest one in thelast 30 years  with forecasted reserves of 7 billiontonnes of high-quality oil  confirms once again that thepotential of the Caspian Sea is enormous. It is ourgenuine desire and intention to see that this gift of Godserves the interests of peace and prosperity.Globalization involves a new level of interactionand interdependence of States. However  along with theobvious benefits  globalization entails the danger of alopsided distribution of these benefits  both at the inter-State and intra-State levels.A widening gap between developed anddeveloping countries is a burning issue. In fact  thisgap is getting bigger  and debates are underway as tothe forms of involvement of both groups of countries inthe processes of globalization  particularly from thepoint of view of the solution of the problems facing thedeveloping countries.The situation with regard to the future of theWorld Trade Organization (WTO) provides a goodexample of the differences in appraising theglobalization phenomenon. This organization  unitingsome 140 States  has become a trade and economiccounterpart of the United Nations. It should be said however  that the WTO has to be thoroughly reformedin order to really liberalize and democratize traderelations. It should not be a controlling and selectivelydiscriminating body of world trade policy.The Bretton Woods institutions also have to bereformed. We believe that the most important goals inreforming them are to ensure their openness anddemocratization  competence and adequacy and toimprove cooperation with the United Nations. We sharethe criticism of the International Monetary Fundregarding its arm-twisting policy when loans are13conditioned on many political factors that have nothingto do with the actual economic situation.In the context of the role of the Bretton Woodsinstitutions in the world  I would like to mention theissue of the integration into the world economy of theeconomies in transition. The role and importance ofthis group of countries  which includes my own  in theworld economy and politics will grow. I stress that it isimportant for Kazakhstan to continue constructivecooperation with the agencies of the United Nationsfamily  as well as with the Bretton Woods institutionsand other international organizations  in promotingeconomic reforms in my country.Kazakhstan continues to give priority attention tothe development of the transit transport system in theStates of Central Asia and in neighbouring developingcountries. We think it is important to actively pursuethe improvement of existing programmes and thedevelopment of new ones designed to raise theefficiency of the present transit system in Central Asia.Our landlocked country  and the region as a whole should have secure multiple access to the worldmarket. This is a matter of strengthening oursovereignty and independence.Environmental issues  particularly themanagement of transboundary water resources environmental pollution and the greenhouse effect long ago moved from the social and economic plane tothe political one  and have acquired truly globalsignificance. All countries face the problems ofprotecting the environment. Yet the effect on theenvironment experienced by developing countries andeconomies in transition is immeasurably much greater.Economic growth has increased the pressure on all thenatural resources of our planet. The problem of lack ofnatural resources and their depletion creates seriouseconomic problems and poverty. Economicdevelopment cannot stop. However  it should follow adifferent path. It should cease to destroy theenvironment so aggressively. It is because of theunderestimation of environmental factors thatKazakhstan today faces such ecological disasters asthose involving the Aral and Caspian Seas and theformer Semipalatinsk testing ground.There have been many cases in history of nationsand States being in conflict over the lack of drinkingwater and water for irrigation. Thousands andthousands of people have often had to pull up theirroots because of problems with water. Reducing thenumber of people without access to safe water is asvital today as ever. Kazakhstan calls for every countryto adopt  under bilateral and multilateral treaties legislative and administrative measures with regard totransboundary water resources and their management.The United Nations Economic Commission forEurope and the United Nations Economic and SocialCommission for Asia and the Pacific have devised ajoint Special Programme for the Economies of CentralAsia (SPECA)  which encompasses all priority issuesfacing the region: development of the transit transportcapacity and multiple pipeline systems; themanagement of energy and water resources;environmental protection; and technological growth.Such a comprehensive approach promotes betterregional cooperation in Central Asia and theintegration of its considerable potential into the worldeconomy. It serves common interests. We thereforeurge the international donor community to activelycontribute to the SPECA programmes and to promotethe economic and democratic growth of Kazakhstanand other newly independent States in Central Asia.The three-pronged goal of global development which I mentioned at the beginning of my statement would be unattainable without an effective commontool. Such a took we see in the United Nations  and weare convinced that there is no alternative to ourOrganization. But the next century and the new  highlycomplex tasks we face will demand a radically renewedOrganization free from the stereotypes of the past. Thismatter is in our hands. We should support the genuinedesire of the Secretary-General to drastically revampour Organization.We believe that it is important to start from thehead  that is  the Security Council. The debates onthat subject have gone on far too long. Shall wecontinue to mark time  or shall we take a responsiblecollective decision? We stand for the expansion of theSecurity Council  in both categories of membership  onthe basis of equitable geographic representation andrespect for the sovereign equality of all United NationsMember States. Kazakhstan supports the inclusion ofGermany and Japan  as well as major developingcountries of Asia  Africa and Latin America  aspermanent members of the Security Council  and alsosupports an increase in the number of non-permanentmembers.14We believe that the peacemaking capacity of theUnited Nations should also be strengthenedconsiderably  and we support the conclusions of thereport (A/55/305) by the Brahimi Panel. As forKazakhstan  it is forming peacekeeping forces throughits participation in the Central Asian battalion composed of three States of Central Asia  and throughthe creation of its own Kazakhstan battalion.There is no doubt that the financial capacity ofthe United Nations should be commensurate with thenew tasks that the Organization is asked to perform.All Member States should meet their financialobligations under the United Nations Charter. In spiteof its temporary economic difficulties  Kazakhstan isstriving to do just that and is taking practical steps inthat direction. As to the scale of assessments and itsmethodology  we have always believed  and continue tobelieve  that the main criterion should be a country'sreal capacity to pay.We have set ambitious tasks for ourselves. Arewe up to them? I am absolutely sure that we are  if wejoin our efforts. In fact  there is no other way. Such isthe imperative of a new era  such are the aspirations ofour nations.I thank the Assembly for its attention and wish itsuccess in its endeavour to build a safer and betterworld in the next century."
"86",3701,"KEN",55,2000,"Let me begin bycongratulating the President on behalf of my delegationon his unanimous election to lead the fifty-fifth regularsession of the General Assembly. I am confident thathis able leadership and vast diplomatic experience willsteer the business of this session of the GeneralAssembly to the desired outcome. I also wish toexpress my delegation’s gratitude to his predecessor Minister Theo-Ben Gurirab of Namibia  for the ablemanner in which he presided over the work of ourprevious session. I commend the Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  whose commitment in shaping theUnited Nations to meet the challenges of the newmillennium has won the respect and admiration ofmany. I particularly commend him for his selflessdedication to duty and encourage him to continueserving the international community with the samezeal.The proliferation of conflicts in Africa continuesto pose serious threats to peace  security and stability.Conflicts have had a negative impact on the continent’sdevelopment capacity and continue to undermineefforts to improve the living standards of our peoples.They have caused considerable destruction and loss oflives  generated millions of refugees and displacedpersons and exacerbated famine conditions in areassuch as the southern Sudan and the Horn of Africa.Africa recognizes the primary role of the UnitedNations in the maintenance of international peace andsecurity. It also recognizes the need for cooperationbetween the United Nations and regional organizationsin peacekeeping and peace-building. Such efforts haveyielded positive results in some countries. However there are others  such as the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo  where the United Nations has been slow toact.Positive regional initiatives have been recorded inthe cessation of armed hostilities between Ethiopia andEritrea  under the auspices of the Organization ofAfrican Unity (OAU). We commend the parties for thematurity they have demonstrated. We urge both partiesto the conflict to uphold the ceasefire while workingtowards a final negotiated settlement of that dispute.The United Nations is urged to speedily discharge itsduty along that common border.The establishment last month of a TransitionalNational Assembly and the election of the President ofthe Republic of Somalia was indeed a momentousoccasion. I pay tribute to President Ismail OmarGuelleh of Djibouti for his mediation efforts and hissteadfast commitment to the cause of peace in Somalia.I call upon the international community to continueproviding support and humanitarian assistance to theSomali nation. I also hope that the recently concludedaccord on Burundi will bring to an end the seven-year-old civil war and enable the people of that country toredirect their efforts towards reconstruction anddevelopment.The recent unfortunate experience in SierraLeone calls for a review of peacekeeping operations particularly with regard to the safety  commissioningand deployment of troops. Kenya supports the recentinitiative aimed at curbing the trade in illicit diamonds which fuels and sustains conflicts in Africa. Kenyawelcomes the decision by the Security Councilauthorizing the establishment of an internationalcriminal court to try those responsible for atrocitiescommitted in the civil war in Sierra Leone. It shouldsignal to the rebels there and elsewhere that theinternational community will not tolerate acts againsthumanity.Turning to disarmament and internationalsecurity  we are disappointed that the Conference onDisarmament for the second year running has notundertaken any substantive work. This situation isparticularly disturbing  since the Conference is the solemultilateral disarmament negotiating forum.The Conference has for a considerable period oftime been expected to conduct serious negotiations ona fissile material cut-off treaty and a treaty on nucleardisarmament. This Assembly has in various resolutionsurged the Conference on Disarmament to undertakesuch negotiations. During its fifty-fourth session  forinstance  the General Assembly passed four resolutionswhich  inter alia  called on the Conference to get downto serious work.The lack of progress at the Conference is due tothe reluctance of key nuclear-weapon States to submitthemselves to negotiate in good faith  despite theirobligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.We still expect the nuclear-weapon States to honourtheir commitment to undertake genuine nucleardisarmament  which they renewed during the 2000Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty. Failureof the Conference on Disarmament will send the wrongsignal to non-nuclear-weapon States and might wellencourage those with nuclear ambitions to join thatclub. After the end of the cold war  there is no longerany justification for maintaining nuclear arsenals  ifthere ever was one. Kenya calls on the nuclearcountries to preserve outer space as a nuclear-freezone.The serious security problem posed by theproliferation of illicit small arms and light weapons is amatter of grave concern to Kenya. We hosted in Marchthis year the Great Lakes Region and Horn of AfricaConference on the proliferation of illicit small armsand light weapons. The Conference  attended by 10States of the region  adopted the Nairobi Declaration which calls for greater cooperation and information-sharing between law enforcement and border controlofficials of States in our region  as well as thestrengthening and/or adoption of national laws andcontrol mechanisms governing civilian possession ofarms  and urges source countries to regulate weaponsand arms transactions through strict licensing. TheNairobi Conference was an important initiative. Kenyais in the process of organizing a follow-up meetinglater this year.In the same vein  I should like to express our fullsupport for the International Conference on the IllicitTrade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All ItsAspects  scheduled for 2001. We hope that thatConference will adequately address our concerns.A consequence of conflicts and the proliferationof illicit small arms and light weapons has been themassive movement of refugees across borders. Kenyacontinues to host a large number of such refugees. Thishas put a heavy strain on our own scarce nationalresources.I am happy to note that the Government of Kenyais in the process of finalizing the Refugee Bill 2000 inorder to address the refugee phenomenon. The Bill is aresult of joint efforts between the Government ofKenya  the United Nations High Commissioner forRefugees and other stakeholders. It will providerefugees with a better legal framework in which to liveand exercise their rights. Kenya would like to see anend to the disparity in the treatment of refugeesglobally. We have noted with concern the bewilderinginconsistency in the responses to the refugee problemsin other parts of the world compared with those inAfrica. We hope that in future the internationalcommunity will respond in a fair and consistent mannerto refugee crises in all parts of the world.The promotion of human rights and fundamentalfreedoms is firmly on the international agenda. InKenya the Government effort is geared towardsenhancing public awareness of existing rights andfreedoms. In this regard  the Government has prepareda bill seeking to establish an independent human rightscommission to monitor and protect human rights. Thatcommission would also advise the Government on itsinternational obligations on the protection andpromotion of human rights.During the last session of the Assembly Icommended the High Commissioner for Human Rightsfor adopting a proactive approach to human rightsissues. We continue to stress that human rights shouldbe addressed in a global context through a dialogue-based approach. In this way  we will realize wideracceptance and observance of human rights.The rise in transnational networks of crime narcotics  money laundering and terrorism is anothermatter of grave concern to us. The effects of theAugust 1998 terrorist bombing in Nairobi are stillevident in our economy and in the lives of Kenyans.We have undertaken measures to contain this menaceby establishing special policing units and strict controlof movement on border areas and other national entrypoints. We are also collaborating with internationalsecurity agencies  such as Interpol  and have signedextradition treaties with a number of States. We call forconcerted efforts to adopt effective internationalmeasures to eradicate the growing and dangerous linksbetween terrorist groups  drug traffickers and armedcriminal groups. The struggle against terrorism canonly succeed if there is cooperation between allcountries to track down and apprehend wantedterrorists.Kenya supports the initiative to restructure andrevitalize the United Nations in the economic  socialand related fields. We stress that the promotion ofdevelopment should remain a central priority of theOrganization.The process of reforming the Economic andSocial Council should be expedited by organizing itswork throughout the year and reinforcing its role inproviding overall policy guidance for operationaldevelopment programmes and funds.Kenya supports the implementation of policiesthat foster economic growth in developing countries inorder to bridge the widening gap between rich andpoor. My delegation urges the United Nations and theBretton Woods institutions to ensure the facilitation ofstronger and more equitable international multilateraldevelopment cooperation designed to address thegrowing problems in economic development.We are all aware of the challenging task oferadicating poverty consistent with the overallobjectives and strategies agreed in the CopenhagenDeclaration and the Programme of Action adopted atthe World Summit for Social Development and with theoutcome of the Millennium Summit. Kenya supportsand continues to implement the CopenhagenDeclaration and the Programme of Action. Thiscommitment is manifested in our Government’sdetermination to establish a firm policy andinstitutional framework for mainstreaming the povertyeradication agenda. The formulation of the NationalPoverty Eradication Plan is a step towards focusingnational policies and operational priorities on the poor as well as providing an enabling environment for themto participate in economic and social development.Further  the Government of Kenya has developedan interim poverty reduction strategy paper  which hasbeen prepared in consultation with all stakeholders.The strategy paper outlines measures designed toimprove economic performance  while identifying keyactions to reduce the prevalence of poverty.The above measures are part of the KenyaGovernment’s strategy to restore economic growthwhile maintaining economic stability. Economicreforms are gaining momentum and are expected tolead to a progressive increase in real per capita growth.Currently  the country is facing a severe drought  theworst in our country’s history. This is having adebilitating effect on our economy. We appreciate theassistance received so far from the internationalcommunity and seek continued support to deal with thesituation.Globalization poses enormous challenges todeveloping countries  and ours is no exception. Kenyawelcomes initiatives that protect the weaker Statesfrom the adverse effects of globalization. The ability ofAfrican countries to participate effectively  exercisetheir rights and meet their obligations in the WorldTrade Organization (WTO) is an important determinantin their integration into the international tradingsystem. My delegation is concerned about the growingprotectionism manifested in attempts to support a newround of multilateral trade negotiations within thecontext of the WTO. Kenya is firmly opposed to theintroduction of new protectionist barriers to tradecamouflaged as labour  health and environmentalstandards.At the same time  we urge the implementation ofspecial and differential provisions in respect ofdeveloping and least developed countries because oftheir low levels of industrialization and the vulnerablenature of their economies.The increased globalization of financial marketsand capital flows poses new challenges for themobilization of adequate resources. Kenya shares theconcerns of developing countries over the generaldecline in official development assistance and the freeflow of foreign direct investment to developingcountries. Portfolio investment  which tends to bevolatile and unpredictable  as experienced during the1997 financial crisis  is a source of financial instability.We support the creation of a new international financialarchitecture for a more stable financial system. Theglobal market environment poses enormous challenges and there is an urgent need for supportive internationalpolicies that will ensure the financial system’s efficientfunctioning.The slow progress in Africa’s attainment ofsustainable economic growth is linked to the failure tomobilize resources. This has been aggravated byinternal conflicts and the prevalence of diseases such asmalaria and the HIV/AIDS pandemic  which inthemselves have a causal relationship with poverty anddeprivation. My country  in collaboration withinternational agencies  is zealously pursuing scientificresearch to find a cure for malaria and the HIV/AIDSpandemic. We call upon the international community tosupport our research efforts to find a cure for thesediseases  which continue to ravage millions. Kenyawishes to stress the need to ensure the easy availabilityof existing drugs to those already afflicted.Given that information technologies are importantprerequisites for development  the developed countriesshould direct resources to accelerate the developmentof information technology in Africa. In this regard Kenya welcomes the Okinawa Charter initiative of theG-8 countries and looks forward to the implementationof its aims.My delegation notes the commitment made by theG-8 to speed up the pace of implementation of theenhanced Highly Indebted Poor Countries DebtInitiative  in line with the targets agreed at the CologneSummit. However  the initiative suffers from a lack ofcommitment to implementation and should be reviewedwith a view to being speeded up. We share theconcerns  expressed by the leaders from developingcountries who attended the Okinawa G-8 Summit  onthe impact of the debt burden to poverty alleviationefforts. Debt repayment in sub-Saharan Africa is to thedetriment of health  education and other essentialservices. Kenya urges creditor countries to honourpledges for debt relief and increase balance of paymentsupport to developing countries.Kenya attaches special importance to South-South cooperation. It is in recognition of the importantrole of economic cooperation among developingcountries that we continue actively to pursue economicintegration with countries in our own subregion. Therelationship between regional and subregionaleconomic groupings is seen within the framework ofthe African Economic Community  which Kenya fullysupports.The institutions established in 1945 are overduefor an overhaul. The world political  economic andsecurity landscape has changed  and so must theseinstitutions. The United Nations must become a trulyuniversal Organization  democratic and representativeof the many diverse interests. Its organs should reflectthis rich diversity  with effective representation andparticipation at all levels of decision-making. TheGeneral Assembly has to reassert its role within theOrganization. The Security Council must also reflectthe principle of equitable geographical representationand the realities of our times. Kenya seeks to havepermanent seats on the Security Council allotted forAfrica  to be filled by African countries on a rotationalbasis and on the same footing as existing permanentseats. The transformation of institutions dealing withother issues is equally overdue if we are to re-energizethe efficacy and effectiveness of the United Nations  ascalled for in the Millennium Declaration.Kenya appreciates the increased utilization of theUnited Nations Office at Nairobi. We are neverthelessdissatisfied with the level of involvement withenvironment and human settlement issues. There is ahuge  under-utilized capacity in the Nairobi offices. Itshould be noted also that the Nairobi Declarationadopted by Member States in February 1997 declaredthe United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)to be the principal body in the field of environment.Kenya is therefore totally opposed to the creation ofnew institutions with similar concerns and calls uponthe international community to strengthen the role ofUNEP and the United Nations Centre for HumanSettlements (Habitat) in Nairobi.In conclusion  Kenya fully embraces the spirit ofthe Millennium Declaration  with a pledge to make itsmodest contribution in the general service of a happierfamily of nations."
"87",3725,"KGZ",55,2000,"At the outset  Sir I take this opportunity to congratulate you on yourelection as President of this historic MillenniumAssembly and wish you every success in yourimportant mission. I also pay tribute to Mr. Gurirab forhis skilful leadership during the fifty-fourth session.My delegation welcomes Tuvalu as the newestMember of the United Nations.All of us were witnesses to the historicMillennium Summit  at which an unprecedentednumber of heads of State and Government gathered toaddress the issues of the future of humanity. Manyleaders reiterated that our future depends on ourcommon efforts for humanity's betterment  and that theUnited Nations has always been  and continues to be  aunique forum which  by virtue of its universalcharacter  has the mandate to solve the pressingproblems of peace  security and development.In this regard  the Kyrgyz Republic favoursincreasing the overall effectiveness of the UnitedNations and recognizes that the United Nations shouldbe a results-oriented Organization. Kyrgyzstan supportsmeasures aimed at transforming the United Nationsinto an Organization with a more perfect managementand a well-ordered structure  and thus better preparedto cope with both humanitarian and political crises.Emphasizing the importance of the UnitedNations as a global Organization of the humancommunity  Kyrgyzstan supports the universalcharacter of its reforms  which should include allbodies of the United Nations  including the SecurityCouncil. Confirming its position on the quantitativeexpansion of the Security Council in both categories the Kyrgyz Republic favours clear  geographicalrepresentation of the countries of Asia  Africa  LatinAmerica and the Caribbean.A decade ago Kyrgyzstan chose as its goal theestablishment of a democratic open society and aneconomy based on free market principles. Today wecan look back at our first 10 years with somesatisfaction. However  the invasions of internationalterrorists into the southern part of the Kyrgyz Republicin 1999 and August this year have shown that the newdemocracies are very fragile. These events also testifyto the fact that international terrorist organizations haveevery intention of perpetrating their criminal activitiesusing the territories of the States of Central Asia. Theseactions should be seen for what they are: part of theglobal plan of international terrorism  with the expresspurpose of destabilizing a wide region.No individual country can cope with thesechallenges on its own. It has become quite clear thatterrorism represents a threat to the whole globalcommunity  which can  and should  take adequatemeasures in the struggle with this evil. The struggleagainst terrorism should be conducted at the national regional and international levels.Kyrgyzstan has contributed to strengthening theglobal consensus on combating international terrorism.Furthermore  as of this year  Kyrgyzstan is a party tothree major international Conventions  and a Protocol against terrorism. Kyrgyzstan is currently working onbecoming a party to the International Convention forthe Suppression of Terrorist Bombings  adopted by theGeneral Assembly on 15 December 1997  and theInternational Convention for the Suppression of theFinancing of Terrorism  which was opened forsignature this year.An important step towards strengthening regionalsecurity is the Summit of the heads of State of themembers of the Shanghai Five  which is assuming adefinitive character. The Bishkek group has beencreated within the framework of the Shanghai forum.This group of law-enforcement bodies and specialservices of the member countries conducts work on thecoordination of our countries' actions in preventingand confronting all manifestations of internationalterrorism  extremism  separatism  the illegal drug trade the smuggling of weapons  illegal migration and otherkinds of criminal activity. The anti-terrorist centre ofthe Shanghai Five is currently being created  with itsheadquarters in Bishkek.The Bishkek meeting of the heads of State ofKyrgyzstan  Kazakhstan  Tajikistan and Uzbekistan andthe special envoy of the President of the RussianFederation  which was held on 20 August 2000 demonstrated the unanimous resolve of the countries ofCentral Asia and Russia jointly to eradicate the threatof terrorism in their territories. We believe that theefforts of our countries will be supported by theinternational community. The United Nations plays themost important role in this process. The Kyrgyz17Republic is taking action in favour of the creation of aninternational system of measures for controllingterrorism and other forms of extremism. In this regard we are considering with interest Uzbekistan's initiativeto establish an international counter-terrorism centrewithin the United Nations system.The efforts made by Kyrgyzstan and other Statesof Central Asia in the struggle against internationalterrorism  religious and political extremism and illegaldrug trafficking  will not be crowned with successwithout the normalization of the situation inAfghanistan. We express the hope that effectivemeasures for the radical improvement of conditions inAfghanistan will be undertaken. It is particularlyimportant to guarantee that such forms of commonactivity be further developed. Furthermore  expressingits sincere aspiration to promote the promptestablishment of peace in Afghanistan and stability inthe region as a whole  the Kyrgyz Republic confirms itsreadiness to make its territory available for the holdingof a peace conference on Afghanistan under theauspices of the United Nations.In its desire to make its own contribution to theefforts of the global community in creating a safe nuclear-free future  Kyrgyzstan is continuing to moveforward with its very active participation in thecreation in Central Asia of a nuclear-weapon-free zone.We welcome the assistance of the United Nations in therealization of this initiative. We express our hope thatthe countries of Central Asia will successfully finishthe work on the drafting of a treaty that responds to theinterests of the peoples of the region and of the entireinternational community.The issue of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treatycannot be avoided when speaking about world security.Signed in 1972  it became an important cornerstone ofstrategic stability. In this regard  we should reaffirmtoday its role in international security and our need tostrictly observe it and comply with all of its provisions.The Kyrgyz Republic aspires to make acontribution to United Nations peacekeepingoperations. Kyrgyzstan is currently represented in thepeacekeeping missions in Sierra Leone and Kosovo.My country is going further to make efforts to expandits contribution to the peacekeeping activities of theUnited Nations.For Kyrgyzstan  a country with an economy intransition  the most significant problems are those ofdevelopment. The key role in their resolution should beplayed by the United Nations Development Programme(UNDP)  as the main body of the United Nationsresponsible for coordinating the provision of assistancewith national development purposes. The KyrgyzRepublic welcomes the decisive steps taken by theUNDP Administrator aimed at structural reform andthe easing of the heavy financial burden  which canthreaten the realization of a number of national projectson democratic and economic reform.With regard to the problems of financing fordevelopment in the context of globalization andinterdependence  Kyrgyzstan draws particular attentionto financing for the eradication of poverty. TheSecretary-General's report (A/54/2000)  “We thepeoples: the role of the United Nations in the twenty-first century”  has identified poverty as one of the mainchallenges facing mankind. Shorn of all thesophisticated economic rhetoric  poverty reductionmeans simply the creation of new jobs and productiveactivities that will provide people not only with incomeand employment  but also with self-respect and hopefor their future and the future of their children. Specialmeasures should be taken by the internationalcommunity to assist developing countries and countrieswith economies in transition in their efforts to developand participate fully in the global economy.The establishment of a uniform transport systemis especially important for Central Asia  which islocated far from major sea routes. Kyrgyzstan isworking for the development and realization of large regionally important projects  such as the creation of auniform transport system with access to externalmarkets and of modern communication systems. Thiswill not only optimize the global transport system byreducing distances and transportation time  but alsoprovide a very powerful impetus for economicdevelopment because of the expansion of exports. Suchlarge projects as the transport corridor between Europe the Caucasus and Asia  known as TRACEKA  havealready begun to be developed and realized.We support those provisions of the Secretary-General's report that address the issue of the buildingof “digital bridges”. It is obvious that the huge progressin computer science and telecommunications hasradically changed the picture of the world. The18telecommunications “Silksat” project has beendeveloped for the purpose of preventing the threat ofinformation breakdown between countries. Its purposeis to facilitate the optimal entry of the countries of theGreat Silk Road into the global telecommunicationssystem.The Kyrgyz Republic  believing that stability hasnot only political and economic aspects  but also anenvironmental perspective  submitted to the Secretary-General this year its instruments of ratification andaccession to the following treaties concerningenvironmental issues: the United Nations FrameworkConvention on Climate Change; the Convention onLong-Range Transboundary Air Pollution; theRotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed ConsentProcedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals andPesticides in International Trade; and the ViennaConvention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer andthe Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete theOzone Layer.Today the Kyrgyz Parliament is working on theratification of the Kyoto Protocol  in support of theidea expressed by the Secretary-General in hismillennium report that“The need to preserve biodiversity is a lessself-evident conservation issue than pollutedbeaches  burning forests or expanding deserts.But it is as crucial  if not more so. “ (A/54/2000 para. 293)I would add mountain ecosystems to the Secretary-General's list of major ecosystem concerns. I take thisopportunity to express our deep gratitude to the globalcommunity for its support of Kyrgyzstan's initiativewith the adoption during the fifty-third session ofresolution 53/24  proclaiming 2002 the InternationalYear of Mountains. We express the hope that itsobservance will promote mobilization by theinternational community of economic  technical andfinancial resources for the sustainable development ofmountainous areas. To that end  the Kyrgyz Republicoffers to host in Kyrgyzstan in 2002  under the auspicesof the United Nations  of an international conferenceon mountains.In preparation for the International Year ofMountains  we call on States and internationalorganizations to give further attention to the problemsof preserving the natural balance of mountainousecosystems and the development of mountainouscountries and regions. We commend the Food andAgriculture Organization  the leading agency forpreparing for the Year  for its comprehensive conceptpaper on mountain issues and for its tireless efforts inthat field.Kyrgyzstan supports the initiative of the Republicof Tajikistan to proclaim 2003 the year of fresh water within the framework of the United Nations. We hopethat the global community will support it.Kyrgyzstan faces problems in dealing withnatural disasters and their regularly occurringconsequences  especially in mountainous regions. TheKyrgyz Republic has a direct interest in the furtherstrengthening of the international capacity to deal withaccidents  in advanced specialized technologies to copewith the consequences of accidents  and in increasingthe coordination of the rescue services of variouscountries.In conclusion  I assure the President that theKyrgyz delegation will take a most active part inachieving our overall common purpose: to ensure thesuccessful work of the Millennium Assembly."
"88",3768,"KHM",55,2000,"On behalf of thedelegation of the Kingdom of Cambodia  I amparticularly pleased to extend  through you  Mr. ActingPresident  my warmest congratulations on the occasionof the election of Mr. Harri Holkeri as President of thefifty-fifth session of the General Assembly of theUnited Nations. May I also convey my congratulationsto Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  President of the fifty-fourthsession  for his eminent leadership and successfulsteering of the work of that session. Equalcongratulations go to Secretary-General Kofi Annanfor his admirable and untiring efforts made on behalf ofpeace and development in the world. I would also liketo take this opportunity to welcome Tuvalu into theOrganization and to convey the sincere congratulationsof the Cambodian delegation. Tuvalu's presence amongus will add a new credit to our Organization.The political platform for economic development launched by the Royal Government of Cambodia sinceits formation in 1998  after many decades of civil warand tragedy  and in spite of enormous difficulties andobstacles  has scored good results with regular growth thus paving the way for a solid foundation for long-term economic growth and sustainable development inCambodia.The achievements of 1999  and of the first sixmonths of this year  are encouraging for the future ofCambodia. The Kingdom of Cambodia  with itsprofound belief that the value of democracy and humanrights should be in harmony with cultural peculiarities traditions  and level of development  considers humanrights to be one of the foundations of the system ofgovernment. The Royal Government of Cambodia  atpresent  is making great efforts towards thereinforcement of democratic pluralism and the rule oflaw.The recently held Millennium Summit on the roleof the United Nations in the twenty-first century has through its Millennium Declaration  defined greatguidelines on this universal institution's policies andreforms  designed to overcome problems facing ourplanet in the third millennium. The shared reflection ofour leaders is testimony to the aspirations of all peoplesthroughout the world for a more equitable internationalenvironment in the face of rapid globalization and itseffects on the economic  social and culturaldevelopment of all nations.On the question of the Security Council  theRoyal Government of Cambodia believes  as do manyMember States  that it is very important for theSecurity Council to reflect the reality of today's world.This can be achieved by expanding the permanent andnon-permanent membership of the Council to thedeveloping countries and to those countries that haveconcretely contributed to sharing the burden of UnitedNations operations. Only through overall reform andenlargement will the Security Council be able tomaintain its effectiveness and legitimacy in this newmillennium. In this regard  Cambodia strongly supportsJapan's and India's permanent membership in this corebody of the United Nations.The Kingdom of Cambodia observes with greatinterest the situation in the Middle East. We urge bothsides to make greater efforts in order to achieve lastingpeace in this suffering region. The Kingdom ofCambodia reaffirms its total support for a fair equitable  durable  and global settlement based on therelevant resolutions of the United Nations and on theapplication of the agreed-upon peace accords  so thatthe inalienable rights of the Palestinian people will berecognized by all.In spite of the consequences of the financial crisisin 1997 and 1998  Asia is on the road to recovery andAsia's economic growth has ever since been recorded.The thirty-third Association of Southeast AsianNations (ASEAN) Ministerial Meeting held this pastJuly in Bangkok bears witness once more to theexemplary solidarity between member States tointegrate their economies and to further advance theirmultiform cooperation.The Kingdom of Cambodia is very pleased withthe inter-Korean summit meeting in Pyongyang lastJune  which we consider as an important landmark inthe relationship between the two brotherly nations  andwhich has enormously contributed to the maintenanceof peace and stability in its region as well as in thewhole world and to the peaceful reunification of Korea.(spoke in French)25We are witnessing  today  the growingphenomenon of globalization. There are no States thatcan avoid its immense impact on our daily life.However  the process of globalization is not asufficient answer to the quest of the developingcountries to reach progress and development for betterliving conditions of their people. It is clear that theimpact of globalization benefits  primarily  Stateshaving strong economies and advanced technology while leaving the least developed countries with little if any  means to cope with such reality.The developing countries  especially the leastdeveloped countries  that cannot catch up withglobalization's speed will be left behind. The richcountries will get richer and more developed  and thepoor countries will get poorer and poorer.Therefore  the Royal Government of Cambodiacalls all Member States of the United Nations to unitetheir efforts and resources to make sure that thebenefits of globalization are expanded more equallyamong the international community and to maximizethe positive impact of this phenomenon in order toenable the least developed countries to follow the trendof globalization.Another aspect of finance for development is thecrushing burden of debt that weighs on the developingcountries. Debt places a heavy burden on thedevelopment process of many developing countries.Unfortunately  the debt strategies that have beenimplemented so far have not proved capable of solvingthis problem.The Royal Government of Cambodia appreciatesthe initiative taken by some nations in agreeing tosolve the intolerable debt burden of the least developedcountries. However  the results are currently far frombeing sufficient. That is why we appeal for theseinitiatives to be adopted by some other members of theinternational community  enabling more poor countriesto benefit from these human and just actions.Cambodia sincerely hopes that the MillenniumSummit  which has just successfully concluded  willbring about the imperative reform of the UnitedNations. The reform of this important world body willpositively respond to the reality of the world today  andwould be able  I hope  to establish a new mechanism tosave the developing countries from becoming victimsof globalization  even as other countries derive greaterand greater benefit.In this context  as the United Nations has beencalled upon by the Millennium Summit to play a moredecisive role in ensuring that the development ofnations is more equitable  it is necessary that this worldinstitution possess the means to support its actions.Also  it is an imperative requirement to establish a newmechanism of relations between the United Nationsand the international financial institution. Moreover  it is necessary to have a new order ofinternational relations in view of the rapid phenomenonof globalization  so as to reduce the ever-increasingunjust gap between the rich and poor countries. I amconvinced that this is not a matter of generosity  but amatter of human security  as well as the security of theentire international community."
"89",3813,"KNA",55,2000,"Thedelegation of Saint Kitts and Nevis congratulates you Sir  on your election to the presidency the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-fifth session. We pledge our fullsupport and our assistance in the work ahead. Permitme also to pay tribute to the work of your predecessor who took us through a challenging fifty-fourth session.As the new Foreign Minister of Saint Kitts andNevis  I am deeply honoured to be addressing theAssembly at this historic moment of increasingexpectations at the national level. At the same time  wesalute the dawn of this millennium with consternationin the face of the unprecedented challenges thatconfront us.The United Nations has matured in the past fivedecades  but we recognize that this is an institutionwhere maturity cannot be measured in days or decades.The maturity of which I speak should be measured bythe quality of our commitment and the depth of ourvision.The phenomenon of globalization has beencharacterized by growth in the level of trade  increasedflows of capital  and advanced technology. Althoughwe do not question this reality  we are cognizant of theinherent challenges and inequalities of globalizationresulting from our varied levels of development. Smallisland developing States such as Saint Kitts and Nevishave yet to access a significant share of the vauntedbenefits that globalization has brought in its wake. Wecontinue to bear a disproportionate share of its costswhile experiencing continuous marginalization due toour small size and to the volatility of financial flows.We urge the United Nations to influencedeveloped countries to improve market conditions forexports from small developing States  which are2especially vulnerable. We are inclined to ask thepertinent question: Why is globalization  with all itsinherent benefits  not improving the lot of the pooramong us?It is evident that globalization is creating newscenarios on our landscape; as these new situationsemerge  we must develop new strategies to remainrelevant. What is critical  therefore  is the need forincreased cooperation among Member States in ourefforts to secure our various interests.Saint Kitts and Nevis would like to stress theimperative of giving the United Nations the politicalimpetus necessary to address the inequalitiescharacterizing inter-State relations. This Organization with its tradition of democracy  should resolve theanomalies created by globalization. We welcome therecommendations of the Secretary-General intended toensure that this multifaceted phenomenon will work tothe advantage of small island developing States. Weintend to persevere in our efforts to adopt the requisitemacroeconomic policies. However  effectivegovernance and cooperation at the global level mustcomplement our democratic will and our political willat the national level.We should commit ourselves to strengthening theUnited Nations as the multilateral institution whichprovides a forum of inclusion. We shall also persist inour efforts to ensure the development of mechanismsand modalities to make possible equitable results. Inparticular  we urge the use of a vulnerability index tobe factored into any assessment of small island Statesby the United Nations and by internationaldevelopment and financial institutions.As for globalization and governance  Saint Kittsand Nevis is concerned by the recent action taken bythe financial action task force of the Organization forEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD)countries  which has sought to put pressure on thealready weakened economies of several CaribbeanStates  including Saint Kitts and Nevis. In recent times many of us  in our efforts to diversify our economies have undertaken to build a strong financial servicesector. But sadly  as I speak  my people findthemselves  along with the collective populations offour other Caribbean neighbours  assaulted throughnegative advisories.We urge the United Nations  through theSecretary-General  to impress upon OECD countriesthat unilateral attempts to effect multilateral solutionsin their own self-interest weaken the democratic fibreof international relations. We urge  therefore  that anydiscussion on the development strategies of countrieslarge or small must be raised to the level of inclusivediscussions or multilateral forums.We would like to emphasize that there is no harmin a competitive  well regulated  supervised financialservice sector. However  a unilateral challenge to thesovereign rights of States to implement legal taxregimes is an unwarranted attack on the integrity ofthose States. We believe that the development of thefinancial services sector holds valuable opportunitiesfor small developing countries. We understand also theneed for due diligence and for appropriate checks andbalances to frustrate and deter money laundering.The coupling of the financial services sector andmoney laundering without distinguishing between thetwo does grave injustice to a legitimate economicenterprise. Saint Kitts and Nevis is committed toensuring that no individual or entity abuses ourfinancial services sector for illicit purposes. To thatend  we have enacted legislation and have established afinancial intelligence unit. We will be vigilant and willcontinue to take the necessary steps to keep this sectorfree from abuse. Members can thus see that we areaware of the difference  and that we are committed toensuring that our jurisdiction complies withinternational standards.The convening earlier this year of the specialsession on the World Summit for Social Developmentallowed us to focus attention on the human face ofpoverty  which is overlooked by globalization. Whilewe  as developing countries  continue to adopt aproactive approach to our social development agenda the United Nations  through its specialized agencies should continue to support national poverty reductionprogrammes so as to promote favourable economic andfinancial opportunities for all young people.Saint Kitts and Nevis  therefore  regards ascritical the meeting on financing for development scheduled for the year 2001. We hope that it willprovide the appropriate opportunity to adopt measuresto strengthen the international financial system; thiscould ensure long-term access to resources andtechnical assistance.St. Kitts and Nevis welcomes the Secretary-General's initiative for the establishment of a disaster3response programme that would complement theresilience of our people to contribute to effective andtimely reconstruction efforts. However  the impactfrom man-made disasters is even more devastating. Thefrequent passage through our waters of shipments oftoxic and hazardous waste poses a serious threat to ourfragile ecosystems. We urge the United Nations toassume a greater role in mobilizing support within theinternational community to implement this policy. Wehave to take action to avert the threat of pollution fromship-generated waste  as well as accidental release ofhazardous and noxious substances.We regard the progress achieved in promotingwomen in development as vital to the global agenda ofhuman rights. Hence  St. Kitts and Nevis welcomed theconvening this year of the special session on the statusof women  which allowed Member States to review andassess the progress made since the Beijing Declarationand Plan of Action.My Government is currently implementing a newgender management system and has introducedmeasures to ensure that the national budget anddevelopment programmes are more gender sensitive.We are committed to strengthening and promoting themainstreaming of a gender perspective at all levels.There has been much debate about the criticalrole of information technology in bridging the globaldigital divide. We welcome the Secretary-General'sproposal for a United Nations Information TechnologyService  which could go a long way towards our effortsto sustain our future through capacity-building.In the Group of 77 Summit convened earlier thisyear  the developing countries committed tostrengthening South-South cooperation through thetransfer of knowledge and technology. St. Kitts andNevis intends to forge ahead on the information super-highway. My Government has embarked on aprogramme to make each child in St. Kitts and Neviscomputer literate by the year 2005. We encouragedeveloped countries to use the availability ofappropriate technologies  not only to generate wealthfor themselves but also to advance the economic andsocial well being of the citizens of the world. In thewords of Dr. Martin Luther King “Through our scientific genius we have made theworld a neighbourhood; now  through our moraland spiritual development  we must make it abrotherhood”.The plethora of issues on the United Nationsagenda is complex and involved. Indeed  thesechallenges sometimes even exceed the capacity ofindividual States. Therefore  we need to harness thecollaborative energies of States and non-State actors tocope with the fundamental changes in the world. ThisOrganization should be guided by the foresight ofPresident Truman who  in reference to the Charter stated “The Charter will be expanded and improved astime goes on. Changing world conditions willrequire readjustments”.Change is the only constant. St. Kitts and Nevisencourages Member States to recognize the importanceof change as we embrace the true concept ofdemocracy within the Security Council. Theundemocratic structure and lack of fairness within theSecurity Council threaten to undermine MemberStates' commitment and trust in the Organization.Even as we forge ahead into a new millennium we still are witnessing some of the most gruesomeforms of man's inhumanity. War and other inter-Stateconflict still litter the landscape of many societiesthroughout the world. We must continue to supportpeacekeeping operations to ensure that the rhetoric ofviolence is silenced. The concepts of peace-making andpeacekeeping must also be complemented by theimperatives of development. Once we have establishedpeace  we must also lay the foundation to supportlasting peace.We welcome and congratulate the State ofTuvalu  admitted at the opening of this fifty-fifthregular session. As a vulnerable small island Caribbeandeveloping State  St. Kitts and Nevis is pleased towelcome another vulnerable small State from thePacific  convinced that it is seized of its obligations touphold the principles of the Charter.In addition  St. Kitts and Nevis reiterates its callfor discussion of the Chinese people on Taiwan. Again we  emphasize that our policy seeks to promote respectfor the sovereignty of States. However  as we reflect onthe mission of this institution  we deem it appropriateto consider the invaluable contribution of the 23million Chinese people on Taiwan who can add greatsubstance to international discourse.This Millennium Assembly affords us theopportunity to reflect on the Secretary-General's4report  which focuses on the world's people and theUnited Nations role in ensuring their well-being.We welcome the importance attributed to peaceand security on the agenda of the United Nations andwelcome the proclamation of the year 2000 as theInternational Year for the Culture of Peace. We furtherapplaud the decision to declare the decade beginning in2001 as the International Decade for a Culture of Peaceand Non-violence for the Children of the World. Ourchildren are our future; the new millennium belongs tothem. It behooves us to dissipate the ominous cloudson the horizon of their dreams so they can awaken to aworld free of fear.The experts contend that there is an obviouscorrelation between the persistence of poverty and poorhealth.The statistical reports on HIV/AIDS paint asinister picture. Saint Kitts and Nevis is disturbed bythe rapid increase in the number of persons infectedwith the HIV/AIDS virus and its economic and socialconsequences for growth in developing countries. Thisdisease does not recognize national boundaries andthreatens to undermine future economic and socialdevelopment in many of our nations. We look forwardto a United Nations special session on HIV/AIDS tointensify and better coordinate our approaches at theinternational level.Despite all its shortcomings  the United Nationshas a critical role to play in the international system.Without the United Nations  many small States likeSaint Kitts and Nevis would lose a champion ofcollective interests. That is unacceptable. One of themost valuable gifts to humanity in the last millenniumhas been the United Nations. We must thereforecommit ourselves to preserving it."
"90",3839,"KOR",55,2000,"Itgives me great delight and honour to address theGeneral Assembly's first session of the newmillennium. I would like to begin by conveying mysincere congratulations to you  Sir  on your election tothe presidency of this historic session  the success ofwhich is ensured  I believe  by the experience andwisdom you bring to this noble work. I would also liketo pay tribute to your predecessor  His ExcellencyMr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  whose dedication andleadership enabled the fifty-fourth session to lay thegroundwork for the Millennium Assembly.I also take this opportunity to warmly welcomethe admission of Tuvalu to the United Nations.Two weeks ago world leaders  including myPresident  gathered in this very place to rally thepolitical will of the international community to meetthe challenges of the new millennium. Their meeting ofminds here in this Hall of peace  as summed up in theMillennium Declaration  reaffirmed the role of theUnited Nations as the embodiment of humankind'saspiration to greater peace and prosperity  to bestrengthened and fulfilled through the efforts of allMember States.It is only right that the new millennium shouldstart with the beginning of the end of the confrontationand conflicts handed down from the past era. Such astart has been made on the Korean peninsula with thefirst South-North Korean summit meeting in June. As aresult  inter-Korean relations have taken a definite turnfor the better. The whole world stands to benefit fromthe liquidation of the final legacy of the cold war thatthe summit appears to have set in motion on the Koreanpeninsula.During the June summit the two leaders engagedin an extensive discussion on peace on the Koreanpeninsula  South-North economic cooperation and thefuture of the Korean people. At the end  theyannounced a five-point joint declaration committingthe top leaders of the two sides to steering inter-Koreanrelations away from tension and enmity towardsreconciliation  peaceful coexistence and co-prosperityand eventual unification.The summit is being followed up with inter-Korean ministerial meetings to work out concrete stepsto implement the summit agreements. Some steps havealready been taken  such as the reopening of the liaisonoffices at the truce village of Panmunjom and severalsociocultural exchange programmes. Some are in themaking — the work to reconnect the railroad betweenthe two sides and the negotiation of the necessary legalinstruments for full-scale economic exchanges  such asagreements on investment guarantees  avoidance ofdouble taxation  settlement procedures and disputearbitration. The third ministerial round is to be heldlater this month on Cheju island of South Korea.In the latest development the two sides haveagreed on a return visit to the South by Chairman KimJong Il at an early date. Furthermore  in a key move fortension reduction  a South-North defence ministers'meeting is to be held on 25 and 26 September  also onCheju island.Each of these developments stirs the hearts andminds of the Korean people. But none would match theprofound emotions that were aroused in mid-August bythe exchange of visits in Seoul and Pyongyang byfamilies that have suffered the unprecedentedhumanitarian plight of remaining separated for half acentury. It was a limited exchange involving only 100individuals from each side  out of an estimated 105million members of families torn apart by the nationaldivision. But further exchanges are in the planning  asare more lasting solutions to their plight.As dramatic and hopeful as the June summit andthe inter-Korean developments since then have been only the first steps have been taken in the long processof ending the cold war and establishing a lasting peaceon the Korean peninsula. We sincerely seek the abidinginterest and support of the international community tosee us through. In this regard  I should like to expressmy Government's wholehearted appreciation of thestatement by the Co-Chairpersons of the MillenniumSummit welcoming the inter-Korean summit and thefollow-up measures.At the dawn of a new millennium the UnitedNations has yet to resolve the old problems of violentconflicts that are worsening in both scope and nature.In many parts of the world  countless lives continue tobe lost in armed conflicts  insurgencies and ethnicviolence at regional  subregional  and intra-nationallevels. We  as Member States  have to rally a strongerpolitical will to prevent a repetition of these tragediesthat have happened or are happening in Rwanda Kosovo  Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo.It is particularly deplorable that United Nationspersonnel in the field are under growing  violent attack.We urge all parties concerned to guarantee the safetyand security of the peacekeeping  humanitarian andother United Nations personnel. In this regard wewelcome the Brahimi report as providing a useful basisfor improving the effectiveness of the peacekeepingoperations activities with an adequate mandate andresources.My Government remains fully committed toUnited Nations peacekeeping missions. Last year  insupport of the democratic aspiration of a people  theRepublic of Korea sent an infantry battalion to EastTimor. Furthermore  with the economy regaining agrowth momentum  we are taking steps to fulfil ourpledge of an increase in our contribution to thepeacekeeping operations budget. This is an expressionof our firm belief that in the twenty-first century theUnited Nations should be better prepared and morewilling to fulfil its responsibility for internationalpeace and security.Many leaders at the Millennium Summit spoke ofthe double-edged nature of the globalizing world which brings unprecedented opportunities foreconomic growth on the one hand  while it furtherwidens the disparities between the developed anddeveloping countries  on the other. Aggravated by thedigital divide of the information age  the wealth gapcan become a source of unrest and instability in theworld.The Republic of Korea has actively taken on thechallenges of globalization. At home we have turnedthe recent economic crisis into an opportunity to gearup for the knowledge-based economy of the globalinformation age. We knew that we must emerge fromthe crisis not simply as we were before the crisis but ina new form fit to thrive in the age of informationindustries and borderless competition. Thus  boldreforms have been under way to rid the economy ofpast inefficiencies and to accelerate liberalization andmarket opening. Active Government assistance hasbeen rendered to small and medium-venture businessesin the information sector  as well as to educating thepeople in computer literacy.Government policies have combined with theintellectual vigour and adventurous spirit of the Koreanpeople to produce the world's fastest growing Internetpopulation   an estimated 20 million users by the endof the year out of a population of 43 million  almost 50per cent of our entire population. While activelypromoting the information age  we have also givenspecial attention and care to those pockets of societythat would fall further behind without help. Our effortsin this area have been built around the concept of“productive welfare”  which aims at enabling thesocially weak and enhancing the living standards of all.A key operative term is human resources development which offers training and education to all who arewilling to work.We believe that the same concept of enabling theweak to develop their capacities should be applied ininternational development assistance. Thus  on theoccasion of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation(APEC) Forum on Shared Prosperity and Harmony inSeoul in March this year  our President  Kim Dae-jung urged donors to support the developing countries intheir efforts to set up information centres which wouldprovide communities with access to the Internet andother conveniences of the information age. I am veryhappy that the proposal is entirely consistent with theSecretary-General's initiative on the United NationsInformation Technology Service (UNITeS). In addition 6my Government is increasing its assistance for humanresources development in the developing economiesthrough the dispatch of experts and invitations totrainees in the information and telecommunicationfields. In particular  in collaboration with the UnitedNations  we have offered training opportunities toexperts from African countries in export promotion.We will continue to strengthen cooperation with theUnited Nations to address the mounting challenges thatAfrica faces.Shared values and ideals make for the strongestof the bonds that enable nations to work togetherbeyond differences in history  ethnicity and socio-economic development. In this regard  the spread ofdemocracy and its values in the post-cold-war era hasgreatly enriched the grounds for the global communityto build a world of durable peace and prosperity and ofdignity for all human beings. While upholding humanrights and democratic values at home  democraciesshould cooperate to promote their universality in theglobal community. Thus  the Republic of Korea washappy to serve as a co-convenor for the firstinternational conference of the Community ofDemocracies in Warsaw last June  and we are honouredthat Korea will host the second internationalconference of the Community of Democracies inOctober 2002.Meanwhile  to strengthen democracy at home  myGovernment has continued the endeavour to improvehuman rights laws and practices. At present we are inthe process of enacting a comprehensive human rightslaw  which will give birth to a national human rightscommission. The commission will work to improveinstitutional arrangements for the promotion of humanrights and to raise public awareness. We are alsomaking significant progress in enhancing the rights ofwomen and children as well as workers. Particularlynoteworthy is the creation of the Ministry of Women due within this year  to advance gender equality.As the new millennium opens  the challengesfacing the United Nations are multifaceted and ever-diversifying. I have mentioned a few. There are manymore issues  such as disarmament and sustainabledevelopment  that are equally important. However  theresources of the global body remain limited. Ongoingreform is required to enable the United Nations to meetthe challenges with greater efficiency andeffectiveness. Thanks to the Secretary-General'sinitiative  considerable achievements have been madeto streamline the Organization  but there are still areaswhere creative input is called for. Security Councilreform is one of those areas. We believe thatrepresentativeness  transparency and effectiveness mustbe the guiding terms in the debate for a comprehensivereform of the Council.We do not need new concepts to describe thechallenges of the new millennium. They are still theproblems of peace and prosperity and the right ofhuman beings to live with dignity. However globalization has increased the intensity of theproblems as well as the chances for their resolution.Therefore  the role of the United Nations must also beconsolidated. The Government of the Republic ofKorea is prepared to play an active role commensuratewith its abilities to accomplish the common goals ofthe global community. I sincerely hope that this bodywill lead the way in putting the lofty spirit of theMillennium Declaration into action. In the process  mycountry  the Republic of Korea  heartened by theenhanced hope for its peaceful and prosperous future will play an active part."
"91",3885,"KWT",55,2000,"Onbehalf of the delegation of the State of Kuwait  it givesme pleasure to extend to you  Mr. President  warmcongratulations on your unanimous election asPresident of the fifty-fifth session of the UnitedNations General Assembly. We wish you success insteering the deliberations of this landmark session. Letme assure you of my delegation's commitment to workconstructively with you towards meeting the commongoals and aspirations of the international community.I wish to take this opportunity to pay tribute tothe remarkable efforts made and prudence shown byyour predecessor during his presidency of the lastsession of the Assembly.In the same vein  let me once again place onrecord our great admiration of and appreciation for thecrucial role played by the Secretary-General  Mr. KofiAnnan  since he assumed the helm at the UnitedNations. Mr. Annan has been working tirelessly toimprove the performance of the Organization's systemin the interest of global peace  security anddevelopment and to bring it more in line with theongoing transformations in international relations.On a membership note  let me now extend awarm welcome to the Republic of Tuvalu  which hasjoined our ranks as the newest Member of the UnitedNations. Tuvalu's admission to membership enhancesthe universal character of the Organization.Just a few days ago  United Nations Headquartershosted an unprecedented  historic gathering of a verylarge number of heads of State or Government  whocome together to renew their commitments to theCharter of the United Nations and to reiterate theirunwavering belief in the importance and relevance ofthe United Nations in developing a better world structured on the values of justice  equality coexistence and cooperation.The Millennium Summit was a momentousoccasion to review and appraise the achievements andfailures of the past. It was an occasion to sketch out avision to face the challenges of the future. TheDeclaration adopted by the Summit  together with therecommendations contained in the report of theSecretary-General on the role of the United Nations inthe twenty-first century  are a blueprint for addressingthe pressing problems and challenges that will confrontmankind in key areas. Chief among those dauntingchallenges that hamper the fulfilment of peoples'aspirations around the globe to achieve adequate levelsof freedom  dignity and peace are the arms race increasing national and racial conflicts  poverty ignorance  development  human rights abuses terrorism  environmental degradation and the spread oflethal infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS and malaria.The list can indeed go on ad infinitum. The effects anddangers of those problems cut across national bordersand transcend any artificial barriers. If anything  thisfact confirms the need for consolidated internationalefforts and a reinforced United Nations role system-wide.Here  we note with some measure of satisfactionthe ongoing attempts being made at the global level tocope with those problems. Numerous worldconferences and special sessions of the GeneralAssembly held in the last few years have facilitated theconclusion of several international agreements andtreaties covering a range of subjects. In those meetings it was reaffirmed that resolve would rid humanity ofthe risks of nuclear weapons and the alarming dangersposed to international peace and security by theirproliferation. In another important area  the BeijingDeclaration and the Platform for Action wereentrenched to enhance the status of women and toensure their full rights. The Copenhagen Summit  withits focus on universal human development  was also thesubject of a follow-up conference held recently.In that regard  the State of Kuwait takes pride inthe fact that the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme's Human Development Report 2000 statesthat Kuwait has maintained its rank of first amongArab countries  and number 36 in the world  in thefield of human development. Kuwait is nowdetermined to pursue its efforts to do even better in thefuture. A key component of our efforts is our12commitment to the implementation of the principlesand goals enshrined in the international conventionsand treaties covering human development and humanrights  and to employ them at the national level with aview to improving our economic and social conditions.Interaction between the Kuwaiti Government and theNational Assembly — which is the legislative authorityin Kuwait and the product of robust parliamentary anddemocratic life in our country — will certainlyaccelerate our efforts to fulfil the goals and aspirationsof the people of Kuwait.In the course of the decades that span the life ofthe United Nations  the Organization has established agood record of achievement and has proven itseffectiveness in the resolution of many disputes andconflicts. It has also helped to contain many problems.Thus  it is now really difficult to imagine a worldwithout the United Nations. The Millennium SummitDeclaration reaffirmed that the United Nations is thecommon house indispensable to the entire family ofnations. Having said that  and in view of the profoundtransformations in the world order and the attendantnew problems and challenges  it has become imperativeto continue to support and cooperate with theSecretary-General to reform the United Nations bodieswith a view to streamlining them in response to theglobal changes  thereby enabling them to respondbetter to the challenges of the future.In that regard  we reaffirm the need to pursueefforts to improve the procedures and working methodsof the Security Council. The goal is to make the workof the Council more transparent and to increase thenumber of permanent and non-permanent seats  with aview to expanding the base of the decision-makingprocess under controls that ensure equitablerepresentation to making an efficient contribution tothe Council's fulfilment of its functions andresponsibilities in terms of maintaining internationalpeace and security.At this juncture  we wish to underscore the needfor all Member States to pay their assessedcontributions in full and on time  both to the UnitedNations regular budget and to the peacekeepingoperations budget. It is indeed essential to provideadequate financial resources to the United Nations sothat it may carry out its mandates.Ten years have elapsed since the Iraqi invasion ofthe State of Kuwait. That invasion constituted a seriousprecedent in international relations because itrepresented a flagrant violation of the Charter of theUnited Nations and the norms and principles ofinternational law. Furthermore  that invasionundermined the security and stability of the Gulfregion. Kuwait now recalls with pride the firm standand resolve demonstrated by the internationalcommunity in condemning  confronting and defeatingthat aggression. All of that was distinctly illustrated ina quick series of resolutions adopted by the SecurityCouncil under Chapter VII of the Charter as of the veryfirst day of the invasion  on 2 August 1990. Thathistoric stand by the international community was aremarkable embodiment and consolidation of thesystem of collective security. It also ushered in a newinternational order and represented a clear and strongmessage to any Government or regime that mightpursue a policy of aggression with a view to territorialexpansion at the expense of others.The reverberations of the sinister Iraqi aggressionare still being felt by all of us today. The SecurityCouncil remains seized with the repercussions of thataggression. Since the invasion  the Council has had toadopt 54 resolutions and numerous presidentialstatements in response to the persistent procrastinationand equivocation of the Government of Iraq  which hasconstantly sought to evade its international obligations.Indeed  it is regrettable that for 10 years now theGovernment of Iraq has failed to meet its obligationsunder Security Council resolutions.The main requirements yet to be met under theresolutions of the Security Council relate to thequestion of Kuwaiti and third-country prisoners andhostages. This humanitarian issue illustrates thetragedy facing hundreds of families who continue togrieve over the unknown fate of their loved ones. Littleprogress  if any  has been made. Basically  we are stillat square one. Resolutions 686 (1991)  687 (1991) and1284 (1999)  which requested Iraq to unconditionallycooperate with the International Committee of the RedCross (ICRC) to account for prisoners and hostages remain unimplemented. In fact  since its boycott ofboth bodies in January 1999  the Government of Iraqhas continued to illustrate its disregard for thehumanitarian nature of this issue through its insistenceon not resuming its participation with the TripartiteCommission and its Technical Subcommittee.Furthermore  the Government of Iraq also insists onnon-cooperation with the high-level Coordinator 13Ambassador Yuli Vorontsov  who was appointed by theSecretary-General to facilitate the repatriation ofprisoners and hostages.Let me seize this occasion to reiterate our call tothe Iraqi Government to deal positively with thismatter  given its humanitarian  religious and moraldimensions. This issue must be resolved in accordancewith the relevant Security Council resolutions. Alongthe same lines  we demand that Iraq cooperate with thehigh-level Coordinator to complete the return of stolenproperty. This is also in accordance with the relevantSecurity Council resolutions. The most important ofthose assets include military hardware that has beenincorporated into Iraq's military system and theirreplaceable archives of the State of Kuwait  whichwere deemed by the Security Council as the “Statememory” of our country. The stubborn resistance byIraq to return these assets and documents betrays thenon-peaceful intentions still harboured by theGovernment of Iraq towards Kuwait.What is deeply regrettable is that the Governmentof Iraq has not only failed to meet the obligations weoutlined earlier  but that it has allegedly completed theelimination of its weapons of mass destruction while atthe same time not allowing  United Nations inspectorsto verify those claims. Iraq also claims to have fulfilledall its obligations under the relevant Security Councilresolutions. In its stance  Iraq stands isolated in theface of the United Nations  the internationalcommunity and the many regional organizations andgroupings that continue to call on Iraq to complete itsimplementation of Security Council resolutions.In his report on the work of the Organization thisyear  the Secretary-General put it succinctly andeloquently when he stated:“Iraq's lack of compliance with variousSecurity Council resolutions continues to be ofgrave concern.” (A/55/1  para. 54)In addition  the decision adopted by the lastministerial meeting of the Organization of the IslamicConference  held in Kuala Lumpur  Malaysia  last Juneconfirms beyond any doubt that there is indeed a singleunified international and regional position on the needfor Iraq to comply with Security Council resolutions.That decision demanded that the Government of Iraq among other things  continue its efforts to complete theimplementation of its commitments under SecurityCouncil resolutions in the interest of peace  securityand stability in the region. It also welcomed theadoption of Security Council resolution 1284 (1999)and invited Iraq to cooperate with the United NationsMonitoring  Verification and Inspection Commission(UNMOVIC) under the chairmanship of Mr. Hans Blixto implement the provisions of resolution 1284 (1999).That same decision further stressed that Iraq mustexpressly and clearly admit that its invasion andoccupation of the State of Kuwait was a breach of pan-Arab  Islamic and international treaties and laws; abreach of the Charter of the League of Arab States andthe Common Arab Defence Pact; the Charter of theOrganization of the Islamic Conference; and theCharter of the United Nations. The decision alsorenewed the Organization of the Islamic Conference'sinvitation to Iraq to take the necessary steps todemonstrate its peaceful intentions towards the State ofKuwait and other neighbouring countries  both inwords and deeds.Against this backdrop  we would like to knowwhere Iraq stands now vis-à-vis those resolutions andthe sincere calls made upon it by regional andinternational organizations. We note with regret thatthe Government of Iraq  for a good 10 years now  hasnot drawn the right lessons. It continues to reveal itsnon-peaceful intentions and policies of aggressiontowards the State of Kuwait and neighbouringcountries.The remarks made by the Iraqi President and theannouncements by several high-ranking Iraqi officialslast month  together with the unjust Iraqimisinformation campaign against Kuwait and theKingdom of Saudi Arabia  are perhaps the mostcompelling evidence that the Iraqi regime is stilldetermined to pursue a course of aggression and feelsno sense of remorse or contrition over its actions of 2August 1990. Therefore  Kuwait calls on theinternational community to maintain its pressure on theGovernment of Iraq  with a view to forcing it toimplement  all relevant Security Council resolutionsand to abandon its aggressive attitude  which seriouslyjeopardizes the security and stability of the State ofKuwait and of other States in the region.Kuwait  for its part  supports all efforts made bythe United Nations to alleviate the suffering of thebrotherly people of Iraq  with whom we fullysympathize. We therefore welcome the improvementsintroduced occasionally by the Security Councilsanctions Committee established by resolution 66114(1990) into the operational methods of thehumanitarian programme  with a view to facilitatingand expediting delivery of humanitarian materials tothe brotherly people of Iraq. We note with satisfactionthe report of the Secretary-General issued last week  inwhich he stated that the humanitarian programme hadsucceeded in providing a great measure of assistance tomeet the urgent humanitarian needs of Iraq in allsectors  despite the many obstacles and difficulties thatthe programme faces.At the regional level  in keeping with Kuwait'skeen interest in ensuring security and stability in theArabian Gulf region  and in view of the close relationsbetween the sister State of the United Arab Emiratesand the friendly State of the Islamic Republic of Iran we support the position of the States of the GulfCooperation Council (GCC) on the question of thethree Emirates islands. We hope that the efforts beingmade by the ad hoc GCC Tripartite MinisterialCommittee will prove successful in creating a bilateralnegotiating mechanism to resolve the current disputeover the islands in accordance with the norms andprinciples of international law and goodneighbourliness. If negotiations fail to bring about asolution  then the dispute should be referred to theInternational Court of Justice to resolve it in asatisfactory manner. This will help bolster themechanisms of reconciliation among the States of theregion and expand the channels of mutual interests andconfidence-building.In the same vein  we would like warmly towelcome the maritime border demarcation agreementbetween Kuwait and its sister the Kingdom of SaudiArabia. This accord reflects the depth of brotherlyrelations between our two countries. It also represents amodel of civilized cooperation in resolving borderdisputes and problems. With that outcome  we lookforward with interest to the forthcoming talks betweenKuwait and the friendly State of the Islamic Republicof Iran to complete the demarcation of maritimeborders between the two countries.We take this occasion to pay tribute to thewisdom shown by the leaders of the Kingdom of SaudiArabia and Yemen  which resulted in the signing of anagreement on the demarcation of the border betweenthe two countries. This will no doubt consolidate theunderpinnings of security and stability in the region.In the context of the relentless search for a just lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East Kuwait has been closely following the peace processsince its inception in Madrid in 1991. That process hastime and again experienced obstacles  risks anddeadlocks due to the unwillingness of the IsraeliGovernment to carry out the accords concluded withthe Palestinian National Authority within theframework of the peace process. Israel has so fardemonstrated its non-commitment to  and non-compliance with  the operational principles andframework of the peace process anchored chiefly inSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338(1973)  together with the principle of land for peace.Israeli intransigence aborted the success of therecent Camp David summit despite the immense andtireless efforts made by the United StatesAdministration. Here  Kuwait wishes to reiterate itscommitment to the Arab position of adherence to peaceas a strategic option. We also reaffirm our belief that acomprehensive and just peace will not be possiblewithout the full restoration to the Palestinian people oftheir legitimate rights  including the right of return ofthe Palestinian refugees  pursuant to paragraph 11 ofGeneral Assembly resolution 194 (III)  and theestablishment of their independent state on theirnational territory  with Jerusalem as its capital. We alsocall for the resumption of negotiations on the Syrian-Israeli track  with a view to achieving full Israeliwithdrawal from the occupied Syrian Arab Golan to theborder line of 4 June 1967.At this point  we wish to urge the active andeffective facilitators in the peace process  especiallythe United States of America  to redouble their effortsand to bring pressure to bear on the Israeli Governmentto convince it that the only viable path to easing itssecurity concerns is a return to the framework andprinciples established at the Madrid Conference  inorder to achieve a genuine peace that secures thereinstitution of lawful Arab rights to their legitimateowners.Still in the context of the Middle East  we wouldlike to express to our brothers in Lebanon — thePresident of the Republic  the Government and thepeople — our warm congratulations on the restorationof national sovereignty over their liberated land aftermore than 20 years of Israeli occupation  which left inits wake vast destruction in the regions of southernLebanon and western Bekaa. As a contribution to the15rehabilitation and reconstruction of southern Lebanonand with a sense of responsibility emanating from theclose brotherly bonds between Kuwait and Lebanon the Government of Kuwait has made a cash grant of$20 million and has requested the Kuwait Fund forEconomic Development to finance projects forrebuilding infrastructure in villages of the South.Kuwait will in the meantime continue its support forLebanese Government efforts to extend sovereigntyover all its national territory to safeguard Lebanon'sterritorial integrity and independence.Kuwait welcomes the positive developments atthe national reconciliation conference of Somalifactions that was held in Djibouti last month. We paytribute to the sustained and sincere efforts made by thePresident of Djibouti  His Excellency Mr. Ismail OmarGuelleh. We hope that the remaining factions will jointhe national reconciliation process in order to shore upthe unity and stability of Somalia  which  we hope  willeventually bring that country back into the fold ofArab  Islamic and international life. We take thisopportunity to stress Kuwait's support for the people ofSomalia in their efforts to rebuild State institutions andto reconstruct the country as a whole.Turning to the rest of Africa  Kuwait is followingwith deep sorrow the conflicts and civil wars that havelong afflicted a number of countries. These conflictsimperil the peace and stability of many nations anddeplete their potentials  capabilities and resources.Even though the problems of Africa have come to be afocus of the global agenda  and even though the UnitedNations system has embarked on in-depth discussionand analysis of the root causes of those problems  theproposed solutions remain blueprints awaitingimplementation. The net result is that the continentcontinues to be plagued by bitter conflicts and painfulpolitical instability  which aggravate already intractableeconomic and social problems  foremost among themforeign debt  poverty  illiteracy and the spread ofcontagious diseases  such as HIV/AIDS and malaria which afflict millions of people and claim the lives ofhundreds of thousands of innocent victims every year.It is very sad indeed that many countries in Africaare suffering from these problems at a time when themodern world has made enormous progress in all areasof human activity. We therefore urge the internationalcommunity to pursue its efforts more vigorously tohelp bring peace and security to African nations and toassist them in meeting their economic and socialdevelopment goals. A vital role can be played by theinternational aid agencies and financial institutions which we hope will redouble their outreach efforts toovercome Africa's daunting problems and challenges.Kuwait believes that any such donor drive will not beeffective unless and until African peoples andGovernments themselves shoulder their responsibilitiesand dedicate their full energies to lifting themselves upout of their current misery and onto the path ofmainstream modern progress. Another key factor inthis process is the need to resolve disputes by peacefulmeans in order to create a climate of security andstability and to preserve sorely needed economicresources.The world today is witnessing the emergence ofseveral promising economic phenomena created by theimmense information and technology revolution that issweeping the communication and trade sectors. Ofparticular significance is the formation of numerousinternational and regional economic blocs that areseeking to remove customs restrictions and to liberatetrade among nations. In response  many developingcountries have made drastic changes in their economicand administrative structures in order to alignthemselves with those transformations and to putthemselves in an advantageous position with respect toeconomic globalization in the hope of achieving bettereconomic growth and progress.Kuwait thinks that the phenomenon ofglobalization  notwithstanding its merits  could have anadverse impact on the economies of developingcountries unless the very basis of North-Southeconomic relations is restructured in line with thetenets of mutual benefit  common interest  the need tonarrow the technology gap  and the removal ofobstacles that impede the access of the products ofdeveloping nations to the markets of the developedindustrialized countries in the interest of both groups.In the meantime  developed countries should provideadequate economic assistance to developing nations tohelp them strengthen their infrastructures and build uptheir economies on a sound and solid foundation.In this context  Kuwait has never shrunk fromdoing its fair share to meet all its international andregional obligations towards the developing countries.Our assistance is channelled through international aidagencies and institutions as well as through the KuwaitFund for Economic Development. That fund hasprovided loans and financial grants for many16development projects and programmes in scores ofdeveloping countries. More than 96 countries on allcontinents have benefited from these loans and grants.Within its means  Kuwait will remain committed tohelping the development efforts of developingcountries  because of our belief that overalldevelopment and broader participation and cooperationare essential for ensuring security and stability for allcountries of the world.We remain hopeful at the outset of a new centurythat the nations of the world will close ranks to fulfilthe noble principles and purposes of the United NationsCharter. We also hope that the Millennium Declarationwill be translated into a tangible reality that fulfils theaspirations and the vision of peoples yearning to live ina climate of security  peace  freedom and justice  and ina world where the enormous power of science andtechnology will be harnessed to serve humandevelopment in all spheres of life and to enrich humancivilization.Let us make partnership and cooperation to builda better tomorrow for our children our guiding motto inthe new century. Let us pledge ourselves to bequeath tothe generations of the coming century the assurancethat we have kept our faith to them  and that we havesown for them the seeds of goodness that will yield abetter life."
"92",3931,"LAO",55,2000,"At the outset  I would like  on behalfof the delegation of the Lao People's DemocraticRepublic  to congratulate you  Sir  on your well-deserved election to the presidency of the fifty-fifthsession of the General Assembly. We are confident thatour Assembly stands to gain a great deal from yourable leadership and from your wide knowledge ofinternational affairs.Let me also take this opportunity to congratulatethe outgoing President  Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab Minister for Foreign Affairs of Namibia  for theguidance he provided to the fifty-fourth session of theGeneral Assembly.The twentieth century has been an epoch of greattechnological and scientific discoveries andachievements. This is indeed one of the positive thingsabout the past century that we all can be proud of.However  this same past century has brought enormouscalamities and left manifold complex problems as weenter the twenty-first century.Certainly  we have to accept the responsibility forresolving them and in order to succeed in addressingthis daunting task  we must lay down sound basicfoundations aimed at encouraging and building peaceand international cooperation for development. This isthe lofty goal of our new age that we should all striveto achieve.In preparation for the new millennium  a numberof international conferences were held on differentissues under the auspices of the United Nations  suchas the World Summit for Children in New York  theEarth Summit in Rio  the World Social Summit inCopenhagen  the World Conference on Women inBeijing  UNCTAD X in Bangkok and otherinternational conferences of equal importance. Themain objectives of those assemblies were to solve themultifaceted problems that have occurred in the world with the hope that the new millennium will faceminimal risk in every area and that humankind willconcentrate its intelligence and resources ondeveloping the economy  civilized culture andprosperity in equality  in a just and peacefulenvironment free from violent confrontation  withconcern for poverty  disease and others. However  theobjectives set forth by these conferences have not livedup to our expectations. In addition  new challenges thatare far more complex have erupted in the light ofglobalization.The South Summit of the Group of 77 and China which was held in Havana in April this year  rightlyidentified the positive and negative sides ofglobalization and put forward a collective guideline forfuture action. The conference was of the view that theunsolved problems are the well-known issues of thegrowing debt  the unfavourable world trade measuresimposed on goods from the developing countries  inparticular  the least developed ones  as well ashuman resources that have not yet been developed tocope with new technologies and others. Overall  allthese issues need to be seriously dealt with togetherbetween the North and the South  so as to meet thechallenges and make use of favourable opportunitiesthat will lead to a North-South cooperation based onequality and mutual interest  as explicitly expressed inthe Havana Declaration.The achievements of humankind in the pastcentury are of immense value. We believe that  if theseachievements are correctly used  happiness andprosperity will be brought to the new generation of thenext century. Nonetheless  we are still yet concernedover the challenges that the new generation has to face.Today many young girls and boys worldwide have notenjoyed happy lives and lacked opportunity foreducation. Moreover  they are subject to exploitation6for the purpose of pornography  prostitution and drugaddiction  that destroy their own future  their families the society and  subsequently  becomes the source ofinternational terrorism.Similarly  the gender issue is also of greatimportance. Although equality between women andmen is respected and women's participation in sociallife has increased  poverty and violence continue to bethe major obstacles that affect women's life. Tosuccessfully tackle this problem  countries around theworld should help each other and devote the necessaryresources to this domain.Drug abuse continues to be a subject of majorconcern for the international community. In the LaoPeople's Democratic Republic  the Lao Governmenthas implemented  with the cooperation and assistanceof friendly countries and international organizations in particular the United Nations International DrugControl Programme  a number of projects with aview to remedying the effects of drug abuse.Experience has shown that people involved in poppycultivation continue to remain poor. Therefore  in orderto definitely solve this problem  it is imperative tocarry out alternative development projects  ensure foodsecurity  enable people to earn more by cultivatingcrops other than poppies  as well as traditionalcultivation. The Lao Government is determined tocontinue its efforts in drug control and supervision. Itis our hope that the international community will lend astrong helping hand in order to help us to overcome ourdifficulties as soon as possible for the bright future ofour children.While the world is entering the new millennium a number of regional conflicts have been satisfactorilysettled  thus responding to the aspirations of theaffected nations. However  at the same time  manyother regional conflicts remain unsolved and continueto cause pain and suffering to the people directlyinvolved.In the Middle East  durable peace has not beenensured: the inalienable national and fundamentalrights of the Palestinian people have not yet beenexercised. We welcome the resumption of peacenegotiations between Israel and the PalestineLiberation Organization. The two parties should seizethis opportunity to write a new page of history basedon peaceful coexistence and economic cooperationamong the peoples in the region. In this perspective we look forward to seeing the establishment of anindependent Palestinian State and of respect for anexistence of all States in the region  thus ensuringdurable peace and cooperation between the nations  inparticular between the Arab States and Israel.The economic  commercial and financial embargoapplied against the Republic of Cuba continues tocause enormous difficulties and damage to the Cubanpeople. In compliance with the relevant resolutions ofthe General Assembly  we urge that an end be put tothis restrictive commercial practice  which runs counterto the principles of the Charter  international law andthe present world trend.The Lao People's Democratic Republic isfollowing closely the situation in the Korean peninsula.We welcome the outcome of the Korean Summitbetween Chairman Kim Jong 11 of the NationalDefense Commission of the Democratic People'sRepublic of Korea and President Kim Dae Jung of theRepublic of Korea  who met in Pyongyang last Juneand laid down an important foundation in response tothe aspirations of the Korean people for the peacefulreunification of Korea and the settlement of theproblems in the Korean peninsula through peacefulnegotiations  which contributed thereby to thepromotion of peace  stability and cooperation in theregion.On 2 December 2000  the Lao People'sDemocratic Republic will commemorate its twenty-fifth anniversary. Over this period  the Lao people haveupheld the spirit of patriotism  self-sufficiency  andstrength and have attracted assistance and cooperationfrom the international community. They have madetremendous accomplishments in national construction.As a result  their living standard has graduallyimproved. The most outstanding achievement  attainedfor the first time in the country's history  is that wehave reached self-sufficiency in rice production andeven have a surplus for export. The socio-economicinfrastructure has been continuously expanded  theState is governed by the rule of law and freedom anddemocracy are respected and constantly promoted. Thesolidarity of the Lao people of all ethnic groups hasbeen further strengthened. These are all fundamentalfactors in ensuring political stability and social order.Thanks to the policy of renewal consistent with themechanisms of the market economy  the developmentof the people's right to self-determination and an open-door policy in our international relations  we are7convinced that the Lao People's Democratic Republicwill be able to emerge from underdevelopment in thenear future.Globalization has had an uneven impact on thedevelopment of every country  because each nation isat a different stage in the development process. Whilesome developing economies are making use of theincreasing economic opportunities  a large number ofdeveloping countries continue to be marginalized andare therefore not in a position to benefit from thisprocess. Most countries in the developing worldcontinue to face problems of access to markets  capitaland technology. Many are obliged to undertake painfulstructural reforms that are not compatible with theirrealities and have an undesirable negative impact thatimpedes their integration into the world economy.Against this backdrop  there is a need to build afavourable environment that would enable thedeveloping countries to compete in the world tradingsystem and to fully benefit from globalization. TheUnited Nations has a crucial role to play in helping tomake this happen.As we bid farewell to the twentieth century humanity is still yearning for a world of peace  a worldfree from want and misery  a world governed byinternational relations based on respect for the nationalsovereignty of States  cooperation for development andpeaceful coexistence between peoples. Theinternational community is therefore duty-bound toincrease its cooperation in all possible areas so as toensure that the objectives of the United NationsSummit Declaration are achieved and to bring benefitsto peoples throughout the world  as well as guaranteesto new generations of a better life and a moreprosperous future. In this spirit  I wish the presentsession great success."
"93",3974,"LBN",55,2000,"Itgives me pleasure  Sir  to congratulate you on yourelection as President of the General Assembly at itsfifty-fifth session. I am confident that your vastexperience and unswerving efforts will guarantee theachievement of the best results at this session.I would also like to thank your predecessor  Mr.Theo-Ben Gurirab  Minister for Foreign Affairs of theRepublic of Namibia  for having wisely andsuccessfully conducted the deliberations of the fifty-fourth session. I would be remiss if I failed to expressto the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  our thanksand appreciation for his efforts to preserve theprinciples and purposes of the Charter with a view toconsolidating the prospects for peace and stabilityaround the world.A new century has been ushered in. Our peoplesand countries believe in the United Nations and in itsability to embrace new visions and concepts. We havehigh hopes that a reinvigorated Organization willpromote a new world order forged  in essence  by thenew forces at play. This will be a world order free fromthe new power play in order to consolidate theprospects for international peace and security indifferent parts of the globe and to meet the costs ofdevelopment  which is the right of each and everyindividual. This can only be accomplished if wesucceed in reactivating the central role of the UnitedNations. The primary organs of the Organization namely  the Security Council and the Economic andSocial Council  must be entrusted with containing andchecking the dangers that face humanity and thatthreaten its social and economic peace as well as itssecurity.2I am pleased to announce that  towards the end ofnext year  Lebanon will host the summit of theInternational Organization of La Francophonie to beheld in the context of the Dialogue amongCivilizations. Lebanon's experience in coexistence  itspluralistic nature and its openness to the world are  inour view  the best expression of such a dialogue.We all agree that the United Nations is anindispensable international institution  notwithstandingits inability to settle many disputes since its inception.The United Nations has at times been lax in enforcingits own resolutions  and at others it has been influencedby the international balance of power  which made itblind to the double standards at play. But what isindisputable is that the United Nations  with itsmandates and its multifaceted world activities constitutes a major human achievement and tradition.We must build upon this achievement by evincing thenecessary will to lead the world towards reconciliationwhilst maintaining the necessary balance between thecollective interests of States  large and small.Our actions must be based on the principles ofsolidarity  equality and justice enshrined in the Charter.This is of particular importance at this crucial juncturein our human existence. While vast regions of theworld are plagued by poverty  deprivation and disease others are enjoying a social and economic boom rarelymatched in the history of mankind. It is thereforeimportant to jump start the different United Nationsorgans and specialized agencies  which have alreadyimpressed us with daily records of achievement thatstand as a true measure of our collective spirit ofsolidarity . This solidarity must be the cornerstone of anew humanitarian world order capable of protecting theindividual and of respecting all aspects of his rights.In this context  we highly value the steps taken torestructure some of the development organs of theOrganization. Such steps have introduced into theirwork programmes the concept of cooperation with theinstitutions of civil society and with internationalfinancial institutions  the private sector and the donorcommunity.In the second half of May this year  Lebanon andthe United Nations witnessed a historic event when mycountry recovered most of its occupied territories in thesouth and in western Bekaa. Thanks to the resistanceand steadfastness of the Lebanese people and thesupport of the international community  Israel had towithdraw from these territories after a ferociousoccupation that lasted more than 22 years. It left behinda trail of devastation and destruction of infrastructure private property and the environment  as well as acollapse in local production centres. Lebanon has paiddearly for its liberation. Thousands fell as martyrs onthe road to victory and thousands more were injured ordisabled.Human and material losses were not confined tothe areas that were immediately under occupation. For30 years  the Israeli arm of aggression has stretched farto reach all Lebanese territories. Repeated Israelistrikes terrorized our civilian population  destroyedcivilian and vital establishments and wreaked havoc onour economic and service sectors. The Israeliwithdrawal came in the wake of 22 years of continuedrefusal to comply with Security Council resolutions425 (1978) and 426 (1978)  which called upon Israel towithdraw immediately and unconditionally fromSouthern Lebanon and the western Bekaa to theinternationally recognized borders  with strict respectfor the territorial integrity  sovereignty and politicalindependence of Lebanon.For the first time since 1978  the United NationsInterim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) was allowed tofulfil its mandate under resolution 425 (1978). To dothis  the United Nations had to identify a line for thepurpose of confirming the Israeli withdrawal.Regrettably  in three locations  this line did notconform to the internationally recognized boundaryline demarcated in 1923 between Palestine andLebanon under the French and British Mandates. TheUnited Nations border line also leaves the Shabaafarmlands outside UNIFIL's area of operation inSouthern Lebanon.Lebanon has seriously cooperated with the UnitedNations to fulfil the requirements for theimplementation of Security Council resolution 425(1978). Despite Israel's repeated violations of thewithdrawal line and its obstructive practices  whichhindered the deployment of the international workforce for weeks  the force was at long last able todeploy  accompanied by the Lebanese armed forces.At this juncture  I see it fit to recall Lebanon'scivilized stance and the wisdom and tolerancegraciously shown by its valiant people after its victoryand the withdrawal of the Israeli forces. Contrary todire predictions  no mayhem or acts of vengeance3ensued. This has earned us the appreciation andadmiration of the international community.On this occasion  allow me to pay tribute to theSecretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. KofiAnnan  to his assistants and to the officers and soldiersof UNIFIL for the tireless and unswerving efforts theyhave been making in fulfilment of their noble task andin compliance with the resolutions of internationallegitimacy.In this context  I would like to underline theimportance of the following points. First  Lebanoninsists that its internationally recognized bordersremain intact. They are the borders demarcated inaccordance with the 1923 Paulet-Newcomb maps  andreaffirmed later in the 1949 Israeli-Lebanese GeneralArmistice Agreement. Second  Lebanon confirms itsreservations on three locations on the blue line ofwithdrawal adopted by the United Nations as thewithdrawal line. This reservation is included in thereport submitted by the Secretary-General to theSecurity Council on 16 June 2000.Third  Lebanon insists on its right to sovereigntyover the Shaba'a farmlands  which are an integral partof Lebanese territories. Fourth  Lebanon insists on itssovereignty and authority over the locations set by theUnited Nations inside the United NationsDisengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) line in theMount Hermon area.Fifth  Lebanon demands the immediate release ofall Lebanese detainees from Israeli prisons. They arekept as hostages in violation of the terms of the 1949Fourth Geneva Convention  of the relevant Protocolsand of the Hague Convention of 1907. Lebanonbelieves that the release of the detainees will be acompletion of the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon andwill therefore be a fulfilment of Security Councilresolution 425 (1978).Sixth  the liberation of Lebanese territories fromIsraeli occupation shall remain compromised unless ajust solution is found to the problem of Palestinianrefugees residing in Lebanon. The solution lies inallowing these refugees to return to their homeland  asprovided for in the resolutions of internationallegitimacy.Israel must compensate Lebanon for the human material and economic losses sustained as a result ofIsraeli occupation and other acts of aggression  inaccordance with international and customary laws andwith the principles of the United Nations Charter. Inthis regard  we recall Security Council resolution 262(1968)  which entitled Lebanon to appropriate redressfor the enormous destruction it suffered when Israelattacked Beirut's International Airport in late 1968. Inthat attack  Israel destroyed 13 civilian Lebaneseaircraft. The Lebanese firmly believe in their right toreceive adequate and fair reparations for the substantialloss and devastation inflicted upon them after manylong years of occupation and repeated acts ofaggression. Those acts have been perpetrated by Israelsince 1978 in stark defiance of the will of the UnitedNations.Lebanon will therefore resort to the InternationalCourt of Justice (ICJ)  which is the proper organ towhich to address its claims. We hope that the ICJ willbe able to endorse our request for adequate reparationsand we appeal to the international community tosupport our just and fair demands.The question of the reconstruction andrehabilitation of the Lebanese liberated territoriesenjoys a high priority on the Lebanese agenda. It alsoenjoys tangible international support. In this context  Iwould like to recall the preparatory meeting of thedonor community  held in Beirut on 27 July incooperation with the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme (UNDP) and the support of the World Bankand the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan. Thismeeting was attended by representatives of 40 Statesand international financial institutions. The participantsdiscussed the question of providing urgent financialassistance to help restore normalcy to the liberatedterritories. The preliminary deliberations werepromising and we hope to see them materialize at thedonors' conference to be held at the ministerial level inOctober.The Lebanese feel that the internationalcommunity did not exert adequate efforts to compelIsrael to comply with Security Council resolution 425(1978)  which called upon Israel to end its occupation along time ago. Due to this delay  Lebanon as a wholehad to suffer the dire consequences of occupation. Ourresources plummeted  our economy crumbled and ourpeople endured untold suffering. From this rostrum  Iappeal to the donor countries  to international financialinstitutions and to the United Nations specializedagencies to provide sufficient assistance for thereconstruction and rehabilitation of South Lebanon.4This will be a token of solidarity on behalf of theinternational community.We thought that the prospects for the realizationof a just and comprehensive peace in the region werereal following the recent rounds of negotiations.Regrettably  the results were disappointing. Thenegotiations for peace floundered and the process wasderailed on all tracks. This was due to the fact that theIsraeli leaders gave the logic of No's' precedenceover the principles of right and justice. This isparticularly unfortunate in the light of the manyachievements made in bringing the negotiations soclose to an optimal solution  especially on the Syriantrack.The prerogatives of peace are not commensuratewith the Israeli No's'. These No's' run counter to theresolutions of international legitimacy that provided forthe return to Syria of the entire Golan up to the line of4 June 1967. These resolutions also recognized theneed to enable the Palestinian people to recover theirinalienable rights  including their right to self-determination  the establishment of their independentState on their own national soil  with Jerusalem as itscapital  and their right to return to their homeland inPalestine.The liberation of most of the Lebanese territoriesfrom Israeli occupation will not affect Lebanon'scommitment to the process of peaceful settlement ofthe Middle East question. Lebanon upholds its positionwith regard to the inseparability of the Syrian andLebanese tracks. We believe that the opportunity for ajust and comprehensive peace remains  provided thatIsrael complies with the resolutions of internationallegitimacy and the Madrid terms of reference.Lebanon believes that Israel has forfeited theachievements made in its negotiations with the Arabside due to the conflicting domestic agendas of variousIsraeli political groups. This will hinder the settlementprocess in the region  and will further compromise ourprotracted pursuit of peace. Lebanon calls on the co-sponsors of the peace process  the United States andthe Russian Federation  and the European Union torenew their efforts to relaunch the peace process fromthe point where it left off in 1996.Lebanon cannot fail to stress once again that inorder to achieve a peaceful settlement  the Palestinianrefugees  particularly those hosted by Lebanon  mustbe allowed to return to their homeland. Ignoring theirproblem or attempting to resettle them in Lebanon willfurther exacerbate the tension and the volatility of theregion. This would in turn threaten the prospects of ajust and lasting peace.More than 10 years have passed since the Iraqiinvasion of Kuwait. Nevertheless  the question of therelease of the Kuwaiti detainees and prisoners of warstill awaits a solution. We in Lebanon have condemnedthis invasion. We believe that  in addition to othermeasures required of Iraq  the release of prisoners willbe an important step towards improving relations withthat country. Lebanon calls for lifting the sanctionsimposed on Iraq in order to alleviate the suffering ofthe brotherly Iraqi people and to allow them to restoretheir security  stability and prosperity.There is a favourable trend in the relationshipbetween Iran and the Gulf States. That trend must be anincentive to settle the dispute over three islands thathas been going on between the Islamic Republic of Iranand the United Arab Emirates for over three decades. Itshould be settled in the context of good-neighbourliness and the common interests promoted bythe League of Arab States and the Organization of theIslamic Conference.The Millennium Summit was convened as part ofa global effort to foster the credibility of the UnitedNations and its ability to seek solutions to the problemsof all countries and peoples. The internationalOrganization must be capable of keeping up with thedemands and challenges of the new millennium whenever and wherever they arise. The deliberations ofthe Millennium Summit made it clear that what was atstake was the individual. Attempts to arrive at a globalvision may differ in the details  but should definitelyagree on the substance. In our view  the MillenniumDeclaration embodied creative ideas and principles thatmust be embraced in a global blueprint and translatedinto reality. Such a blueprint introduces novelapproaches to the purposes and working methods of theUnited Nations.Lebanon agrees with the conclusions of theSummit. The main challenge we face today is toguarantee that the benefits of globalization are sharedby all peoples of the world. The correct approach is forus to stand united so that globalization and itsmanifestations and results will have a human face.Adequate controls must be developed and must takeinto account the different cultures  traditions and real5needs of the peoples of the world. The costs andbenefits of globalization must be fairly and equallydistributed.Lebanon also believes that the protection of ourcommon environment presents a different kind ofchallenge. Careful strategies must be developed forwater-resource management  combating desertification respecting and preserving ecosystems and combatingenvironmental pollution. Those strategies must begoverned by new ethics. God has privileged Lebanonwith a scenic landscape and an optimal geographiclocation. Regrettably  we have had our share ofenvironmental degradation. We therefore attachincreasing importance to environmental issues. Lawsare currently being enacted for the preservation of theenvironment pursuant to the decisions of relevantinternational conferences. We need the support of theinternational community in our endeavours.Development has become the main preoccupationof the developing and least developed countries. Itmust be linked to an open and just global tradingsystem within an institutional framework thatguarantees unobstructed investment and capital flows as well as the transfer of technology.We must develop an international mechanismwithin the United Nations to address the indebtednessof developing countries.In our view  there is an inherent link between themaintenance of regional and international peace andsecurity and the process of development and peace-building. Hotbeds of tension and protracted armedconflict in some regions of Africa  the Balkans and theMiddle East impede the realization of integrateddevelopment. Our international Organization musttherefore dedicate more efforts to defusing tensions andto resolving crises by reforming and invigorating theroles of its two primary organs  namely  the SecurityCouncil and the Economic and Social Council.In conclusion  Lebanon is a founding Member ofthe United Nations and has contributed to the draftingof the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Today Lebanon looks forward to playing a distinct role in theregional and international arenas. We are anxious toreconstruct and rehabilitate our vital and civilinstitutions and productive sectors after the liberationof our land from the Israeli occupation. We in Lebanonare striving for a just and comprehensive peace in theMiddle East that will bring back stability to our regionand allow us to play a positive role in building a newworld in which we aspire to live."
"94",4021,"LBR",55,2000,"I am honoured toparticipate in this historic session on behalf of HisExcellency Mr. Charles Ghankay Taylor  President ofthe Republic of Liberia.I am pleased to congratulate you  Sir  on yourelection as President of the General Assembly at itsfifty-fifth session. My delegation acknowledges theastute diplomatic skills and esteemed wisdom that youbring to this important assignment. We are thereforeassured of a successful convocation  and assure you ofthe full cooperation of the Liberian delegation.I also take this opportunity to pay tribute to theoutgoing President  Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab of Namibia my brother and colleague  for the very able manner inwhich he conducted the fifty-fourth session of theGeneral Assembly.In the same vein  I commend our Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for his vision  far-sightedness and the efficient manner in which hecontinues to carry out his mandate.This session has the challenge of determininghow the international community will address theprimary issues of peace and development. It has thetask of assisting in preventing intra-State  inter-Stateand regional conflicts  as well as of ensuring that wepursue balanced and non-selective approaches to theirsolution. In addition  it must consider how to bringequity to the present international financial structure.Despite the much heralded dividends that globalizationoffers  developing countries are still beset by mountingdebt burdens  unfair trade practices  declining officialdevelopment assistance  poor health delivery systemsand inadequate resource flows. An improvedenvironment for global interaction  sensitive to theneeds of developing countries  is a dire necessity thatmust not be ignored during our deliberations.The purposes and principles of the Charter haveproved to be of durable value over the years. Today  asin the past  Liberia reaffirms its commitment to thisinstrument. The machinery that has evolved continuesto be an indispensable framework for betterinternational relations. But Member States cannotcontinue to support the United Nations in words only and must avoid resorting to the expediency ofexploiting it in the pursuit of narrow national aims thatconsistently discredit others.At the dawn of this millennium  the UnitedNations performance will be measured principally byits capability to sustain and protect the universal valuesof liberty  equity and solidarity  tolerance  non-violence  respect for nature and shared responsibility as endorsed by the Millennium Summit a few weeksago. Liberia intends to be a part of the process.2There are areas of the United Nations that needconstant attention and improvement. Liberia and otherMember States have spoken of the need to deal withsome of the structural and institutional malaise thatcontinues to undermine the Organization'seffectiveness. As emphasized in my address to theMillennium Summit  we must  first  review theinequitable representation of the world's peoplereflected in the present structure of the SecurityCouncil; secondly  review the undemocratic processesof decision-making in the Security Council; and thirdly  review the continuous violations  with apparentimpunity  of the United Nations Charter by the big  therich and the powerful.Indeed  when the Organization was constructed five nations were entrusted with the responsibility ofoverseeing the entire world. The prevailingcircumstances justified this dispensation  and Liberia  asignatory to the Charter  reasoned that the arrangementwas acceptable. Time has unfolded new realities thatmake the arrangement of old unrealistic  unjustifiableand certainly unacceptable.There is a need to take into account existingpolitical  economic and security realities. I need hardlysay that one area of concern to Liberia is the use of theveto in the Security Council — a use that  on someoccasions  has proved to be in conflict with the nobleobjectives of the Charter.Liberia is interested in peace  justice development and economic progress for its people  andwill not restrain its voice on issues that are vital to allnations and on which it should speak with an equallyauthoritative voice.Mindful that peace can translate into a sustainedclimate for development  Liberia has continued to workwithin the framework of the Economic Community ofWest African States (ECOWAS) to make peace in oursubregion a reality. In this regard  Liberia wasprivileged to assume the mandate given to PresidentCharles Ghankay Taylor by his colleagues  heads ofState of ECOWAS  in Abuja in May 2000.In keeping with consultations held among theChairman of ECOWAS  the Chairman of theOrganization of African Unity (OAU)  the President ofNigeria  and the President of the Gambia  hosted by thePresident of Liberia  in Monrovia on 26 July 2000  anew leader and interlocutor of the RevolutionaryUnited Front (RUF) has been named by the RUF highcommand  through a letter to the Chairman ofECOWAS. Thus Corporal Foday Sankoh was removedfrom the peace process in Sierra Leone. Additionally the new RUF leadership has indicated  in writing  itswillingness to accept a ceasefire  to return to positionsheld at the signing of the Lomé Agreement on 7 July1999  to accept the deployment of an ECOWAScontingent of the United Nations Mission in SierraLeone (UNAMSIL) into RUF positions and to proceedwith the disarmament  demobilization and reintegrationprogrammes.Liberia  along with other ECOWAS memberStates  has also called upon the new RUF leadership toshow good faith by returning all seized arms ammunition and equipment to UNAMSIL. It has beenreported that some armoured personnel carriers havebeen returned to UNAMSIL  but we must continue toinsist on full restitution.Liberia wishes to take this opportunity to againcondemn the taking of United Nations peacekeepers bythe RUF  an act that challenged and undermined ourconcerted efforts to ensure collective security.Likewise  the recent attacks on United Nationspersonnel in East Timor and Macenta  Guinea  areunacceptable and warrant the collective actions ofMember States of the United Nations to prevent anyfuture attacks against United Nations personnel. Wemust send a clear and unambiguous message to allgroups that the people of the world intend toadequately protect those individuals commissioned tocarry out specific assignments for and on behalf of theUnited Nations  whether in the area of peacekeeping orin the discharge of other humanitarian services.The Government of Liberia has expressed itssupport for Security Council resolution 1306 (2000) which calls for an end to the smuggling of diamondsfrom Sierra Leone. As evidence of this  myGovernment has committed itself to undertakingseveral initiatives  including the enactment of a statutecriminalizing the export of undocumented oruncertified diamonds; the enforcement of legislationrequiring the Central Bank of Liberia to issuecertificates of origin  in line with existing laws; and thedevelopment of a transparent process  with theassistance of experts from the International MonetaryFund and the World Bank.After the Liberian civil war our Government tookseveral measures to consolidate peace and security in3our subregion  especially since many disgruntledformer combatants sought refuge in neighbouringcountries. The Government of Liberia voluntarilydestroyed  with the assistance of ECOWAS and theUnited Nations  more than 21 000 small arms and morethan 3 million rounds of ammunition. The Governmentof Liberia also signed the protocol to the ECOWASsmall arms Moratorium.Despite these measures  and the currentimposition of an unjust arms embargo against Liberia armed insurgents from the neighbouring country ofGuinea have attacked Liberia for the third time. Therepeated violations of Liberia's territorial integrity byarmed insurgents from the area of the Guinea-SierraLeone borders have been reported to this Assembly andthe Security Council  the OAU and ECOWAS. Thoughgenerally unacknowledged and not condemned  inApril 1999 there was an incursion from Guinea followed by another in August of the same year.A third and most recent attack emanating fromthe Republic of Guinea is ongoing and has resulted inthe loss of lives and property and the displacement of alarge number of our people.We are alarmed by the large quantities of newarms and ammunition being used by the insurgentscoming from Guinea  and the implications for ongoingarmed conflicts and potential hotbeds in our subregion.The repatriation of some 32 000 refugees toLiberia by the Office of the United Nations HighCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has beensuspended as a result of the armed incursion. Indeed Liberia is a stakeholder in the peace and security of thesubregion  and especially in bringing the illegal armstrade in West Africa to an end.The inviolability of the borders between Liberia Guinea  and Sierra Leone remains a crucial issue. Wecall  once more  for a monitoring presence of theUnited Nations at these borders to monitor all crossingpoints capable of vehicular traffic. We recognize theenormous cost of policing the entire length of theborders and suggest the utilization of an airbornemulti-spectral service to detect any unusual movementsof any type along the entire border. Intelligencegathered therefrom could prove useful to the threecountries and the international community at large. Thecost of this service is reasonable and could beunderwritten by the international community.The Government of Liberia wishes to bring to theattention of this Assembly the maltreatment of Liberianand Sierra Leonean refugees in Guinea  which wasincited by a speech given by the President of Guinea General Lansana Conté  on 9 September 2000  andconfirmed by Human Rights Watch. The refugees havebeen arrested  beaten and some even raped.These actions are in violation of internationalconventions and we appeal to the internationalcommunity to call upon the Guinean authorities torespect and to protect all refugees living within theirterritory. The attack on Guinea  while condemnable  isno excuse for such inhumane treatment meted outagainst innocent refugees.Liberia remains committed to the pursuit of peaceand stability  both at home and in the subregion  and inso doing  will assiduously struggle for the socio-economic uplifting of its people and those of thesubregion under the ECOWAS Treaty.In my intervention last year  I renewed myGovernment's request for the Security Council to liftthe arms embargo imposed on Liberia eight years agoin 1992. I advanced reasons in support of this request principal among which was the constitutional duty todefend the territorial boundaries of Liberia and toprotect all individuals therein  and especially in light ofthe repeated armed incursions into Liberia bydissidents from Guinea. Again  in early July 2000 therewas another incursion into Liberia from the samecountry by dissidents with the declared objective ofoverthrowing the duly elected Government of PresidentCharles Ghankay Taylor. As I speak  there is anongoing war between Government forces and thedissidents.Although our repeated requests for the lifting ofthe arms embargo have not received a favourableresponse from the Security Council  we again put thismatter before that body for urgent consideration.The present security situation within Liberia andthe West African subregion compels us to seek removalof these restrictions  so that the Government of Liberiacan acquire the means to protect its citizens and otherswithin the territorial confines of the country  as well asto maintain a stable environment. On the other hand the continued existence of an arms embargo againstLiberia in the midst of repeated armed aggression is aviolation of our inherent right to self-defence underArticle 51 of the United Nations Charter. If the United4Nations fails to grant Liberia the right to defend itself then the United Nations is obligated to provide for thesecurity and defence of Liberia.The persistent attacks on Liberia  we believe  areprecipitated and encouraged by the knowledge thatdissident forces have of the existence of the UnitedNations arms embargo on Liberia  which leaves Liberiavulnerable to such callous and unwarranted attacks onits nation and people by dissidents outside of thecountry.The Security Council arms embargo has not onlyundermined and compromised Liberia's capacity forself-defence  but it has further deprived our universitiesfrom obtaining needed laboratory chemicals  deprivedour industries from acquiring essential explosives formining and rock quarries. Hence  the arms embargocontinues to have a disruptive impact on oureducational system and our economy as well.In this post-conflict environment  there is theurgent need to build confidence and enhance thecapacity of government institutions  such as health education and agriculture-related agencies and securityapparatus  which are vital to meeting the basic needs ofLiberians  including ex-combatants.Pledges were made toward the achievement ofthis objective in Paris in December 1997. However little aid has trickled in to further the reconstructionprogrammes of our Government.Despite the assurances from the internationalcommunity that the road to international assistance wasa successful disarmament process followed by theholding of free and fair elections  the internationaldonor community has continued to pursue a policy ofpunitive disengagement.Pursuant to this policy  essentially  all knownavenues for obtaining assistance are laden withimpractical conditionalities  which are difficult to meeteven by countries that have not experienced civil war.We wish to note that this exclusionary attitudeapproximates the imposition of economic sanctions onLiberia and its people.However  whatever justification we mayrationalize  there is a population of Liberia that hassuffered the scourge of seven years of civil war:vulnerable children  women and the elderly  whodeserve humane assistance irrespective of any politicalimperatives; people who care less for the politics of themachination of power brokers who arrogate untothemselves the right to determine what is acceptablebehaviour in the international political system. I mightadd that Liberians are not automatons.As a sovereign people  we claim the incontestableright to exercise the leading role in determining ourdestiny  especially the right of ownership of ourdevelopment programmes. We are an integral part ofthe human family  pulsating with needs and aspirationsthat are good and honourable. We too desire to reap thebenefits of the people-centred development underlinedin the Millennium Declaration.At this precarious period of our national life Liberians have shown uncommon resilience and arerelentlessly striving to rebuild their lives. What weseek from the international community is its empathyand human understanding in providing the requisiteassistance that will enable Liberians to enjoy the basichuman rights of food  security and peace. Importantly we wish similar benefits for our neighbours and othersbeyond the West African subregion.Following the successful celebration of theMillennium Summit  which reinforced our collectivedetermination for the improvement of the managementof the United Nations in the twenty-first century  itwould seem morally incongruent that the 23 millionpeople of Taiwan are being denied the right toparticipate in a United Nations.General Assembly resolution 2758 (XXVI) deniesthe Taiwanese people the right to participate in UnitedNations activities and contravenes the United NationsCharter's principle of universality. How can suchinjustice suffice in this era of increased globalinteraction  economic interdependence  politicaltransformation  democratization and rapprochement?With the undeniable record of the Republic ofChina  its experience in democracy as proven by therecent election of President Chen Shui-bian  its respectfor human rights  its economic power resulting from itsacceptance of the market economy; the energy imagination and courage of its people; technologicalachievements and humanitarian attributes all over theworld  who would query its overarching relevance?Liberia fervently reiterates its call for theinclusion of the Republic of China in this worldOrganization. We believe that the Republic of China5can make important contributions that would serve thebest interests of the United Nations community.The world has witnessed a significantachievement in science and technology  leading torapid industrialization and the improvement of thestandard of living of humankind. Although the gains inscience and technology have led to the development ofnew medicines and other scientific knowledge  it hasequally posed a threat to the environment and humansurvival. Rapid industrialization and scientificdiscoveries are dangerously impacting theenvironment. Unless we modify our activities  thesweet stories of scientific achievement will sadly leadto tragedy and doom. In this new millennium wecannot ignore the potency of threats posed byenvironmental degradation to our survival. Saving theplanet is a precursor to the continued existence of its 6billion inhabitants.This is why my delegation supports the efforts ofthe Commission on Sustainable Development  andendorses the Commission's recommendation toconvene a General Assembly summit-level review preferably in a developing country in 2002  to reassessthe decision reached on Agenda 21 at the RioConference in 1992.Among the many impediments to social andeconomic development in Africa are poverty  poorhealth delivery systems  intra-regional wars and civilconflicts. It is a known fact that there is a correlationbetween war  civil conflict and the spread ofHIV/AIDS. The HIV/AIDS pandemic targets anddestroys our human resource  which is the basis for oursocio-economic development. United Nations recordsshow that the prevalence of HIV/AIDS increases incountries affected by war and civil conflicts  owing topopulation movements. Therefore  we should notignore the fact that post-conflict countries need specialattention to fight the disease.Throughout Africa  HIV/AIDS accounts for theincrease in the death rate among young people andadults between ages 10 and 24  and 25 and 45respectively.We appeal to the relevant United Nationsagencies and other partners in the HIV/AIDSprogrammes to help Liberia obtain the $6.5 millionneeded to prevent and control the spread of HIV/AIDS.Meanwhile  in reference to the Inter-AgencyStanding Committee working group established by theSecurity Council in January this year to examine therelationship between war and civil strife and the spreadof HIV/AIDS  I would like to state my delegation'sendorsement of the targets set for reductions in newinfections  and applaud the measures taken thus far toprovide care  support and access to information andmedication for HIV/AIDS victims. Hence  mydelegation commends the United Nations for itsassistance to countries significantly affected by thisdreadful epidemic.Apart from HIV/AIDS  malaria  tuberculosis andpolio contribute immensely to the obliteration of socio-economic gains in countries where they arewidespread. Cognizant of the impediments that theseinfectious diseases pose to our socio-economicdevelopment  Nigeria has offered to host an AfricanSummit on HIV/AIDS  tuberculosis and otherinfectious diseases in the year 2001. Meanwhile  wecommend President Olusegun Obasanjo for hosting theAfrican Summit on “Roll Back Malaria” in April thisyear.We in Liberia have not relented in our efforts toreduce  if not eliminate  these health scourges thatcontinue to threaten our social and economicdevelopment. Hence  the Liberian Government incooperation with the World Health Organization has  asa result of a vigorous campaign  successfully containedpolio  which killed and immobilized thousands of ourcitizens in  past years. The polio vaccination campaigntargeted 900 000 people  and the number of peoplevaccinated was 911 423.I am pleased to report that  if I am allowed toborrow and paraphrase the main slogan from thissuccessful campaign: we are determined to “Kick polioout of Liberia”.Liberia continues to be saddled by the debtburden. This debt overhang  which remains a majorcontributor to the gap between the rich and poornations  was acquired out of loans given in the pursuitof influence in the cold war  which  as I stated in myaddress to the Millennium Summit  was not in theinterest of the borrower. As a result of the debt burden our children are deprived of food  education  healthcare  and jobs for their parents.While we commend countries that have takensteps to relieve poorer countries of their debt burden  I6emphasize that unless all rich creditor nations adoptmeasures to erase this burden  it will continue to beoppressive  and an impediment to sustainabledevelopment for poor countries.Liberia rejects the proclaimed efficacy of thehighly indebted poor countries initiative  and callsupon the G7/G8 countries to consider a comprehensivedebt waiver programme for all highly indebted poorcountries.In January this year  the meeting on povertyreduction and growth held in Libreville  Gabon highlighted the situation in post-conflict countries thatthe Copenhagen Conference failed to address.In this regard  Liberia has proposed the holdingof a regional summit of post-conflict African States todevelop a realistic approach to debt eradication  andcalls on the international community to support thisimportant venture.As I conclude  I cannot help but wonder what thisnew Millennium has in store for the people of theworld. Nationalism remains an unchallenged realitytoday  despite the wave of globalization engulfing ourworld. Also  the politics of power and “might makesright” still pervade in inter-State relations  especiallyamong the powerful. Will the powerful break down thezeal of nationalism under the cover of their demand forgood governance  democracy  transparency and humanrights?We have indeed seen with what double standardsand ulterior motives these demands have been made.Or  will the lofty tenets of the Charter be upheld inequally recognizing and respecting the right of self-determination of the small and the big  the poor and theaffluent  in a world rich in cultural diversity deservingof coexistence in peace and universal harmony? Willthis millennium see the end of cultural hegemony andarrogance  primitive sentiments undeserving of thisnew age of enlightenment and technology?Only the test of consistency between our moralvalue system and our actions will stand witness toposterity."
"95",4067,"LBY",55,2000,"It gives me great pleasure  Sir  to extend toyou  on behalf of my country's delegation  ourcongratulations on your election as President of thissession  and to wish you every success in themanagement of its affairs. I would also like to expressour appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Theo-BenGurirab  the Foreign Minister of Namibia  whoadministered the work of the fifty-fourth session of theGeneral Assembly most competently. I wish also toseize this opportunity to express our gratitude toSecretary General Kofi Annan for his initiatives  whichhave been instrumental in putting an end to tension inmany parts of the world and for his endeavours aimedat reform of the United Nations and the enhancement10of its role  so that it may better fulfil its duties according to the Charter. A word of welcome is alsodue to the Republic of Tuvalu  which joined us a fewdays ago as a new member of the United Nations.This session is convened in the aftermath ofseveral developments. In the past few days  theSecretary-General submitted Comprehensive report onpeacekeeping operations; it included a number ofrecommendations that would assist the United Nationsin assuming its responsibilities in this field.Furthermore  over the last few months  the GeneralAssembly convened two special sessions  the firstconducted a review of the progress made in theimplementation of the outcome of the WorldConference on Women  and the second reviewedprogress in the implementation of the outcome of theWorld Summit for Social Development and beyond.Last week  this hall witnessed the convening of theMillennium Assembly  at the conclusion of which theleaders of the world expressed their adherence to theUnited Nations and renewed their commitment to thepurposes and principles of its Charter  as well as theirintent to lend it their support and to enhance its role toenable it to cope with the new century  with all itschanges and challenges. In our view  thesedevelopments will undoubtedly contribute to the effortsaimed at achieving the goals of this Organization.However  it must also be noted that we are still farfrom achieving the ultimate goal for which we strive namely  the establishment of a world that enjoys peace security  freedom  equality  and justice  a world freefrom oppression  acts of aggression  and attempts toimpose hegemony and domination.There are many regions in the world today thatsuffer from wars and conflicts. Famine and diseasessuch as cancer  malaria  and acquired immunedeficiency syndrome (AIDS) still threaten the lives ofmillions. Resources provided by nature for thesustenance of life are being seriously endangered.Developing countries have not benefited from theadvantages of globalization in a manner proportional totheir suffering from its negative impact. In fact international financial institutions have started toimpose severe conditions on these countries to theextent that they find themselves at the mercy of a newform of colonialism. Attempts to intervene in theinternal affairs of other States have threatened toeliminate sovereignty  not only to violate it.There are also unilateral boycott policies andimposition of unjust sanctions  even aggression  underthe pretext of so-called international legitimacy. Oldideological barriers have been replaced by new barriersthat obstruct the States of the South from access totechnology they desperately need for development  andthat impose trade protection measures on their productsby making other markets inaccessible to them. We arealso witnessing selectivity in the sphere ofdisarmament and double standard policies in thetreatment of international issues. Furthermore  criminalactivities have increased  including illicit drugtrafficking  the financing of organized crime and allkinds of transnational crimes.Such is the current state of the world  with itsvarious variables and challenges  after the collapse ofinternational equilibrium. Such a state of affairsnecessitates the adoption of certain measures to combatand rectify the prevailing conditions. The UnitedNations  in its capacity as an instrument and referenceauthority for all  should perform a pivotal role indealing with these variables. However  we believe thatthe Organization will not be capable of making aneffective contribution in this respect unless radicalreforms are introduced into the composition of itsorgans and the working mechanisms of its entities. Inorder to guarantee success for this process  we shouldmake it a comprehensive one that takes into accountthe aspirations  ideas  and proposals of all MemberStates  big and small  strong and weak. Theresponsibility for success or failure of this processmust ultimately be a joint responsibility.My country  wishing to contribute to the ongoingefforts aimed at reforming the United Nations  believesthat the required reform should achieve the followingobjectives: first  strengthening the role of the GeneralAssembly so that it becomes the authority responsiblefor determining and deciding the conditions that mustbe deemed truly threatening to international peace andsecurity. A mechanism answerable to the GeneralAssembly should be established to ensure theimplementation of its resolutions and to enable it tocontrol and hold accountable other United Nationsorgans  including the Security Council  which itselfshould be an executive entity for the implementation ofGeneral Assembly resolutions.Secondly  restructuring the Security Council sothat it achieves fair geographical representation in itsmembership  with equity for African  Asian  and LatinAmerican States that are not fairly represented in themembership of the Council.Thirdly  improving the ways and methods bywhich the Security Council conducts its work so thatits activities are rendered more transparent. Its rules ofprocedures should also be reviewed. In fact  theGeneral Assembly  which represents all the MemberStates of the Organization  should issue such rules;otherwise  it would be meaningless to say that theCouncil acts on behalf of the international community.Fourthly  we urge the abolition of theprerogatives that the victors of the Second World Wargranted to themselves  particularly the right of veto which should be eliminated because it is non-democratic and undermines the principle of the fullequality of Member States  as enshrined in the Charter.Fifthly  in order to enable the Organization tofollow up on its plans and programmes  we propose theestablishment of an international committee answerableto the United Nations  with subcommittees that covermost regions of the world  empowered with thenecessary mandates and resources to undertake thetasks of inspecting and implementing United Nationsprogrammes.Despite the problems suffered by many Africancountries  the current year has witnessed someencouraging developments. In Somalia  Parliament wasable to choose a new President for the country and thedisputing parties in Burundi signed a nationalreconciliation agreement. The fighting that broke outbetween Ethiopia and Eritrea has been contained andboth sides have signed a ceasefire agreement. Thesesolutions were the fruits of efforts made by theOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and a number ofAfrican leaders who sincerely care for the security stability and development of the continent. For its part my country has contributed to all these efforts and willpursue  in cooperation with the OAU and theSecretary-General of the United Nations  our initiativesaimed at securing a just settlement acceptable to allparties to the conflict in Sierra Leone. We will alsocontinue our good offices with the aim of finding asolution to the conflict in the Democratic Republic ofCongo and the Great Lakes region on the basis of theimplementation of the Sirte agreement  which wascompleted in Lusaka  for the purpose of ending thedispute in that region.From the outset  we in Libya have realized thatAfrica's problems are partly due to its disunity and thefragmentation of its own peoples' efforts. Therefore  inorder for the continent to be truly capable of facing thechallenge of disputes  disease and backwardness  aswell as others imposed by new international situations Brother Colonel Muammar Al-Qadhafi  the leader ofthe revolution  has pursued his efforts to unify thecontinent so that it may be ushered into the newcentury strong and unified. It was in this spirit that ameeting of African foreign ministers was held inTripoli last April  at which the founding law for theAfrican Union was drafted. This law was approved inLomÈ last June at the Assembly of Heads of State andGovernment. At the invitation of the leader of therevolution  the African presidents will meet in Sirteearly next year to declare the official establishment ofthe African Union. This bears witness to the fact thatAfrica has overcome the negative aspects of the pastand realized the dream of unity  which has been theaspiration of African peoples for decades.All these initiatives and endeavours provide newevidence that Africa fully realizes that the solution toits problems and the advancement of its capacitiesreside basically in the efforts of its own sons anddaughters. Nevertheless  it should be emphasized thatinternational peace is indivisible and that internationalstability cannot be achieved partially. This means thatthe international community has an obligation to assistAfrica in its efforts to realize peace and stability on itssoil. As we reiterate today our invitation to all States tohelp Africa in developing a programme to eliminateepidemics and diseases  provide a solution to theproblem of its external debt and ensure that thecontinent is dealt with on new  just and equitable terms rather than be considered merely as a consumer marketfor the products of the industrialized world  we wish torecall  as we have always done  that Africa's problemslie in the abuse of its resources  the plundering of itswealth and riches  intervention in its internal affairsand the imposition of foreign concepts alien to itstraditions and culture. We demand that such practicesbe discontinued  as they constitute one of the mainreasons for political instability in many parts of thecontinent and for economic backwardness in most. Wealso call upon the States that colonized Africa  drew itsborders and scattered and enslaved its people to offertheir apologies to the continent and to fully compensateit for all the damage inflicted by colonialism.12No solution has yet been found to the Palestinianquestion because the essence of this problem has beenignored. My country emphasizes once again that thereis no solution to the Palestinian problem other than thereturn of the Palestinian people to their homeland andthe establishment of their State on the land ofPalestine  with Jerusalem as its capital. On thisoccasion  as we salute the people of Lebanon who thanks to their steadfastness  were able to defeat theenemy and liberate their occupied land  we once againstress the need for an end to the occupation of theSyrian Golan Heights. We also demand the immediatelifting of the sanctions imposed on Iraq and call uponthe international community to put an end to the humantragedy endured by that country's people  to preservethe unity and integrity of its territories  to respect itssovereignty  to refrain from interfering in its internalaffairs and to cease the military aggression waged dailyagainst it.The international community has madecontinuous efforts in the field of disarmament. Mycountry  which is a party to most internationalconventions in this area  is still fully convinced thatsome international conventions addressing certainaspects in this field should be reviewed. I would refer as one example  to the Ottawa Convention on theProhibition of the Use  Stockpiling  Production andTransfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on TheirDestruction  which deals only with simple weapons oflimited effect. We  as one of the third world peopleswho are incapable of defending our borders and landsagainst the powerful who possess aircraft carriers andaircraft that refuel in flight  feel that humanity shouldbe preoccupied with the destruction of nuclear chemical and biological weapons  as well as withballistic weapons  rather concern itself with mines which are a simple form of weaponry.On the other hand  we have noticed that a numberof obstacles still hinder the efforts to establish a worldfree of weapons of mass destruction. Those whopossess nuclear arms have not yet undertaken actualmeasures to dispose of their nuclear arsenals. In fact some of them have continued to develop these weaponsvertically  instead of beginning to destroy them. TheIsraelis  who possess hundreds of nuclear warheadswith which they threaten the Arab people from theAtlantic Ocean to the Arabian Gulf  still refuse to jointhe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons and to place their nuclear installations underthe supervision and the safeguards system of theInternational Atomic Energy Agency.In raising this most serious and momentoussubject  we are fully convinced that  unless theinternational community adopts effective measures toforce the Israelis to accept and implement theinternational conventions on nuclear disarmament  andunless the nuclear-weapon States take practical steps toprove the seriousness of their undertakings  efforts toprevent the proliferation of nuclear arms will be utterlyworthless and any claims concerning the destruction ofnuclear arms will be a major act of deception that willnot fool the peoples of the world.Terrorism still constitutes a source of gravedanger to humanity  because no effective measureshave been taken to trace the roots of this phenomenonin order to eradicate it. My country  which has been adirect victim of state terrorism  has relentlesslyreiterated its strong condemnation of terrorist acts andits willingness to cooperate with all internationalefforts aimed at their elimination. My country'seagerness to put an end to terrorism was so strong thatwe called in 1992 for the convening of a specialsession of the General Assembly to consider methodsto eradicate all forms of terrorism and violence.Today  in reiterating this request  it is mostimportant that we clarify that the correct approach toeliminating terrorism must begin with providing adefinition for terrorism that is universal  objective democratic and scientific. It is genuinely unacceptablethat some still classify the struggle of peoples for theirfreedom and the fight of persecuted groups againsttheir persecutors as forms of terrorism  whereas theyturn a blind eye to real terrorism  embodied in unjustsanctions  occupation  invasion  foreign military bases naval fleets  weapons of mass destruction and the useand threat of use of force. Unless all such matters aredealt with  it is certain that any international efforts toeliminate terrorism will be of no avail.We believe that it has become necessary to takeadditional measures to reinforce international systems such as the Statute of the International Criminal Court concerned with the punishment of perpetrators of themost serious crimes against international security. In itspresent form  the Statute is designed to try only theweak. We ask that it be modified to guarantee the trialof all perpetrators of acts of aggression  drugsmugglers and their trading partners  those responsible13for massacres of innocent people  and those whocommit acts of aggression against United Nationstroops.We look forward to the establishment of a worldin which equality and justice prevail and which is freefrom discrimination  oppression and injustice. This willrequire the drafting of laws that preserve the rights ofmother and child and guarantee that a person may ownhis own house and be a partner in his own productivework  that his basic needs will not be subject tocommercialization and that his rights are not usurpedas a source of income.We also look forward to taking practical measuresthat lead to the realization of a world free from motivesof aggression  manifestations of violence  epidemicsand diseases. We also hope that efforts will be joined tocombat the phenomenon of the white poisons'.Moreover  in order to protect our planet from thedangers that threaten it  we should work to eradicatepests  strive to establish low-cost water desalinationsystems and seek to prevent the flow of waters ofrivers  rain and snow to seas and oceans. Furthermore all factors that hinder the prevention of desertificationand the expansion of agricultural development shouldbe removed. One of these factors is the problem ofmines and other remnants of war from which manycountries  including my own  still suffer. There are stillmillions of mines in our lands planted by the fightingforces during the Second World War. We hope that theStates responsible for planting these mines willrespond to the international decisions that call uponthem to make available maps for their locations and toprovide technical assistance for their removal.Allow me now to raise a subject that haspreoccupied the attention of the internationalcommunity for the last seven years  namely the disputebetween my country and a number of Western Statesconcerning the Lockerbie incident. I would like tofocus on the manner in which the Security Council hasdealt with this issue since the suspension of thesanctions in April of last year. As you are well aware more than a year and a half have now elapsed since thetwo suspects appeared before the Scottish courtconvened in the Netherlands. Almost the same periodhas elapsed since the Secretary-General submitted hisreport to the Security Council pursuant to resolutions883 (1993) and 1192 (1998)  in which he confirmedthat my country has fulfilled the demands stated in therelevant Security Council resolutions. Despite all thesedevelopments  however  the Council has beenprevented from adopting the resolution that requiresthe lifting of the sanctions  because of the intransigenceof one country  the United States. This intransigencehas been such that a threat to use the right of veto wasvoiced.The United States gave a number of justificationsto prevent the Security Council from lifting the unjustsanctions imposed upon the Libyan people. The first ofthese justifications is that Libya still supportsterrorism. This is a groundless pretext. My country which was itself a victim of terrorism in 1986 andbefore  has repeatedly declared its condemnation ofinternational terrorism in all its aspects and forms  andstressed its support for all international efforts aimed atits eradication. Moreover  the Secretary-General'sreport has given irrefutable proof concerning thevacuity and lack of truth of all American claims thatLibya supports terrorism.The second of these American justifications isthat Libya should cooperate with the Scottish courtconvened in the Netherlands. This is a refutablejustification  as my country has pledged from thebeginning  that it will cooperate fully with the court.This pledge has  in fact  been proven since the courtstarted reviewing the case. In fact  the United States isthe one that has not fully cooperated with the court byhiding basic information requested by the court  whichin itself violates Security Council resolutions that callupon all States  and in particular the concerned ones  tocooperate with the Scottish court sitting in theNetherlands.The third  and the strangest of these justifications is the demand that Libya pay compensation to thefamilies of the victims of the Pan Am Flight 103. Thequestion to be raised here is: How could the UnitedStates ask for compensation while the Scottish courthas not yet reached a verdict? Does this not constitute acomplete disregard for the legal principle thatstipulates a presumption of innocence until the accusedis proven guilty? Furthermore  why does the UnitedStates jump to conclusions and deliver a readyconviction  while acquittal or conviction is a matter forthe court alone to decide? Libya's fulfilment of itsobligations was confirmed by the Secretary- General'sreport a year and a half ago. It was also reaffirmed bythe decisions of the Summit of the Organization ofAfrican Unity  the Non-Aligned Movement  theOrganization of the Islamic Conference  the Arab14League and lastly the Group of 77 and China  whichcalled for a complete lifting of the unjust sanctionsimposed on the Libyan people.In view of all of the above  my country demandsthe following:First  this issue should not politicize  as it hasnow become a legal matter that should be left to thediscretion of the Scottish court convened in theNetherlands without interference from any parties.Secondly  the Security Council should  as early aspossible  adopt a resolution under which the sanctionsimposed on the Libyan people are fully and irrevocablylifted. This is the only procedure that reaffirms thecommitment of the Council to paragraph (16) of itsresolution 883 (1993)  and the second paragraph of itsresolution 1192 (1998). It would also reaffirm theCouncil's response to the wishes of the absolutemajority of the international community  on whosebehalf the Council is supposed to work.Should the Council be further hindered fromadopting the required resolution  my country will haveno choice but to resort to this august Assembly so itcould take the necessary measures to vindicate us vis-‡-vis one State that refuses to lift the sanctions  a Statethat was behind the imposition of these sanctions in thefirst place."
"96",4098,"LCA",55,2000,"Humanity  our greatestconcern  is the reason why we are gathered here today.Humanity stands at a defining moment in worldhistory. The challenge before us is to harness thecollective consciousness and will of the internationalcommunity to address the problems of planet Earth.During the course of the past century  thedisparities between and within nations have widened.Poverty  ill-health  illiteracy and hunger among theworld's people have increased. The world's ecosystem the foundation upon which we all depend for survival is rapidly deteriorating. That is why we must regardthis moment as significant in human history  despiteFukuyama's claim that history has ended. The ThirdMillennium offers us the opportunity to break awayfrom the shackles of the past and create newbeginnings. The choices that we make can change theface of humankind and lead to the accepted goals ofglobal peace  economic and human security and thegreater good of humanity.The past century was replete with examples ofnations preening themselves for conquest anddomination. The conquistadors who plundered the NewWorld are still at large  using global institutions  newtechnologies and weapons of destruction to oppress anddominate the weak  the innocent and the dispossessedsectors of mankind. The message that Saint Luciabrings to this Millennium Assembly comes from thepen of Saint Lucia's Nobel Prize Laureate DerekWalcott  who reminds us that  “There are no worlds toconquer/But worlds to re-create”.Minds that are historically poisoned withconquest can hardly experience the essentialequanimity and calm of re-creation. The theme of thismillennium Assembly reaches out in the direction ofre-creation: a people-centred reshaping of the role andfunction of the United Nations and a purposeful moralthrust in re-creating the battered  demoralized societiesin which we live.8That is why we must embrace the United NationsMillennium Summit's theme  “We the peoples: TheRole of the United Nations in the twenty-first century”.The attainment of meaningful transformation in theworld system calls for a United Nations capable ofassuming a vanguard role in development and inadvancing human society and security. The UnitedNations system must play a critical role in promotingglobal responsibility. Global responsibility implicitlyinvolves some form of moral commitment to humanwelfare. It is the formulation of economic programmesdesigned to bring about economic redistribution  tosafeguard against economic crises and to formulatedevelopmental policies that are in keeping withenvironmental protection and sustainability.The United Nations should be strengthened toplay a more central role in development  ensuringequity and security for its small  vulnerable Memberslike Saint Lucia against the greed of profit-drivenPowers. Instead  we are witnessing a consistent systemic weakening of the United Nations' role indevelopment  with development issues being left toundemocratic institutions like the World Bank  theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) and the WorldTrade Organization (WTO)  which perpetuate globaleconomic inequities and ignore the development issuesand concerns of developing countries.The United Nations Development Programme(UNDP)  the United Nations' primary developmentagency  is now reoriented to giving advice ingovernance and democratic elections. The UnitedNations therefore plays a peripheral role indevelopment  and small States like Saint Lucia are lefton their own to be devoured by powerful States backedby powerful transnational corporations.Saint Lucia joined this Organization andentrusted it with our hopes of peace  security anddevelopment. This Organization has passed on our trustto a few dominant Powers and corporations. If theUnited Nations has a diminished role in ensuringdevelopment  peace and security for its small andvulnerable Members  then our presence here is anunnecessary diversion of our scarce resources. In thesecircumstances we feel threatened and vulnerable thatour trust has been betrayed.The greater good of human security cannot befostered simply through peacekeeping operations andhumanitarian missions. There must be a global drive toempower people  through the elimination of theadverse conditions that cause the incapacitation of thehuman spirit and the imprisonment of the imagination.Hence  the United Nations of the twenty-first centurymust be capable of playing a significant role inliberating the human spirit and imagination througheducation and real opportunity. It must be able toreposition itself to give practical meaning to the risingtide all over the world as the common man aspires tohigher and wider horizons.In reaffirming our faith in the United Nations andits Charter  it is again with the hope of savingsucceeding generations from the scourge of war. Thethreat to peace does not necessarily emanate frommilitary warfare. There are new forms of war currentlybeing waged on the small  the weak and the vulnerable.In previous addresses to this Assembly  and in thestatement of our Head of Government to theMillennium Summit  we pointed out the injusticeperpetrated on Saint Lucia and other banana-producingcountries of the Caribbean by the WTO  through itsrejection of the marketing regime for bananas inEurope as being WTO-incompatible. That ruling hascondemned our countries to the prospect of economicruin  in that the stabilizing force of our economy hasbeen dealt a mortal blow.Since that ruling by the WTO  which granted anunreasonably limited time to adjust our economy  wehave lost 50 per cent of our foreign exchange earnings while thousands of farmers have become unemployedand poverty and crime are on the increase. Yet  despiteour urgent economic situation  negotiations betweenthe European Union (EU) and the United States havebeen stalled. Saint Lucia calls on the United States toresume discussions with the European Union on a newmarketing system for bananas that could be acceptableto all  giving due consideration to the Caribbeanproposal. But that is a pipedream. Our hopes haveslipped on a banana skin  because there is a newsweetheart deal between Britain and the United States.Resilient a people as we are  we are moving todiversify our economies and to build another sector —financial services. Again  the economic giants aredetermined to crush our development efforts andsubject our people to poverty by attacking yet anothersector of our narrow economic base.Saint Lucia has acted in good faith in fulfillingour obligations to the Charter of the United Nations 9assuming equality of all Member States. We haverespected the territorial integrity and politicalindependence of other Member States and have neverinterfered in the internal affairs of another State.Today  the Organisation for EconomicCooperation and Development (OECD) has chosen todictate the tax policies of Saint Lucia and otherCaribbean islands by labelling our tax regime as aharmful tax haven and is threatening to imposesanctions for non-compliance with its prescribedchanges to our tax policies.It is Saint Lucia's sovereign right to determine itstaxes. We cannot tell the OECD countries what taxes toimpose  nor do we expect interference in the exerciseof the sacred right entrusted to us by our citizens. Ourdevelopment options are few and limited  and weconsider the OECD action a violation of our basichuman right to development and to pursue a decentstandard of living for our people.Our peace is threatened  our democracy is beingundermined. The conditions for conflict are beingcreated in my country and in the region  and yet instead of addressing development  we are being askedto strengthen the United Nations to intervene innational crises.Within the context of a globalized world  theconcept of sovereignty is fast becoming an endangeredspecies. No self-respecting nation would willinglyabandon its sovereignty for the illusion of a betterworld  when all the signals from this brave new worldare destructive and negative. In respect ofpeacekeeping interventions  one can surrendersovereignty to avoid a holocaust but certainly not topermit well-heeled rapacious countries to hog thecapital flows in the financial services sector.Last week  through our Heads of State andGovernment  we reaffirmed our faith in the UnitedNations and its Charter as indispensable foundationsfor a more peaceful  prosperous and just world. Thisreaffirmation is of particular significance to smalldeveloping States like Saint Lucia  lacking the size andresources to urge the international community to givedue consideration to our concerns and interests. Weagreed to entrust the United Nations with ensuringequality among States. It is of paramount importance tous that the United Nations does not flinch in its role offostering international dialogue and consensusbuilding  so that the concerns and interests of allMember States are adequately addressed and reflectedin the work of the Organization. We do not expect ourtrust to be given to more powerful influences todetermine our collective future. We rededicatedourselves to upholding the principle of equality ofStates and expect that equality to be realized in policydirectives of the United Nations with a balance inrepresentation of the interests of Member States andregions.Saint Lucia calls on the United Nations to assumeits rightful  central role in development and thegovernance of globalization  to promote democracyand good government nationally and internationally  tostand for right and the protection of its weak andvulnerable Members against the powerful anddominant and to seek equality and justice for all. Thisshould be the focus of the United Nations in the newmillennium if poverty is to be eradicated and peaceenjoyed.Saint Lucia cannot be enthusiastic about otherissues until development and equity in the globaleconomy become a priority. Our decline in revenuesdenies us the capacity to increase our contribution topeacekeeping  and we will be reluctant to do so untilthere is an increase in our participation and benefitfrom the global economy. Man cannot live bygovernance alone or peace alone. Our people must findthe sustenance that will enable them to participate ingovernance and peace. Saint Lucia therefore eagerlylooks forward to the convening of theintergovernmental conference on financing fordevelopment to discuss in a holistic manner issues oftrade  finance and monetary matters in the context ofglobalization and trade liberalization.We have always promoted an integrated approachto development and global issues  and this age oftechnology and interdependence lends itself more thanever to the integrated approach of assessing andaddressing the issues at hand.We continue to view the financing fordevelopment process as the missing and the criticallink in the development agenda for a sustainable andlasting resolution to poverty and threats to peace. Wehope that through this process the United Nations willreclaim its legitimate role in development  entrusted to10it in the Charter  and promote the effectiveparticipation of all its Member States in the governanceof the global economy and globalization  for thebenefit of all the peoples of the world.The greatest threat to world peace and democracyis the systemic imbalances and inequities in the globaleconomy and the institutions that govern it. Thissituation is unsustainable and explosive. The thrust ofmany statements made during the Millennium Summitand this session has been to strengthen peacekeepingefforts with resources and personnel. We recognize thatthere is need for improvement in peacekeeping effortsto make them more effective. However  equal emphasisand effort are not being committed to addressing thereal threats to peace and the primary causes of war.Developing countries are threatened by continueddeprivation and inequities in the global economy.Unless these inequities and imbalances are corrected we will continue to create situations of unrest andthreaten intervention while causes go unaddressed.Similarly  we parade the fashionable notion ofpoverty eradication in isolation  ignoring the complex multi-faceted nature of poverty and the causes ofpoverty  including global economic inequities. Thisfaçade to placate the poorest is fooling some of thepeople  but not all of the world's poor. The holisticnature of development takes precedence over thepalliative of poverty eradication. Internationalcooperation in development should instead bedemonstrated through meeting the United Nationstarget of 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product inoverseas development assistance  through debtcancellation  special and differential treatment on acontractual basis for developing countries and adequatefinancial support for the United Nations' developmentprogrammes.We have reaffirmed our commitment topromoting democracy  albeit with the emphasis ondemocracy at the national level. The inherent problemin achieving this objective is clear  since democracy atthe national level is undermined by the lack of acommensurate level of democracy at the internationallevel. The world's peoples and leaders will rightlymock the call for democracy if this principle is notequally applied in the Security Council  the BrettonWoods Institutions and the World Trade Organization the main institutions that currently govern world affairsin peace  security and the world economy  respectively.The United Nations must demonstrate leadership ofdemocracy at the global level if we are to believe inthis principle as a foundation for peace and prosperityin the new millennium. All Member States must beable effectively to participate in matters of peace security and the global economy in order to give realmeaning to democracy and governance.The symbolism of the United Nations isuniversally recognized  but our role in this millenniumis to redefine its goals  sharpen its focus and make it amore efficient instrument for effecting global changeand development. But this institutional change must beinspired and fired by the commensurate determinationof Member nations to re-create their own societies. Theresonance and sympathetic vibration of our visionarySecretary-General Kofi Annan is not enough. We asMember nations must set about the task of societal re-creation  within the parameters of our own societies  tooffset the negative influence of moral degradation crime  drugs and anti-social behaviour. These are thebenchmarks of the uncivil society.In the re-creation of our own societies we face thestructural disadvantages of unemployment  illiteracyand the tyranny of consumerism and materialism. Ouryoung people are cannon-fodder for the blandishmentsof cable television. They lap up a culture and a lifestylethat militate against their own self-development. Theyfail to understand the nexus between earning andspending and develop an appetite for consumerdurables which their economic base could neversupport. They become aggressively fired-up withdemands and rising expectations that neither theresources of the State nor their flimsy work ethic canentertain. They develop a culture of carping criticismthat leaves no space for a culture of appreciation.Caribbean Governments look on almost helplessly at agrowing phenomenon that threatens to disturb therhythm of projected economic growth and breeds akind of lawlessness which conventional law-and-ordertechniques cannot contain.As globalization erodes the economic and socialbases of our islands  international and bilateral aiddwindles. As ideologies and ideals give way topragmatism  the weak social and political fabric ofthese fledgling nations is laid bare. The vocabulary ofcontainment and patience can no longer hold back theanarchist tide of popular revolt. Small nations willencounter their own Seattles  with no NationalGuardsmen to come to the rescue  no sustainingphilosophies to stem the tide  only the grim statistics offalling revenues and rising expectations.Nations which attempt to grapple with thesesocial problems have incurred the wrath of largecountries  culminating in isolation and the impositionof sanctions. Countries like Cuba and Libya have feltthe crush of sanctions. The United Nations system mustrethink the strategy of imposing sanctions and mustdevise other means of ensuring compliance within theinternational community. The imposition of sanctionsis often inhumane and is usually accompanied bydevastating economic consequences and fails toproduce the desired effect in targeted countries. Theinternational community should realize thatinterventions  embargoes and sanctions do not ademocracy make.Because of the untold suffering inflicted oncivilian populations  a twenty-first century UnitedNations system cannot continue to endorse theimposition of sanctions. What is even more devastatingis that the general will of this Assembly is often floutedand ignored when the international consensus calls fora removal of sanctions. Is democracy merely aconvenient attitude? If so  it begs the question as to theinsistence that countries like Cuba should conform tothe principles of democracy when these principlesthemselves are being compromised and rejected as amatter of convenience. It is these injustices andviolations that have turned world opinion in favour ofthe embattled Caribbean country Cuba and have madeits leader Fidel Castro a living symbol of theunconquerable spirit of our people to triumph overadversity and incredible odds.More than ever  the positives of a reformedUnited Nations will become a refuge  a bastion of hopefor nations nonplussed by events that seem suddenlyout of their control. In my previous address to thistime-honoured institution  I alluded to the plight ofAfrica. I should like to reiterate that as Africa was thelast impression of the twentieth century  poetic justicedemands that it must be our first preoccupation in thetwenty-first century.In the process of re-creation  Saint Lucia and theCaribbean must strive to become a catalyst for peace inthe international forum. We must use our collectiveinfluence to contain the border disputes that threaten tocreate friction in Latin America and the Caribbean. Wemust also be wary of importing conflicts into ourregion.In the case of Taiwan and China  it is vital thatwe pursue the line of working towards a one-Chinapolicy instead of fuelling the hostilities thatcharacterize the existing relationship between thesetwo countries. An early resolution of the impassebetween Taiwan and China will strengthen thesolidarity of the developing world.In the case of Africa  the Caribbean has alwaysenjoyed a peculiarly symbiotic relationship withAfrica. Men like Padmore  C.L.R. James  EricWilliams  Sir Arthur Lewis and Walter Rodney have allworked assiduously at the side of African leaders likeNkrumah  Nyerere  Sékou Touré and Léopold Senghorin order to realize the ultimate dream of a united Africaliberated from the bondage of poverty  disease andexploitation. This noble tradition must continue. Onceagain  Saint Lucia calls on its CARICOM colleagues topursue the possibility of obtaining observer status atthe Organisation of African Unity.The peoples of the African continent face theonslaught of the AIDS pandemic that threatens todecimate the population of the entire continent. But thedevastating effect of AIDS is felt not only on theAfrican continent. Today the world is confronted withthe greatest health crisis in human history. The effectsof this disease can destabilize fragile democracies andeconomic progress in both the developing and thedeveloped world.We welcome President Clinton's efforts to createan African AIDS Trust Fund and the pledge of onebillion US dollars to combat AIDS in sub-SaharanAfrica. We also welcome Cuba's undertaking to sendthree thousand Cuban doctors to Africa. However given the transnational nature of the disease  the UnitedNations should use its institutions to launch amovement aimed at the complete eradication of thisscourge. If the world is to survive the ravages of thisplague  we must not only pledge financial resourcestowards research and the development ofpharmaceuticals  but we must make thosepharmaceuticals affordable and accessible and alsocontinue to sensitize the international community topreventive measures.At year's end  the General Assembly will witnessthe end of the first International Decade for theEradication of Colonialism. Much remains to be done12before the United Nations is successful in carrying outits statutory mandate to ensure complete and absolutepolitical equality for the peoples of the relevantterritories. This must remain the guiding principle ofthe international community. That the majority of theremaining Non-Self-Governing Territories are smallislands does not mean that the self-determination oftheir peoples is less important than for formerterritories which achieved sovereign status. We mustresist all attempts to legitimize the present unequalcolonial arrangements  which do not provide for fulland absolute political equality. Saint Lucia thereforefully endorses the proclaiming of a second Decade forthe Eradication of Colonialism and calls on MemberStates and United Nations organizations to fulfil theirresponsibilities under the Charter and relevant GeneralAssembly resolutions.On the initiative of the Government of Canada  adebate has started in the forum of the Organization ofAmerican States on the subject of global humansecurity. It is comforting for developing States  andespecially small developing States  to feel that theconscience of the international world has been prickedinto focusing on the security of the entire globe — theentire globe. On a discordant note  the United States ofAmerica is now concentrating its attention on anational missile defence system aimed at protecting theUnited States from missile attacks. At this strategicjuncture in the new millennium  when world leadersare gingerly nurturing a culture of peace anddisarmament  this action runs counter to the mood forreconciliation and universal nuclear disarmament. Thisunfortunate and myopic emphasis on the protection ofone nation and one people might well trigger a rash ofself-protective nuclear explosions  effectively erodingthe fragile trust which underpins the hope for globalhuman security.There are no worlds to conquer  but worlds torecreate. The recreation of the United Nations must beposited on the basis of mutual respect between rich andpoor  mutual respect between large and small nations.As small and desperate as our islands appear to be  weshould hold fast to the principles that inform theoperations of the United Nations.We challenge the paradigm shift which thedeveloped nations are cleverly manipulating to shuntthe focus of the United Nations towards peacekeepingand humanitarian assistance. Saint Lucia states clearlyand unequivocally that the United Nations focus shouldzero in on development as a radical instrument foreradicating poverty and war.No $600 million carrot will tempt us to abandonthe principle of a nation's capacity to pay. No Congressshould determine the scale of assessments for theUnited Nations  and there should be no conditionalityfor paying arrears and meeting one's obligations to thisOrganization.The hungry sheep look up and are not fed. Thewolves run amok and batten on their hunger  and thecycle goes on in its impropriety. This Organizationmust not flinch in its millennial resolve to end thecarnage.“So I come to you from the weary battlefield oftimeArmed with the disappointments of yesterdayThe sufferings of today and the dreams oftomorrowIn the struggle I may dieBut let's not forsake another tomorrow”."
"97",4125,"LIE",55,2000,"Allow me to begin myremarks by congratulating you  Mr. President  on yourelection to the presidency of the fifty-fifth session ofthe General Assembly. I wish you much success inguiding the Assembly to a fruitful outcome and Ipledge to you the full support of the Liechtensteindelegation. I would also like to congratulate the newestMember  Tuvalu  on its admission to the UnitedNations and in particular  to welcome Tuvalu into thegroup of small countries.24I have had the honour of participating in thegeneral debate before  but this year is very special. Itmarks the tenth anniversary of Liechtenstein'smembership in the United Nations. I would thereforelike to include in my remarks some of the issues towhich Liechtenstein attaches particular importance inits United Nations engagement. For Liechtenstein  asfor many other countries  the United Nations stands forthe protection of human rights and human dignity andfor the promotion of common values.The United Nations has been particularlychallenged during the last 12 months in playing itsrightful role in the pursuit of peace and security.Although remarkable efforts have been made  someconflict situations still do not allow for effectivepeacekeeping to take place. When the Secretary-General called last year for a culture of prevention  mydelegation fully supported his ideas and we still believethat the prevention of conflicts must be the key conceptin the maintenance of peace. We all know thatpreventing conflicts can save hundreds of thousands oflives. Political energy and enormous financialresources can be used for other purposes. The term`culture of prevention' entails a comprehensiveapproach to different kinds of problems. However preventive approaches can be perceived as a threat tothe sovereignty of a State. The classic notion of theterm obviously no longer enables us to cope with thechanged realities of the world. The sovereignty ofStates remains a cornerstone of the United Nations.Creating a culture of prevention is therefore a processthat requires a concerted effort by the United Nationsmembership as a whole. Addressing the root causes ofso many of today's internal conflicts will constitute afurther step in meeting this humanitarian  political andeconomic necessity. Liechtenstein has for several yearspromoted ideas and suggestions on a preventiveapproach with regard to problems arising from theapplication of the right of self-determination. It is timeto free ourselves of biased and obsolete thinking and torecognize that the effective application and exercise ofthe right of self-determination is the basis forpreventing internal conflicts and the violentdisintegration of States.The adoption of the Rome Statute of theInternational Criminal Court (ICC) in 1998 was anhistoric step. The conclusion of the work on theelements of crimes and the rules of procedure by thePreparatory Commission this summer was a furtherstep forward  and the ratification process is promising.We hope to be able to contribute to the entry into forceof the Statute soon. It is of crucial importance that theintegrity of the Rome Statute be maintained throughoutthe remaining work to be done by the PreparatoryCommission. The qualities of the ICC have often beenpraised. The ICC's potential for prevention is certainlyone of its outstanding characteristics. An effectivecriminal court will make an important contribution toterminating the practice of impunity which hasprevailed for so long without being seriouslychallenged.Liechtenstein has always supported enhancedUnited Nations cooperation with regionalorganizations  inter alia   the Organization for Securityand Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) as well as theCouncil of Europe  in particular in the areas of humanrights  conflict prevention and post-conflictrehabilitation.The promotion and protection of human rightscan also contribute to the prevention of conflicts. Thisis more than a legitimate concern for all of us  it isour duty. Ever since Liechtenstein became a Member ofthe United Nations 10 years ago  this issue has been atop priority. In recent years  human rights have becomemore important in foreign policy and in the worldeconomy. There is increased awareness that humanrights issues cannot be considered in an isolatedmanner  since there is a clear connection betweenhuman rights and economic prosperity  social welfare and peace and security.The full enjoyment of human rights andfundamental freedoms by women must be the basis forfull equality in a stable society and we must continueto take further action in order to achieve the fulladvancement and empowerment of women. Togetherwith 12 women Foreign Ministers  I last night signed aletter addressed to the Secretary-General in which wenoted the special needs of women in HIV/AIDSprevention  care and treatment  and called upon theUnited Nations membership to take into account theneed for an enhanced availability of education  testing counselling  care and treatment designed to address thespecific needs of women and girls.Liechtenstein fully supports the fight againsttransnational organized crime  in particular traffickingin persons  and offences against children as well as thefight against money laundering. Financial crime is25increasingly a key concern in today's open and globalfinancial world  which is characterized by the highmobility of funds and the rapid development of newpayment tools. In our view  international cooperation inthe global fight against money laundering can only beenhanced if all international financial services centreswork towards full implementation of internationallyagreed standards  and my Government therefore fullysupports the objectives of the United Nations GlobalProgramme against Money Laundering (GPML)Forum. The approach must  however  be transparent inclusive and non-discriminatory  and the positiveaction already taken or being taken by individualcountries must be properly recognized. Any punitiveapproach  including the establishment of lists and theimposition of sanctions on individual jurisdictions  aswell as the failure to distinguish between the fightagainst money laundering and tax issues  runs counterto the spirit of international cooperation. We thereforeregret  in particular  recent proceedings by someinternational and regional bodies directed againstcertain financial centres  including Liechtenstein. Thelack of transparency and the manner in which this wasdone are not in conformity with the establishedprinciples and procedures of international cooperation.These established principles and procedures mustguide the cooperation between States and the resolutionof difficulties they may have. International cooperationmust be handled in the same way when large States aredealing with small States and when small States aredealing with large States. No organization should beallowed to depart from established practice ininternational relations. Cooperation by small Statesmust never be interpreted as capitulation; cooperationimplies consideration of the rights and interests of all."
"98",4172,"LKA",55,2000,"I convey to thePresident the warmest felicitations of Sri Lanka on hiselection to the high office of President of the fifty-fifthsession of the General Assembly  and I pledge to himSri Lanka's fullest cooperation and support in his work.To the Foreign Minister of Namibia  Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  I convey Sri Lanka's appreciation andadmiration for the masterly manner in which he servedas President of the fifty-fourth session of the GeneralAssembly.I would also like to take this opportunity towelcome Tuvalu to the membership of the UnitedNations.The Millennium Summit is over. I fervently hopethat its dreams and hopes for a better world will neverfade from the hearts and minds of all mankind. ThePresident of Sri Lanka  Chandrika BandaranaikeKumaratunga  unable to attend the Summit  conveyed 24through a message I had the honour to read out to theSummit  her hopes and her vision for the future ofhumanity. Her words were these:“Peace among all States and peace amongall peoples within States so that all  and not onlysome  may in safety  without fear  in dignity without humiliation  in good health  and inmaterial and spiritual well-being enjoy thewonders of life on this miracle we call the planetEarth.” (A/55/PV.7)Therefore  the President of Sri Lanka spoke  withemphasis  of the necessity of protecting and preserving for the future  those minimal and most fundamentalcertainties that the Member States of the UnitedNations have been able to establish — in particular  topreserve what was and continues to be theOrganization's very foundation: the entity we know asthe State. She pointed out that it was in the GeneralAssembly that representatives of Governments  ofpeoples and of States gather together under a Charterthat assures States of their sovereign equality  theirpolitical independence and their territorial integrity.These are the fundamentals of the United Nationssystem.And this is as it should be. States are the principalorganizational entities into which the peoples of thisplanet have gathered. The principal  overallorganizational edifice of the international community isthe inter-States system.For the entity we know as the State  there is nosubstitute. If States weaken  so will this Organization.If States are diminished  so will this Organization bediminished.Thus  it was the plea of the President of Sri Lankathat everything possible be done to protect andpreserve  and not to decry or endeavour to erode  thestability and the well-being of the entity we know asthe State  for whose sovereignty  territorial integrityand political independence the Charter gave us itsassurance.Before proceeding any further I should make itclear — in view of recent statements on the part ofspeakers of obvious goodwill and intentions  but withwhose fundamental premises I fundamentally differ —that those who assert the necessity of continuedreaffirmation of the sovereignty of the State in terms ofthe Charter must not be regarded — I repeat  must notbe regarded — as having in any way diminished theircommitment to the importance of universal adherenceto human rights and all that is required for the dignityof the individual. Sri Lanka is deeply committed to thepromotion and protection of the human rights of itsown people and of all peoples everywhere.There is  however  a substantial body of opinion within which Sri Lanka includes itself  which is of theview that the way to proceed in the matter of humanrights and the dignity of the individual is properlythrough continued and close cooperation between allStates  while respecting the sovereignty of each. Theway of multilateralism or globalization  which appearexpressly or by implication to overlook or diminish thesovereignty of States  is not  to many of us in this Hall a commendable course. It is not a course whoseworthiness in practice has as yet been established.Indeed  most endeavours to overlook or diminish thesovereignty of States have often had disastrousconsequences. With that initial clarification and areminder that human rights are for the observance notonly of States  but non-State entities as well  I shallproceed with the remainder of my address.We must bear in mind that the entities we knowas States are national and international corporateentities of enormous complexity  differing in so manyrespects from corporate entities of the private sectorand  of course  differing as well from thoseinnumerable entities  in their thousands now  to whichwe refer  broadly and benignly  but somewhatsimplistically  as civil society.If the management of a developed State withmore than adequate resources at its command is acomplex undertaking  how much more complex wouldbe the management of a developing State without suchresources and such infrastructures? Then there arethose developing States such as Sri Lanka  with theirmulti-ethnic  multireligious societies where thelegacies of centuries of a colonial past take more thanone generation to erase.Aside from the pressures inherent in the verynature and history of a State  let us not forget theadditional external pressures a State is subject to —economic  social and political  legitimate andillegitimate  civil and uncivil  and often criminal —that the age of information and its consequences havebrought in their wake. These are external pressures thatraise troubling uncertainties for many States and for25developing States in particular  that are without theblessings of abundant resources and advancedinfrastructures. These are uncertainties that strain thestructures of States and could come close to threateningtheir very existence.Where the processes of globalization areexploited to their advantage by the irresponsible or theillegitimate or the criminal  one is reminded of thereport from the Secretariat received by this Assemblythree years ago which drew attention to the threat toGovernment authority and civil society  to law andorder and to legitimate economic and politicalinstitutions posed by transnational networks of crime narcotics  money laundering and terrorism havingaccess to sophisticated information technologies andweaponry.Of course  where there is the use of internalarmed force against a State  as in my country  thecomplexities within a State compound themselvesmany times over; and we know that the use of armedforce against a State is the greatest threat of all to itspreservation and well-being. This is particularly so indemocracies  whose very openness makes them mostvulnerable; and Sri Lanka is a democracy of long-standing and unwavering commitment to democraticfundamentals.Peace among States  the primary purpose of theCharter  has to a large extent been achieved  if not infact in every case  at least in general  and in terms ofgenerally observed rules of international law  under andpursuant to Charter provisions that proscribe the use ofarmed force by one State against another State  exceptin self-defence or as authorized by the SecurityCouncil.Yet when we turn to peace within States  and theuse of armed force against a State internally  we see anentirely different  and an often confusing andfrustrating  picture. Each armed conflict is unique; eacha creature of its own history; the nature of eachdetermined by its own surroundings. There is nosimplicity of circumstance  no uniformity in scenario no easy solution. Internal armed conflicts come inmany different forms.The relatively clear-cut format of a UnitedNations response to inter-State armed conflicts —monitoring a truce and keeping the peace after anagreed cessation of hostilities — seems  for internalarmed conflicts  inadequate or inapplicable.The Charter does not prescribe how thisOrganization should proceed in cases of internal armedconflicts  except for the wise admonition in Article 2 paragraph 7  which says “Nothing contained in the present Chartershall authorize the United Nations to intervene inmatters which are essentially within the domesticjurisdiction of any State.”In view of the varieties  complexities andintricacies of internal armed conflicts  thisOrganization appears to be without the necessarystructure  the knowledge  expertise  experience andresources — and often  it would seem — without thenecessary collective will.To suggest that the United Nations shouldintervene in internal armed conflicts across theboard — a suggestion made  on occasion  by persons ofobvious goodwill but with little knowledge of localcircumstances — is wishful thinking of the mostsimplistic kind  and incorrect in the extreme.A proposition of such a nature ignores thefundamental premise  indeed the truism  articulated soimpressively to the Millennium Summit by the head ofState of Algeria  President Bouteflika  in hissummation of the deliberations of round table four: thata democracy  offering to all its peoples the fundamentalnecessities of peaceful  all-inclusive politicalprocesses  simply cannot tolerate armed defiance of thedemocratically expressed will of the populace of aState  which an armed terroristic attack on ademocratic State so obviously constitutes.At a more practical level  where would thisOrganization — woefully under-financed for thefulfilment of its development objectives  which billionsaround this world expectantly await — obtain thefurther resources for such far-flung interventions ininternal domestic crises.Charter provisions and United Nations practiceaffirm that a State may act in individual or collectiveself-defence should there be an armed attack across itsfrontiers. Yet  against massive internal armed attack the abilities of most States — or at least the abilities ofmost developing States — to react with equivalentarmed force in self-defence  or in enforcement of thelaw of the land  or in the maintenance of law and order are very limited. Traditional police services areinadequate in design  in training  in equipment and in26experience. Few States have ready and affordableaccess to the necessary information or intelligence.Few States are able to maintain military infrastructureseffective against heavily armed guerrilla-typeonslaughts and the horrors of terror.Such has been the experience of my country. SriLanka has for many years had within its territory anarmed conflict that has complicated the lives of theentire population of the country. It is a conflict of anextraordinary nature. A very small group of armedfighters and supporters — numbering less than 15 000persons in total; schooled in and totally devoted toviolence; rejecting the processes of peaceful societyand participatory governance; achieving  through thepractice of systematic terror  national and internationalnotoriety; rebuffing all overtures for settlement of suchproblems as they may have through dialogue —continues  in defiance of law and order  in rebellionagainst the State to fight for the establishment of aseparate  monolingual  mono-ethnic State in ourterritory.A democratic State  because of its openness  itslaws  traditions and practices and its commitment totolerance and dissent  is especially vulnerable to thedeployment of force against it by any group within itsboundaries. An internal armed challenge to any Stateanywhere is a challenge to all States everywhere.Unless all States  democratic States in particular  agreeto come to the aid of a State in such peril  democracyitself will be imperilled everywhere. Democracy willnot survive.When the security and integrity of one State isthreatened by an armed group within it  surely —especially in these contemporary times  with the coldwar far behind us — it behoves all other States to denythat armed group any encouragement  any succour  anysafe haven. Today  for the prosecution of terroristactivities in one country  massive funds are raised withimpunity in other countries  often through knowing orunknowing front organizations or other entities thatnow proliferate in many forms and in many countries and often  sadly  in the guise of charitable groups orgroups ostensibly concerned with human rights orethnic  cultural or social matters.The magnitude of the collection of funds abroadfor terrorist purposes  and the extensiveness of thereach of the international networks developed for thatpurpose  boggle the mind. Their receipts seem toexceed the receipts of many transnationalconglomerates — all free of tax. Revenues come  ofcourse  from the customary illegal trade in drugs  armsor other merchandise  including the smuggling ofhumans.But there also exists a far more abundant andseemingly limitless reservoir of funds — namely expatriates of similar ethnicity settled abroad. As thewestern media has reported over the past few yearsfrom time to time  collections from expatriates abroadfor the armed group known as the Tamil Tigers  whichis battling the Government of Sri Lanka  are staggeringin their magnitude: for example  $400 000 a monthfrom one country; $600 000 a month from another;$2.7 million a month from yet another; and largeadditional funds from expatriates in still othercountries.In 1988 an excellent study was published onfinancial havens  banking secrecy and moneylaundering  a study by experts in the field commissioned by the United Nations Office for DrugControl and Crime Prevention. In order to implementadequately the provisions of the recently adoptedInternational Convention for the Suppression of theFinancing of Terrorism  a study of a similar nature byUnited Nations bodies on the collection of externalfunds for massive  continuous internal armed rebellionagainst a State  such as occurs in Sri Lanka  becomesespecially necessary when the armed group battling aState is in blatant violation of the human rights andhumanitarian norms and standards — including thoserelating to children and to children in armed conflict —that this Organization so correctly and so diligentlyespouses as the minimal contemporary requirements inhuman society.I proposed such a study at the fourth round tableof the Millennium Summit  and that proposal wasendorsed by our Chairman  President Bouteflika ofAlgeria  in his summation to the General Assembly ofthe proceedings of our round table. I urge that theinternational community give favourable considerationto that proposal.As the years go by  and the armed conflict fuelledby such massive funds from abroad continues within aState  paradoxically  international perceptions seem toblur  not only among those in civil society  who areoften uninformed  but even on the part of those inpositions of international authority  within and outside27this Organization  who should know better. Theexistence of the internal armed conflict and theresulting casualties are bemoaned  and a cessation ofhostilities is urged at any price  in seeming inattentionto the fundamental fact that it is the armed internalgroup that is the aggressor and it is the State that is thevictim.Such a blurring of international perceptions insome quarters as to what the crucial facts are  isdistressing  and profoundly disappointing  to those such as we in Sri Lanka  who have struggled hard  andcontinue to struggle hard  to preserve our democraticway of life and the richness of our multi-ethnic multireligious culture in the pluralistic tolerance wewere once so blessed to enjoy.I hope that the thoughts that I have expressedtoday on the nature of the affairs of States  and of theaffairs of developing States in the main  will show insome measure why a sympathetic  rather than aninquisitorial  style is by far preferable in relation to theaffairs of States  as in all human relationships.At a more general level  I would like  before Imove on from this part of my statement  to refer to twoother relevant questions: the role of the GeneralAssembly and the role of civil society in the affairs ofthe United Nations. The General Assembly is the onlyprincipal organ of the United Nations in which allMember States are represented  and the only principalorgan whose terms of reference allow for considerationof any matter within the scope of the Charter.Yet there is the perception among some that thecentre of gravity in decision-making on questions ofmajor policy importance to the Organization appears tohave moved away from the General Assembly to anextent unknown in earlier years. Sri Lanka greatlywelcomes  therefore  the reaffirmation in paragraph 30of the Millennium Declaration of the central position ofthe General Assembly as the chief deliberative  policy-making and representative organ of the United Nations and the commitment of all nations to enable theGeneral Assembly to play that role effectively. Thepractical manner in which the General Assembly couldplay that role will  of course  require very carefulthought.The ways in which “civil society”  and theinnumerable entities that that expression encompasses could best contribute to the work of the UnitedNations — in terms of data collection  research andanalysis and expertise — in a manner that does notprejudice the role of States in the affairs of the UnitedNations  will also require most careful examination.Such contributions should be made in a manner that isnot partial or partisan  in favour of or against  but rather  in a manner that befits an objective and neutralconsultant.Moreover  although civil society within a nationalcontext could be  and is  well accommodated indomestic political processes  the manner in which civilsociety could be internationally accommodated withinUnited Nations processes still remains a puzzle.As in all human relationships  so also amongstStates: the strong do better than the weak  the richbetter than the poor  the developed better than thedeveloping. This is the case most of all when times arehard. The marked decline in official developmentassistance  and the failure of most of the strong  therich and the developed to meet their officialdevelopment assistance pledges  show that for States there is no general safety net.If there is one message from the MillenniumSummit  and one that is now coming from thisMillennium Assembly loud and clear  it is thatglobalization may be a reality for all  but that it is thatno panacea for all — certainly not for the developingworld. The benefits of globalization have by-passedmuch of the developing world. The poorest among us spanning the continents of Africa  Central America andAsia  have experienced increasing marginalization.There is little opportunity for developing countries tobe formative in the shaping of the world economy forthe future — in the deliberations that really matter.Thus  although we are leaving the past centuryand the past millennium behind us  and celebrate theirpassing  more than half of humanity is still haunted bythe old  intractable economic and social tragedies thathave been with us since the dawn of time: poverty illiteracy  ill health  hunger  unemployment  theproblems of the young  uncontrolled urbanization andthe growth of mega-cities.Among these  poverty alleviation and povertyelimination remain for most of us in the developingworld the highest and  in fact  the only  meaningfulpriority. Poverty degrades humanity and  in an era ofabundance and conspicuous consumption  visible inreal time across billions of television screensthroughout the world  undermines the very foundations28necessary for the growth of humane societies andrefined governance.The developing world needs to be accorded anadequate formative voice in the formulation of a newdevelopment chapter for the twenty-first century. Thuswe turn to the United Nations and  in ultimate recourse as it were  to this General Assembly  under whoseactive supervisory authority there must be a revival ofa comprehensive North-South development dialogue —a dialogue that seems to be fading away.To tell the countless starving and helplessmillions that a free global marketplace will show us theway is  I am sorry to say  simply not enough.Resource deprivation over many generations andits debilitating consequences on adequateinfrastructural growth has severely damaged thecapacity of developing countries to cope with themodern world.A new development chapter must provide for thecatastrophic negative contingencies  be they “man-made” or otherwise  including such occurrences as thepresent surge in the price of oil to the highest levels ina decade that now place crushing burdens on thenational economies of developing countries strugglingdesperately to contend with economic realities. They like Sri Lanka  can only hope and pray that the oil-producing countries  which are certainly not insensitiveto the plight of the developing world  will find itpossible in some way to relieve such pressures in thevery near future.I should also wish at this juncture in my addressto say a word about the South Asian Association forRegional Cooperation (SAARC) of the seven States ofSouth Asia — Bangladesh  Bhutan  India  Maldives Nepal  Pakistan and Sri Lanka — a body which isdeeply committed to the advancement of the economicand social well-being of our peoples  numbering nowin the region of 1.25 billion  not merely throughnational endeavour  but through regional andinternational cooperation. Sri Lanka  as the currentChair of SAARC  is seeking to implement theprogramme of activities laid down at the 1991Colombo summit as best it can in difficultcircumstances. The people of our region are deeplycommitted to the goals of SAARC. They continue tointeract vigorously on a wide range of professional cultural  educational and social activities notwithstanding the temporary setback to high-levelpolitical involvement that SAARC has suffered at thistime. We in SAARC are confident that it will not belong before our movement is again able to play its fullrole in the welfare of our peoples.I have just returned to New York from theInternational Conference on War-Affected Children organized so successfully by the Government ofCanada and held at Winnipeg.I cannot conclude my address to the GeneralAssembly this year without making at least a briefreference to the abominable crimes that are beingcommitted against young Tamil children in Sri Lankaby the rebel group known as the Tamil Tigers. Theyhave been  and are  forcibly conscripting even 10-year-old children  boys and girls  for battle against the SriLankan Army. Some of these children have beenprogrammed into suicide bombers. They are forced towear cyanide capsules round their necks and to bite onthem to evade capture. This wretched practicecontinues unabated.In 1998  at the invitation of my Government  theSecretary-General's Special Representative forChildren and Armed Conflict  Mr. Olara Otunnu visited Sri Lanka and met some of the Tamil Tigerleaders. They assured him that they would not recruitany person under the age of 17 and would not send intobattle any person below the age of 18. A few monthsago he stated that since his visit to Sri Lanka there havebeen continuous reports of the recruitment and the useof children by the Tamil Tigers. The assurance theygave him has been totally dishonoured. In a poignantanswer to a question by an interviewer  the SpecialRepresentative said this:“Children who become soldiers lose theirinnocence. Part of the reason why the fightinggroups will tend to reach out to children isbecause  of course  the adults may becomedisillusioned  they may be killed off  they mayrun away  so they reach the children who are lessable to defend themselves. But there's a morecynical reason than that: children  because theyare innocent  can be moulded into the mostunquestioning  ruthless tools of warfare  intosuicide commandos  into committing the worstatrocities. In other situations  it is ideology —come fight for the homeland  come fight for ourethnic group  come fight for a new society — thatmay appeal to families and to children. So there29are many reasons which facilitate the abuse ofchildren in this way.”I thank the Special Representative for having hadthe courage to speak out on this important issue. Toremain silent in the face of such criminality is toencourage and condone it. It is the duty of all of uswho care about the children of the world to rallyagainst the cruelty  brutality and the grievous harmcynically inflicted on them by groups such as the onethat abuses them in Sri Lanka. A few months ago  therepresentative of the United Nations Children's Fund inSri Lanka told journalists — and I thank him for hisstatement — that the situation of children in the areasheld by the Tamil Tigers had worsened since they gavetheir assurance to the United Nations SpecialRepresentative. Parents have reported that theirchildren have been recruited. It is a serious problem.He observed that until they  the Liberation Tigers ofTamil Eelam (LTTE)  announce to their own peoplethat they have taken measures to prevent childrenbelow 17 years from being recruited  we cannot taketheir promises seriously.A respected and courageous human rights groupin Sri Lanka  consisting mostly of Tamil teachers whoused to teach at Jaffna University  have said in a recentreport that since last May a fresh child-recruitmentcampaign has been launched by the Tamil Tigers.According to their report  children as young as 10 yearsare being forcibly conscripted  age being noconsideration as long as the child was able to carry agun. In recent days and months the international presshas focused sharply on the plight of child soldiers inSri Lanka.A few days ago Sri Lanka deposited itsinstrument of ratification of the Optional Protocol onthe Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict to theConvention on the Rights of the Child. This Protocolhas noted that the Statute of the International CriminalCourt makes conscripting  enlisting or using children incombat a war crime in both international and non-international armed conflicts. It holds non-State actorsalso accountable for such crimes and it calls upon Stateparties to cooperate in preventing and combating suchcrimes.Accordingly  today  in this General Assembly ofthe United Nations Sri Lanka calls upon all States toratify this Protocol  and it calls upon the State partieson whose territory the LTTE has offices and frontorganizations to take strong punitive action againstsuch establishments  and to declare the LTTE acriminal organization  as the LTTE sustains its criminalactivity in respect of the use of child soldiers throughfunds generated on the territories of other State parties which are obliged to cooperate in terms of theConvention and the Protocol.The Winnipeg Conference ended yesterday withan impassioned plea to the world to move urgentlyfrom words to deeds  to save the hundreds of thousandsof children who are abused  maimed  displaced traumatized and killed by war. In our cruel world ifanything should stir the conscience of mankind it issurely the plight of these children. Let it not be saidthat yet again we have failed — failed to hear and heedthe anguished cry of children in distress  children onwhom adults have inflicted  and continue to inflict unspeakable cruelty. No  politics cannot divide us onthe issue of child soldiers. Massive funds are notrequired to save them. What is required is the will andthe commitment to act of those States which are in aposition to act. The Winnipeg appeal is addressed tothem. Let us all wholeheartedly support that appealnow so that when the special session of the GeneralAssembly for Follow-up to the World Summit forChildren is held here in New York next September  wewill be able to adopt practical measures that will finallyensure that children will be forever protected from theravages of war."
"99",4214,"LSO",55,2000,"On behalf of theGovernment and people of Lesotho  I extend our mostsincere congratulations to the President on his electionto preside over the fifty-fifth session  and wish himevery success in the discharge of his duties. We areconfident that his personal  diplomatic and leadershipqualities will guide us through the session  and assurehim of our support and cooperation at all times. Let mealso pay a well deserved tribute  and express our thanksand gratitude  to his predecessor  our colleague Minister Theo-Ben Gurirab of Namibia. We thank himin particular for his statesmanship  sterling guidanceand effective organization during the difficult times ofthe fifty-fourth session.We also remain deeply indebted to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his continued dynamicleadership and commitment to our Organization  andfor his relentless efforts in achieving the Organization'sgoals.The admission of a new Member to ourOrganization is always a moment of joy  and that ofTuvalu is no exception.19This  the first session of the General Assembly inthe new millennium  offers an opportunity for us toreflect on the challenges and threats we face as weenter the new century  a century that has ushered in arevolution that future generations will likelycharacterize as one that had the greatest impact onhuman civilization since the advent of the telegraph radio and television. The world is indeed witnessing arevolution in the information systems and theirintegration into the lives of men  women and children leading to the term “information age “. The informationage of the twenty-first century is taking root as itimpacts on the lives of all sectors of society at both thenational and international levels.There can be no doubt that for some informationtechnology and globalization are beginning to turntheoretical possibilities into fact  as the use ofcomputers and computer-dependent systems haveresulted in improvements in basic health conditions andincreases in life expectancy  efficiency andproductivity  thus offering tremendous economicpotential and prosperity. Unfortunately  the majority ofothers who have been left out of that prosperitycontinue to live in conditions of extreme poverty remain embroiled in unending conflicts and areravaged by the HIV/AIDS pandemic and otherdiseases.The challenge for the United Nations of thetwenty-first century is to eliminate those disparities bybringing poor countries into the digital age  thusmaking them extract value from globalization insteadof watching globalization extract value from them.Education remains the key for the attainment of theseobjectives. In fact  our message from Lesotho here is:education  education  education.A disturbing phenomenon for the internationalcommunity  and in particular for Africa  is that whilethe rest of the world is experiencing an increased flowof financial resources Africa's development prospectscontinue to be hampered by unsustainable debtservicing obligations. Just as we have placed povertyeradication at the centre of economic and socialdevelopment  it is equally necessary to accord similarimportance to the debt problems of developingcountries. In our view  that would be a vitalcontribution to the realization of the goal of halving theproportion of people whose income is less than $1 aday by 2015.Lesotho falls into the category of countries thatare not eligible for debt relief under the existingframework. In our Millennium Summit Declaration wemade pledges to grant more generous developmentassistance to poor countries that plan to apply theirresources to poverty reduction and to dealcomprehensively with their debt problems. We need toconcretize these pledges by adopting measures toaccelerate debt relief such as the cancellation of theofficial debt of those countries and the expansion of theHeavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative. Thiswould assist us in ensuring that by 2015 the majority ofour people have access to safe drinking water  that allchildren complete a full course of primary education and that joblessness is reduced among our youth. Itwould also help us curb the spread of HIV/AIDS andassist the children orphaned by this scourge.The Government of Lesotho adopted povertyreduction as its highest development priority in itssixth and seventh National Development Plans. Wehave taken firm measures to reduce poverty. Based onour democratic dispensation and peaceful environment we have successfully embarked on an aggressiveinvestment promotion campaign for job creation. I ampleased to report that we are experiencing initialsuccess in attracting foreign investment.We believe that South-South cooperation is animportant tool for developing and strengthening theeconomic independence of developing countries. Tothis end  we in southern Africa have made modest butencouraging progress with respect to South-Southcooperation by accelerating the entry into force of theSouthern African Development Community (SADC)Trade Protocol  which encompasses deeper economiccooperation  cross-border investment and trade  freemovement of factors of production  and free movementof goods and services.The Third United Nations Conference on theLeast Developed Countries  to be held in Brussels nextyear  is both timely and crucial. Since this bodyrecognized  some years ago  the least developedcountries as the poorest of the developing countries there has not yet been any improvement in the weakeconomic situation of those countries  whose numbershave instead increased from 25 in 1971  to 48 in 1997.Lesotho therefore looks forward to theConference  which will review the internal constraintsto the development of the least developed countries and20the adequacy of international support measures in thecritical areas of official development assistance  debtrelief  market access and trade.The High-level International IntergovernmentalEvent on Financing for Development  to be held in2001  will come to naught unless we are resolved toundertake it armed with the requisite politicalcommitment and global solidarity to achieve ourdevelopment goals nationally  regionally andinternationally.The Government of Lesotho remains keenlyaware that good environmental management requiresconcerted efforts from all members of the community.Therefore  we have established partnerships at theinternational  regional and national levels to addressthe problems of environmental degradation. We believethat the environment is too important an issue to be leftin the hands of one Organization. In this regard  welook forward to the process of the 10-year review ofthe United Nations Conference on Environment andDevelopment (UNCED)  at which we will share ourexperiences with  and learn from  our counterparts inthe international community.Regarding the integrated and coordinatedimplementation of  and follow-up to  the major UnitedNations conferences and summits  my delegationvalues the review meetings because they offer us theopportunity to evaluate our performance and toconsider the way forward. They also rekindle ourpolitical commitment to achieving globaldevelopmental goals. We therefore feel that the reviewprocess should continue in the twenty-first century with a stronger emphasis on the evaluation ofachievements and constraints.Like globalization of the economy  globalizationof human rights cannot be avoided. Today human rightsare well established as the legitimate concern of allhumanity. If  as the world agreed in Vienna in 1993 “the promotion and protection of all human rightsis a legitimate concern of the internationalcommunity” (A/CONF/157/24 chapter III  sectionI  para.4) this calls for a more pragmatic approach in identifyingpertinent situations requiring the protection ofhumanity  including in situations where a state hascollapsed or disintegrated.Among the promising developments as we beginthe century is the growing world consensus on the needto stop impunity by punishing those responsible forgenocide  war crimes and crimes against humanity  asevidenced by the number of signatories andratifications to the Statute of the International CriminalCourt (ICC). This momentum has rekindled our hopefor peace and for an end to the persistence of humanrights violations. Lesotho's ratification of the ICCStatute is a further clear indication of its commitmentto the protection of human rights and to bringing tojustice all those who commit gross violations of theserights.As we celebrate the fifth anniversary of theUnited Nations Fourth World Conference on Women we must be reminded that the goal of gender equality isfar from being achieved. Despite pessimistic forecasts and despite different evaluations of the achievementsof the special session on women  the Beijing + 5conference's adoption of a final document proposing aseries of actions and initiatives in the 12 critical areasidentified in Beijing is an indication of theinternational community's renewed commitment towomen's rights. Implementation of the normsenshrined in the Convention on the Elimination of AllForms of Discrimination against Women remainscritical for the attainment of the goals set in Beijing.As technology brings the peoples of the worldcloser together  thus removing political and otherbarriers  societies continue to be ravaged by racialdiscrimination  xenophobia and other forms ofintolerance  exemplified by “ethnic cleansing”  racialhatred and new forms of slavery. A challenge for theUnited Nations is to define goals and global strategiesfocused on urgent and effective measures to eliminateracial discrimination and ethnic conflicts. Lesotho thuswelcomes the convening of the World Conferenceagainst Racism  Racial Discrimination  Xenophobiaand Related Intolerance  to be held in South Africa in2001. This Conference will offer an opportunity for usto develop action-oriented measures to rid the world ofthese scourges.Preventing the proliferation of weapons of massdestruction — nuclear  chemical and biological —remains one of the most important tasks facinghumankind in the twenty-first century  as theseweapons remain a major threat to world peace. Thepursuit of arms reduction and the challenge ofachieving sustainable disarmament thus remain the21only bulwark against the use or threat of use ofweapons of mass destruction.While we welcome the nuclear-weapon States'undertaking to eliminate their nuclear arsenals  theirfailure to agree to a specific timetable for doing so isregrettable. The challenge is to translate theseundertakings into concrete actions to eliminate allnuclear dangers. We thus support the Secretary-General's call for a new international conference oneliminating nuclear dangers as a means of advancingour disarmament goals. We also remain convinced ofthe need and desirability of convening a special sessionof the General Assembly devoted to disarmament.Thanks to the efforts of all actors  bothgovernmental and non-governmental  the world isbeginning to witness tangible results as the production trade and use of landmines slowly drops  thus loweringthe number of casualties. This  however  should notlead to any complacency  as evidence of the use ofmines in some conflict areas  particularly in Africa continues to surface. We look forward to a day whenthe world will be free of these weapons and encourageall those who continue to use mines  as well as thosewho remain outside the Convention banning landmines to heed the rapidly growing international and regionalmomentum for the ban on those weapons.Lesotho supports the convening of a UnitedNations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Armsand Light Weapons in All Its Aspects in June and July2001  as mandated by General Assembly resolution54/54. We share the view that the outcome of theConference should be a global action plan with specifictimetables for the implementation of commitments onissues such as codes of conduct  legislative andregulatory measures  control  enforcement transparency  and tracing measures and mechanisms.The proliferation of armed conflicts in Africacontinues to hamper efforts to achieve progress ineconomic and social development. The lack of politicalwill to find lasting solutions to ongoing conflicts andthe emergence of new ones continues to effectivelycripple the productive activities of those countries aswell as further erode the poor social infrastructure thatexists in many countries. The illicit trade in arms diamonds and other natural resources  as well as thediversion of resources from development to militaryactivities  continue to fuel these conflicts  thusundermining democracy and development.The challenge for Africa remains the managementand resolution of conflicts  the avoidance of war andthe strengthening of democratic institutions. These areenormous challenges which require Africa'scommitment to stability and the rule of law  but  aboveall  they require strong political will on the part of theAfricans themselves and resources from theinternational community to reinforce democraticgovernment  to deter attempts to overthrow it and evento reinstate it where it has been overthrown by illegalmeans.We in Lesotho have bitter experience of attemptsto overthrow a legally and democratically electedGovernment. Thanks to our SADC partners  order hasbeen restored in Lesotho and the Government isvigorously pursuing a programme of reconstruction which includes the creation of a climate of politicalreconciliation on which the consolidation ofdemocratic gains and democratic culture can rest. TheGovernment of Lesotho remains fully committed todeveloping a culture of democracy  good governance observance of human rights and constitutionality. Theinternational community's assistance remainsindispensable to the success of these efforts. Wetherefore stand solidly behind the position held by theOrganization of African Unity  SADC and theCommonwealth of disallowing Governments that comeinto power by illegal means from participating in ourcouncils. This should include our councils in theUnited Nations.Despite positive steps being taken by theGovernment of Angola to stabilize the situation in thatcountry  peace continues to elude the people of Angolabecause of the non-fulfilment by Jonas Savimbi of theLusaka Protocol. We urge the international communityto observe all Security Council resolutions againstUNITA and to fully cooperate with the United Nationsto ensure the effective implementation of sanctionsagainst UNITA.We appeal to all parties to the Congolese conflictto honour their obligations under the Lusaka CeasefireAgreement and to lend their support to the process ofinternal dialogue under the facilitation of Sir KetumileMasire of Botswana.We support all measures aimed at ending theillicit trade in diamonds in Sierra Leone and applaudthe Economic Community of West African States forits efforts to bring peace to that country. We are22gratified to see the cessation of hostilities betweenEthiopia and Eritrea and call on both parties to thatconflict to redouble their efforts for a lasting peace. Wealso urge all armed groups in Burundi to fully andeffectively participate in the negotiations so as tofacilitate the speedy conclusion of a ceasefireagreement and a comprehensive peace accord. We lookforward to the conclusion of the process in WesternSahara so that the people of that country can freelydetermine their own future.We reaffirm the right of the Palestinian people toexercise their inalienable rights and we urge parties tothe Middle East peace process to redouble their effortsto find durable peace in the Middle East.The real test for the United Nations in thiscentury is how far it is prepared to go in addressing allthese challenges and how far it will go in turningpromises into reality  thus enabling the large majorityof the people of the world to fulfil their potential andrealize their aspirations. While we appreciate themagnitude of these challenges  we continue to havefaith in the United Nations capacity to solve globalproblems  its broad universal support and its ability touphold and reaffirm our shared values of peace  equity social justice  democracy and human rights."
"100",4240,"LTU",55,2000,"I would like to say Mr. President  that I take special pleasure in seeing youpreside over this Millennium Assembly session. I wishto assure you of my delegation's full support in all yourendeavours. As one of the Vice-Presidents of the pastsession  I want to convey my special appreciation tomy colleague and your predecessor  the ForeignMinister of Namibia  Theo-Ben Gurirab. I would alsolike to extend my gratitude to the Secretary-General forpresenting his report “We the Peoples” to the worldcommunity.Allow me also to convey my delegation's warmwelcome to Tuvalu as a new member of the UnitedNations.It is both remarkable and profoundly logical thatin the beginning of the new millennium highrepresentatives of almost 200 nations have gathered forone sole purpose — to comprehend challenges of thecontemporary world. The fact that we all have gatheredhere  representing all regions of the world  cultures andreligions  means that we all share the belief in thevalue  viability and potential of the United Nations.Heads of State and Government  during the course ofthe Millennium Summit  have guided us towardsstrengthening the United Nations  including its centralrole in peacekeeping and poverty eradication. Our tasknow is to act upon their guidance.Globalization  the digital revolution and thetriumph of free trade have transformed the world into avibrant world economy. Interdependence within theworld economy emphasizes collective problems andsolutions. Thus  the United Nations  the Bretton Woodsinstitutions  the World Trade Organization (WTO) andmany other international organizations areindispensable mechanisms in achieving stable peace  inassisting in shaping the course of development  and inensuring that the world economy provides benefits forall.Never has the world been so well off. Yet  neverhas it been confronted with so many problems on theglobal scale. The nature of threats has entirely changed.The phenomena are so complex that they defy easygeneralization. These phenomena comprise extremepoverty and marginalization of entire communities;gross violations of human rights; ethnic conflicts andgenocide; arms proliferation; terrorism; andenvironmental degradation.No effort should be spared to free people fromdehumanizing conditions of extreme poverty. The goalsadopted at the Millennium Summit are challenging.Assistance  new trade arrangements  and debt relief9will hardly constitute a panacea  unless necessary andstrong commitments to poverty reduction  economicequality  combating the HIV/AIDS pandemic andsupporting education are reflected  first and foremost in national policies of individual States  andconcurrently on the agendas of internationalorganizations. Good health  literacy  and education arecritical assets for economic development. Humancapital  combined with a high level of economicequality  good governance  and abiding by the rule oflaw can really make a difference. This is the course westrongly uphold if we aim at reducing by half the levelof extreme poverty by 2015 and achieving sustainabledevelopment.The realities are that most of the economicthinking and ruling is being done within the BrettonWoods institutions  the World Trade Organization orthe Organisation for Economic Cooperation andDevelopment (OSCE)  and a fully coordinatedapproach to the problems of peace and developmentshould be sought between these organizations andinstitutions and the United Nations.We have yet to learn how to manage the spin-offsof globalization and how best to make use ofinternational mechanisms to address new forms ofthreats. Better yet  prevention is preferable to cure. Forreally effective prevention  a broader definition ofsecurity is vital and must encompass pressingeconomic and social problems. The root causes ofconflicts should be addressed as a fundamental part ofefforts to establish secure peace and stability.Should preventative strategies yield no results the United Nations must have a truly effectivepeacekeeping capacity at its disposal. Lithuania willsupport every effort to fix structural deficiencies withinthe United Nations and adequately to staff and financerelevant departments. Provided the determination resources  capacity and willingness are available  Ibelieve  humanitarian catastrophes and crises can beaverted. Proposals to improve the United Nationspeacekeeping capacity and performance  especiallythose contained in the Brahimi report  have beenwidely endorsed by our leaders. Now we have to workon it with a view to shifting the historically prevailingconception of peacekeeping as an ad hoc job to one ofthe core functions of the United Nations.Great challenges to the new international way ofcontaining and resolving ethnic conflicts await inAfrica. A prospective strategy could be to encourageand assist regional organizations  especially theOrganization of African Unity and the EconomicCommunity of West African States; involve civilsociety and the business community; and  most notably enhance the United Nations  especially the SecurityCouncil's capacity to act well in advance  before acrisis gets out of hand. Pledges to contribute to a saferworld add up to nothing if mounting demands foradequately trained and equipped peacekeepers andcivilian policemen  judges and administrators fall ondeaf ears. East Timorese  Kosovars and SierraLeoneans are pinning their hopes on us. Failure torespond to them would mean in the end that we do nomore than celebrate our own individual security.Lithuania has always been and remainscommitted to building collective security. On theinternational level  Lithuania emphasizes activeparticipation in international organizations and itssubstantial contribution to peacekeeping efforts  suchas its participation in the United Nations standbyarrangements system or  from the very beginning of theinternational engagement in the Balkans  making ourcivilian policemen and military available to themissions in Bosnia and Kosovo. Moreover  additionalcommitments will promptly follow as more highlytrained policemen and troops become available. In thisregard  I wish to voice our strong desire to place aLithuanian part of the joint Lithuanian-Polishpeacekeeping battalion under the United Nationsstandby arrangements with a view to joining the Stand-by Forces High-Readiness Brigade.On the regional level  we have made membershipin alliances of democratic nations — the EuropeanUnion and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization —our top priority. We regard the OSCE principles including a country's right to choose its own securityarrangements  to be of fundamental value to ensuringpeace and security. We believe that  by taking this way we will meet our economic  cultural  social and otherconcerns and enhance European security as a whole.On the subregional level  we stress practicalcooperative efforts to uphold democratic and economictransformation throughout the region. Over the pastdecade  our engagement with Poland has turned into aclose partnership that has already produced remarkableresults. Good bilateral relations with the neighbouringstates of Latvia and Estonia have grown into a dynamictrilateral Baltic cooperation  which has expanded into a10broader Baltic-Nordic cooperation. We also seek tofurther develop mutually beneficial good-neighbourlyrelations with Russia. Joint Lithuanian-Russianprojects on cooperation with the Kaliningrad region area good example of our pursuit of a foreign policy offriendly relations  which also fully coincides with theEuropean Union's Northern Dimension policiesendorsed at the Feira European Union summit thisJune.Cooperation requires wisdom and patience. Yet all too often  guns have been a choice of cure for ethnicstrife and social or economic collapse. Vigorous andurgent efforts are needed to curtail the proliferation ofsmall arms. We deem it vital for the 2001 UnitedNations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Armsand Light Weapons in All Its Aspects to address criticalissues in the field of transparency  legitimate transfers accountability  enforcement of sanctions andobservance of moratoriums. A commitment to theelimination of landmines should now be coupled withan effort towards putting small arms off limits tobelligerent causes.Against the background of gains in disarmament a number of setbacks have made the picture lessencouraging. We share the profound concerns arousedby the abundance of weapons of mass destruction andthe proliferation of missiles. I fail to see any way tocreate a safer world other than reducing  eliminatingand outlawing weapons of mass destruction. In thewake of the successful outcome of the 2000 ReviewConference of the States Parties to the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) Lithuania will work with other committed nations toachieve unequivocal commitment to nucleardisarmament.Certain fundamental values are essential tointernational relations. Such are human responsibilityand human rights. At the Millennium Summit President of Lithuania Valdas Adamkus spoke abouthis belief that“in the face of a globalized tomorrow  the UnitedNations will increase the scope of its human-dimension activities. Human rights shouldbecome a cornerstone of the emerging worldstructure”. (A/55/PV.5)The concept of the human dimension must be at thecentre of all United Nations activities.If we are to address the root causes of conflict we have to admit that respect for human rights  theprotection of minority rights and the institution ofpolitical arrangements in which all groups arerepresented are vital. For my region  of particularinterest is determining how the internationalcommunity can promote the rights of people copingwith the post-communist transition.The limits of human rights applicability are beingconstantly questioned. The United Nations shouldmove ahead in the search for new and more effectiveinstruments to fend off the challengers of human rights.Persons responsible for genocide  crimes againsthumanity  war crimes and crimes of aggression shouldbe brought to justice. If that is the goal which theinternational community is after  an effectiveInternational Criminal Court should start working assoon as possible. For its part  Lithuania will make goodon its commitment to ratify the Rome Statute by theend of this year.Based on the experience of my own country  Iwish to stress that increasing the equality of social economic  educational and political benefits acrossgender has a positive impact on economicdevelopment. These issues have been at the forefront ofthe agendas of all Lithuanian Governments sinceregaining independence  which have worked actively tohelp solve the question of equal rights and otherproblems which women face. One of our achievementsis the adoption of the Law on Equal Opportunities which is the first law of this kind in Central andEastern Europe. Being a signatory State to the SecondOptional Protocol to the Convention on the Eliminationof All Forms of Discrimination against Women  I callfor its early entry into force.The attainment of freedom  security and welfarefor people is feasible only by embracing the effects ofglobalization and not defying them. We have a globalinstrument readily available for that purpose  yet wekeep arriving at the same conclusion: we need a UnitedNations with greater capacity and better performance.A number of measures have been carried out. Theoutstanding efforts of the Secretary-General cannot beoverestimated. Lithuania supports the Secretary-General's greater emphasis on the United Nations as aresults-based Organization. We also endorse the stresson better management  mobilization of new resourcesand new forms of partnership. The Security Councilshould play its part in this regard. The lessons drawnfrom the Secretary-General's reports on Srebrenica andRwanda have to be paid more than lip service.Within the complex of measured designs forrevitalizing the United Nations  our efforts to reformthe Security Council occupy a prominent place. TheSecurity Council would only win if it acquired a newpower and authority base. I would like to reiterateLithuania's position that the Security Council shouldbe increased  both in permanent and non-permanentmembership categories  and that the Eastern EuropeanGroup should be given one additional non-permanentmembership seat. In turn  even with a revitalizedCouncil  cooperation with regional organizationsshould be strengthened.The reforms  no matter how far-flung  may onlyremain a partial success as long as the United Nationsis not given necessary resources. The Organizationneeds a sound and predictable financial footing.Therefore  Lithuania strongly supports acomprehensive review of both the regular-budget scaleand the scale of assessment for peacekeepingoperations. In the latter case  an ad hoc arrangement of1973 has lost its touch with present day economicrealities. We need to adjust the United Nationspeacekeeping scale of assessment methodology tobetter reflect the current economic conditions of allMember States. I hope that the revision will enjoysupport by all countries of the United Nations and willbe carried out in an expeditious manner.The United Nations symbolizes and guards thehumankind hope for a better future. Let's make ithappen!"
"101",4284,"LUX",55,2000,"Ms. Lydie Polfer  Vice-Prime Minister and Minister forForeign Affairs of Luxembourg regrets having had tocut short her stay in New York. She has asked me tomake this statement in her place.The Millennium Summit has given us thetestimony of the heads of State and Government. Thisexceptional meeting was the opportunity for a renewedcommitment of States throughout the world to ourOrganization  encouraging common efforts to giveevery citizen the freedom to enjoy a decent life andopening the way for self-fulfilment for individuals andtheir communities.We congratulate and commend you  Sir  as thenew President of the General Assembly. We alsoexpress our gratitude to your predecessor  Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  for the vigour of his presidency.Our Secretary-General has tirelessly emphasizedthe urgent need to act by innovating and ensuring asustained pace for the work of the Organization. Wealso commend him and especially encourage him tocontinue his work.My speech today will emphasize the themes ofLuxembourg's message to the Millennium Summit. Thespeech by Mr. Hubert VÈdrine  the French Minister forForeign Affairs  on behalf of the European Union fullyreflects the point of view of my country.In 1999 we restated the main themes of theLuxembourg Government's involvement in Europe andwithin the United Nations and its commitment tostrengthened international solidarity  demonstrated bythe fact that in 2000 my country has reached theobjective set by the United Nations of officialdevelopment assistance of 0.7 per cent of grossnational product. This year is a time to speak further ofthe principle of shared responsibility  because theworld has to face the old challenges of violence anddevelopment  as well as the more recent one ofglobalization.Globalization is both a source of achievement andcause for concern. It is ambivalent and requiresadequate instruments in order to manage it and gear ittowards equitable development. Without a commondefinition of the rules to be applied  it could give riseto bitterness and revolt. But the use of violence mightcompromise the path towards development. It is amatter of concern that worldwide arms sales have beenon the rise since 1996. The horror of constant violencecommitted by human beings against each other couldsimply make us grieve. However  such a passiveattitude would not do justice to the realities of thisworld. The number of armed conflicts has in fact gonedown  from 55 in 1992 to 36 in 1998  but this barestatistic does not explain how this decrease took place.2However  another statistic should grab our attention:between 1974 and 1999  113 countries went from anauthoritarian regime to a multi-party system. Moremeaningful than statistics is the encouraging fact thatthe number of negotiation processes has increased  thekey to their success often being innovative formulas toachieve peaceful coexistence where previously therewas deadlock and resentment.East Timor  the conference between Somalis inDjibouti and the new inter-Korean dialogue are recentexamples. In spite of the obvious difficulties  theseconstructive developments show by their number anddiversity that preventing conflicts is a strategy inmotion. We have to consolidate this strategy ofprevention in order to show that it produces lastingresults. Of course  there are many failures  and we mustnot close our eyes to the difficulties.In Kosovo  in particular  intolerant behaviour ledto a sort of blindness  even in people who hadthemselves suffered oppression. Psychology teaches usthat former victims do not always avoid eventuallybecoming executioners. We must put an end to thisvicious circle and stop unbridled criminality. Thecommitment of the Special Representative  BernardKouchner  and of all those who are working to brightena grey sky brings us a message of hope which will bearfruit.At the end of the cold war our hopes wereperhaps inspired by impatience. Today we see thatthere are solid foundations: above and beyondacademic investigations and the awakening ofconscience  concrete action is being taken. We thankthe community of organizations and individuals presentin the field; those who pay with their lives expectothers to support them and to provide the necessarymeans.But the major responsibility is not to disappointthose in direct need of assistance: victims  displacedpersons and refugees  those denied the protection of therule of law  even the means of subsistence. And whenmanagement deficiencies lead to short-sighted over-exploitation and stifling pollution of an environmentthat can take no more  this phenomenon should bereversed and responsibility established and assumed.How can we believe that catastrophes will gounnoticed or that international solidarity will not botherto analyse the cause of events?Crime must not pay. This concept will go fromtheory to practice in the globalization era. Informationis spreading ineluctably and innovations are beingmade. International law may be lagging behind certaintechnologies  but it is in the process of beingdeveloped. For example  universal participation in theoverall structure of multilateral treaties  which wasstrongly stimulated by the Millennium Summit.Another example is the courts to try war crimes genocide or crimes against humanity. After the creationof tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda some countries are considering establishing courts incooperation with the United Nations. National courtshave instituted proceedings  and as a result the era ofimpunity is ending. Luxembourg was the eighteenthState to ratify the Rome Statute of the InternationalCriminal Court  which will go into effect after 41 moreratifications.In democracy the rule of law prevails  butpolitical action is crucial to its development. Throughthe major conferences of the 1990s and their follow-ups  the United Nations has shown clearly that suchconferences are also an important source of law. Theguidelines that emerge stimulate the creation ofdomestic laws  and their juxtaposition produces a vast internationally recognized network. Future actions including the campaign against small arms  financingfor development and the World Conference againstRacism  will help promote the rule of law. Stable  butnot rigidly fixed  transparent and subject to democraticcontrols  the rule of law is certainly one of the mostreliable pillars for development.But the international community and the UnitedNations will have to build other pillars as well as partof the structure for a world in which poverty andviolence no longer threaten us. Without going intodetail  I refer to the need to remember  respect forequality  the will for prevention and openness tocooperation.The century which is drawing to a close was themost terrible in the history of mankind in terms ofabsolute numbers of victims  and also in conceptualterms  because it led to the development and use ofweapons of mass destruction. Above all  it saw severalcases of genocide on an unheard-of scale  openlymotivated by the most despicable racism. It is essentialto study the mechanisms which lead to theseaberrations into inhumanity  because repetitions of such3destructive phenomena should be rejected and madeimpossible.The conclusion to be drawn is that we shouldremember  which means escaping from ignorance andalways bearing in mind the lessons of the past. If thecountries of the European Union are very sensitivewhenever they encounter xenophobia  racism and therejection of those who are different  it is because weare resolved at all costs to act to avoid once againsuccumbing to the sickness of hatred. A Europe with agrowing population  a European Union spreading to theeast and the south  must act with determination tocontinue the course of openness.Luxembourg is a laboratory with a mixture ofpeoples  as a result of our being at the crossroads ofFrench and German culture and because of the impactof immigration of long ago. The moral outlook of itscitizens leads them to respect others and theirindividuality. With the coming of sovereignty independence and development became a reality forour country  and with them a strong adherence to theprinciple of equality  whether of individuals or States.It is the responsibility of all States to expose thedangers of any tendency to feel contempt for others.Unfortunately  division and lack of respect for theworth of the individual can be seen on every continent.Only five years ago the world deplored the mostviolent racist crimes in Bosnia and Rwanda. Suchcrimes must be rejected  for they create openings thatthe prejudiced quickly take advantage of. We mustcollectively assume responsibility in the fight againstthis vicious circle.Respect for equality requires that we do not makeindependence a sanctuary. Rather  it demands that weaccept each other as partners and recognize thelegitimacy of our respective interests. Thanks to theprogress of the European Union  classic sovereigntyhas been replaced for its member States by aninterdependence whose positive effects are impressive.The solution  in the year 2000  is no longer abstractindependence  but concrete cooperation.Throughout the year 2000  the Security Councilhas devoted a great deal of time to Africa inrecognition of the seriousness of the phenomenon oftaking large portions of countries hostage. Some ofthese crises are being fuelled by the exploitation ofnatural resources. The significant international reactionto these events is encouraging  but it must also lead tothe elimination of these situations. Among them  I willmention the problems in Angola  Sierra Leone and theDemocratic Republic of the Congo.These catastrophes  along with otherdevelopments  in particular in East Timor  insouthern Lebanon and along the border betweenEthiopia and Eritrea  have contributed to aconsiderable increase in United Nations peacekeepingactivities. However  these activities are suffering froma lack of resources  to such an extent that both theiroperations and their credibility are compromised.Instead of being a deterrent  they risk becoming simplyan alibi.I hope that this session will be able to adoptenergetic measures to implement the recommendationsof the Panel on United Nations Peace Operations chaired by Mr. Brahimi. The lack of financial resourcesshould not be an insurmountable obstacle. Further  it isappropriate to take up this issue as part of this session'sagenda item on the scale of assessments forpeacekeeping operations. But in fact  these activitiesare above all operations aimed at maintainingceasefires. Achieving peace requires other efforts first and foremost the will to prevent conflicts and thedetermination to avoid their resurgence.After the research  the passionate discussions andthe debates  most recently those that took place inthe Security Council and in the General Assemblycommittee on the prevention of conflicts in Africa have we found sufficient will to now take action? Sucha critical mass is necessary if a determined will toprevent conflicts is going to be manifested.Human solidarity will be essential in thoseinstances in which the parties show they are incapableof avoiding conflict and when attacks on the integrityof individuals and major material consequences can beclearly foreseen. Indifference and lack of assistance inthe face of danger no longer accord with the universalawareness of the reality of our interconnectedness which grows in parallel with the spread of knowledge.This is an ethical issue  but it is also an issue ofknowledge and technical resources. Luxembourgintends to create a civilian action corps to go onhumanitarian and human development missions.Luxembourg will contribute to the United Nationsfunds for peace-building  and it is involved inpeacekeeping operations and in reconstructionmissions.4The will to prevent conflicts entails the ability tochoose from among a great range of mechanisms thatare capable of dissuading those who  as a result ofignorance or provocation  are turning to aggression.This will to prevent conflicts can be that much moreeffective in managing disputes if it is invoked wellbefore violence breaks out. Over eight years  thediscreet action of the High Commissioner on NationalMinorities of the Organization for Security andCooperation in Europe  Mr. Max van der Stoel  hasamply justified the confidence placed in him by 55European States and former Soviet Republics and hasproduced significant results.When people are struggling in isolation  externalcooperation and solidarity can remove the mostdifficult obstacles. The noteworthy HumanDevelopment Report 2000 of the United NationsDevelopment Programme stresses the importance ofpreventing conflicts  of inclusive democracy and ofrespect for human rights as means of preventingcountries that have been bled white from beingexcluded from the benefits of the global economy andof global technology.For their part  Mr. Annan and Mr. Brahimi remindus that every action to reduce poverty and ensure asolid foundation for growth is a step towardspreventing conflicts. This is one of the keys ofdevelopment. It is a very reliable method for buildingconfidence and reducing poverty. It is a responsibilitythat we must take up.The effort cannot be undertaken unless externalcooperation is not in itself an obstacle. In many cases itgives rise to questions and resistance. But cooperationthat is not welcome is pointless. Unfortunately  at timesmistrust and a certain pride prevail and lead to afortress mentality. This in turn can lead tooveremphasizing identity issues and to thedevelopment of a mental block.When a terrifying earthquake rocked Turkey in1999  the Greeks offered their assistance. This gestureand the Turks' acceptance of it have profoundlytransformed bilateral relations that have beenparticularly difficult. This positive  spontaneousdevelopment was the result of the awareness of ForeignMinisters Papandreou and Cem that the ongoing harmbeing caused by the earlier mistrust was not acceptable.This positive development is continuing  and it isgreatly hoped that it will soon be reflected in theconversations  under the aegis of the United Nations between the Greek and Turkish Cypriotcommunities  conversations that are at presentindirect.When confidence comes up against the invisiblewall of ignorance  even the tendered hand will not betaken. Thus  those who are separated by apsychological chasm should construct a bridgehead andexpress in a decent manner their willingness to achievemutual recognition.The Israelis and Palestinians were reconciled insignificant ways as a result of the Camp Davidconversations. President Clinton  for his perseverance Prime Minister Barak and President Arafat  for theirawareness of history and their common acceptance oftheir shared responsibility to the future  deserveencouragement and the firmest support in their effort toconclude this historic process. I am convinced that theresources of this dialogue have not been exhausted.There is an opportunity to achieve  within the next fewweeks  a framework agreement. It must remain clearthat the willingness to cooperate has been firmlyestablished. This willingness will be seconded by thewillingness of the international community  and ofEurope in particular  to offer its support to theestablishment of peace and to the reconstructionefforts.The sculpting of the role of the United Nations the shape of its future work  will be a complex anddemanding task if we expect the Organization to escapeits current fragility and affirm its responsibility. Butperhaps we can rely increasingly on the vast experiencethat has been gained during past actions. Thedevelopment of this collection of experiences requiresincreasing internal cohesion. The responsibility for thedevelopment of this cohesion falls on theOrganization's Members. This is the objective we mustset for ourselves. The willingness to cooperate mustlead to the elaboration of healthy administrative andfinancial structures  as well as to balanced relationsbetween the principal organs  none of which should beexempt from periodic reform.Today the United Nations cannot be said to be ina position to meet these criteria. Therefore  is it notindispensable that its Members pay their assessmentswithout delay or conditions  and in full?The fact that the Security Council is not beingreformed and the distance between the Council and thevast majority of General Assembly members does not5contribute to the effectiveness of the Organization. Thebridges that the United Nations will try to constructshould include  in order to seek greater unity of action a reinvigorated relationship between the GeneralAssembly and a duly enlarged Security Council.The United Nations will be put to the test. As aresult of the pursuit of globalization the Organizationwill be in demand. Will it be capable of meeting thechallenge and of responding in a way that will put theOrganization at the centre of the major internationaldiscussions? Even after the Millennium Summit itwould be rash to claim that this question is closed.Luxembourg hopes that it will be possible to respondpositively  and Luxembourg reaffirms its willingness tocooperate so that we can proceed together in thisdirection."
"102",4310,"LVA",55,2000,"Finding ourselves in a newcentury and in a new millennium  it is natural to reviewwhat we have done right and to meditate also on whatwe could have done better. The United Nations is theforum and the system that allows us to contemplate thestatus of the world's development from the widestpossible perspective.Latvia is small  but the success of our democracyand the success of our efforts at European integrationwill have a strong positive effect on the destiny of theBaltic Sea region. The success of an Organization likethe United Nations can be measured by how its workhas affected the lives of individual people in allcountries. In the age of globalization the challenge we7collectively face is to ensure that all can bebeneficiaries.As a result of the revolution in informationtechnology  the world has grown smaller. Nations andpeople are closer to each other than ever before. Thisunderlines the importance of the principle ofuniversality. Today the decisions taken in one part ofthe globe affect people and nations all around theworld. This calls for wider representation and  in thecase of the United Nations  for the reform of theSecurity Council  which needs to be carried out toreflect the present political and economic realities.To respond to modern challenges  the UnitedNations needs both political will and courage. In thisregard  I would like to express my appreciation to theSecretary-General for his efforts in strengthening andmodernizing the Organization through its reforms.The United Nations also needs to be betterequipped to prevent and manage conflicts.Unfortunately  the demand for peacekeeping is stillhigh. The Member States  both individually andcollectively  must do more to meet this demand. Latviahas done its best to make its practical contribution topeace and security. During the past year Latvia'speacekeepers have been present in Bosnia andHerzegovina and Kosovo as a part of North AtlanticTreaty Organization-led forces. In accordance with theUnited Nations decision to extend the mandate for theoperation in Kosovo  Latvia will continue itsparticipation and will allocate more resources forpeacekeeping operations in next year's budget.As a future member of the European Union Latvia attaches great importance to the development ofa common European security and defence policy thatwill increase the European capabilities in conflictprevention and crisis management. We are willing tocontribute our forces and to participate in EuropeanUnion operations.To provide the United Nations with proper toolsfor peacekeeping  the reforms of the scale ofcontributions must be implemented to reflect thecapabilities and responsibilities of every Member State.At the same time  the United Nations must ensure thatthe resources are spent wisely and operations managedproperly. For its part  Latvia is considering a review ofits contribution to the peacekeeping budget with a viewto gradually increasing its share.Human rights must remain high on the agenda ofthe United Nations in the twenty-first century. As amember of the Commission on Human Rights and itsBureau  Latvia remains strongly committed to thestrengthening of the United Nations human rightsmechanisms. In particular  the role of the Office of theUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rightsand its programmes  including the development ofnational capacities for the promotion and protection ofhuman rights  should be strengthened.Latvia remains committed to the establishment ofthe International Criminal Court. We welcome theefforts of its Preparatory Commission in tackling thetask of finalizing the texts of the rules of procedure andevidence  and the elements of crime  in a timelymanner. Those who commit crimes against humanitymust not go unpunished.Fifty years of foreign occupation left us with aheavy social  economic and psychological burden.From the time of our return to independence in 1991 Latvia has made every effort to overcome this legacy.To be successful in the new millennium  we need theconsolidated input of all our people  regardless of theiroccupation  ethnicity or place of residence. That is whythe Latvian Government has elaborated its programmeof integration of society. This is an experiment and inmany ways unique. The integration programme is ourvision of how our society can function most effectivelyon the basis of democracy and respect for humanrights.This programme complements the integrationmeasures being implemented through education withthe help of the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme. The programme will increase publicparticipation and it will reduce differences among thevarious regions of Latvia. It is a sign of Latvia'sreadiness to explore new ways of improving the livingstandards and the social climate.Latvia's international role has grown in the pastdecade of freedom. Each year we are able to do morefor the people of Latvia and the internationalcommunity. With the beginning earlier this year oftalks for European Union membership  Latvia entered anew phase in its international relations. This NovemberLatvia will assume the presidency of the Council ofEurope  our first presidency in a pan-Europeanorganization.8Latvia is determined to participate even moreactively in the work of the United Nations. ThereforeLatvia has put forward its candidacy to be a non-permanent member of the Security Council for theperiod of 2006 to 2007. I believe Latvia is ready toassume this high responsibility.It is an honour to present Latvia's perspectivehere today at the outset of the fifty-fifth session of theGeneral Assembly. I wish all of us a very useful andproductive session."
"103",4357,"MAR",55,2000,"Allow me first of all to congratulate you very warmly Sir  on your assumption of the presidency of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-fifth session. TheMoroccan delegation will spare no effort in giving youevery support to ensure the success of your work. Iwould also like to thank your predecessor and to wishhim every success in his responsibilities.I also cannot fail to pay a very warm and specialtribute to Secretary-General Kofi Annan  who has ledthe Organization with such conviction  tenacity andcompetence. I take this opportunity to congratulate himon his efforts to ensure the success of the MillenniumSummit.I also wish to convey my congratulations to theState of Tuvalu  which recently joined membership ofthe United Nations.Multilateral relations have become the mostrealistic approach to transnational problems in a worldundergoing the process of globalization. It is quiteclear that a collective response is more necessary nowthan ever before in our approach to the seriousproblems of today's world. It is obvious that no countryor group of countries can claim to be able to take solecharge of the numerous problems of besetting thecomity of nations. When we consider nuclearproliferation  weapons of mass destruction  thedeterioration of the environment  endemic poverty organized transnational crime  the drug problem andother such problems  we are compelled to recognize thescope of the strenuous efforts that will have to be madeby the international community to deal effectively withthem.Despite the tremendous progress that has beenmade in recent years in all sectors of human activity and despite the potential benefits heralded by theglobalization of economies and technologicalbreakthroughs  half of the world's population continuesto live in a state of abject poverty. Morocco believesthat efforts to reduce poverty and to ensure sustainabledevelopment require international action in order tointegrate the developing countries in the globaleconomy and new reforms  undertaken by the countriesconcerned  to meet the essential needs of their peopleswith respect to health care  education and employment.Similarly  trade barriers must be reduced for thosegoods that are of particular benefit to the exports of thedeveloping countries  particularly the least developedcountries. Medium-income countries should be relievedof their debt burden so that they can devote theresources thus freed to investments in social andeconomic infrastructures.In this context  Morocco believes that the timehas come for international institutions  particularly theBretton Woods institutions and the World TradeOrganization  to adopt a new approach to assisting thecountries of the South in their development efforts.These institutions must adapt themselves to the newinternational context in order to redress the imbalancesbetween the countries of the North and the South which have grown considerably since the external-debtcrisis. The total statistical indices available and thelessons learned from the paradoxical trends that areintrinsic to the world economy reveal the need to seeknew sources for financing and sustainabledevelopment. That being so  Morocco places greathopes on the holding of a world conference in the year2001 on financing for development and hopes that atthat time bold initiatives will be taken in order toalleviate the intensity of poverty in the world.20Morocco is rooted profoundly in its Africanismand is therefore very much concerned about thegrowing number of hot spots in Africa and also theillicit traffic in small arms that feeds those conflicts. Itis extremely regrettable that our continent holds theunhappy record for refugees throughout the world victims of wars  as well as for epidemics  for exampleAIDS  malaria and many others. Only a concertedeffort on the part of the African countries  with thesupport of the international community  will be able toreverse the current trend. Africa  which has been tornby armed conflicts  presents the image of a continentdrifting aimlessly. Nevertheless  we Africans havealways been known for our wisdom and our natural giftfor negotiation and conciliation.We would like here to make a pressing appeal toall those involved to renounce resorting to force as ameans of solving disputes. Africa has wasted a greatdeal of time in internal quarrels  thus passing upvaluable opportunities for developing and becoming anintegral part of the world economy. The financial andhuman resources the belligerent parties have wastedkilling each other could have been better utilized toserve social and economic development projects intheir respective countries and could have helped themto overcome all the problems that they face. That iswhy we support all the initiatives that have beenrecommended by the United Nations to set up astrategy to prevent conflicts and to improvemechanisms for intervention in these cases. As always Morocco supports all those initiatives that help tostrengthen peace and security in Africa. In this regard Morocco has responded to the United Nations appeal toparticipate in the peace mission in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo.The marginalization of Africa is a seriousobstacle to its integration in global development. Ourcontinent receives only 2 per cent of internationalinvestments  whereas the population of our continent isin excess of 700 million. While it is true thatresponsibility for development of the continent restsfirst and foremost on the shoulders of the Africans  it isequally true that the resources available to the Africanscannot meet the considerable needs of their populationsin all fields.For that reason  it is becoming more and moreurgent to help Africa by displaying solidarity in orderto ensure that it embarks on the road to progress security and peace  specifically by developing itshuman resources  and by educational policies that areadapted to the realities of the continent and are inharmony with the values of that continent and itscivilizations. We also have to consider the question ofthe debt of African countries so that the treatment ofthis problem can finally generate wealth rather than bean obstacle to development. The effort of Africancountries should also be supported by opening themarkets of the developed countries to their productsand their exports.For its part  Morocco intends to spare no effort tomake its contribution to improving the livingconditions of African peoples — hence  the decisionthat was announced by His Majesty King MohammedVI at the African-European Summit in Cairo  adecision to cancel the debt of the least-developedAfrican countries to the Kingdom of Morocco  and alsoto remove customs barriers to their exports. We hopethat other countries  particularly the rich andindustrialized ones  will make a similar gesture.Morocco believes that the peace that we all aspireto in the Middle East can only be brought about ifinternational legal principles are respected  particularlySecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338(1973)  the principles which emerged from the MadridConference  particularly the principle of land for peace as well as the commitments and the agreements thatwere concluded between the parties concerned.Peace in this region to which Morocco is soattached can only take place when Israel withdrawsfrom all occupied Palestinian territories and the SyrianGolan. The international community must assist thePalestinian people to recover its legitimate andinalienable rights  first and foremost its right to set upits own independent State on its territory with Al QodsAl-Sharif as its capital.Morocco  on the initiative of His late MajestyKing Hassan II  may God have mercy on his soul  andhis successor King Mohammed VI  will spare no effortto usher in the establishment of just and comprehensivepeace in the Middle East.His Majesty King Mohammed VI  as chairman ofthe Al-Qods Committee  during the State visit toWashington in June 2000  made an appeal to the partiesconcerned to start upon a fruitful dialogue between thecultures and civilizations and:21“to all believers  people of the Book and in thisfaith which have united the children of Abraham to liberate this thrice holy city from hatred andresentment.”These same principles were reiterated by theCommittee on Al-Qods during its most recent meeting which was held on 28 August under the presidency ofHis Majesty Mohammed VI. Morocco would like tojoin its voice with all peace and justice-lovingcountries so that the current efforts may be crownedwith success  which will make it possible for allpeoples in the region to live in peace  stability andsecurity.The Moroccan people share the joy of ourbrothers  the people of Lebanon  as a result of theIsraeli withdrawal from its territory  and we willcontinue to give our unflagging support to the peopleof Syria to reassume total sovereignty over the GolanHeights  which is occupied by Israel.We are also following with some disquiet theburdensome conditions imposed upon the Iraqi peopleby the embargo which has deprived people  particularlychildren  of food and medicine and many other needsas well. Morocco  for its part  feels anxious at thedeterioration of the food and health situation in Iraq.We support all international efforts to lift sanctionsagainst that fraternal country. We consider furthermorethat safeguarding the sovereignty and territorialintegrity of Iraq is a fundamental prerequisite forstability in the region.Morocco welcomes the suspension of the airembargo imposed on Libya. We also hope that the totalembargo will be finally lifted as soon as possible.Morocco  aware as it is of its responsibilities  issparing no effort to make the Maghreb an area of peaceand peaceful coexistence among all peoples in theregion. The partners in the Arab Mahgreb Union mustget beyond their current economic problems and acceptthe fact that the only way to develop the region andensure its security and stability is to build this Union in which our peoples have placed great hopes particularly at this time when the requirements ofglobalization make the establishment of regionalgroups yet more important.Among the challenges faced by the Mahgreb there is the so-called problem of the Western Sahara. Iwould like to take this opportunity first and foremost toconfirm that the Kingdom of Morocco  which initiatedthe referendum  has cooperated completely in itsimplementation and has indeed made a number ofsacrifices to allow the population of that region toreassert its will.We have been very patiently following the effortsundertaken by the Secretary-General to allow thisprocess to reach a successful conclusion. We havesupported all the efforts that have been made  since weare convinced that  in the final analysis  thereferendum  while ensuring respect for self-determination  will eventually confirm the rights of ourcountry to territorial integrity and its sovereignty overthe entire southern territory.As everyone knows and as has been emphasizedby the Secretary-General and by the Security Councilin various reports  the referendum's implementation —to which  in contrast to what some have claimed  weremain committed — has come up against a number ofproblems that may  if not resolved  endanger andcompromise the entire process. What essentially needsto be done is to ensure  without any kind of partialityor leniency  that the entire Saharan population  as hasalways been agreed  may express its wishes inaccordance with the letter and spirit of the referendumplan.If the referendum is to be democratic  free andequitable  it must be subject to a number of rules thatno one can transgress by trying to accommodate oneparticular party at the expense of the other.The Secretary-General and his SpecialRepresentative are still actively involved in this task.We will continue to give them our total cooperation sothat the various difficulties besetting theimplementation of this plan can be overcome.Our country has made its own contribution to theefforts by making a number of suggestions that shouldbe acted upon if we want to have a democratic impartial and equitable referendum. We would repeatthat  for our part  while we remain committed to thecontinuation of this process and respect the rules set upfor it  we will give our total support to any action thatthe Secretary-General and his Personal Envoy  Mr.James Baker  undertake to resolve this dispute onceand for all. As His Majesty King Mohammed VI statedon 30 June 2000  any settlement must be carried out inthe context of the sovereignty  legality and unanimityof the Moroccans.22This being said  Morocco would like to draw theinternational community's attention to the situation ofthe tens of thousands of refugees who have beenforcefully displaced and who have been living underinhumane conditions  according to the reports ofinternational humanitarian organizations  of diplomatswho have had access to the camps  and of the hundredsof escapees who have managed to return to the Sahara.The international community can no longer tolerate thesuffering of these people because of delays andconsiderations they themselves are not responsible for.No one can disregard the fact that the Kingdomsof Spain and Morocco are joined by the unbreakableties of their age-old history  their geographical andcultural closeness  and by their common destiny as partof the Euro-Mediterranean region. Because of ourdesire to safeguard these excellent fraternal andneighbourly relations Morocco has constantly appealedto friendly Spain and to all political forces in Spain tofind a solution that will spare our children unnecessarysuffering from crises inherited from a painful past.Spain  which is a great friend and neighbour must understand that the occupation of the twoMoroccan cities of Septa and Melilla and theneighbouring islands is not in accord either withinternational law nor with the sense of history. Basedon similar situations  we are convinced that it ispossible to devise a settlement that will both safeguardthe sovereignty of Morocco and respect and protect theeconomic  social and cultural interest of Spain in bothof these cities.For this reason  on a number of occasions theKingdom of Morocco has suggested — on the initiativeof His late Majesty Hassan II  may God preserve hissoul — that a Moroccan-Spanish think tank be createdin order to bring about a final resolution of thesituation regarding Septa and Melilla and theneighbouring islands.Our two countries are duty bound to spare ourpeoples and our region from all possiblemisunderstanding and resentment. It is for this reasonthat Morocco offers a hand of peace to Spain  invitingit to commit to a common dialogue so as to resolveonce and for all this territorial dispute inherited fromthe remote past.Morocco  because of its geopolitical position attaches particular importance to stability and tostrengthening cooperation in the Mediterranean basin.Relations between Morocco and the Europeancountries is of great strategic importance in view of thevarious historic  political  economic  cultural andhuman ties that unite us and in view of the values weshare. The mutual attraction between Morocco andEurope derives from history  geography and commonstrategic needs  while a range of mutual interests havenaturally made the European Community Morocco'sfirst partner in a number of areas relating tointernational cooperation. Relations with the EuropeanUnion have developed quite significantly this year withthe coming into force of the Association Agreement of1 March. This agreement marks a decisive stage in ourrelations with the European region since it is builtessentially on four fundamental pillars: politicaldialogue; economic  cultural  technical and socialcooperation; enhanced financial cooperation; and theprogressive and responsible development of a free-trade zone by the year 2012.Morocco is currently waiting for the EuropeanUnion to carry out the qualitative leap that will make itpossible to redirect our association along new strategicand innovative lines — governed by agreed modalities by shared responsibilities and by co-development in allsectors of common interest.It is our hope that the flow of direct investmentsinto Morocco and to the other countries of North Africaas well will be encouraged in order to help create massemployment  which is so essential to keep our youthaway from social evils and to consolidate the bases ofour progress in regional stability.It is also our hope that the cultural interests andthe cultural identity of our Moroccan community inEurope will be safeguarded and that the dignity of ournationals will be constantly protected in accordancewith the democratic values that are the underpinning ofthe European structure. In this context we can together  conceive of a Mediterranean region wheresecurity and peace prevail as well as a strengthenedEuropean/Mediterranean partnership.In disarmament matters  Morocco appreciates theconsiderable advances made by the Review Conferenceof the Parties to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) which took place in New York in May of this year.We hope that Israel will respond positively to theConference's appeal to accede immediately to the NPTand place its nuclear installations under the safeguardsof the International Atomic Energy Agency. We are23convinced that such a decision on the part of the Israeliauthorities will be a major contribution to ushering in aclimate of peace  trust and stability in the region.Morocco supports the initiative of the Secretary-General to organize an international conference thatwould make it possible to find appropriate means to putan end to the nuclear threat.It is Morocco's firm conviction that the UnitedNations continues to be the most appropriate tool andinstrument for settling conflicts and for building peace.It is therefore high time that the Organization set upcredible machinery and early warning mechanisms toreact in an appropriate way before conflicts break outas recommended in the report of the high-level expertPanel on United Nations Peacekeeping Operations.The United Nations and its specialized agenciesare now more necessary than ever to contain andresolve the problems of security and development.The United Nations must continue to be thecornerstone of strong multilateral cooperation.The complexity and interdependence of theproblems before us mean that we must increaseinternational cooperation and consultation. For thatreason  a new era in international relations necessitatesa reform of the Security Council by revising itsfunctions and its membership. Such a reform willundoubtedly confer greater credibility on the SecurityCouncil and make it better adapted to perform itsmandate in maintaining international peace andsecurity. Despite difficulties  the main point is toensure the best possible representation in the SecurityCouncil of the various current components of theUnited  particularly the developing countries.The end of the ideological rivalry between thetwo super Powers means that we can entertain newprospects that there will emerge an international orderbased on justice  peace  international legality andhuman rights as well as democracy and development an order that will make use of the Charter as a work ofreference and that will take into account the growinguniversalization of the Organization and the fact thatnew global social challenges are emerging and also thatrecent socio-strategic changes have occurred.Finally  we are convinced that if the UnitedNations directs its actions along these lines  it willfinally meet the ideals for which it was founded."
"104",4381,"MCO",55,2000,"Allowme  first of all  to congratulate you most warmly  Mr.President  on your election to the presidency of thefifty-fifth session of the General Assembly. Allow mealso to express the conviction that under your authorityour work will be conducted with the same high level ofvision and competence demonstrated by the Presidentof your country  Ms. Tarja Halonen  in herCo-Chairpersonship of the Millennium Summit at theside of the President of Namibia  Mr. Sam Nujoma. Ialso extend my thanks and congratulations to theSecretary-General  who continues to imbue theinternational Organization and the entire internationalstaff he commands with the virtues of rigour moderation and integrity that he embodies in hisservice to the great ideals of the Organization.Those are the same ideals that have just beenreaffirmed by the Heads of State and Government.They also reaffirmed their confidence in the capacity ofthe United Nations to ensure the advancement of  andrespect for  those ideals so long as the internationalcommunity gives the Organization the necessarysupport through a renewed commitment.For a small State such as Monaco  nothing ismore important than such a reaffirmation of the idealsthat should govern relations between sovereign Statesin a spirit of equality and dignity. It is not a question ofdisregarding the profound differences that may existbetween States with regard to their objectivecharacteristics  influence or weight in the affairs of theworld. However  it is appropriate to reaffirm the factthat  no matter how small  each State should enjoy theright to respect  and that all States are be bound by thesame rules in conducting international affairs.Its history of over seven centuries makes itpossible for Monaco to gauge what that reaffirmationrepresents  a reaffirmation supported by the commondetermination of all States represented here. For its2part  the Principality associates itself fully with theimpetus provided by the Millennium Summit. To theextent it is able  Monaco intends to contribute todeveloping the full potential of that impetus.Allow me  before I touch on the principal issueswe will be dealing with at this session  in whichMonaco has a longstanding interest  to address atopic that seems to require some clarification: thePrincipality of Monaco itself.Though the notoriety enjoyed by the Principalityseems well established  since the whole world hasheard of it  all too often people have a one-sided viewof it in which it is reduced to a set of appealing butvaguely archaic clichÈs.Many people still believe that the casino is themain source of income for the State  while in fact theassessment paid by the SocietÈ des Bains de Mer which manages the casino  yields only 4 per cent ofpublic revenue. The rest derives primarily from taxesand income from public property. In truth  the structureof our budget is not very different from that of anyother country. As concerns expenses  many might envyus  as we are able each year to devote a third of ourresources to investing in civil engineering projects.Many people also believe that we depend to alarge extent on tourism. We are pleased  of course  thatMonaco attracts about 6 million visitors a year. Buthere again reality contradicts the image of a tourism-dependent economy  because tourism accounts for only10 per cent of the principality's revenues. Of the rest 40 per cent  are the product of local or internationalcommerce  20 per cent of banking activities  10 percentof industrial activities  emanating from about 100high-technology  non-polluting companies  and therest derive from a variety of services.Clearly  Monaco  rather than being a sort of old-style paradise for a happy few  has all thecharacteristics of a highly developed country.In this connection  we must also note to whatextent the Principality provides jobs in the region.Though Monaco has 30 000 residents  it has 38 000workers  some 30 000 of which live outside of Monacoand commute to the Principality every day  whichenables them and their families to enjoy the samesocial benefits and educational  sports and medicalamenities as the people of Monaco themselves.Monaco is undoubtedly a small country  but itdoes not live in the past. On the contrary  we have abroad and modern outlook  and it is this vision that hasenabled us to become a highly developed State that usestate-of-the-art technology and is involved in massiveprojects  such as the one that has enabled us to buildout over the sea and thus expand our territory by morethan 20 per cent during the reign of the currentSovereign Prince.Although all of this is based on unarguable fact some still question the source of our prosperity. To oursurprise and indignation  we recently heard it said thatthe Principality was too lenient with respect to certaincriminal activities. Quite the opposite: we have soughtways and means of combating criminal activities andhave consistently reaffirmed our will to strengthen themeasures we take to meet the challenges of today.All foreign activities require Governmentauthorization  which is granted only following an in-depth investigation. Nearly every week theGovernmental Council must veto certain projects. Inthe area of banking and finance  monitoring systemshave been set up  and here we also rely on the help ofour great friend and neighbour  France. The legislationin place to combat money-laundering is the same asthat in most developed countries. In fact  in certainareas  it is even more stringent.Monaco has set up an information and monitoringservice on financial flows to allow for the involvementof legal authorities when necessary and for theexchange of information with the equivalent foreigninstitutions. The Principality is in no way a laissez-faire zone in which all types of wealth can beaccumulated. Nor can it be termed an `opaque'financial venue  unless we believe that transparencydoes not exist anywhere.Some see Monaco as a kind of fiscal paradise  asif we had attempted to create artificial mechanisms toattract floating capital and wealthy people trying toavoid taxation in their own countries. The truth is thatdirect taxation was abolished in 1869  at a time whenthere was no tax on the income of natural personsanywhere in the world  and thus competition could nothave been an issue. The fact that this situationcontinues to prevail today certainly places Monacoamong the countries having `soft' tax laws. But thereare  in fact  taxes: two-thirds of the country's incomeemanates from direct or indirect fiscal contributions 3that is to say  the value-added tax and the tax on theprofits realized from commercial  industrial andintellectual activities.In sum  Monaco is a highly developed countrythat wishes to be an active participant in the Europeansphere and that observes all international commitmentsto combat present-day scourges such as financialcriminality and money laundering  which pose a clearthreat to the equilibrium of financial systems. ThePrincipality is  by its very nature  supportive of itsenvironment  but this is also the will of leadership.I now turn to the basis of its external activities which also reflect its status as a small State focusing ona few areas in which its tradition  experience andabilities can provide added value at the internationallevel.One of our priorities has always beenhumanitarian action and social development. This wasmade clear when  on 26 June last  His Serene Highnessthe Hereditary Prince of Monaco  signed  in thepresence of the United Nations High Commissioner forRefugees  the two Optional Protocols to theConvention on the Rights of the Child  on theinvolvement of children in armed conflict and on thesale of children  child prostitution and childpornography.The actions taken in relation to the World Summitfor Social Development will be followed up during thespecial session to review the achievement of the goalsof the World Summit for Children  to be held next year.We expect that session effectively to address the issueof the protection of children  who are always the firstamong the civilian population to suffer in time of war.The Principality also wishes to contribute todevelopment at the public level as well as in terms ofthe non-governmental organizations  which are veryactive in Monaco  where they receive the strongsupport of all those who feel themselves morallyobligated to contribute to the activities undertaken in aspirit of solidarity by a country that allows them to leada privileged life. We expect from the upcomingConference on the fight against poverty in the leastdeveloped countries  to be held next May  and inparticular from the 10-year review of the outcome ofthe United Nations Conference on Environment andDevelopment  known as Rio + 10  a new impetus forinternational cooperation in these areas so vital to thefuture of humanity  in which progress is currentlylagging.It goes without saying that environmental issues including in particular those relating to the marineenvironment  have always been priority concerns forMonaco  situated as it is on the Mediterranean coast.We will continue to follow up on these activities and totake initiatives along the lines of those we have beenpromoting.I can only reaffirm the role that the Principalityplays in all relevant forums to intensify the struggleagainst the severe scourges of our times  such asterrorism  trafficking in drugs and in human beings and the illegal financial flows which they create orsustain.Let me conclude by expressing the hope that Ihave been able to provide a clearer view of thesituation in present-day Monaco  a situation ofcontrasts. Monaco is one of the smallest countries inthe world  but at the same time one of the most highlydeveloped. It is an anachronism for those with anunrealistic or prejudiced view  but its economicstructures reflect great modernity and dynamism. Itsimage may be identified with play and leisure  but thefact is that it creates jobs well beyond its borders. It isviewed as a curiosity  yet it remains an acknowledgedsovereign State  as proved by its participation in theprincipal international organizations and by the factthat its voice is heard in areas where its contributiondeserves to be taken into account.I could continue that list of contradictions  but Ithink those are sufficient to provide a key to what HisSerene Highness Prince Rainier III said when heopened the fabulous new Grimaldi Forum  aconference and cultural centre in Monaco  insummarizing the inspiration that has always sustainedhis dynasty and the Principality over the centuries:`One does not need a great territory to have greatdreams  or a great number of people to makethem come true."
"105",4406,"MDA",55,2000,"Allow meat the outset  Mr. President  to convey to you ourcordial congratulations and regards on your election asPresident of the fifty-fifth session of the GeneralAssembly. I am convinced that your competence andactive cooperation with United Nations Member Stateswill pave the way for a successful and fruitful session.I would also like to express sincere thanks to yourpredecessor  Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  Minister forForeign Affairs of Namibia  for the effective manner inwhich he guided the work of the previous session.At the same time  I wish to commend Mr. KofiAnnan  the Secretary-General  for his firm leadershipsince taking office and for his visionary and action-oriented report “We the peoples:”. This report  togetherwith the forward-looking Millennium Declaration adopted two weeks ago at the historic MillenniumSummit  sets an ambitious agenda for the UnitedNations for the twenty-first century.I would also like to convey our warmest welcometo Tuvalu  the newest Member of the United Nations.As we enter the new millennium  the prospectsfor the international community's evolution are markedby justified hopes  generated by the significant changesthat occurred in the international arena during the lastdecade  yet also by hesitation and sometimes byscepticism regarding our capacity to efficiently facetoday's worldwide challenges. The Millennium Summitoffered a unique opportunity to reflect on the globalproblems that confront the world today and to identifyand act on the challenges ahead. It reaffirmed thecentrality of the world Organization in addressing theglobal  social  security and economic needs for thebenefit of people. We have ahead of us a real challengeto reshape the United Nations so that it can realize itsuniversal goals of peace  human security  cooperation poverty eradication and sustainable development. Fromthis perspective  the Republic of Moldova attaches theutmost importance to the implementation of thecommitments inscribed in the United NationsMillennium Declaration.Though the international community  and inparticular international organizations  makes systematicefforts aimed at resolving conflicts  we shouldrecognize that these efforts sometimes fall short ofreaching their proposed goals. Currently  on theEuropean continent alone  we are witnessing a numberof unresolved conflicts and potentially crisis-generating situations.Democratic transformations and economicdevelopment in some South-Eastern Europeancountries  including the Republic of Moldova  are alsojeopardized by unresolved internal conflicts. In the past2eight years we have made sustained efforts to settle theconflict in the eastern region of the country  in fullcompliance with the principles of international law andinternational practice. The mechanism of settlement involving the Organization for Security andCooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the mediatingStates  Russia and Ukraine  has been established.Moldova is oriented towards a complete settlement ofthe conflict  respecting the principle of the sovereigntyand territorial integrity of my country  and at the sametime granting to the region autonomous status. Despitethe reasonable compromises proposed by theconstitutional authorities  separatist tendencies stillpersist. It is an apparent peace  which distracts theattention of the international community from theimperatives of finding ways to settle the conflict andsimultaneously impedes economic and democraticreforms.The situation becomes more difficult if the factthat the region is over-militarized is taken into account.Tens of thousands of tons of munitions  armaments andequipment  sometimes accounted for and sometimesnot  that are limited under the Treaty on ConventionalArmed Forces in Europe (CFE)  are deployed in theregion. An early  complete and unconditionalwithdrawal of foreign troops  munitions andarmaments  as stipulated in the OSCE Istanbul Summitdocuments  and as required by the CFE Treaty  wouldundoubtedly facilitate the peaceful and completesettlement of this conflict. I express our hope that together with our partners  and assisted by the relevantinternational organizations  we will be able to ensurethe implementation of the schedule for the withdrawalof foreign troops from the territory of Moldova. Iwould like to take this opportunity to express ourgratitude for the political and financial support grantedby a number of States in order to facilitate the processof withdrawal and the destruction of the armaments.Although some of the so-called frozen conflicts at least in our region  do not appear to be gettingworse  there is a growing sense of frustration that thesolution is not yet within our reach. It is thereforeimperative to enhance political awareness regardingunresolved or potential conflicts  with a view toactively involving the United Nations and relevantregional organizations in their settlement.It is well known that the settlement of an ongoingconflict requires incomparably greater political financial and moral efforts than are needed at the stageof preventing conflict. It has become obvious thatUnited Nations mechanisms and strategies for dealingwith threats to stability are inadequate. They need to bestrengthened  not only to resolve conflicts and conflictsituations  but  more important  to prevent them. Fromthis perspective  the Republic of Moldova fullysupports the Secretary-General's efforts to direct theUnited Nations strategy towards conflict prevention.We welcome the Brahimi report on peacekeepingoperations. In our view the implementation of itsrecommendations will significantly consolidate thecapacity of the United Nations in conflict prevention peacekeeping and peace-building.Member States should provide the Organizationwith the necessary support to enhance the rapiddeployment capabilities of the United Nations throughthe involvement of the United Nations standbyarrangements system. Given this context  I would liketo inform the Assembly that Moldova has alreadyestablished the legal and institutional framework for itsfuture participation in peacekeeping operations and theUnited Nations standby arrangements system.Disarmament and non-proliferation are essentialelements of the security architecture. The Republic ofMoldova  like many other countries  considers that weshould continue our efforts to achieve disarmament andnon-proliferation  with universal ratification of themajor multilateral disarmament instruments andnegotiations on biological weapons  ballistic missilesand small arms. In particular  we should reaffirm therole of the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty as thecornerstone of international peace  security andstrategic stability. The Republic of Moldova attachesthe utmost importance also to the issue of small andlight weapons  primarily to the effort to create effectiveinternational mechanisms for the prevention of theirillegal transfer  especially in areas of conflict. In thisrespect  we are prepared to bring our contribution tothe preparation of the international conference on illicittrafficking in small arms and light weapons in all itsaspects  to be held next summer.My country highly appreciates the proposals ofthe Secretary-General on the issues of development andpoverty eradication as reflected in the millenniumreport and in the report on the work of the Organizationsubmitted to the fifty-fifth session of the GeneralAssembly.3In conditions of globalization  which hasgenerated profound transformations in the globaleconomy  this issue becomes even more important particularly for less developed States and for Stateswith economies in transition. A United Nations systembetter adapted to the necessities of economicdevelopment should pay more attention to theharmonization of commercial policies  cooperation inthe technological field  and the monetary policies ofmember States and international institutions.In these efforts  the United Nations should enlistthe support of governmental economic and financialinstitutions  the private sector and non-governmentalorganizations  thus promoting a partnership with a viewto development. A redefinition of the cooperationframework and international help is needed  whichshould involve new strategies and investment policies.My country favours the elaboration of strategies of andmeasures for globalization management  and alsofavours the holding of a special session of the GeneralAssembly regarding globalization and a United Nationsconference on the less developed countries next year.In order to reach sustainable developmentfocused on the human being  there is a need to improvethe partnership among developing and developedcountries  international institutions and civil society.We consider that the United Nations  as a frameworkfor international cooperation  should play a key role insupporting and coordinating national efforts. Withinthe framework of the United Nations developmentprogrammes and funds  the United NationsDevelopment Programme (UNDP) plays a special rolein human sustainable development. United Nationsassistance provided through UNDP has contributed tostrengthening the legal and institutional frameworknecessary for the continuation of countries' reforms.Currently  the framework for cooperation betweenthe Republic of Moldova and the United NationsDevelopment Programme embraces approximately 40projects in the fields of governing and democracy environmental protection and regeneration  theprotection of fundamental human rights and freedoms the promotion of women  poverty reduction anderadication  economic and social strategies  and humansustainable development. I would also like to mentionthe important role of the United Nations EconomicCommission for Europe. By promoting thedissemination and implementation of the instrumentsof the Commission  we would ensure the adjustment ofeconomies in transition to international and Europeanstandards. Thus  the projects implemented by theUnited Nations Economic Commission for Europewould contribute directly to the integration of theseeconomies into the world economy.The Republic of Moldova supports the activity ofthese institutions. We consider  however  that theirfinancial resources should be increased and themanagement of resources should be more efficient. Wewelcome the actions undertaken by the UNDPAdministrator  reflected in the Administrator's businessplans  and those of the Executive Secretary of theUnited Nations Economic Commission for Europe meant to enhance the efficiency of the activities andresource management of these important institutions.We consider that the establishment of strong positionsregarding development policies  through anunderstanding of the characteristic conditions andspecific needs of countries  would contributesignificantly to the Organization's reaching its goals inthis domain.The reform of the Security Council lies at theheart of the general reform of the United Nations. Itshould be guided by the principles of equitablegeographic representation  democracy  effectiveness efficiency and transparency. It is on this foundationthat we can modernize the composition of the SecurityCouncil and bring it into line with the substantialincrease in the general membership of the UnitedNations since 1963  the year of the only previousreform of the Council. The Republic of Moldovapronounces itself in favour of a moderate enlargementof the Council's composition and of a reasonableincrease in the number of permanent and non-permanent members which would correspond to theprinciple of fair geographical distribution and ensurean adequate balance between the industrialized anddeveloping countries.Our country also welcomes the process ofrevitalization and improvement of the GeneralAssembly's efficiency and  at the same time  supportsthe idea of restoring the central role of the Assembly asthe debating and main representative body of theUnited Nations. We consider that it is necessary tocontinue the efforts to consolidate the coordinatingfunctions of the Economic and Social Councilregarding United Nations funds and programmes.Under existing conditions it is clear that UnitedNations reform will continue successfully only if the4financial problems affecting the Organization'sactivities are solved. We support the proposals aimed atthe reform of the United Nations scales of assessments including the peacekeeping scale  taking intoconsideration the payment capacity of each State.Despite the difficulties it faces  my country makesevery effort to reduce its United Nations budgetarrears.The evolution of the situation in the internationalarena in the past 55 years calls for imposes a newvision and a redefinition of the concrete mechanismsfor realizing the fundamental objectives of theOrganization  which spring essentially from thefounding philosophy of the Charter of the UnitedNations. In this respect  the Organization should drawconclusions from its own past and  relying onpermanent support from States  should accomplish newtasks from the perspective of adapting to theimperatives of time. We express our hope that theUnited Nations  which remains indispensable for theinternational community in the twenty-first century will be able to impose a positive direction on thisevolution."
"106",4450,"MDG",55,2000,"I join all those who have welcomedthe start of this fifty-fifth session of the GeneralAssembly. Endorsing the Millennium Declaration ofthe Millennium Summit  I reiterate its message: Letus — the peoples of the United Nations  faced withnew challenges; brothers and sisters  partners linked byand in our support for the principles of ourOrganization; with the expectations and constraints ofour countries and peoples  yearning for peace and well-being; likewise facing the requirements ofglobalization and the manifold risks of conflict andmarginalization — be united in our action; let us say:“We the peoples”  inspired by new hope and newmomentum  are for a better millennium.The delegation of Madagascar congratulates you Mr. President  on your unanimous election to presideover the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly  atribute both to your eminent diplomatic qualities and toyour country  Finland.We also pay tribute to Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab Minister for Foreign Affairs of Namibia  for thededication and determination he displayed in presidingover the fifty-fourth session.We convey our congratulations to the Secretary-General on his efforts he has made. His actions willbenefit all the citizens of the world  who are all anxiousto leave deprivation and poverty behind.I also take this opportunity to thank  from thisrostrum  the United Nations  for having adoptedresolution 54/96 M of 14 March 2000  as well as all thecountries and organizations that helped Madagascarfollowing the cyclone damage at the beginning of thisyear.With regard to restructuring the United Nations  itis high time to enact such proposals as enlarging thatcornerstone of collective peace that is the SecurityCouncil  streamlining the institutional structure tomake it work better  and improving the financialstructure with a view to a more equitable assessment ofcontributions. The power of the veto  which in itselfconstitutes a nullification of democracy  isincompatible with the founding principles of ourOrganization.We know that  unfortunately  Africa is a place ofperpetual conflict  but a new impetus is manifestingitself in the search for lasting peace and reconciliation.With regard to the crisis in Comoros  Madagascarrespects the position expressed by the Organization forAfrican Unity (OAU) at its thirty-sixth Assembly ofHeads of State and Government  held at Lomé. TheAntananarivo Agreement of April 1999 remains theviable solution for bringing to an end the separatistcrisis in Anjouan  a crisis that was caused by theunconstitutionality of the regime currently in power.Madagascar welcomes the efforts undertaken inBurundi by President Nelson Mandela in his capacity18as mediator and facilitator. Those efforts led to thesigning of the Arusha agreement  which we hope willallow the people of Burundi to be united once againand to find peace and a new impetus for development.Madagascar has long supported the struggle forself-determination of the Sahraoui people andencourages the implementation of the United NationsSettlement Plan as the only viable mechanism able toresolve the differences between the two parties.We welcome the outcome of the mediation effortsundertaken by President Ismail Omar Guelleh of theRepublic of Djibouti. Thanks to those efforts  Somaliais now beginning to find peace after more than adecade as a non-State. The election by the parliamentin Djibouti on 25 August 2000 of Mr. AbdikassimSalad Hassan as the new President is a step towardsagreement. The people of Somalia can now embarkupon the process of restoring a State of law and civilpeace through their own efforts and with the support ofthe international community.The desire in recent months for dialogue betweenthe two Koreas is encouraging. We welcome thesummit conference held in Pyongyang in June 2000 todiscuss peaceful reunification that led to the signing ofa joint North-South declaration. The family reunionsthat took place after half a century of separation weremoving  and such meetings should be facilitated in thefuture. The decision to have the athletes of the Northand South march together at the Olympic Games inSydney reflects a desire for reconciliation.Madagascar is a peaceful island in the IndianOcean. Through me  my country reiterates itscommitment to carrying out disarmament. We arecounting on the implementation of the conventionsprohibiting the production  proliferation and illicitsales of weapons of all kinds. On 25 August 1999 Madagascar ratified the Convention on the Prohibitionof the Use  Stockpiling  Production and Transfer ofAnti-personnel Mines and on Their Destruction.Furthermore  our Parliament's ratification process forthe Convention on Biological and Toxin Weapons hasbegun.The proliferation of light weapons is one of thecauses of the spread of conflict. My country thereforefully supports the convening in 2001 of an internationalconference under the auspices of the United Nations onthe illicit trafficking in light weapons in all its aspects.We pay tribute to the United Nations peacevolunteers who were victims of the recent terrorist actof aggression in West Timor. We underscore the needfor a joint strategy to deal with the current wave ofviolence. Thus on 1 October 1999  Madagascar signedthe International Convention for the Suppression ofTerrorist Bombings. We look forward to a speedyconclusion of the draft convention for the suppressionof acts of nuclear terrorism.Madagascar strongly supports therecommendations of the Brahimi report and looksforward to their effective and speedy implementationso as to strengthen the peacekeeping capacity of ourOrganization. We should stress the training  equippingand safety of peace volunteers. In this connection  thecountries concerned and neighbouring States shouldmake their contributions. Adopting a comprehensiveapproach to conflict prevention is necessary becausethe problem needs to be tackled at the source.Because we support democracy and theobservance of human rights and the rights of citizens Madagascar joined in the decision taken at Algiers in1999 during the thirty-fifth OAU Assembly of Headsof State and Government to condemn the taking ofpower through unconstitutional means. A resolution ofthe thirty-sixth Assembly  which was held at Lomé urges the international community to condemn withone voice such anti-democratic practices and to enactsanctions against regimes that result from suchpractices.In the new millennium  let us ensure that childrenremain at the heart of our collective efforts. Thetwenty-fourth special session of the General Assembly on social development  held in June 2000 at Geneva emphasized the need to protect children  to informthem of their rights and to educate them fully in orderto prepare them for citizenship.In order to mark the Millennium Summit  on 7September 2000  Madagascar signed OptionalProtocols: one to the Convention on the Rights of theChild  on the involvement of children in armedconflict  and another to the Convention on theElimination of All Forms of Discrimination againstWomen. Gender equality is for us an ongoingchallenge.We condemn anything that runs counter to theprogress of human beings  and we endorse the commonstruggle against social scourges and transnational19crime. We also wish to draw attention to the upsurge insuch new areas of concern as sex tourism  paedophiliaand the spread of HIV/AIDS. Moreover  together withmy sister Ministers for Social Affairs  we spoke out infavour of a united struggle against those scourges in aletter to Secretary-General Kofi Annan.What Africa needs is easier access to care andmedications. Without opposing in any way the nobleprinciple of freedom of thought and expression  wedeplore the ill effects of any type of physical or moralaggression that is the result of the proliferation of cults and media representations of obscene and immoralimages. In this regard  legal instruments should bedesigned and implemented to create parameters for theelectronic dissemination of material that poses a threatto morality.The signing by Madagascar on 7 September lastof the Optional Protocol to the Convention on theRights of the Child on the sale of children  childprostitution and child pornography attests to ourdetermination to work to safeguard the family unit andfamily values  which are a source of human dignity andwhich guarantee stable sustainable social development.In this context  Madagascar adopted a law in 1999which outlaws paedophilia.Madagascar has also involved itself in the variousstages of the negotiations that led to the adoption andthe signing  on 14 September 2000  of the Protocol onBiosafety  the objective of which is to avert the dangersof using genetically modified substances. Madagascaris also against any use of the research relating to thecloning of human beings.The economic and social difficulties facing mycountry are made worse by the uncertainty and changesin the international system. We must thereforestrengthen international dialogue on the basis ofpartnership and shared responsibility. We areconvinced that the promotion of a culture of peace andof mutual understanding will help bring about aharmonious world. Accordingly  Madagascar supportsGeneral Assembly resolution 53/22  which proclaimed2001 the United Nations Year of Dialogue amongCivilizations.We hope that this session will outline strategiesthat are consonant with the requirements ofdevelopment and of human security  in keeping withthe plan of action proposed by the Secretary-General inhis report.An overall rethinking of development isnecessary  because it is in everyone's interests toincrease the purchasing power of the developingcountries  so that in the near future they can becomeequal partners as well as a potential market. Wedeplore the glaring inequalities that exist today: ourpeoples are suffering from famine and malnutrition whereas some others are enjoying amazingoverproduction. This imbalance does nothing topromote commercial and financial flows. We thereforesupport the Millennium Summit Declaration  whichproposes the adoption of a duty-free admission policyfor products exported by the developing countries  anincrease in official development assistance  and theimplementation of a debt relief and forgivenessprogramme.The holding in May 2001 of the third UnitedNations Conference on the Least Developed Countriesshould lead to decisions that ultimately will help toeliminate the least-developed-country category fromthe scale of world economic values.Accordingly  we support the principles of self-confidence and of mutual trust in the establishment of amonetary fund — a development fund — and acommodity price stabilization fund. This initiativeseeks to both reduce the vulnerability of the developingcountries to exogenous factors and to decrease thedependence of our economies on those of thedeveloped countries.Concerning Africa specifically  regional andcontinental integration is vital in order to avoidmarginalization. In this respect  Madagascar signed thedraft Charter of the African Union  which is theexpression of the rebirth of a responsible  sovereignAfrica.Important meetings await us in 2001  includingthe high-level intergovernmental meeting on financingfor development and the special session to follow up onthe World Summit for Children  which are allopportunities to give real meaning to the commitmentsundertaken during this Millennium Assembly.We have come to this historic session convincedthat it will breathe new life into our Organization andprovide the basis for a dynamic for peace and20cooperation. We have come here because we haveconfidence in concerted action to meet today'schallenges. We have come here because we have hopein a viable future free from need in a world of well-being and peace."
"107",4489,"MDV",55,2000,"Allow me at the outset toassociate myself with previous speakers incongratulating Mr. Holkeri on his election to presideover the General Assembly at this historic session. It isa tribute to his distinguished political experience and tothe invaluable contributions made by his country Finland  to the work of our Organization.I should also like to extend my appreciation to hispredecessor  Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  the ForeignMinister of Namibia  for the excellent manner in whichhe discharged his responsibilities during the fiftyfourth session.I would also like to pay a special tribute to ourSecretary-General  Kofi Annan  for the inspirationalleadership and the moral authority he has brought toour Organization. His report to the MillenniumSummit  “We the peoples”  will remain a powerful andluminous beacon as we strive to make the world a morejust and peaceful place for future generations and theUnited Nations a more effective  efficient andresponsive Organization in the new millennium.Exactly 35 years ago today  Maldives wasadmitted to the United Nations. We were proud to takea seat in this world body  which has seen steady growthin its membership  activities and influence. Today  weare pleased to welcome to our midst the island nationof Tuvalu. We look forward to working with Tuvalu infurthering the cause of small island nations for a moreeconomically humane and socially just world that isenvironmentally sustainable in the future.Wars  hunger and famine have marred much ofthe twentieth century. Terrorism  drugs and the spreadof HIV/AIDS threaten to destroy the peace andprosperity of our future generations. Economicinequality and social injustice have tended to increase 16despite many laudable efforts to the contrary. Astechnological advances bring untold riches andopportunities to many  many more continue to live indeprivation  their lives becoming increasinglymarginalized in a fast-changing world.Only a few days back  the Millennium Summitbrought together the largest-ever gathering of worldleaders in human history. It was not only a historicoccasion but also one that rekindled the hopes andaspirations of the world's peoples. The MillenniumDeclaration adopted at the Summit charts out a futurevision for the world in which “the peoples” haverightfully been given pride of place in our efforts toreshape the future of humanity. As my President President Abdul Gayoom  stated at the MillenniumSummit  “The gap between expectation and result mustbe eliminated” (A/55/PV.3) in the new millennium.The leaders of the world have recognized thedangers posed to the future of humanity. They havepledged themselves to a better world — a world that ismore just  a world in which every human being can livein dignity  a world that rejoices in its diversity of races religions and culture. They have pledged to strengthenthe United Nations so that it may have the resourcesand capability to deliver the dreams of “we thepeoples” of the world. It now remains for us totranslate these words into deeds  rhetoric to reality.Action must begin now.For over two decades  Maldives has managed tomake significant economic and social progress. We areindeed proud of what we have achieved with thelimited resources at our disposal. A stable politicalenvironment  a supportive international community andthe creativity of our people have combined to help oureconomic growth. However  this does not reduce in anyway the vulnerability of our economy. We continue tohave a small and narrow economic base comprisingfisheries and tourism  both of which are extremelysusceptible to external forces that are often beyond ourcontrol. Indeed  the precarious nature of our economyis readily evidenced whenever the price of tuna plungesin the international market. Similarly  any downturn inthe economy of major tourist markets or regionalinstability casts a long shadow on our tourist industry.We do not want to wear the least developedcountry label for ever. As a small but proud nation  we too  would like to be a self-reliant country. Nationalpride  unfortunately  does not feed our population oreducate our children. It is for these reasons that duringthe Economic and Social Council meeting in July thisyear  Maldives argued against its removal from the listof least developed countries  which would undoubtedlypull the rug from underneath our feet. Indeed  oursuccesses in national development to date have beenhighly dependent on the concessional finance anddevelopmental assistance we have enjoyed as a leastdeveloped country. The withdrawal of access to suchconcessional assistance at this crucial stage of ourdevelopment would seriously cripple ourdevelopmental efforts. Our economy will slidebackwards if we lose preferential access to markets.Our debt burden will become unsustainable.We take some comfort in the decision made bythe Economic and Social Council to defer theconsideration of the recommendation to graduateMaldives from the list of least developed countries.The structural impediments facing our developmentalefforts are so formidable that the country's graduationat this stage is not justified. Our geophysicalfragmentation  combined with remoteness from majormarkets  accentuates our vulnerabilities  many ofwhich are unique. Maldives is not simply an islandnation; it is a nation of islands. In fact  we have over1 100 small  low-lying islands. Our population isscattered over 198 islands  each of which needs to beprovided with adequate administrative and socioeconomic infrastructure. Poor and porous soilconditions prohibit most agricultural production  whileavenues for economic diversification are extremelylimited. Transport and communication costs areprohibitive. That is why we have appealed to theinternational community to take a closer look at oursituation and re-examine the issue of our graduationfrom the list of least developed countries. We hope theinternational community will understand and supportour cause.Since the adoption of the Barbados Programme ofAction  the small island developing States have beenwaiting for the international community to meet thepledges made at the Conference on small islanddeveloping States  while their economic and ecologicalchallenges have increased manifold. We therefore arehappy that the world leaders at the Millennium Summithave once again highlighted the special needs of smallisland developing States  including the necessity ofdeveloping a vulnerability index that can truly capturethe unique features of these States. The leaders have17also resolved to implement rapidly and in full theBarbados Programme of Action and the outcome of thetwenty-second special session of the GeneralAssembly. These are welcome developments which wehope will soon be translated into action by theinternational community.Allow me to stress the importance of the earlycompletion of the vulnerability index called for by thisAssembly. In developing this index  we believe  theinternational community should take into account notonly those factors that are similar among the islandStates but also those that are unique to particular islandStates. For example  while some may be prone tocyclones and hurricanes  others may be more affectedby beach erosion or coral bleaching.Maldives has consistently voiced its concernsover the negative impact of environmental degradationon small island States. We welcomed the adoption ofthe Kyoto Protocol. Unfortunately  the slow pace of itsratification by the international community continuesto endanger many small island developing States. It isindeed regrettable that to date only 23 countries haveratified the Protocol.We are  however  heartened by the fact that theMillennium Declaration calls upon the internationalcommunity to expedite the early ratification of theKyoto Protocol to ensure its entry into force by thetenth anniversary of United Nations Conference onEnvironment and Development in 2002. We call uponthe United Nations to take a leading role in making therelevant resolve of our leaders at the Summit a reality.As the President of the Maldives  speaking at theMillennium Summit  declared “Humanity's quest for progress must besustainable. We have no right to destroy the Earth.Ecological damage must be stopped. Global warmingmust be curbed. All low-lying countries must besaved.” (A/55/PV.3)The protection and security of small Statescontinue to constitute an issue of critical concern to mycountry. Among the 189 Members that compose theUnited Nations today  many are small countries whichrequire protection from a variety of threats to theirsecurity. The Maldives believes that within the sphereof international peace and security  which has alwaysremained a high priority on the United Nations agenda the security of small States should continue to receivespecial consideration as a political and moralobligation of the international community. The interestand concern of the United Nations on this issue shouldnot be allowed to diminish  even in the future.Globalization is today a reality. No country  largeor small  can swim against the tide of globalization andthe digital revolution that is reshaping the modernworld. Globalization must benefit all countries. Itscosts must be shared evenly by all countries. The leastdeveloped countries must be granted duty-free andquota-free access to the markets of developed countriesfor their exports. They deserve debt relief  includingdebt cancellation  in return for demonstrablecommitments to poverty reduction. Developmentassistance needs to be increased. We remain hopefulthat the Third United Nations Conference on the LeastDeveloped Countries  to be held next year  will usherin a new era of development for the least developedcountries.During the course of last year  the United Nationswas able to record some important achievements. Thefollow-up sessions to the world conferences on womenand on social development reaffirmed the goals ofcreating a more just and tolerant society. Modest butsignificant progress was achieved by the ReviewConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons towards freeing theworld from the scourge of nuclear arms. Effortstowards the establishment of an International CriminalCourt are moving ahead. A valuable framework forstrengthening United Nations peacekeeping operationshas been laid out by the Brahimi report (A/55/305).Yet many shortcomings and frustrations continueto plague the world community. Conflicts based onethnic arrogance rage on. Poverty persists at a levelthat is morally repugnant. The spread of the HIV/AIDSpandemic needs to be urgently addressed. Internationalpeace and security continue to be threatened byterrorism and drug trafficking cartels operating withinand across borders.A comprehensive and permanent peace settlementin the Middle East continues to elude us. This isdisappointing. We would like to reiterate our fullsupport for the cause of the Palestinian people and toencourage the sponsors of the peace process in theMiddle East to continue to pursue their efforts towardsachieving a lasting peace in the region.The situation in the Gulf continues to trouble us.Peace  progress and security in that region can never be18achieved unless settlements on all unresolved issuesare complied with fully by all the parties concerned inconformity with the relevant United Nationsresolutions. We would like to reaffirm our unwaveringsupport for the independence  sovereignty andterritorial integrity of Kuwait. As I mentioned before we continue to believe that the United Nations has anobligation to uphold the security and territorialintegrity of all Member States  including small States.The Maldives firmly believes that the myriadchallenges facing the world today can be effectivelyaddressed only in a multilateral framework in whichthe United Nations must play the central role. Despitethe many shortcomings it may have  the United Nationsremains the only truly universal organization whereglobal issues can be addressed. We believe that anincreasingly interdependent world calls for astrengthened multilateral system with an effectiveinternational legal regime that is respected by allnations. It is with this conviction that the Maldives hasbecome a State party to a number of internationalconventions and treaties  including the eightconventions and treaties to which we became partyduring the Millennium Summit  taking advantage of theopportunity offered by the Secretary-General.We fully support the steps being taken by theSecretary-General in the process of reforming ourOrganization. While there has been much progress more remains to be done. Reform of the SecurityCouncil to reflect the political reality of the modernworld is essential if the United Nations is to remain acredible and effective organization  enjoying theconfidence of the peoples of the world. Reform of theUnited Nations must aim at enhancing the legitimacyof the Organization  making the United Nations moredemocratic and transparent  and reinforcing the abilityof the United Nations to uphold equality amongnations.At the Millennium Summit  our leadersilluminated the way forward. It now remains for us tomove forward in concert  for the benefit of the peoplesof the world."
"108",4536,"MEX",55,2000,"Mycountry is pleased at the election of Mr. Harri Holkerito preside over the work of the fifty-fifth session of theGeneral Assembly. We are certain that  with his talent ability and experience  the efforts of this extremelyimportant Assembly session will be highly productive.My delegation would also like to extend its recognitionto Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab for his outstanding work asPresident of the Assembly at the session that has justconcluded.Last Friday  during the Millennium Summit  theleader of the Mexican nation  Ernesto Zedillo  statedhis personal commitment and that of the Mexicanpeople to the values and principles that sustain theactivities of our Organization. Today  through me  theMexican Government renews its willingness tocontinue working and participating constructively tostrengthen the United Nations  the reason for thosehistoric meetings. We will do this guided by ourtraditional policy in the multilateral arena: byencouraging dialogue  consensus  and unrestrictedrespect for international law. We will do thisconvinced  as well  that we must make good use of thisopportunity to give renewed impetus to the UnitedNations  so that it can progress in solving thechallenges that we confront  and can fulfil the goal ofbuilding  in this new century  a safer  more just andequal world for all. As the President of Mexico stated we will do it confident that we Mexicans have thenecessary foundation to do our share in achieving thetargets contained in the report of the Secretary-Generaland the Millennium Declaration.My country is convinced that the practice ofdemocracy is indispensable for the development ofnations and to guarantee respect for individualfreedoms. But we are also sure that democracy issustained by the sovereign will of its citizens and is therefore  a domestic process that cannot be imposedfrom the outside  although  without a doubt  it can andmust be nourished by international dialogue betweencountries and by the cooperation that can be providedby the United Nations.Mexico is also convinced that  just as thepredominance of democracy within the membership ofour Organization is imperative  it is essential thatrelations between nations follow democratic practicesas well  and that these  in turn  be reflected inorganizations such as the United Nations that we  thepeoples of the world  have created to organize ourcoexistence.Today we find ourselves with an extraordinaryopportunity to advance in that direction: to coverfurther ground in the democratization of ourOrganization; to achieve a level of democratization thatallows the United Nations to successfully fulfil themission with which we entrusted it in San Francisco the validity of which we seek to renew today  a level ofdemocratization that reinforces the legitimacy of ourOrganization and invigorates its initiatives  a level ofdemocratization that supports the domestic processesthat many of our countries are undertaking and willconsequently be enriched by them.Mexico has stated on various occasions thatstrengthening the General Assembly  the internationalcommunity's most representative universal forum  isindispensable to guarantee the full democratization ofthe United Nations. We have also asserted that it isnecessary to modify the structure and operation of theSecurity Council  so that it can fully shoulder itsresponsibilities in the maintenance of peace andinternational security.It is for this reason that my country hasrepeatedly proposed that we undertake a profoundreform of the Security Council; a reform that is notlimited to modifications of its composition; a reformthat also considers the Council's working methods anddecision-making process; a reform that allows thatimportant organ of the United Nations to reflect theplurality and diversity of our Organization; a reformthat takes into account the transformations of thepolitical landscape in recent times; a reform that doesnot lead to the creation of new centres of power andprivilege; a reform that regulates and limits the scopeof the veto  avoiding its abuse or selective application;a reform that institutionalizes the relationship betweenthe Security Council and the General Assembly so thattheir links  contacts and exchanges of information areclearly regulated; in short  a reform that guarantees thatthe Security Council's decisions have the legitimacythat can come only from the universal assent of theGeneral Assembly.30Based precisely on this unwavering faith in theuniversality of international law  which Mexico fullyshares  my country has engaged in its most importantbattles in this world Organization. Mexico has alwaysbeen ready to participate in codifying international law but we have continually insisted that progress alongthis path should involve all of the countries that makeup the community of nations. This is the onlyguarantee for preserving legality and for ensuringcordial  constructive and mutually beneficial relationsbetween all of us.The humanitarian crises in Kosovo  East Timorand Sierra Leone  to refer to only a few recent cases have made us reflect on the scope of and limits tocurrent international law. These crises have made ussee that it is imperative to find a balance between theurgent need to respond adequately to humanitarianemergencies and the need to respect the sovereignintegrity of all States. These crises  in short  havealerted us to the need to transform ourselves into a trueassembly that analyses and proposes new paths  andthey have alerted us to what holds us back frombecoming an authentic forum where different positionsare heard and where answers that realistically reflectthe possible consensuses are found.We must therefore move forward and begin aprocess of further codifying our international law; aprocess based on the sovereign equality of States as aliving reality  not just a theoretical principle; a processin which the weak and the strong  the rich and the poor and the small and the large can express themselvesopenly. A process that clearly establishes the rules ofthe game. A process that enshrines democracy as theonly way in which to reach truly legitimate agreements.Because we believe in these democratic values Mexico has always opposed the legitimization  inpractice  of any type of interference  especially when itis based on unilateral decisions or the decisions of asmall group of countries. To the contrary  we havereiterated that the United Nations must be providedwith a modern political structure that permits it toconfront the new challenges to international peace andsecurity brought by the end of the cold war. For thisreason  we have insisted on the need to begin  as soonas possible  a broad process of consultation; a processthat is absolutely democratic; a process that allows forthe discernment of the mood of our community ofnations in order to respond correctly and in timelyfashion to humanitarian crises without weakening theOrganization by doing so.I call upon the President of the General Assemblyto formally begin  as soon as possible  this broadprocess of consultation that will allow us to reflecttogether on this issue of crucial importance for theUnited Nations.Mexico stands ready to continue contributing tothe ongoing process of codifying international law towhich I have referred. We will do so with the sameconfidence with which  in recent years  we haveadhered to a significant number of internationalinstruments proposed by this  our most important worldOrganization. We will do so with the same will withwhich we Mexicans have committed ourselves tomodifying our national legislation in order to complywith the obligations that derive from those instruments.Such is our trust in international law and itsadvancement.With this trust  only a few days ago my countrysigned the Statute of the International Criminal Court as well as the Protocols to the Convention on theRights of the Child. With this trust we ratified  thisyear  the Convention on the Status of Refugees and itsProtocol  as well as the Convention relating to theStatus of Stateless Persons.With this trust  last week Mexico deposited itsratification instrument for the Kyoto Protocol. Somemonths ago  we did the same with regard to theInternational Convention on the Protection of theRights of All Migrant Workers and Members of TheirFamilies.With that same trust  Mexico continues its fight toachieve the total elimination of nuclear weapons andtests  and reiterates the call made last April  by thegroup of countries  including Mexico  that are part ofthe new agenda for disarmament initiative  for thenuclear Powers to commit themselves to the totalelimination of their nuclear arsenals.Future generations deserve a world free ofnuclear weapons. They deserve a world that is also freefrom the uncontrolled manufacture and trafficking ofconventional arms. They deserve  without a doubt  aworld where anti-personnel landmines cease to claimthousands of innocent lives.Our commitment to the protection andpreservation of the human race extends also to31combating the pandemics of our time. Today  a fataldisease  AIDS  threatens to cut off the existence ofmillions of beings on the planet. This is why only twodays ago  the women Secretaries and Ministers forForeign Affairs of 13 countries sent a letter to theSecretary-General in support of his call to stop andreverse the spread of AIDS by 2015 and to providespecial assistance to children orphaned by this scourge.I want to renew the appeal of our 13 nations to all theMembers of the United Nations to support the JointUnited Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS)and to resolutely launch the common efforts that arenecessary to fight this global scourge.As is well said in the report of the Secretary-General and in the Declaration of the MillenniumSummit  the protection of our common environment the fight against transnational organized crime  thepromotion of human rights  attention to vulnerableindividuals  including children  the fight fordisarmament  and international aid to respond to thedemands of the least developed countries  these arethe foundation for allowing the people of the world tolive not only free of fear and misery  but also withhope. These are also the challenges that ourOrganization and its Members must respond to  byconsolidating an international architecture that issustained by democracy and not by the concentration ofpower; an international architecture based on respectfor international law  and not on unilateral decisions;an international architecture that encourages theuniversal character of our community and not selfishindividualism; in short  an international architecturethat emphasizes solidarity and cooperation as thevalues that give sustenance and permanence to theOrganization."
"109",4561,"MHL",55,2000,"I would like firstof all to congratulate the President  on his assumptionof the office of President of the fifty-fifth session of theUnited Nations General Assembly. I wish him everysuccess in this difficult and inspiring task. I would alsolike to express my sincere appreciation to hispredecessor  Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  for his exceptionalleadership during the fifty-fourth session.Allow me to include in this tribute the SecretaryGeneral for his efforts and crucial role in maintainingand promoting the role of this Organization  and for hisinspiration in strengthening its effectiveness andcredibility with respect to peace  security  justice anddevelopment in the world.I wish to add a few comments to the statementmade earlier by the representative of the FederatedStates of Micronesia on behalf of the Pacific IslandsForum countries.Let us pause for a moment to recognize thecontribution of the founding fathers and framers of theUnited Nations and its Charter. They produced adocument which  in large measure  has contributed toan ever-increasing consciousness of the prerequisitesnecessary for world peace. Today we should celebratethe existence of the United Nations and itsaccomplishments  both of which offer us theopportunity to reflect on how collectively we can betterchart our path and articulate our goals more clearly forthe next millennium. President Kessai Note's addressto the Millennium Summit reaffirmed the adherenceand commitment of the Republic of the MarshallIslands to the principles enshrined in the Charter forthe collective good of all people.I take great pleasure in reiterating the MarshallIslands' warm welcome to the Government and peoplesof Tuvalu  as the 189th Member of this Organization.Indeed  the admission of new Member States adds tothe legitimacy of the United Nations.On the other hand  the denial of membership inthis Organization to the 23 million people of theRepublic of China on Taiwan  who have made asignificant and meaningful contribution to internationaldevelopment  is contrary not only to the true spirit ofthe United Nations Charter  but also to its principle ofuniversality and to the Universal Declaration of HumanRights. We must strengthen the vital role of theOrganization in achieving the goals of conflictprevention  maintenance of peace  regional stability promotion of fundamental human rights anddevelopment of democracy and international progress and in fulfilling the aspirations of peoples to selfdetermination and engagement  because the UnitedNations is the only Organization that can bring thatshining light to those 23 million people. Furthermore the United Nations is the only forum for MemberStates to build mutual trust and to resolve issuesthrough peaceful dialogue. The guiding principles ofdemocracy  respect for human rights and the right ofpeoples to self-determination must  in conformity withthe principles of justice and international law  continueto underpin our collective aspirations. This will requireour concerted action in this new millennium.The Republic of the Marshall Islands applaudsand commends the unprecedented efforts made by theleaders of the People's Democratic Republic of Koreaand the Republic of Korea  who have engaged in adialogue that may help chart a course towards lastingpeace in that peninsula. I wish to state also that theGovernment of the Republic of the Marshall Islandsencourages the leaders of Israel and Palestine to seizethe historic opportunity that is within reach topeacefully conclude a framework agreement towardslasting peace in the Middle East. I wish to commendthe efforts of the United States of America in thisregard.The immutable law of change makes it necessaryfor the United Nations to continue to critically examineits performance and structures in search of practicaland timely solutions. This it must certainly do  because38the current political landscape is vastly different fromthe one that prevailed 50 years ago. It is characterizedby a more than threefold increase in the number ofnations with membership in the United Nations  and bya heightened spirit of generosity and desire on the partof civil society and corporations to become more activeplayers in the process of change. It is imperative therefore  that those elements and structures which areantiquated  those which have ceased to promote thewelfare of nations and those which no longer ministerto the needs of a continually changing humanity beswept away and relegated to the pages of history.A more comprehensive review and restructuringof the Security Council  in line with the spirit ofachieving a broader base for decision-making throughconsensus and confidence-building  is clearly longoverdue. Other critical issues in the reform processdeserve further examination  with a view to restoringthat body's dignity and legitimacy and strengtheningthe confidence and trust of the internationalcommunity. Enlarging both the permanent and nonpermanent categories while ensuring an equitablegeographical distribution seems to be the way forward.The Republic of the Marshall Islands remainscommitted to supporting the efforts by the SecretaryGeneral and others to reform and streamline themandates and activities of the United Nations and itsother organizations and agencies. While thepeacekeeping and general fund scales seem to beoutdated  the process of reform must take seriously intoaccount the limited responsibility and capacity of smallisland developing States such as the Marshall Islands tosustain their obligation in both categories. Also  nowthat this Organization stands at 189 Member States  14of them from the Pacific Region  the reconfiguration ofour electoral grouping should be an additional matter tobe placed on the table. It may be a complex one  butthrough our collective inspiration it can be anachievable goal  to be considered without further delay.The Republic of the Marshall Islands is keen tofurther develop its ongoing active role and cooperationwith the United Nations specialized agencies andprogrammes. In the view of the Marshall Islands  thosebodies' efforts to make their operational activities moreeffective and responsive to the special needs of smallisland developing States will undoubtedly play a keyrole in the new millennium. The expansion of theResident Coordinator programme — which brings itcloser to home  where it belongs — is a case in point.While the human rights achievements recorded inthe 50 years since the proclamation of the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights must be acknowledged there is a sense that much remains to be done beforethe world can truly claim that the Declaration hasbecome a common standard of achievement. TheMillennium Summit is a significant acknowledgementof the need for all States to work together  in a spirit ofunity and cooperation  to ensure that the fruits ofglobal development are shared and made moreequitable and just for the benefit of humanity at large.Within the mandate of its Charter to promoteeconomic and social progress  peace and security  andsustainable development and prosperity  the UnitedNations is the only fully representative Organizationcapable of harmonizing our collective aspirations for apeaceful  stable and prosperous global village. TheRepublic of the Marshall Islands endorses SecretaryGeneral Kofi Annan's report  “We the peoples: the roleof the United Nations in the twenty-first century”.At the turn of the century  achievements havebeen realized  and this trend should be encouraged. Yetwe are living under many threats. Acts of terrorism donot recognize national boundaries  and infectiousdiseases such as HIV/AIDS  malaria and tuberculosisare poised to spread quickly throughout the world. Ourdecisive and collective response is therefore more thanever required. In many developing countries  povertyand the deprivation of basic human rights  especially asconcerns women and children  seem directly linked to and escalate  crime.We must also strive to eliminate weapons of massdestruction  especially nuclear weapons. Theuniversality of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons (NPT) and the ComprehensiveNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) is a major concern.Trafficking in drugs and small arms represents aconsiderable challenge and a major threat for smallislands such as the Republic of the Marshall Islands because of its geographic isolation and the fact that itlacks the required resources and capability to combatthese phenomena. Our collective effort towards thecreation of an effective global response to address allof these threats is urgently required.We realize that global environmental degradationis of our own creation. The issue of global warming isa real threat to all  particularly to the Marshall Islandsand to all small island developing States. There is no39doubt that the survival of populations and cultures is atstake.The Marshall Islands has already lost metres ofusable and habitable land due to climate change andsea-level rise  and the rate of loss is increasing. This isa matter of life and death. Implementing the legallybinding commitments agreed in the Kyoto Protocol isthe only significant step forward on the path ofensuring effective global action to combat climatechange. There will be a terrible tragedy unless there isinternational cooperation. How will displacedpopulations — whatever the reasons for their beingdisplaced — be able to enjoy and sustain their basichuman rights for generations to come? Will theircultures and livelihoods be able to survive for thebenefit of future generations?Education and health are of paramountimportance to every country in the world. Education isthe key to the progress of any nation. We mustcollectively strive to ensure that an educatedpopulation makes up a healthy and prosperous society.I am pleased to report that the Government of theRepublic of the Marshall Islands has taken some boldsteps  by allocating the greatest amount of its limitedresources towards the improvement of its educationand health systems. I take this opportunity to appeal forthe interest and support of the international communityin joining us in this endeavour. I am particularlypleased to convey the deep appreciation of theGovernment of the Republic of the Marshall Islands tothe Government of Italy for its generous support forour efforts to implement the Barbados Programme ofAction. The first phase of the Marshall Islands solarenergy project would not have been implementedwithout its support  through the United Nations TrustFund for New and Renewable Sources of Energy. Theinterest in and support of the international communityfor the implementation of the other phases of theproject would be highly appreciated.The Marshall Islands National Nutrition andChildren's Council has been very active since itsinception. In addition to establishing task forces onfood and nutrition  suicide prevention  substance abuse neglect and disability  it made another significantcontribution with the agriculture  food and nutritionpolicy  as the Marshall Islands strives to meet itsobligations under the Convention on the Rights of theChild. Existing policies specifically aimed at the rightsof the child are under review as we consider makingthe Convention a part of the Republic of the MarshallIslands legal system. A representative Commission onSustainable Development has been established with themandate of ensuring that the Barbados Programme ofAction is implemented in all its aspects. Otherlegislation to curb illegal financial transactions willsoon be introduced in the Parliament's current session.These are some of the efforts being made by theRepublic of the Marshall Islands as it strives to meet itstreaty obligations and enhance the life of every citizenof the country. We cannot do it alone  and we appealonce again to the international community for support.Let us have a United Nations that will meet thechallenges of the twenty-first century."
"110",4585,"MKD",55,2000,"At the outset  I would like to congratulateMr. Holkeri on his election as President of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-fifth session. At the same time  Iwould like to express our appreciation to the Presidentof the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  for the results achieved duringhis presidency.On this occasion  I would also like to express ourgratitude to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for hisefficient and relevant leadership of the Organization.The Republic of Macedonia will continue actively tocontribute to the realization of the goals of the UnitedNations.I also welcome the admission of Tuvalu to theUnited Nations  wishing it success in its contribution toUnited Nations activities and expressing our wish toestablish diplomatic relations. At the same time  theRepublic of Macedonia expresses its readiness andcalls for the acceleration of the process of establishingdiplomatic relations with all other States Members ofthe United Nations with which we have not yet doneso.In the region where the Republic of Macedonia islocated  the situation has to some extent improved afterthe huge humanitarian crisis that took place in Kosovo.The heavy consequences of the crisis  which posed aserious threat to the stability and security of theBalkans and more widely in Europe  have not beenfully overcome.The Republic of Macedonia has and will have inthe future a vital role to play for peace and stability inSouth-East Europe and beyond. The risks confrontingthe Republic of Macedonia were enormous. TheMacedonian Government and our citizens have doneeverything within their capacity to respond to theproblems. However  as was the case in the previouscrises that occurred in the Balkans and during theKosovo conflict last year as well  as one of thecountries that most directly felt and bore the brunt ofthe damage  the Republic of Macedonia has shown andconfirmed its long-term commitment to acting as afactor for peace and stability in the region. TheGovernment  even in such conditions  persisted in itspolicy to preserve the stability of the Macedonian Stateand at the same time to reaffirm its capability torespond to all challenges and risks confronting it  inparticular in the economic and social fields.One of the main priorities of the foreign policy ofthe Republic of Macedonia is to further improve good-neighbourly relations with all its neighbours. Thiscommitment has been confirmed through a number ofour initiatives  resulting in more advanced anddeveloped relations in bilateral cooperation andintensified cooperation within the framework of anumber of regional initiatives. My country is awarethat stability and prosperity  in the medium and longterms  can be ensured only if stability is spreadthroughout South-East Europe  with intensive mutualcommunications and good-neighbourly cooperationamong all States of the region.My country has managed  with almost all itsneighbours — Greece  Albania and Bulgaria  but notthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  with which wecontinue to negotiate the demarcation of our commonborder — to have outstanding relations and to developcooperation in many areas of common interest. Wehave significantly improved relations with our southernneighbour  Greece. We continue to hold talks on ourdifferences over the name of my country  under theauspices of the Secretary-General  expressing our willand interest in resolving this issue as soon as possible taking into account the reality and dignity of thecountry and all its citizens.22Despite the huge expectations and initial support the project that is most expected to contribute to thelasting stabilization of the region — the StabilityPact — has not managed to ensure the implementationof a large number of ideas and plans that have beensubmitted and accepted. The Pact  a significantexample of the joint engagement and functioning of alarge number of international organizations and States is intended to hasten the revitalization of the countriesof South-East Europe and their integration intoEuropean structures. I appeal to all participantsengaged in this process  especially the donors and thewider international community  to make the utmostefforts to speed its urgent and timely implementationthrough the accelerated and full realization of theseprojects. This will provide for the economic prosperityof the countries of South-East Europe and strengthendemocratic processes  respect for human rights andstability in the region. The implementation of the Pactconstitutes a natural upgrading of our activities withinthe context of regional initiatives to promote good-neighbourly relations and the possibility of therealization of the foreign policy priorities of mycountry: its full integration into the European andEuro-Atlantic structures.In addition to its foreign policy activities  theGovernment of the Republic of Macedonia is fullycommitted to carrying out fundamental reforms basedon European standards — political  economic anddemocratic — with maximum respect for human rights including minority rights. The Government of mycountry is continuously working on the improvementof inter-ethnic relations. A law on higher educationwas recently adopted that paves the way for privatehigher education in minority languages. Therefore  as aresult of our commitment  concrete steps andachievements  by the end of this year my country willbe the first in the region to conclude the Stabilizationand Association Agreement with the European Union.The efforts of the international community tostabilize the region  to which the Republic ofMacedonia has contributed widely  are beginning toshow results. Despite the limitations  it should be takeninto consideration that the seriousness and complexityof the situation in Kosovo  and in the Federal Republicof Yugoslavia as a whole  mean that the consequencesof this situation cannot be alleviated with the speeddesired by all of us  especially by the countries of theregion.In regard to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia our view is that its democratization is one of the keyfactors for the comprehensive stabilization of thesituation in the region. Our joint efforts should bedirected at support for the democratic forces in thatcountry and at joint actions to start the democraticprocess  followed by the provision of opportunities foreconomic prosperity. It is important to reassess theoverall effects of the sanctions  which should not bedirected at the citizens. We hope that the upcomingelections in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will befair and democratic  in accordance with European andOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europestandards  and be a step towards that country'sdemocratization.Regarding the situation in the Federal Republic ofYugoslavia  I would like  in my capacity as Chairmanof the South-East European Cooperation Process  toinform the Assembly about the joint declarationrecently adopted by the Foreign Ministers of theparticipating States in New York. In the declaration we the Foreign Ministers  expressed our concern about thelatest developments in the situation in the FederalRepublic of Yugoslavia as regards the upcomingpresidential and parliamentary elections  and confirmedour support for the democratic forces in that countryand for its efforts to start the democratic process.All of this might contribute to the integration ofthat country into the international community and to itsparticipation in the work of international organizations following the path that all the other successor States ofthe former Yugoslavia have taken. Furthermore  theresolution of the succession issue of the formerSocialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on the basisof the equality of all successors — as acknowledged bythe decisions of the European Union/United NationsInternational Conference on the Former Yugoslavia  aswell as by the relevant Security Council and GeneralAssembly resolutions — is a prerequisite for stabilityand peace in the region.Concerning the issue of succession  I would liketo point out that during the Millennium Summit andMillennium Assembly  the four successor States haveonce again reaffirmed their joint position and proposedto work more intensively to settle this issue.Furthermore  I would like to express our supportfor the stability and the reform processes undertaken inMontenegro and for the efforts of the democratically23elected Government there to continue pursuingeconomic and democratic development. We alsosupport that Government's greater involvement in thework of international bodies and organizations and inother regional cooperation processes.The consistent position of my country  which wasstated well before the outbreak of the Kosovo crisisand adoption of the Security Council resolution 1244(1999)  was to support a peaceful and political solutionto the Kosovo crisis through substantial autonomy inthe framework of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia respect for the human rights of all living in Kosovo respect for the inviolability of the existing borders and finally  the economic reconstruction and stabilizationof Kosovo and of the region.We support the activities of the United NationsInterim Administration Mission in Kosovo and theKosovo Force (KFOR). We are convinced of the needto build democratic institutions and a multi-ethnicsociety in Kosovo  and to find a model of civil societythat does away with any propensity to create ethnicallycleansed territories. The local elections in Kosovo areof paramount importance for its future.The Republic of Macedonia is concerned aboutthe reported violence and the increased number ofinter-ethnic incidents and tensions in Kosovo. Weconsider that KFOR should strengthen its bordercontrol activities  with the aim of preventing violencefrom spilling over into the neighbouring countries including my country. I am stressing this because therehave been several serious incidents at the border of theRepublic of Macedonia.In the hope that the developments in Kosovo willbe the last serious challenge in the Balkans  we willhave to defend together more successfully democraticprinciples and values and develop long-term preventivestrategies. Regional stability can be provided only byeconomic prosperity  democracy and respect for humanrights and the rights of national minorities  as well asthrough intensive regional and bilateral cooperation.However  the most serious guarantee for the security ofthe region and its transformation into an area ofdemocracy  development  stability and cooperationremains the early integration and full-fledgedmembership of the countries from the region in theEuropean Union and the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization (NATO).This year's Millennium Assembly presents agenuine opportunity to analyse the work of ourOrganization and to evaluate its efficiency in resolvingissues of international interest. We all hope that thedirections for future development will also beunderscored  with the aim of further promoting theachieved results and practices.One of the main characteristics of the modernworld is that now more than ever there is a great dealof interdependence. This represents a new challenge and at the same time is a new feature of internationalrelations. Moreover  when everybody is talking aboutthe enormous significance of the ever more importantmultilateral character of the international scene andabout globalization  the question of the equalparticipation of all the world's actors is being raised.That is  at issue is the official representation of thevoices of all peoples. In this regard  I would like toexpress our support for the efforts of the Republic ofChina on Taiwan to become integrated into theinternational community  taking into consideration theinterests of that country and also its significantcontribution to international cooperation and thesolidarity it has shown. It is in the interest of ourOrganization that the 23 million people of the Republicof China participate in its activities.The negative effects of crises  threats to peace security and economic development  and the pollutionof the environment are felt globally. In accordance withthe new situation in international relations  needs andvisions  an obvious demand exists to strengthen therole of the United Nations. Our Organization cansuccessfully carry out its activities only if the MemberStates fully contribute to their realization.In order to allow the Organization to be able toplay a successful role in the twenty-first century  it isnecessary to adequately reform it. We welcome theefforts made by the Secretary-General thus far to thiseffect  and at the same time we would like to urge himand the Member States to continue. Furthermore  Iwould like to underline that the reform of the UnitedNations will be successful only if strengthening therole of the General Assembly follows the reform of theSecurity Council. In our view  it is necessary toincrease the number of permanent and non-permanentmembers of the Security Council on the basis of thenew reality in international relations. These newmembers should come from both the developing anddeveloped countries.24What needs to be done so that the United Nationscan adequately respond to the challenges of thiscentury? The Millennium Summit offered part of theanswer. The adopted Millennium Summit Declarationcreates obligations for all Member States in their futureendeavours. We share the opinion that  although theDeclaration is a political document  it is first of all anaction plan of our Organization for the period to come.Stressing the importance of the adopted document  Iwould like to urge the General Assembly to beginimplementing it. In these efforts  the Republic ofMacedonia will actively contribute.The Republic of Macedonia will also continue tocontribute to the strengthening of international peaceand security. I emphasize that part of our contributionto the realization of the issues will be elaborated underthe three agenda items as a follow-up to the resolutionssubmitted by the Republic of Macedonia.The maintenance of international peace andsecurity worldwide will continue to be the priority ofour Organization in the twenty-first century. As theSecretary-General stated in his report  the world  andour Organization in particular  will be faced with theneed to be fully involved in conflict prevention conflict resolution and the development of the affectedStates. Therefore  prevention should become one of theprimary instruments of our Organization. In regard toour contribution to prevention activities and policy  Iwould like to inform the Assembly that in the Republicof Macedonia an international centre for conflictprevention and resolution is being established.Of great importance to stability and security  inour view  is the control of small arms and lightweapons  which pose a large threat to peace in manyregions of the world. In that connection  the UnitedNations  in cooperation with other regionalorganizations  such as the Organization for Securityand Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)  can have aserious impact on preventing the proliferation of smallarms and light weapons.We urge the international community to takestrong measures in its efforts to stop arms trafficking especially of small arms and light weapons. In thatrespect  we hope that that the international conferenceon this issue  which will take place next year  willcontribute to more efficient actions.Among the reasons for the eruption of a largenumber of local conflicts worldwide are economic andsocial factors. Globalization  apart from its positiveeffects  has a number of negative implications for thesmall and least developed economies. Financialresources for development are necessary; realistically the United Nations is not able to provide them. Wesupport the appeal for the necessary voluntarycontributions from Member States  but also the idea ofinvolving other participants  such as internationalfinancial institutions  the private sector and otherbodies. In this respect  we welcome next year'sinternational Conference on Financing forDevelopment. I underline that writing off the debts  orpart of them  of countries affected by objective externalinfluences would have a very positive impact. It wouldalso help to diminish global poverty andunemployment and aid the overall economicdevelopment of the indebted countries.The General Assembly is the proper place forevaluating achievements in the promotion andprotection of human rights and freedoms. There hasbeen an impressive development of internationalhuman rights law in the last 50 years. Today we canproudly state that the United Nations  with the adoptionof the Universal Declaration of Human Rights andother instruments  succeeded in affirming theinternational consensus — that human dignity is to bethe basic standard and the main goal for all people andnations.Last year we marked the tenth anniversary of theadoption of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and next year there will be a world summit on thisissue. I take this opportunity to announce the intentionof the Republic of Macedonia to sign in the very nearfuture the two Optional Protocols to the Convention the first on the involvement of children in armedconflict and the second on the sale of children  childprostitution and child pornography.Before I conclude  I would like to single out afew issues to which my Government attaches crucialimportance: first the situation in Africa  both politicaland economic; secondly  the Middle East peaceprocess; thirdly  the financial situation of ourOrganization — all Member States should fulfil theirobligations; and  finally peacekeeping operations which contribute to the affirmation of our Organizationon a global scale. This is the right moment for their25restructuring and strengthening on the basis of thereport (A/55/305) prepared by the Brahimi Panel.Many challenges await us in the twenty-firstcentury. Our obligation is to make the world a betterand happier place to live in. In the realization of thataim  the United Nations has a significant place androle. The significance and existence of our universalOrganization lies in its skilfulness in adapting to realsituations and future challenges.We expect this year's Millennium Assembly tocontribute to the realization of this aim. I assure theAssembly of the Republic of Macedonia's contributionto its successful fulfilment."
"111",4631,"MLI",55,2000,"At theoutset I should like to congratulate the President mostwarmly on his election to preside over the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-fifth session. I take theopportunity to assure him of my delegation's fullsupport as he carries out his difficult but uplifting task.I feel sure that with his experience and abilities as anable diplomat he will successfully guide ourdiscussions.I should also like to extend my sincere and warmcongratulations to his predecessor  Mr. Theo-BenGurirab  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Namibia  forthe ability and authority he demonstrated throughoutthe fifty-fourth session.I also take this opportunity of extending onceagain to Secretary-General Kofi Annan our fullappreciation and support for his constant efforts andresolve to find a better world in spite of the manycomplex challenges in the new millennium. Hisexcellent report  “We the peoples: the role of theUnited Nations in the twenty-first century”  is evidenceof this.Mali welcomes Tuvalu to the Assembly. Itsadmission to membership further strengthens theuniversality of the Organization.More than ever before  our world aspires to peaceand security and sustainable human development. Inthis respect  our fifty-fifth session is unprecedentedlyimportant both historically and politically. Theexceptional opportunity offered us in the MillenniumSummit  which has renewed our hope in humankind must not be lost. The Millennium Declarationdemonstrates our maturity and our elevated sense ofresponsibility for the future of humanity. Now we mustbuild this better world to which we all aspire. Thepeoples of the United Nations look to us. They areimpatient. More than ever before they want to be actorsdetermining their own future  particularly people whodo not have very much  our people. They want to beactors and to benefit from globalization.That is how I see the historical and politicalmeaning of this session  which must give effect to thedynamic now under way. Here  all together  wereaffirm the place and the role of the United Nations inthe maintenance of international peace and security andin cooperation for development  which require that theUnited Nations become more legitimate by being moredemocratic and stronger. What I say will be set againstthis backdrop.The maintenance of international peace andsecurity must remain our priority. The Organization isincreasingly faced with violent  deadly internalconflicts that have taken the lives of millions ofcivilians. It is therefore crucial to improve the systemof prevention and strengthen our institution's capacityto organize and conduct operations effectively andsuccessfully. Here I pay tribute to the report of thePanel on United Nations Peace Operations  led byLakhdar Brahimi. It is indeed a milestone in theprocess of trying to make the United Nations “trulycredible as a force for peace” (A/55/305)  so we mustquickly ensure that it has positive results. As the reportrightly emphasizes  United Nations intervention mustbe decided upon on the basis of uniform criteria regardless of the region in which conflicts occur. Themultidisciplinary nature of new United Nationspeacekeeping missions demands clear and precisemandates.Mali welcomes efforts to strengthen cooperationwith regional organizations in regard to maintainingpeace  while respecting the competence of the SecurityCouncil. Recent events in Sierra Leone remind us ofthis and are a real challenge to us. Efforts by theOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and subregionalorganizations must be supported to establish regionalcapacity. This also applies to the Economic Communityof West African States (ECOWAS)  which already hasa peacekeeping force and will soon have an earlywarning system.Peacekeeping operations cannot be a permanentsolution to conflicts or an answer to the underlyingcauses. The international community must move from aculture of reaction to a culture of prevention based on amultidimensional approach  helping to save manyhuman lives and making additional resources availablefor development. We must also emphasize that theeffectiveness of the United Nations in peacekeepingdepends largely on its capacity for prevention  crisismanagement and peace-building. Here I appeal to theinternational community to provide a stable andhealthy financial base for the Organization'speacekeeping activities.14I pay tribute to the second Security Councilsummit held on 7 September  which dealt with the needto give the Council an effective role in the maintenanceof international peace and security  particularly inAfrica. The resolution that emerged from that summitdeserves the support of us all  for it will certainlystrengthen our capacity for prevention and crisismanagement.We must also continue work to free the worldfrom the fear of weapons of mass destruction and faceup to the threat of light weapons.With regard to nuclear non-proliferation  theindefinite extension of the Nuclear Non-ProliferationTreaty (NPT) regime  the entry into force of theChemical Weapons Convention  the signing andratification of many other treaties on important aspectsof disarmament  and the creation of nuclear-weapon-free zones  are all important contributions toconfidence-building and nuclear disarmament.Mali is fully committed to work to halt the plagueof the proliferation of light weapons. I appeal forgreater coordinated support for regional efforts including support for moratoriums  respect forembargoes on arms deliveries and the strengthening ofcontrols. The United Nations conference in 2001 onthis issue must give the international community anopportunity to take appropriate steps to end theexcessive destabilizing accumulation of such weapons.The conference must look at all aspects and be fullytransparent.I must mention here the troubling issue ofchildren affected by conflict  child soldiers  for the linkbetween the proliferation of light weapons and theintolerable fate of these children is only too obvious.We have a great responsibility for them  and we mustput an end to the destruction of so many hopes. TheInternational Conference on War-affected Children held in Winnipeg  which ended just a few days ago was an opportunity for us all to strengthen ourcommitment to guarantee all children better health school for all  both boys and girls  free from war violence and famine.At the beginning of the third millennium one ofthe most urgent tasks facing humanity is to end thegrowing inequality between rich and poor countries.We must tackle the underlying causes of conflict —primarily their economic and social dimensions. In aninternational environment that is increasingly markedby globalization  continuing poverty is our mostdifficult challenge. The problem of the debt of thedeveloping countries must remain our focus  because itis a major obstacle to their development. Completecancellation of the debt is needed in the overallframework of finding a new development strategy.This new development strategy involves directinvestment  unhampered access to markets throughspecial  differential treatment  fair prices for our goods and transfers of new technology  all of which are majorfactors in development. This means that financingdevelopment must remain on our agenda. Mydelegation welcomes the convening in 2001 of a high-level conference to deal with this issue at theintergovernmental level. The challenges ofdevelopment cannot be taken up unless there is a stableinternational financial system. My country advocates areform of the international financial system that takesaccount of the social dimension of development anddoes not jeopardize nations' capacity to pursue theirnational development objectives.Africa has understood full well that its role andplace in the emerging world implies a renewed politicalapproach of integration and unity of our continent.That is the backdrop to the creation of the AfricanUnion  which calls for a united Africa  strengthened byan integrated development of its full potential and aheightened awareness of its strategic advantages. Maliwas the first country to ratify the Constitutive Act ofthe Union  which we are convinced is the springboardfor the development of the continent  and for aresponsible Africa  an Africa that counts.We must work together to eradicate poverty. Wehave a responsibility to guarantee all human beings alife of decency and dignity  with equal opportunitiesfor all peoples. We can do this. It requires enhancedcooperation and international solidarity through amultilateral approach guided by the United Nations.We must promote global social development  forwe believe that excessive unshared wealth is a poorkind of wealth  a wealth with no social value andtherefore contrary to the essence of our life.The values that give meaning to the wealth of theworld are those of democracy. Here I refer to the strongwords of President Konaré  who rightly told thecommunity of democracies conference  held inWarsaw  that the development of democracy is thebasis for a world of peace  solidarity and social justice 15and that only democracy can allow each of us toshoulder the burden  but also the honour  of being ahuman being and serving humankind. “What an honourit is to be a human being!” he said.The Ministerial Conference on Security  Stability Development and Cooperation in Africa said rightlythat democracy  good governance  respect for humanrights  the rights of peoples  and the rule of law  areprerequisites to achieving security  stability anddevelopment in Africa. Nothing must prevent opendiscussion of ideas and the promotion of politicalpluralism. Despite inadequacies  difficulties andsometimes violent breakdowns  the democratic processis gaining ground in Africa. A democratic Africa isbecoming increasingly real  but it is still a fragilereality that must be supported and helped. Maliwelcomes the adoption last June by the [Community ofDemocracies] of the Warsaw Declaration  advocatingthe strengthening of cooperation among democraticcountries with a view to sharing the best practices protecting themselves against threats to democraticprocesses  and promoting the emergence of apartnership forum to help democracies in transition.We must be strong against unconstitutionalchange of political regimes so that we can strengthendemocracy. We must condemn such changes as a matterof principle and there must be consequences. PresidentKonaré said that pressure must be credible and canonly attain its goal if the international communityadopts a firm consistent and constructive approach inthe event of any putsch or attempted coup d'état. Itmust avoid encouraging those who are tempted toviolate republican and democratic rules by removingany ambiguity. In this respect  the internationalcommunity must be clearer and more rigorous in itsapproach and support the OAU which seeks to deterputsches by taking a clear position and by imposingpolitical sanctions. Could this position not also betaken up in the United Nations?Along the same lines the establishment of theInternational Criminal Court with the Rome Statueswould be a permanent body to act against impunity. Itwould allow us to try those responsible for the mosthorrible crimes and it would also be a tool fordeterrence that could contribute to the maintenance ofinternational peace and security. Mali has alreadyratified the Court's Statute  thus showing that itsupports the struggle against the culture of impunityand to ensure respect for human dignity.In view of the progress in achieving somesettlement in the Lockerbie matter  we would call forthe definitive and immediate lifting of sanctions thatare unjustly inflicting suffering on the brother peopleof the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. We must be carefulabout sanctions because of the humanitarian costinvolved. We must use more effective  targetedsanctions.On the Korean peninsula we welcome the recentinter-Korean summit and the exchange visits bypeoples of both countries. We welcome and supportthese initiatives which begin a direct dialogue betweenthe parties involved and promote peace and stability inthe Korean peninsula.HIV/AIDS jeopardizes the future of millions ofmen  women and children in Africa and it is also athreat to international peace and security. A failure todeal with this would be culpable and suicidalindifference. In this connection we fully support theproposal to convene a special session of the GeneralAssembly on AIDS.Adapting the United Nations to the requirementsof the age is absolutely essential. The challenges facingus in the political  economic and social areas force usto demonstrate creativity and realism so that we cancome up with innovative and constructive suggestionsand translate them into action in the true interests ofour peoples. My delegation believes in the need todemocratize the United Nations further  to restructureall its principal organs. Reform of the Security Councilwill give effect to our desire to modernize thisimportant organ that the Charter makes primarilyresponsible for threats to and breaches of internationalpeace and security. A reformed Council must be moretransparent in its working methods  more democratic more representative  more legitimate in itsmembership  and it must be more credible in the way itis perceived by other member States. Mali reaffirmsAfrica's demand for equitable distribution of seats inthe two categories  pursuant to the Harare Declarationadopted by the OAU Summit of Heads of State orGovernment.More than ever before the human being must bethe very heart of the new millennium. The peoplesexpect the United Nations to promote and ensure aworld of progress for all  a world of peace  a world ofsharing. In this respect Mali sees the Millennium16Declaration as the fabric we can use to build a betterworld. Now is the time for action."
"112",4672,"MLT",55,2000,"I would like to join the otherdelegations here in congratulating you  Mr. President on your election as President of the General Assembly.May I also pay tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab who  through his experience anddiplomatic skills  guided the fifty-fourth session to asuccessful conclusion. I wish to express ourappreciation to the Secretary-General  under whoseguidance and with whose expertise the Organizationhas been moving ahead in the attainment of its goals.May I also extend a warm welcome to Tuvalu  thenewest Member of the United Nations. For many yearsMalta and Tuvalu have cooperated as joint members ofthe Commonwealth.This is an auspicious occasion  not merelybecause the General Assembly is the most widelyrepresentative group of the world's peoples  but alsosince it comes at a time when we are poised on theedge of a new dawn  a new beginning. Only last weekwe saw and heard the heads of State or Government ofcountries the world over reaffirm their faith in theOrganization and its Charter as indispensablefoundations of a more peaceful  prosperous and justworld. It was a renewed commitment to make theUnited Nations a more effective instrument in thehands of the world's people. This is a weightyundertaking  and one which may well benefit from a re-examination of the experience acquired during the past55 years of the United Nations existence.As we are all no doubt aware  the United Nationshas been instrumental in fostering a culture ofpartnership among States. Indeed  we meet here todayin the understanding that this culture of partnershipmust continue to constitute the basis for humanity'sprogress. This is more than just a vision for the future;it is the road map for the way forward based on aprogramme of action that has weathered thevicissitudes of time and withstood test after test eversince its adoption in San Francisco over half a centuryago. It is a noble endeavour that has survived in theface of adversity  that has experienced occasionalsetbacks  but that has also registered more than a fairshare of success.Aided by its long-standing commitment todialogue  the United Nations has positively contributedto the process of decolonization that has so decisivelytransformed the political map of the world. It haspromoted a culture of dialogue and cooperation in themost diverse fields of human existence and endeavour 28ranging from health care to food supplies  from literacyto urban development  from historical heritage to thenatural environment  and  more recently  improving thestatus of women.Nevertheless  in the crucial area of themaintenance of peace and security — the very raisond'être for the creation of the United Nations — theOrganization  for various reasons  has at times beenunable to fulfil this mandate. This is reflected in thepainfully honest reports of the Organization's failingsin Rwanda and Srebrenica. These negative experiencesprovided the backdrop to the recently publishedBrahimi report.The Government of Malta shares the concernsexpressed in this report  which cautions in particularagainst entrusting the United Nations Secretariat withunrealistic mandates while not providing it withcommensurate resources. We look forward to earlyconsultations on the manner in which therecommendations of the report may be pursued.We have given serious consideration toaddressing these concerns and have decided to matchthem with a specific commitment. It was in thisconnection that my Prime Minister last week  in hisaddress to the Millennium Summit  signalled Malta'sintention to significantly increase its peacekeepingcontribution through a voluntary move from group C togroup B.It will be recalled that over the years Malta hasmade other contributions towards promoting the globalobjectives of the United Nations. These have includeda number of initiatives not designed in the narrownational interest but in the interest of the internationalcommunity as a whole.May I recall in this connection Malta's proposalsto the General Assembly relating to the seabed and theocean floor  which led to the United NationsConvention on the Law of the Sea  to the question ofthe ageing and to the initiative relating to climatechange. These initiatives alerted the United Nations toexamine the far-reaching  serious implications of thoseissues and thereby enabled it to adopt timely measures which  as can be appreciated  have helped defuse  andcontinue to defuse  potential political tensions environmental dangers and social complications.The progress recorded in the United Nations overthe years is impressive and a source of greatsatisfaction to my Government. The goals achieved while relevant the world over  lie extremely close tothe heart of the area of which Malta forms part. TheMediterranean can be seen as a microcosm of the largerworld stage. We have faced  and continue to face intermittent conflicts and wide gaps in developmentlevels. The shortage of freshwater resources in someareas is potentially another serious challenge. Despitebeing a sea of promise and great opportunity  theMediterranean continues to challenge our political willto nurture long-lasting stability. Security in theMediterranean requires committed and quietdetermination to identify both the problems and  moreimportantly  the solutions. The element of dialogue thathas so often underscored the work of the UnitedNations has brought much to the enhancement ofrelations between the States of that part of the world.Malta indeed not only shares the aspirations of theUnited Nations in this regard  but has striventhroughout the years to ensure that they become anintegral part of all dealings in the Mediterranean.Together with the rest of the world community Malta welcomes the progress made in the Middle Eastpeace process. We hope that the same determination ashelped overcome seemingly insurmountable obstaclesin the past will continue to inspire the protagonists towork for the goal of a just and permanent peace andsecurity for our Middle Eastern neighbours.The Balkans are another part of theMediterranean area that also continues to challenge thewill of the international community in its quest forstability and its determination to ensure that fullrespect for human rights becomes the common heritageof all peoples who live there. In this respect  everypositive development is of the utmost importance.For over 25 years the situation in Cyprus hasremained a cause of concern. We therefore earnestlyhope that an early settlement of the Cyprus questionwill be found. In this connection  the MalteseGovernment reiterates its full support for the Secretary-General's efforts to find a solution on the basis of therelevant Security Council resolutions.The Mediterranean has also been witness to thecruel and merciless trafficking in human beings  atragic and criminal exploitation of the misery of others.We welcome the initiatives taken by the ItalianGovernment at the Conference for Development andSecurity in the Adriatic and the Ionian held in Ancona29last May. The broad parameters established in thatConference can indeed serve as a prototype for similaragreements elsewhere.Malta has always been acutely aware of the role itcan play in bridging the divides of this complex area.Successive Maltese Governments have consistentlypromoted efforts to develop and consolidatecooperation between the littoral States of theMediterranean at both a bilateral and multilateral level.In the mid-1970s we hosted the preparatorymeeting that led to the Barcelona Convention thatlaunched the Mediterranean Action Plan. In 1995 weargued in favour of a Mediterranean stability pact forthe region  a proposal which is now taking shape in theform of a Euro-Mediterranean charter for peace andstability. In 1997  at a time of difficult politicalcircumstances for the area  Malta hosted the secondEuro-Mediterranean Ministerial Conference  followingthat of Barcelona in 1995. More recently  Malta wasone of the prime movers behind a recommendationwithin the Conference on Security Co-operation in theMediterranean process of the Inter-ParliamentaryUnion for the establishment of a ParliamentaryAssembly of Mediterranean States. These initiativesserve to underscore our commitment to theachievement of peace  prosperity and a just solution tothe demands of the Mediterranean people.We believe  however  that on our own we canonly do so much  and that therefore the principle ofmultilateralism  as enshrined in last week'sDeclaration  must be fully respected and observed. Aswas stated in the final Declaration of the MillenniumSummit  the management of economic and socialdevelopment  as well as the risks and threats tointernational peace and security  must be a sharedresponsibility. Freedom  equality  solidarity  toleranceand respect for the natural environment are goalstowards which our combined energies and effortsshould be channelled.It is for these reasons that we have chosen topursue the path of membership of the European Union.It is the common values and principles that inspired thebirth of what is today the European Union that inspireus in our quest. This is because it is throughmembership that we feel we can best play our part onthe international stage  and contribute more effectivelytowards the promotion of peace and progress in theMediterranean. We feel that our capabilities to play auseful role may be greatly enhanced from within theEuropean Union. This is not solely for our own localbenefit. We believe that our membership will give theEuropean Union an added dimension that will serve tobenefit both the northern and southern shores of theMediterranean littoral.Good governance is what we  the peoples of theUnited Nations  seek at a national  regional andinternational level. Yet good governance is exactlywhat is threatened by a number of phenomena thatplague our contemporary society. Ranging from thetrafficking of drugs to that of armaments and humanbeings  international organized crime threatens the verytexture of law and order through abuse  corruption andviolence. The growth of related crimes also alerts us tothe need for ever closer international cooperation.As much as the socio-political environmentrequires constant vigilance  so too does the physicalenvironment. Global warming remains a constantconcern  and we urge that the undertakings to ward offthe further degradation of the ozone layer be fullyadhered to.Questions of disarmament  extreme poverty  thestriking proportions of HIV and AIDS and thevulnerability of the disabled  infirm and thosediscriminated against on the basis of race or religionremain ever present on the world agenda. At no timemust we lose sight of these very real issues faced by ahuge proportion of the world's people. We must  inpursuit of a more caring and equitable society  seek tounderstand and subsequently meet the needs of thesevulnerable members of society. It is not sufficient topromote global e-commerce and ever new economicworld orders if we do not also tackle the root causes ofmany of the problems in the developing world. Weneed to convert these enormous challenges intomoments of opportunity. We need to harness thepositive forces of globalization  the new knowledge-based economy and the opportunities of trade to bridgethe divides that persist throughout each and everycontinent.The United Nations has taken a leading role inpromoting international understanding and agreementin relation to these varied and diverse areas. Indeed  awide spectrum of activities  international agreementsand agencies of the United Nations have been put togood use in the creation of the impetus necessary forchange. We must continue in our endeavours to bring30people to a common understanding of how this can bestbe consolidated  not solely through dialogue  butthrough concrete actions that must necessarily follow.The number and variety of tasks that face theUnited Nations are by no means small. Malta is however  convinced that the United Nations is theforum best positioned to provide workable options andlong-term solutions to the problems that plague theworld and man's relations with it. Last week'sMillennium Summit clearly demonstrated theinternational community's renewed commitment to thisunique and indispensable Organization and its vital rolein the maintenance of peace and stability  theeradication of poverty  ignorance and disease and theprotection of the global environment.If the Millennium Summit charted our coursetowards making the United Nations a more effectiveinstrument in the hands of the world's peoples  then theMillennium Assembly must come to be remembered asthe point in time when the first major decisions weretaken to place the Organization firmly on this chosenpath. I hope that these will not be merely emptydeclarations of intent  but that each Government andeach of us here present today will endeavour to betterour corner of the globe as best we can. My Governmentremains determined to play its part."
"113",4718,"MMR",55,2000,"At the outset  I would liketo warmly congratulate you  Sir  on your well-deservedelection to the presidency of this historic MillenniumAssembly. We firmly believe that  under your ablestewardship  the first session of the General Assemblyin the new century will be a resounding success. Thissession provides us with an opportune moment to takestock of the track record of the Organization  itsachievements and the areas where it needs to bestrengthened so that it will be equal to the challengesof the new century.I also wish to express our gratitude to yourpredecessor  Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab of Namibia  for theleadership he provided us in our preparations for thisMillennium Assembly and for his tireless efforts andthe dedication  skill and intelligent management withwhich he led the last session of the General Assemblyof the twentieth century to a successful conclusion.My delegation is most delighted to see in ourmidst Tuvalu as a new Member of this worldOrganization. With the admission of Tuvalu as the189th Member of this Organization  our objective ofuniversal membership is closer to reality. On behalf ofthe delegation of the Union of Myanmar  I would liketo extend our warmest congratulations to the delegationof Tuvalu.After the Second World War  under the Charter ofthe United Nations  we established the present systemof collective security. Since then  we have witnessedsubstantial changes in the geopolitical map of theworld  leading to new realities in internationalrelations. There is a strong consensus that ourOrganization must be reformed and adapted to the newrealities in order to enable it to effectively respond tothe new challenges. This consensus has resulted invarious measures and proposals to reform theOrganization  including a process to make the SecurityCouncil more effective  democratic  transparent andaccountable.When this process started in 1993  we had hopedthat we would have completed the reform of theCouncil by the beginning of the new millennium. Afterseven years of discussion on the reform of the Council however  reality has revealed that the issue we took onwas so complex that it could not be resolved quickly.While there has been convergence of ideas on someareas  in others we have come to an impasse. This doesnot mean that we should give up. On the contrary  weshould explore new possible avenues to enhance themomentum we have gained. We must make use of thishistoric opportunity to give added impetus to reformingthe Council so that it meets the needs of our time.We believe that  at this stage of deliberations  weshould identify areas of possible agreement and buildon them. For instance  it appears to be generally agreedthat the Council should be expanded in both categoriesof permanent and non-permanent membership.Similarly  a majority of countries tends to agree thatthe new members should come from among thedeveloped and developing countries alike. While wecontinue our discussion on other aspects of the issue  itwould be conducive to the reform process if we couldestablish general agreement on such possible areaswhere our views converge. I trust that the futurediscussions among us will give serious thought to thesepossibilities. We must redouble the efforts to reformour Organization so that it can truly serve us in ourendeavour to build a better world.As we enter the new millennium  we find to ourdismay and alarm that some major international issuespersist in defying our collective creativity and attemptsto solve them. We must not let these setbacks cast ashadow over the credibility and effectiveness of thisOrganization. We consider it our primary duty to focusour attention on those questions dealing withdevelopment as well as those dealing with peace andsecurity.Despite the efforts of the internationalcommunity  peace throughout the Middle East remainselusive. We hope that the important progress made sofar will pave the way for achieving a just and lastingpeace in the region. We would like to see an enduringpeace in the Middle East  one which would guaranteethe restoration of the inalienable rights of thePalestinian people and the right of Israel to exist withinsecure and recognized borders.There are many other questions that merit ourattention. One such question I wish to bring to theattention of the Assembly is that of Cyprus. Thisquestion has been on the Assembly's agenda for thelast 26 years. We are heartened to note that the UnitedNations is now engaged in another effort to solve the13problem. Myanmar has consistently supported thenegotiations between the Greek and Turkish Cypriotcommunities under the auspices of the United NationsSecretary-General  and we would like to take thisopportunity to pledge our continued full support for thetask.Let me touch upon an important question that isof serious concern to the international community andon which we in Myanmar place special emphasis. I amreferring to the problem of narcotic drugs. Nationallyspeaking  this is a problem that we inherited from thecolonial administration. The poppy plant  from whichopium is harvested  is not native to Myanmar. It wasintroduced into our country by the colonialadministration  which relied on licensed opium dens asa source of revenue. Since then  this evil scourge hasbedevilled the country. Successive Governments havebeen relentless in their efforts to eradicate the problemof narcotic drugs.Thus  the eradication of poppy cultivationremains one of the top priorities for Myanmar.Notwithstanding the harsh and undue criticism levelledagainst Myanmar for a problem with wide internationaldimensions  our sustained efforts to combat theproblem of narcotic drugs have resulted in a noticeabledrop in opium cultivation and production. This fact isacknowledged by the International Narcotics ControlBoard (INCB). Here  it bears reiteration that narcoticdrugs are a global problem  to be solved in a concertedmanner and through global efforts. The problem mustbe tackled in a holistic manner  both from theproduction side and the demand reduction side.National efforts must be supported by internationalassistance and cooperation. Myanmar has been tryingto combat this global problem mainly with its ownresources. Except for the assistance provided by theUnited Nations International Drug Control Programme(UNDCP)  no substantial assistance has been providedto Myanmar in its current efforts to combat this globalmenace. This is tantamount to making a travesty of themuch-avowed principle of shared responsibility.Despite our efforts  Myanmar has been a target ofunfair criticism and censure. An objective assessmentwill identify which countries are making real efforts toeffectively tackle this global problem and whichcountries are paying mere lip service. The fact of thematter is that the scourge of narcotic drugs is not thesole responsibility of any one country. No countryacting on its own can successfully overcome thismenace. To tackle this global problem  we must joinhands and cooperate with each other. Myanmar standsready to do so.The principles enshrined in the Charter haveserved the world community well for more than fivedecades. Sovereignty  sovereign equality  respect forterritorial integrity and non-intervention in internalaffairs are cardinal principles that remain vital for thepeace and security of all nations. These areirreplaceable bedrock principles underpinning thecurrent international system. These are the principlesthat have enabled the international community tosuccessfully deter world conflagrations. Therefore  weare greatly dismayed by the recent tendency in somequarters to cast doubt on the continued soundness ofthese basic principles.There are some who are bent on compromisingthese cardinal principles of international relations voicing support for interference in countries' internalaffairs on various grounds. This is indeed a dangeroustrend  with dangerous implications for the peace andstability of our international system. At a time whenthe powerful increasingly make use of variousinternational forums to fulfil their hidden politicalagendas  a very valid question must be posed: whodetermines the existence of a situation that warrantsinterference in internal affairs? The justification ofinterference in internal affairs under certain conditionsis a concept easily vulnerable to abuse by the powerfulfor their narrow national interests. Interference  evenfor such a worthy cause as humanitarian assistance  canundermine the principles of neutrality and impartiality thus endangering the entire system of humanitarianassistance. A well-intentioned mistake can unravel thefabric of the present international system  which hasstood us in good stead.No nation is entirely free from problems ordifficulties. While some are more successful in solvingtheir problems  others are less successful. There aresome situations where the assistance of theinternational community is necessary to resolve theseissues and difficulties; in other situations  nationalmeasures would best suit the situation. In trying toresolve these problems  a proper understanding and acorrect perspective on the issue  both historical andcurrent  are necessary. A solution obtained withoutsuch understanding and perspective is tantamount totreating the symptoms rather than the disease.14A careful look at countries with ongoing conflictsdemonstrates that some issues are not susceptible to aneasy and quick solution. They are deeply rooted inintra-State tensions and mistrust that have beenlingering for hundreds of years. There are instanceswhen seemingly successful solutions causing fleetingeuphoria have turned out to be pyrrhic victories. This isprincipally because the root causes were neverthoroughly understood and addressed.Furthermore  appropriate and pragmatic nationalattempts at finding lasting solutions should beencouraged and supported. There are many cases wherethe role of the international community isindispensable. There are also many other cases whereits proper role should be limited to assisting the Stateconcerned in its efforts  complementing those effortsonly where necessary.The situation in Myanmar has been the subject ofunfair scrutiny and political pressure by a number ofpowerful countries for quite some time. Therefore  Ifind it appropriate to take this opportunity to apprisethe Members of the Organization of the situation in mycountry. The Government of Myanmar is in the processof establishing a democratic society. In this endeavour it has chosen the path that is most suitable to thecountry  its people and its historical peculiarities.Contemporary history has shown that the transition todemocracy from a totally different and centralizedpolitical and economic system is not always smooth. Itrequires ingenuity  patience and understanding to makethe process peaceful.Here I wish to underscore that the presentMyanmar Government is making all-out efforts tosolve the most fundamental problem of the country: theconsolidation of national unity. Without satisfactorilyresolving this basic question  the objectives ofdemocracy  peace  prosperity and stability will not berealized. National unity will not be consolidated if wecannot address issues such as the eradication ofpoverty  equitable distribution of national wealth andthe maintenance of peace and security.The people of Myanmar share the view that theseissues must be adequately addressed first and foremostin order to achieve the emergence of a developed peaceful and prosperous State.It is at this important and delicate juncture that allsorts of superficial and unsubstantiated charges arebeing made against us  placing many obstacles alongour chosen path to democracy. This line of approachwill only perpetuate the existing programmes in thecountry. It will give rise to unnecessary delays in ourcurrent democratization process. Here I wish to stressthat it was a situation of chaos and anarchy that hadthreatened the country's survival as a State and that ledthe Tatmadaw  the armed forces  to assume Statepower. Although the present Government is a militarygovernment  the country is not governed by martiallaw. The entire body of legislation remains in place andthe country is governed according to these legalprovisions. The country also retains an independentjudicial system.Despite all obstacles placed in our path todevelopment and against all odds  we have madeconsiderable achievements  both economically andpolitically. On the political front  because of theGovernment's endeavour to build national unity  17armed groups have returned to the legal fold. We havebeen able to establish unprecedented peace andtranquillity. We have also made considerable strides inthe country's economy. The country's gross domesticproduct continues to grow year after year. Theeconomy registered 10.9 per cent growth last year. Thisgrowth pattern is expected to continue this year. Theeffective control of inflation also resulted in anappreciable increase in the living standard of thepeople of Myanmar. The people of the country are fullyconscious of all these remarkable achievements. Theyare fully aware that they themselves are the directbeneficiaries of these positive results. The Governmentis determined to redouble its efforts to bring aboutpeace and stability and a better standard of life for thepeople of Myanmar.The peace and stability that we have today do notcome easily. It is only in recent years that peace andstability returned to virtually all corners of the country.What we are doing is laying down a firm foundationnecessary to build a modern  prosperous and peacefulnation. Far from recognizing the unprecedentedachievements made by the Government  some Westerncountries have imposed on us political pressure andunilateral sanctions. International financial institutionsare being used to deny us our rightful loans andassistance. These are hampering all our sincere andvigorous efforts to address the pressing problems of thenation and to uplift the country to a prosperous stage.However  we will continue on our chosen path ofbuilding a democratic society best suited to our15traditions  thus fulfilling the aspirations of our people.We are resolute in our determination to develop thecountry in the shortest possible time.In accordance with Myanmar's foreign policy Myanmar makes every effort to forge friendly relationswith all countries. In conformity with this time-testedpolicy  we have successfully established friendly andclose relations with all neighbouring countries. It is apolicy that we pursue in our relations with fellowmembers of the Association of South-East AsianNations (ASEAN)  countries of the region and all othercountries of the world. I wish to take this opportunityto urge those countries that now have negative viewson Myanmar to look at our situation in a moreobjective manner. We are building a democraticsociety  a society in which peace and stability prevails a society where our people can enjoy a better life inlarger freedom.What we urgently need in the new century is therealization of a just and an equitable internationalorder. We need an international order where right  andnot might  prevails. In establishing such aninternational order  the United Nations is the onlyorganization that can provide the necessary leadership.The envisaged international order must also respect theright of every nation to adopt the political  economicand social systems that best suit its domestic context. Itmust be an international order in which the legitimatedesire of every nation for justice and equality isaccepted by powerful States with understanding andsympathy. In this  the role of the United Nations  as theprincipal intergovernmental institution of universalnature  is irreplaceable. Hegemonic tendencies andpower politics will certainly undermine the basis ofinternational relations and will thereby jeopardize oursystem of collective security.It is my fervent hope that every Member Statewill play its part and make this Organization equal tothe challenges of the new century. At this MillenniumAssembly let us all resolve to translate the ideals of theOrganization into a concrete reality throughcooperation  goodwill and firm commitments."
"114",4775,"MNG",55,2000,"Allow me atthe outset to join previous speakers in congratulatingyou  Sir  on your election as President of theMillennium Assembly of the United Nations. Allow mealso to express my confidence that under your skilfulstewardship this session of the General Assembly willsuccessfully accomplish its mandate. I also wish tocommend our outgoing President  Mr. Theo-BenGurirab  for his eminent leadership during the previoussession of the Assembly.My delegation extends its warm welcome to theGovernment and the people of Tuvalu  whosemembership has brought the United Nations yetanother step closer to universality.This session of the General Assembly is entrustedwith the honourable mission of following up on whatwas agreed by the Millennium Summit of worldleaders. For me personally  this session is also veryspecial. For 26 years  or most of my diplomatic career I have been associated with the United Nations. I feelparticularly privileged to deliver as Foreign Minister apolicy statement of my Government from this rostrum.A few days ago  Member States reaffirmed at thehighest level their commitment to the purposes andprinciples of the United Nations Charter  theirunequivocal support for a more efficient andreinvigorated United Nations and their firm resolve tocollectively work towards a healthier and cleanerworld  free from fear and free from want. TheMillennium Declaration underscored the collectiveresponsibility of world leaders to uphold the principlesof human dignity  equality and equity at the globallevel.That sense of solidarity and shared responsibilityis  in our view  crucial for the international communityto be able to address effectively the formidablechallenges at the dawn of the new millennium. Thechallenges the world faces today are indeed manifoldand complex  both in scope and nature. The centralchallenge  as identified in the Secretary-General'smillennium report  is how to make globalization moreinclusive and have its benefits equitably enjoyed by allnations.4As recently as the mid-1980s  the notion ofglobality was virtually unknown in the internationalvocabulary  let alone the concepts of global governanceor global climate change. Yet just a little more than adecade later  not only does the idea of globality blendwith our day-to-day life  globalization per se has turnedinto a powerful and inevitable process. Globalizationhas been generously showered lately with both praiseand criticism. Along with greater opportunities  it canalso lead to situations of heightened insecurity especially for the weak and poor nations. As myPresident  Natsagiyn Bagabandi  noted in hisMillennium address “Mongolia believes that  with its impartiality anduniversal legitimacy  as well as its Charter-basedprevalence over any other internationalagreement  the United Nations is uniquely placedto provide an overarching general guidance to theprocess of globalization … so that it incorporatesthe human dimension in its seemingly unrulytrends”. (A/55/PV.4)As we draw lessons from the 1997-1998 Asianfinancial crisis  it has become more evident that theprocess of globalization ought to be managed so as tomake the best of its opportunities and diminish itsnegative effects; and that internal policies  no matterhow righteous  are not sufficient to ensure sustainedeconomic growth in this era of growinginterdependence. This is even more true fordeveloping  structurally disadvantaged countries. In aglobally liberalized trade and financial system  thesecountries need to be assisted to withstand powerfulexternal forces  which so often are utterly destructive.Again  this necessitates a genuine display of solidarityand shared responsibility on the part of theinternational community.The global fight against abject poverty  inequalityand disparity  violence  HIV/AIDS  organized crimeand other acute problems is being impeded by  interalia  the increasing external debt burden  the decline inofficial development assistance and the growing digitaland development divides between haves and have-nots.The affluent countries could exhibit their solidarity andshared responsibility by further opening their markets providing deeper and faster debt relief  and givingmore and better-focused development assistance andincentives for foreign direct investment flows to theirless fortunate partners. In this context  Mongolia looksto the upcoming high-level international conference onfinancing for development  the Third United NationsConference on the Least Developed Countries  and thenew multilateral trade negotiations to produce specific time-bound commitments.Mongolia welcomes the South SummitDeclaration and the Havana Programme of Action aswell as the outcome of the meeting between the G-77and the G-8 in Okinawa as important juncturesproviding an inspiring vision for more action-orientedSouth-South cooperation and a meaningful North-South partnership.My delegation attaches great importance to thedecisions adopted at the tenth session of the UnitedNations Conference on Trade and Development(UNCTAD)  which underscored the necessity ofcreating a legal environment that would facilitatetransit traffic for landlocked developing countries improve transit infrastructure and increase efficiency oftrade by eliminating transport and bureaucraticbottlenecks. Here  I am pleased to announce that a firstspecific step to enhance and facilitate multilateraltransit transport cooperation is being taken in theNorth-East Asian region. As a result of a tripartitemeeting held in Ulan Bator under the auspices ofUNCTAD earlier this year  Mongolia  Russia andChina have agreed to conclude a transit trafficframework agreement. Negotiations to draft such anagreement are under way.My delegation further believes that the upcomingfifth meeting of governmental experts from landlockedand transit developing countries and representatives ofdonor countries and financial development institutions as well as a ministerial meeting on transit transportissues  expected to be held in 2003  will play a criticalrole in strengthening a common framework of action toease the burden faced by landlocked developingcountries.We support the proposals put forward in themillennium report by the Secretary-General onimproving the provision of health services andcommunications in areas stricken by natural disasters.As some might be aware  heavy snowstorms and theextremely cold winter of 1999-2000 in Mongoliacaused the loss of nearly 3 million heads of livestock or about 10 per cent of the nation's entire livestockpopulation. Besides the direct loss of livestock  theseheavy winter conditions  known as dzud  had othergravely devastating economic and social consequences 5including the loss of precious human lives. I would liketo take this opportunity to express  on behalf of myGovernment and the people of Mongolia  our sinceregratitude to those Governments  internationalorganizations and individuals that rendered timelyassistance and support in our efforts to overcome theconsequences of dzud.As world leaders solemnly reaffirmed in theirMillennium Declaration “the United Nations is the indispensablecommon house of the entire human family through which we will seek to realize ouruniversal aspirations for peace  cooperation anddevelopment.”(A/RES/55/2  para. 32)If the United Nations is to adequately respond tothe challenges of today's increasingly interdependentand rapidly changing world  a great deal will dependon its ability to adapt itself to an environment that ismarkedly different from the one in which it wasconceived by its founders 55 years ago.The demands on the Organization have increasedmany times over  especially in the area ofpeacekeeping. The lessons of Srebrenica  Rwanda andSierra Leone have made it abundantly clear that athorough and critical review is needed to makepeacekeeping operations succeed in meeting ourcommitment under the Charter. We are deeply indebtedto the United Nations Panel on Peace Operations chaired by Ambassador Brahimi  which  in its report presented a frank analysis of the prevailing situationand forthright recommendations for change. The reportdeserves serious consideration and specific action atthis session of the General Assembly.Mongolia stands committed to making a practicalcontribution to United Nations peacekeepingoperations. As part of its efforts to adequately equip itsmilitary officers and units for participation therein Mongolia took part for the first time in recent trainingexercises held in Kazakhstan for Central Asiancountries.Efforts to reform the Security Council have notyet brought us closer to resolving some of thefundamental issues on the agenda of the Open-endedWorking Group on that question. Like many others  wecontinue to believe that the expansion of the SecurityCouncil should take place made in both categories permanent and non-permanent. In the former category along with major industrialized Powers such as Japanand Germany  developing countries from Asia  Africaand Latin America that are able to contribute to themaintenance of international peace and security shouldoccupy their rightful place in the Council. A reasonableincrease in the number of non-permanent seats wouldreflect the representative character of the Council andenable a growing number of Member States tocontribute to its work. An essential part of the reformprocess should deal with the veto power  the use ofwhich should be considerably curtailed.Mongolias vision of the future of the UnitedNations has been elaborated in the memorandum of itsGovernment on enhancing the role of the UnitedNations in promoting the security interests of smallStates  circulated in the United Nations as documentA/55/310.North-East Asia is a region where the interests ofthe big and powerful intersect  where the leftovers ofthe cold-war era are still discernible  and whereterritorial disputes await a positive solution.Nonetheless  groundbreaking developments are takingplace which give rise to optimism and hope. I have inmind the historic inter-Korean summit  which hasplayed a crucial role for building trust and confidencebetween the two countries. This and other recentdevelopments may well have a positive impact on thesituation in North-East Asia as a whole.Due to its historical and geopolitical realities North-East Asia is probably the only subregion thatlacks a mechanism at the governmental level wheresecurity issues of concern can be discussedcollectively. Various ideas and proposals to this effecthave been floating around for some time  but noserious discussion of this issue has taken place so far atthe track one level. The time may have come to startthinking about the possibility of engaging in adialogue  starting with a free exchange of views on theframework of these discussions.As we review the progress made in the area ofarms limitation  disarmament and non-proliferation our reaction can at best be termed as mixed. Whilethere has been some movement forward in certainareas  there has been little or no progress in others.The 2000 Review Conference of the StatesParties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons (NPT) included in its FinalDocument a number of agreed conclusions and6recommendations related to nuclear disarmament. Forthe first time ever  with reference to article VI  all thenuclear-weapon States made“an unequivocal undertaking to accomplish thetotal elimination of their nuclear arsenals  leadingto total nuclear disarmament to which all Statesparties are committed under article VI”.(NPT/CONF.2000/28  part I  p. 14  para. 15 (6))The Conference also agreed on the need toestablish in the Conference on Disarmament anappropriate subsidiary body with a mandate to dealwith nuclear disarmament. It called for the immediateestablishment of such a body. The Conference alsocalled for further efforts by the nuclear-weapon Statesto reduce their nuclear arsenals unilaterally and forfurther reductions of non-strategic nuclear weapons based on unilateral initiatives as an integral part of thenuclear disarmament process. A call has been made forthe engagement  as soon as appropriate  of all thenuclear-weapon States in a process leading to the totalelimination of their nuclear arsenal. These elementsconstitute an important statement of purpose and  iftranslated into practice  will open the way to practicalnuclear disarmament measures.Mongolia welcomes the ratification by theRussian Federation of the Comprehensive Test BanTreaty (CTBT) and START II treaties  and we lookforward to the United States' ratification of the CTBTat an early date. We urge the Russian Federation andthe United States to follow up on their earlierannouncement regarding the discussions on theSTART III Treaty.Mongolia joins the international appeal to the keyStates to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test BanTreaty so that it could be brought into force as soon aspossible. The urgency of this call becomes even morecompelling in light of the activities that could seriouslyundermine the nuclear non-proliferation regime.My delegation also believes that it is importantfor the Conference on Disarmament  which for severalyears has been unable to agree on a programme ofwork  to end its stalemate and to engage in earnestnegotiations on an early conclusion of a universal andverifiable fissile materials cut-off treaty. Pending thenegotiation of that treaty  we would welcome amoratorium by the nuclear-weapon-States on theproduction of weapons-grade fissile materials and forgreater transparency through disclosure of their presentstocks. Better still  we would urge the United Nationsto establish a register for all stocks of weapons-gradefissile material. This would help establish an importantbalance with the United Nations Register ofConventional Arms.We welcome the decision taken by the UnitedStates to postpone the deployment of a national missiledefence system. The undermining of the Anti-BallisticMissile (ABM) Treaty  a cornerstone of strategicstability  could trigger an uncontrollable nuclear armsrace.The growing emphasis placed of late on nuclearweapons in military doctrines is a cause of increasingconcern. It is  therefore  only natural that countries likeMongolia favour the adoption of such steps as de-alerting of nuclear weapons  removal of nuclearwarheads from delivery vehicles and joint undertakingsby the nuclear-weapon powers of a pledge not to be thefirst to use nuclear weapons. These are essential safetymeasures that would reduce the risk of unauthorized ormiscalculated use of nuclear weapons. In addition provision should be made for legally binding negativesecurity assurances to non-nuclear States Parties to theNPT  as has become customary for nuclear-weaponStates in signing Protocols to nuclear-weapon-freezone treaties. In this context  Mongolia welcomes theSecretary-General's proposal to convene a majorinternational conference aimed at identifying ways ofeliminating nuclear dangers. We hope that this timelyproposal will be given serious consideration at thissession of the General Assembly  followed by theadoption of a relevant resolution to this effect.Mongolia shares the legitimate concern of theworld community over the global proliferation of smallarms and light weapons  which are the principalinstruments of death wherever conflicts and warsoccur. We hope that the United Nations Conference onthe Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons inAll Its Aspects  scheduled for 2001  will result inpractical measures designed to tighten control  curb thespread and destroy surplus weapons.As is known  in 1992 Mongolia declared itsterritory a nuclear-weapon-free zone; this was widelysupported by the international community. Since thenwe have come a long way. At its fifty-third session theGeneral Assembly adopted resolution 53/77 D entitled“Mongolia's international security and nuclear-weapon-free status”. As a follow-up to its declaration 7the Mongolian Parliament adopted a law last Februaryon Mongolia's nuclear-weapon-free status  thusinstitutionalizing it at the national level. At thissession  we expect a joint statement by the nuclear-weapon States to provide security assurances toMongolia in connection with its nuclear-weapon-freestatus  which would represent an important step alongthe road to institutionalizing that status at theinternational level. I wish to put on record myGovernment's appreciation to the five PermanentMembers for their constructive cooperation andsupport.We believe that the aforementioned securityassurances would be more credible if Mongolia's otherexternal security issues were duly addressed. In thatcase  not only would the status be more credible; but itwould also allow Mongolia to serve as a positive factorof stability and predictability in the region. In thisconnection  we certainly share the view of theSecretary-General  expressed in his report on this item that consultations with the relevant United Nationsbodies will produce concrete and action-orientedapproaches to addressing the non-nuclear aspects ofsecurity.In line with the broader approach to security  andon the basis of relevant provisions of theaforementioned resolution  the InternationalConference on Human Security in a Globalized World in the context of Mongolia  was held this year with theparticipation of the United Nations and internationalexperts; it produced detailed recommendations on awide range of human security-related areas. In manyrespects  the recommendations of our Conferenceparallel the spirit and concepts of the MillenniumDeclaration.In July of this year parliamentary elections wereheld in Mongolia  the fourth elections since the onsetof democratic reforms a decade ago. The electionswere recognized as free and fair by all political forces as well as by international observers  and served as atestimony of further consolidation of democratic normsand institutions in my country. They proved once againthat the embrace of democracy and respect for humanrights are an irreversible choice made by theMongolian people. As a result of the elections  theMongolian People's Revolutionary Party won anoverwhelming majority of seats in the Parliament.From this high rostrum  I wish to reiterate myGovernment's robust commitment to the consolidationof democracy and the continuity of reforms. The taskof ensuring human security and promoting human-centred development is high on the agenda of the newGovernment  as envisaged in its action programme.The Government is resolved to ensure sustainedeconomic growth through reinvigorating andencouraging the development of domestic industry upgrading the living standards of the people byreducing poverty and unemployment and ensuringequitable social and educational opportunities.The Government of Mongolia will intensify thestructural reforms and encourage an export-oriented private sector-led economy. Mining  the processing ofraw materials of animal origin  tourism and otherexport-oriented sectors are the priority areas ofdevelopment. The privatization of State assets including the most valued State enterprises  willcontinue. The creation of a favourable environment forthe attraction of foreign investment is also a priorityobjective.I fully share the view expressed in theMillennium Report that success depends to aconsiderable degree on the quality of governance thecountry enjoys. Hence  my Government attachesparticular importance to enhancing the effectiveness transparency and accountability of public offices andfighting corruption in both corporate and public areas.The Government of Mongolia is determined tocooperate closely with non-governmental organizationsand other representatives of civil society in enhancingthe rule of law throughout the country.In its endeavours to carry out simultaneouseconomic and political reforms  Mongolia isencountering a multitude of challenges. The eighthmeeting of the Mongolia Assistance Group will be heldlater this year in Paris  and my Government isconfident that our foreign partners will continue toextend their generous support and cooperation so as toease the transition challenges faced by my country.In pursuing its foreign policy  based on thecontinuity of a multi-pillar  open and proactiveapproach  Mongolia will continue to develop andexpand its friendly relations with the RussianFederation and the People's Republic of China on theprinciples of good-neighbourliness  mutual benefit andequality. My Government will accord high importanceto the further development of bilateral relations withthe industrialized nations  including the United States8of America  Japan  other Asian and Pacific countriesand members of the European Union. Their political moral and financial support will continue to play animportant role in facilitating our reform efforts. TheMongolian Government will actively strive tostrengthen our traditional long-standing relations withEastern and Central European countries  as well as withthe developing countries of Asia and the Pacific  LatinAmerica and Africa.Mongolia will continue its active participation inmultilateral processes and international organizations such as the United Nations  and will spare no effort toensure that the world Organization remains a focalpoint for the coordination of the efforts of thecommunity of nations towards peace and developmentin the years to come."
"115",4862,"MRT",55,2000,"On behalf of the Islamic Republic ofMauritania  I should like to congratulate Mr. HarriHolkeri on his election to the presidency of the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly. We areconfident that his personal qualities and his extensivepolitical and diplomatic experience are an excellent36guarantee of the success of this session. I should like toassure him of the full cooperation of our delegation inthis lofty task.I should like also to seize this opportunity toexpress our sincere thanks to his predecessor Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  for the outstanding way inwhich he guided the work of the previous session. I paytribute also to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan.We deeply appreciate his efforts to reform andrestructure the Organization as well as to develop itsmethods of work and rationalize its role in all domainsso that it meet the needs and challenges of today.In this respect  we listened closely to theSecretary-General?s presentation of his report on thework of the Organization. It is also my pleasure towelcome Tuvalu as a new Member of the Organization.We are prepared to cooperate fully with it in order toachieve the objectives of our Organization.The reform and restructuring process of theUnited Nations bodies has become a necessity for thecommon interest. The conditions in which the UnitedNations was founded more than 50 years ago havechanged  and major developments have taken place inall fields and at all levels  making it essential to reviewthe methods of work and structure of the Organization.For that reason  we support the expansion of theSecurity Council  in keeping with the principles oftransparency and justice  so as to achieve equitablegeographic representation and to reflect theuniversality of the Organization  in accordance withArticle 24 of the Charter.This session is being held at the dawn of the thirdmillennium  at a time when the majority of humanity isliving in conditions that prevent them from realizingtheir aspirations. Despite some encouraging indicatorsin some of the third-world countries  the general trendis towards a wider gap between the industrializedworld and the developing one  which is facing majorobstacles such as external debt  low prices for theircommodities  and the difficulty of accessing worldmarkets.Our Organization should exert all possible effortsto alleviate the economic and social difficultiesconfronting the developing countries. It must help themaccelerate their development in an effective manner byincreasing official development assistance and byallowing more direct foreign investments into thesecountries and the opening of the markets of thedeveloped countries to the products of developingones  all of which will contribute to the establishmentof a new world order based on consensus  cooperationand solidarity among all States.The problem of debt must also benefit from theattention and the interest of the internationalcommunity  because it is an obstacle to the economiesof the developing countries. In this respect  my countryhopes that the initiative undertaken to alleviate the debtof highly indebted and poor countries will contribute tothe solution of this problem.The world today is facing numerous problemsand challenges  the effects of which are not containedby national boundaries. They jeopardize internationalsecurity and undermine the achievements registered inall fields. Thus it is our duty to work relentlessly toresolve these problems. They include  to give but a fewexamples  terrorism  poverty and violations of humanrights.In this respect  my country wishes to reaffirm itscondemnation of the phenomenon of terrorism  inwhatever form and whatever its origin. We call for thereinforcement of cooperation and consultation at theinternational level in order to face this phenomenonwith determination.There is also a need to put in place policies andadopt measures to combat poverty  in order to ensuresustainable development. My country has created acommission entrusted with combating poverty and withimplementing concrete programmes aimed at preparingour citizens to play a role in development. Thiscommission is also responsible for guaranteeing thepromotion of individual and collective rights.In this context  I would like to recall the specialsession of the General Assembly on socialdevelopment  held in Geneva last June  whichreaffirmed and stressed once again the Programme ofAction adopted at the World Summit for SocialDevelopment  held in Copenhagen in 1995.We hope that the outcome of that special sessionwill contribute to an improvement in the livingconditions of all people and to the attainment ofsustainable development by strengthening the linksbetween social issues and development.We express our satisfaction at the outcome of lastJune?s special session of the General Assembly 37?Women 2000: gender equality  development and peacefor the twenty-first century?  and we hope it willenhance the role played by women in all spheres.The foreign policy of the Islamic Republic ofMauritania is founded on good-neighbourly relations peaceful coexistence and strengthening regional andinternational cooperation. In line with those principles my country attaches great importance to consolidatingstability and eliminating the causes of conflict andtension that can threaten international peace andsecurity and hamper development in many regions ofthe world.Turning to the Middle East  my country  whilereaffirming its support for the peace process  considersthat a just  lasting and comprehensive peace in theregion can come about only on the basis of the Madridagreements  the principle of land for peace  and the fullimplementation of Security Council resolutions 242(1967) and 338 (1973) to ensure complete Israeliwithdrawal from the occupied Palestinian territoriesand from the Syrian Golan and the restoration to thePalestinian people of their legitimate national rights foremost among them the right of self-determinationand the right to the establishment of an independentState with the holy city of Al-Quds Al-Sharif as itscapital. This requires us to intensify our efforts toovercome the obstacles to peace in the region  a regionthat so sorely needs a chance to realize its potential andto turn a new page in the history of its peoples. In thatcontext  we note with satisfaction the Israeliwithdrawal from southern Lebanon.We hope that efforts to bring stability andunderstanding to the Gulf region will be successful. Mycountry reaffirms its respect for and adherence tointernational legitimacy  and reiterates its rejection ofanything that could impinge on the independence orterritorial integrity of Kuwait  as well as its rejection ofany measure that would threaten the unity or territorialintegrity of Iraq. We call for an end to the embargoimposed against the Iraqi people  who have sufferedimmensely from that embargo; it is children  womenand the elderly who have suffered most.On the question of the Arab Maghreb  my countryis working staunchly and resolutely in cooperation withour sister countries in the Arab Maghreb Union tostrengthen cooperation and consultation to realize theaspirations of the people of that region.On Western Sahara  my country reaffirms itsreadiness to make every effort to promote theimplementation of the United Nations settlement planfor that conflict.Turning to developments in the Lockerbie crisis we wish to express our satisfaction at the progresstowards a comprehensive settlement  including thesuspension of the embargo imposed on Libya. Wewelcome the success of the diplomatic approach  andwe hope that this problem will be resolved once and forall.We are concerned about the ongoing conflict inSomalia  and we hope that our Somali brothers willagree to engage in constructive dialogue in a spirit ofresponsibility and patriotism with a view to a peacefulsettlement and to restoring unity and nationalsovereignty to the country so that it can once moreenjoy stability and a climate of conciliation.We regret the continuing tension in Sierra Leone and hope that ongoing efforts will bear fruit  so thatthat country  which for nine years has been suffering ina destructive war  can once again enjoy stability and aclimate of conciliation.On the situation in the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo  we reaffirm our support for the LusakaCeasefire Agreement  which in our view is the onlyacceptable framework for a peaceful  comprehensiveand lasting solution.With respect to Angola  my delegation reaffirmsits full support for Security Council resolutions 864(1993)  1127 (1997) and 1173 (1998)  and calls uponUNITA to fulfil its commitments under the LusakaProtocol so that peace and security may return to thatcountry.Turning to the conflict between Ethiopia andEritrea  we express our satisfaction at the ceasefireachieved thanks to the efforts of President AbelazizBouteflika of our sister country the People?sDemocratic Republic of Algeria. We hope that thenegotiations between the parties will result in a finalsolution to that conflict.On Kosovo  my country expresses its satisfactionat the positive developments towards ending theviolence  restoring confidence and rebuilding thecountry after many years of war.38The United Nations was established to attain thecommon purposes of all mankind  notably internationalpeace  security and stability. The text of the Chartercontains the provisions necessary to ensure a balancebetween the rights and the duties of all those wishingto serve the common interests of international society.That is why  at the dawn of the third millennium  wemust spare no effort to ensure the maintenance ofinternational peace and security."
"116",4908,"MUS",55,2000,"It gives me greatpleasure to address the Assembly under the leadershipof Mr. Harri Holkeri. I offer him our heartiestcongratulations on his election to preside over this firstsession of the new millennium and assure him of thetotal support and cooperation of my delegation.We would like also to thank Mr. Theo-BenGurirab  the Foreign Minister of Namibia  for theexcellent manner in which he presided over the work ofthe fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly. Thisyear again  we wish to compliment the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for his remarkable leadershipin the conduct of the work of the United Nations. Wepay special tribute also to the President of the fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly and to theSecretary-General for their imaginative and tirelessefforts in achieving the resounding success of theMillennium Summit  held here just a few weeks ago.We also wish to welcome Tuvalu as the newestMember of the United Nations family.During that historic Summit — the largestgathering of heads of State or Government the worldhas ever seen — the relevance and importance of theUnited Nations in a global society was emphasized.World leaders pledged most prominently theircommitment to ensuring that the United Nations adaptsto the new era and strengthens its capacity to deal withthe challenges of maintaining peace and security eliminating poverty and promoting development andprogress for the benefit of all humanity.13Since its inception  the United Nations has been abeacon of hope to mankind for a more secure andprosperous world. The recently adopted MillenniumDeclaration provides fresh impetus to the UnitedNations to rededicate itself to the fulfilment of the loftyideals of our Organization  namely to uphold worldpeace and security and promote cooperation anddevelopment in all areas of human endeavour.The maintenance of world peace and securityremains the biggest challenge for our Organization.The continued existence of nuclear arsenals and thethreat of a nuclear disaster represent a majorimpediment to the maintenance of peace and security.Following the end of the cold war  the feeling ofinsecurity created by nuclear militarization hasdiminished  but the international community'saspiration to global disarmament and the completeelimination of weapons of mass destruction within adefined time-frame has eluded us.We welcome all the efforts the internationalcommunity is making towards achieving universalacceptance of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons (NPT). Yet more than 30 000 nuclearweapons are deployed around the world  includingweapons that are still maintained in a high state ofreadiness. The risk that nuclear weapons may explode whether by design or by accident  is ever growing. Mydelegation is convinced that the early convening of aninternational conference on nuclear disarmament toaddress issues of global denuclearization  including thetotal elimination of all existing nuclear weapons withina specific time-frame  is of critical importance. Such aconference would allow all States  most importantlythose possessing nuclear capabilities and which do notfall under the purview of the NPT and theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT)  tovoice their concerns and contribute substantiallytowards achieving a world free of nuclear weapons.This is a debt we owe to generations yet unborn.The role of the Security Council in the crucialarea of international peace and security is evident.However  this central organ of our Organization will berendered even more effective if it is furtherstrengthened to make it respond positively to theemerging new realities which the new millennium isbound to confront.Members of the United Nations attach greatimportance to the need for reform of this supremebody. It is to be noted that under the existing provisionsof the Charter  which date back from a time when twothirds of the Members of the United Nations were stillunder colonial rule  a handful of States on the SecurityCouncil have the power to make decisions that bind thewhole membership. Such a mode of operation iscompletely out of tune with today's realities  and  forthis institution to retain its credibility  it shouldundergo a comprehensive reform  taking intoconsideration proper and equitable geographicalrepresentation.In this regard  Mauritius supports the position ofthe Non-Aligned Movement and the Organization ofAfrican Unity (OAU) on the expansion andrepresentativity of the Security Council  and we lookforward to an early conclusion of the work of theOpen-ended Working Group on the Question ofEquitable Representation on and Increase in theMembership of the Security Council.We support an increase in the membership of theSecurity Council  and we are in favour of making theCouncil an effective representative body that can act inthe interests of humankind at large at all times.The meeting of the Security Council at the levelof heads of State during the Millennium Summit wasan unparalleled opportunity for the 15 Members todiscuss  at the highest level  how to make peacekeepingoperations more responsive. We are all aware thatdeployment of United Nations troops in conflictsituations is seen as the last chance for the restorationof peace and  in this venture  we simply cannot affordto fail. Therefore  the discussions that took place at thesummit level of the Security Council need to beseriously pursued so that the future orientation ofpeacekeeping operations may be effected on a sounderbasis.In this respect  we welcome the proposals forimproving the United Nation peacekeepingperformance  as contained in the report of the Panel onUnited Nations Peace Operations — the BrahimiReport — and we look forward to their speedyimplementation.It is indeed a sad reflection that at the dawn of anew century  several African nations  such as Angola the Democratic Republic of the Congo  Sierra Leone Burundi  Somalia and the Comoros remain trapped incivil conflicts with disastrous consequences formillions of people on the continent and in the14subregion. At the regional level  the OAU  as well asleaders of the subregions concerned  have spared noefforts to address each of these conflicts  but we needto realize that no great success has been achieved sofar. The intransigence of the main protagonistsinvolved continues to remain the stumbling blocktowards the peaceful resolution of conflicts in Africa.The involvement of the United Nations in theseconflicts has unfortunately also met with little success.We need to be imaginative  and we need to explore with the civil society in each country in conflict  waysand means to convincingly establish that the fruits ofpeace are achievable. We need to look at thepermanence of our interests  and these are based inpeace and stability.We also note with great concern that  despite allthe efforts and steps taken by the OAU for a speedyreturn to constitutional order in the Comoros  theAnjouanese separatists and the military leadership inMoroni have signed the Fomboni Declaration indefiance of the OAU and the international community.We urge the international community to refrain fromlending any support to the Fomboni Joint Declarationwhich  we believe  will undermine the unity andterritorial integrity of the Comoros. Indeed  it isunacceptable that the future of the archipelago of theComoros be compromised by two individuals who arenon-elected and do not represent the aspirations of thepopulation. We reiterate our support to the OAU in itsongoing efforts aimed at resolving the crisis  inaccordance with the provisions of the Antananarivoaccord  which remains the most viable framework for alasting  consensual and durable solution to the crisis.We call on the military regime and the separatists inAnjouan to cooperate with the OAU so as to achieve anearly resolution of the crisis.We welcome the signing of the Agreement onCessation of Hostilities between Ethiopia and Eritreathis year. This is a positive step  and we urge the OAU the United Nations and other States to continue supportfor these two countries to take the next steps toconclude a settlement for lasting peace. Our regiondeserves no less.While  inevitably  the international community through the United Nations and regional andsubregional organizations  must continue to do all itcan to end the existing conflicts and prevent new ones there is an important aspect of civil conflict that cannotbe overlooked any longer. It has been establishedbeyond doubt that civil conflicts such as those inAngola and Sierra Leone have resulted from personalambition or greed for private enrichment on the part ofpowerful individuals  rather than in pursuit of alegitimate cause and struggle for the common good. Inpursuit of their sinister designs  these individuals wagelong wars on and against their own people and  actingwith impunity  inflict untold suffering on the masses including women  the elderly and children  causerefugee problems within and outside their nationalfrontiers  and retard development and progress of theircountries We believe that such dangerous personsshould not only be condemned and stopped as early aspossible from pursuing their unpatriotic designs  butalso should be made to answer to their people and tothe international community for the crimes theycommit.The proposed International Criminal Court shouldserve as the tribunal of the international community totry and punish such individuals and  the sooner it startsfunctioning  the better it will be for humanity at large.The International Criminal Court will not only be adeterrent for people who engage in heinous crimes butwill also be an important instrument for themaintenance of international peace and security. Unlesssuch a step is taken  the world will continue to facesimilar tragedies  and the perpetrators of such tragedieswill go unpunished.At long last  we have seen a glimmer of hope forthe suffering people of Somalia. We congratulate theleaders of the Intergovernmental Authority forDevelopment (IGAD) for their initiative in puttingtogether a peace and reconciliation process that willallow for the establishment of a representativegovernment to take charge of the affairs of the country.We appeal to all factions in Somalia to come togetherand to take part in this new initiative  with a view tostopping the misery that the Somali people haveendured for too long.Important steps have been made this year towardspeace in the Middle East. We congratulate PresidentArafat and Prime Minister Barak for the courage theydemonstrated recently during the difficult negotiationsin Camp David under the guidance of PresidentClinton. We believe that  having reached such a crucialstage of the negotiations  President Arafat and PrimeMinister Barak must meet the daunting challenge oftaking further steps forward to reach a final agreement.15We are confident that both leaders have the capacity tobridge the gaps and reach a mutually acceptable andsatisfactory agreement. We appreciate that the issuesoutstanding in the path of such an agreement aredelicate  but we are confident that the leaders of theregion will respond to the ardent wish of peoplesaround the world for a peaceful Middle East.It may sound like an anachronism  but it hashappened just a few months ago in the Pacificregion — namely in Fiji and in the Solomon Islands —that small bands of thugs have overturneddemocratically elected Governments. In the case ofFiji  Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry together withhis whole Cabinet of Ministers  was held hostage for aslong as 56 days  in a struggle for political power. ThePrime Minister was set free only after he finallyconceded that his Government would resign.The international community watched helplesslyas the tragic situation unfolded in Fiji. The fact thatthis is not the first time that a democratically electedGovernment is overthrown by unorthodox and violentmeans makes the situation all the more serious andcalls for the immediate attention of the internationalcommunity. Mauritius condemns unreservedly allattempts by any group  anywhere  to thwart the will ofthe people by force. I am reminded here of thestatement of the United Nations Secretary-General atthe opening of the OAU Summit in Lomé this yearwhen  applauding the OAU decision to excludeGovernments that have come to power byunconstitutional means from participating in OAUmeetings  he expressed the wish that some day theUnited Nations also would take a similar decision. Thetime has come for us to seriously consider suchavenues in order to send a clear signal to people whoare bent upon perpetrating constitutional violations intotal disregard of the will of the people.Mauritius remains fully committed to the respectand promotion of human rights  democracy  goodgovernance and the rule of law. These principles areenshrined in our Constitution. With regard to humanrights  our commitment goes far beyond our nationalborders  as reflected in our membership in variousUnited Nations committees  where we play an activerole. Multi-party  free and fair elections constitute coretraditions jealously cherished by the people ofMauritius. In the exercise of our valued democraticrights  on 11 September last  just 10 days ago. thepeople of Mauritius  for the seventh time since ourindependence in 1968  elected a new Government. ThisGovernment remains committed to supporting strongly at the national  regional and international levels  theprinciples I have mentioned earlier.Since we met in September last  we havewitnessed several acts of terrorism in various parts ofthe world endangering the lives of numerous innocentpeople. The hijacking of an Indian Airlines jet  thekidnapping of unsuspecting tourists from a Malaysianholiday resort and bomb attacks in some capitals aregrim reminders of the dangers we face at the hands ofunscrupulous and heartless fanatics. We condemn allacts of terrorism and call on the internationalcommunity to take concerted action to deal with thisproblem. For our part  Mauritius stands prepared toplay a significant role in the United Nations and itsvarious organs to combat all such acts which pose athreat to international peace and security.I had some remarks on people-centreddevelopment  debt and globalization. I refer delegatesto the text that will be circulated. I will now talk aboutregional cooperation.Mauritius attaches great priority to globalpartnership in addressing the key issues of povertyalleviation  achieving sustainable growth anddevelopment  and peace and security. We believe thatregional cooperation continues to be the inevitableroute towards strengthening international partnershipand cooperation. Regional cooperation not only isdesirable  but constitutes a necessary dimension in theprocess of the regional integration of many economiesinto the global economy.Small island developing States  which constituteone fifth of the membership of the United Nations  arein a particularly difficult situation due to theirvulnerability to a wide range of ecological  climaticand economic factors. The specificities of these Stateshave been articulated in the Barbados Programme ofAction for the Sustainable Development of SmallIsland Developing States. Constraints to theirsustainable development include a narrow resourcebase that does not allow them to benefit fromeconomies of scale  and the fact that they have smalldomestic markets. They also rely heavily on externalmarkets  which are usually geographically distant  andcosts for transportation  energy and infrastructure arehigh. In addition  small island States have littleresilience to natural disasters. A vulnerability index of16socio-economic and other parameters has beenprescribed for these States in the Barbados Programmeof Action. We urge the United Nations and otherinternational organizations to coordinate their efforts indeveloping and refining such an index  which shouldbe used  together with other factors  by the WorldTrade Organization and the Bretton Woods institutionsto accord special and preferential treatment to thiscategory of State.I wish to say a few words now about the Chagosarchipelago and the island of Tromelin. Respect forsovereignty and territorial integrity is  under the UnitedNations system  an acquired and inalienable right ofevery State  however big or small. We are consciousthat the United Nations favours the completion of theprocess of decolonization.For a number of years now  we have continuouslybrought before the General Assembly the question ofthe Chagos archipelago  which has always formed partof the State of Mauritius. This Assembly will recallthat the Chagos archipelago  including the island ofDiego Garcia  was detached by the colonial Power justbefore our independence  in violation of GeneralAssembly resolutions 1514 (XV) of December 1960 —the Declaration on the Granting of Independence toColonial Countries and Peoples — and 2066 (XX) of16 December 1965  which prohibits thedismemberment of colonial territories prior to theaccession to independence. We have all along sought toresolve this issue bilaterally with the United Kingdomthrough dialogue  but there has been no tangibleprogress so far. This issue has now reached a criticalstage and we are extremely anxious to have meaningfulnegotiations with the United Kingdom with a view toresolving this matter within the shortest possible time.We also reiterate our demand that  pending a resolutionof this issue  the former residents of the Chagosarchipelago and their families  who were forciblyevicted and sent to Mauritius by the colonial Power  beallowed to return to their homeland.We launch a fresh appeal to the former colonialPower  the United Kingdom  to come forward andengage in serious and purposeful discussions with ustowards the early settlement of the Chagos archipelagoquestion. We wish to stress that Mauritius will neverabandon its intention to reunite its territory and toassert its sovereignty over the Chagos archipelago.We also urge France  with which we have beendiscussing the issue of the return to us of the island ofTromelin  another outer island territory of Mauritius  towork with us constructively for an early resolution ofthis important issue. There is an agreement in principlefor the co-determination of the island and itssurrounding maritime space and we need to work outfurther modalities so as to arrive at a final solution onthis issue.(spoke in French)I was gratified by the meeting  on 6 September2000  of heads of State and Government of French-speaking States Members of the United Nations. Thatmeeting allowed us to consider and arrive at the truththat the United Nations is the keystone that will allowmankind to free itself from the chains and otherprejudices that hinder the evolution of internationalaffairs and globalization  the two main engines of abetter future for all. This meeting offered French-speaking States Members of the United Nations theopportunity firmly to assert their determination toachieve that objective.I wish to stress that the future to which we aspireand in which we place our hopes must develop inconditions of respect for and promotion of the pluralityof our peoples  their cultural and ethnic diversity andtheir multilingualism. We are duty-bound to respect maintain and preserve the nature of our world  thatrainbow of many cultures which  through globalizationand the United Nations  will be a source of enormouswealth for States and individuals.The Republic of Mauritius daily lives out thisvision of the future. Our experience prompts us tosubscribe to that vision for the common good. Hopesand dreams are built on concrete action. With theassistance of all its Member States  the United Nationsmust enjoy better and greater means. Only thus willpeace become a tangible reality. Without peace andsecurity  any effort at development is doomed to failureand the happiness to which the peoples of the worldaspire will remain dead letter.(spoke in English)It goes without saying that  to achieve theobjectives of a more peaceful  just and prosperousworld  nations need to rededicate themselves to newcommitments in the twenty-first century. Ourdelegation is ready to assume this responsibility and17looks forward to a fruitful outcome for the session thatlies ahead under Mr. Holkeri's leadership.I wish to end on a note of optimism with regardto the capacity of the United Nations to address globalissues and to spearhead development and progress. Mydelegation is confident that our Organization and itsspecialized agencies are poised to play an even greaterrole in global reconstruction. We live in a highlydemanding world. It wants results  seeks accountabilityand is not ready to condone failures. We all have aresponsibility to make the world a safer place and toensure a better future for our people. We can do it. Letus do it.Before I conclude  however  I wish to take thisopportunity to confirm the candidature of Mauritius forelection to one of the non-permanent seats in theSecurity Council in the elections that are scheduled totake place next month. As far back as January 2000 Mauritius announced to all countries of the EastAfrican region that we would seek election to a non-permanent seat on the Security Council. At that time Mauritius was the only declared candidate. TheGovernment of Mauritius considers itself fullyqualified to serve on the Security Council  which is thesupreme organ of the United Nations  in the largerinterests of peace and security and to contribute in asubstantial measure to the important work of ourOrganization.As a multi-party democracy in a multi-ethnicsociety  Mauritius has a track record in internationalrelations and we consider that the standing of theSecurity Council depends upon that of its constituentmembers. The Security Council will be called upon totake important decisions in the interests of peace andsecurity and it is important that the Security Councilact as a homogeneous body. It is the wish of mycountry that our candidature be considered on itsmerits. We will very much appreciate the GeneralAssembly's support in this regard."
"117",4945,"MWI",55,2000,"At the outset  allow me tojoin other speakers in congratulating Mr. Harri Holkerion his election to preside over the MillenniumAssembly. I am confident that under his ablestewardship we the peoples  and particularly those ofus from the developing countries  can look forwardwith optimism to a highly proactive session of theGeneral Assembly. His election to the presidency is aclear reflection of the confidence which theinternational community has in his great country Finland. He can count on the continued support andcooperation of the Malawi delegation in thismomentous task.Let me also pay tribute to his predecessor Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  Minister for Foreign Affairs ofthe Republic of Namibia  for his highly successfulpresidency of the fifty-fourth session.Less than a fortnight ago  our leaders gathered atthis very venue to map out the way forward in thismillennium. The enthusiasm with which thedeliberations were conducted culminated in a highlyinspiring outcome document  which gives a clearoutline of what needs to be done.Malawi welcomes the outcome of the MillenniumSummit. At the same time  we recognize that thestrategic partnership required for the implementation ofthe outcome document calls for the politicalcommitment of the international community. It istherefore our hope that the enthusiasm with which theworld leaders approached the Millennium Summit willtranslate into genuine political will in theimplementation of the measures that were adopted.Let us all build on the consensus that emergedfrom the Millennium Summit. Recognition by worldleaders of the urgent need to address issues bedevillinghumanity today is the first step towards building aprosperous and better tomorrow.A multiplicity of factors are constraining theefforts of the developing countries towards achievingeconomic development. There is therefore a need for amultidimensional approach in order to address theplight of these countries. Such efforts must  ofnecessity  be pursued at both the national andinternational levels.Not long ago  Malawi joined other members ofthe international community in welcoming the processof globalization. We joined the chorus inacknowledging the inevitability of the march towards aglobal village. In our enthusiasm  we looked forward tomeeting the challenges and taking advantage of theopportunities that globalization was envisaged to offer.Today  the experience has proved daunting. A numberof constraints dog our march towards the globalvillage.Along with other sub-Saharan African countries Malawi has yet to meaningfully enjoy the benefits ofmodern information technology. We all know that theprocess of globalization is centred on the swift andaccurate flow of information. The interconnectednesswhich information technology brings about offers thebenefits of choice. Those who possess thetechnological capacity are  hence  ahead of the rest inthe march towards the global village.Malawi therefore calls upon the donor communityto level the playing field by assisting those who lackthe capacity to meaningfully take advantage of amodern global information network. There is need toclose the existing digital divide.International trade is critical if the economies ofmost developing countries are to thrive. Malawi'sexport-oriented economy is  in this regard  noexception. With no mineral wealth of significance  oureconomy depends almost solely on the export ofprimary agricultural products and the importation ofmanufactured goods. The steadily deteriorating barterterms of trade for the primary products has long been asource of concern to us. As if this were not dauntingenough  the situation is compounded by the impositionof protectionist measures by countries that offermarkets for our exports. A range of non-tariff barriersis being subtly put in place  rendering it difficult forour products to reach those markets. Theseprotectionist measures run counter to the spirit of freetrade which we all profess and which we all believe tobe necessary for the growing interdependence among21countries. As long as barriers to free trade amongcountries are erected  global integration will face aserious setback.Malawi therefore calls upon the developmentpartners to open up their markets to products from thedeveloping countries. Increased market access is oneway in which a country like Malawi could beempowered to meaningfully participate in theglobalization process.Time and again  we in the developing countrieshave expressed serious concern over the existingproblem of external debt. Debt servicing has compelledour Governments to divert meagre resources fromdevelopment programmes. As a result  basic socialservices and investment in other infrastructureprogrammes suffer.We welcome initiatives adopted by thedevelopment partners to address the problem of debt.The Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) DebtInitiative is  among other measures  notable. We alllooked forward with hope to the recent G-8 Summitheld in Okinawa  Japan. However  the lack ofcommitment to deal with the problem of debtdecisively means that the burden still remains virtuallyintact.Malawi therefore believes that the only way inwhich the problem of external debt can meaningfullybe addressed is through outright cancellation. We inviteour development partners to exercise the political willfor debt cancellation. We need to free resources forinvestment in basic infrastructural services.Official development assistance and foreigndirect investment are necessary if developingeconomies like Malawi's are to develop. It is largely inrecognition of this reality that the United Nations setthe target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national productof developed countries for official developmentassistance. The general decline in official developmentassistance flows to the developing countries thereforeruns counter to the internationally recognized target.We therefore pay tribute to those development partnerswho have either met or exceeded the 0.7 per centtarget. At the same time  we call upon those fallingshort of it to live up to the expectations of theinternational community.Malawi welcomes the trend towards a rise inforeign direct investment over the past few years.However  we observe that  in spite of the steady rise the distribution itself has been uneven  with sub-Saharan Africa making no meaningful gains. We hopethat efforts will be made to address the disparity.Just over 10 years ago  the Berlin Wall cametumbling down in a highly symbolic move marking thedemise of the cold war. All peace-loving people in theworld who wanted humankind to live in dignitywelcomed that momentous development. The conceptof “peace dividend” gained currency as theinternational community welcomed the opportunity toturn swords into plowshares.Today's reality has not borne out ourexpectations. Trouble spots  both long-standing andemerging ones  dot the globe. During the cold war  weblamed conflicts on super-Power rivalry. Yet conflictstoday have assumed different dimensions  and theycontinue to divert meagre national resources away fromdevelopment programmes.The protracted civil war in Angola  civil strife inSierra Leone  the Great Lakes region of Africa  theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  Kosovo andCentral Asia  among other areas  perhaps reveal causalfactors that we glossed over during the cold war. Greedamong politicians and the ruthless pursuit of profit bymultinational corporations have  in a number of cases coalesced to prolong conflict. We have all noted therole that a precious mineral like diamonds can play inunleashing human tragedy.Malawi welcomes the recent adoption by theUnited Nations Security Council of a resolution thataims at regulating the trade in diamonds  especiallythose acquired illegally. The international communitycan count on our unflinching cooperation in theimplementation of the resolution.We have also noted the untiring efforts of theUnited Nations in the maintenance of internationalpeace and security. However  the lessons of the UnitedNations peacekeeping mission in Sierra Leone  andindeed elsewhere  clearly point to the need for a seriousreview of the mandate of such missions. Theembarrassment that the peacemakers were subjected tois something that  we believe  must not be allowed tohappen again. In this regard  my delegation welcomesthe recommendations made in the Brahimi Report.We  at the same time  join the internationalcommunity in condemning the recent murder of three22United Nations relief workers in West Timor. We callon those responsible to desist from further interferingwith the safety and freedom of refugees andhumanitarian workers in the region.Malawi recognizes that the United Nations alonecannot provide miracle solutions to conflicts that ragein the various regions. It is largely incumbent upon theprimary players to exercise political maturity andrestrain their passions.We note that in most conflict areas  there existnegotiated frameworks for resolution of thedifferences. And yet  the sheer lack of politicalcommitment has led the parties to wantonly renege onagreements that they so painstakingly negotiated. Wetherefore call upon all warring parties to respectexisting peace agreements and pool their effortstowards nation-building.The Government of Malawi welcomes efforts bythe United Nations to rid the globe of weapons of massdestruction. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty(NPT) and the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty(CTBT) represent some of the notable efforts by theinternational community to bring about lasting globalpeace and security. Malawi would like to express itsreadiness to join the international community in theadoption of measures that seek to advance the cause ofinternational peace and security.We waste meagre resources to keep conflictgoing  while in the process sacrificing the welfare ofour people. His Excellency Dr. Bakili Muluzi President of the Republic of Malawi  time and againdecried this  saying that we  especially in sub-SaharanAfrica  are too poor to divert meagre resources tosustain conflict.The above factors present a front which impedeseconomic development in the developing countries especially the least developed among them. Investmentin basic infrastructure suffers as a result of  directly orotherwise  an interplay of these forces.As long as the international community holdsback the political will needed for decisive action  theplaying field will remain uneven. As such  thedeveloping countries will continue to be marginalizedin the march towards the global village.My delegation does not intend to heap all blameon international factors alone. At the national level  wein the developing countries have to take stock of ourdomestic policies. Malawi  for one  is doing its part inthis regard. The democratic governance which theruling United Democratic Front (UDF) ushered in thecountry in June 1994 is well on course. The people'sconfidence in the UDF-led government was manifestedwhen they re-elected it in the June 1999 generalelections. In the seven years of its existence  theGovernment has put in place institutional mechanismsaimed at promoting human rights and other freedomsthat form the core of good governance.Malawi's commitment to the consolidation ofdemocracy is now irreversible. In November this year the country will take yet another step forward with theconduct of local government elections. We fullyrecognize the contribution which good governancemakes to economic development in a country.In this regard  I would like to pay tribute to theUnited Nations and those development partners whohave contributed to our effort towards the promotion ofgood governance. As the process goes on  we shallcount on your continued assistance.We in Malawi further recognize the central rolethat a vibrant private sector plays in economicdevelopment. For long  the previous government inMalawi neglected the private sector  opting  instead  toboost parastatal enterprises.The new political dispensation has opened up thecountry to a competitive  free market economy.Inefficient parastatal organizations are falling intoprivate ownership through a privatization programme.Already  there are discernible benefits accruing  mostnotably marked improvements in the quality ofproducts and services on the domestic market.The existing political stability and the generalwarmth of the friendly people of Malawi create aninviting climate to the foreign investor. TheGovernment has  in addition  adopted measures whichare aimed at creating a conducive investmentenvironment. We  therefore  welcome entrepreneurs tocome and sample the market.At the core of Malawi's fight against poverty isthe Poverty Alleviation Programme (PAP) which theUDF-led Government launched upon its assumption ofoffice. Within the context of the programme  theGovernment later launched the Malawi Social ActionFund (MASAF)  a bottom-up framework that involvesthe villager in taking decisions on development23programmes. MASAF is making the difference in thelives of the citizenry. The face of infrastructure in thecountryside  where nearly 80 per cent of the country'spopulation resides  has been considerably transformed.We  therefore  thank the World Bank for thesupport it is extending to the Malawi Social ActionFund  which is currently in its second phase.Among other strategies  Malawi has adoptedmeasures aimed at empowering vulnerable groups insociety. A systematic programme aimed at empoweringwomen through micro-credit and improved access toeducation for girls are some of these. A few years ago the Government established the Ministry of State in thePresident's Office Responsible for Persons withDisabilities  whose impact is beginning to show.Our determined efforts to rid the country ofexcruciating poverty are impeded by the HIV/AIDSpandemic. In the last decade  the extent of devastationcaused by the pandemic in Malawi has beenfrightening. By targeting the productive age bracket ofthe population  HIV/AIDS has clearly begun to reversethe hard-won gains that the nation had made towardsthe close of the last decade.At the same time  we are aware of the advancesthat the West has to date made in the treatment ofHIV/AIDS. The prohibitive cost of the drugs precludesdeveloping countries like Malawi from gaining accessto them. And yet  these are the countries that are in thegreatest need of such therapy  in view of their highincidence of HIV/AIDS.My delegation appreciates the effort of the UnitedNations  through the Joint United Nations Programmeon HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS)  to deal with the pandemic.We welcome the fact that the Security Council gavecentre stage to HIV/AIDS issues early this year. Webelieve that the devastation left by the scourge deservesa high international profile. Malawi further calls onthose countries with the capacity to make the necessaryarrangements to render the drugs affordable for allthose who need them.It is clear that if the international community is toforge the strategic partnership needed for a smoothmarch towards the global village  we need to level theplaying field. This calls for political will on the part ofall of us. We need to fulfil our shared responsibilitiesfor the benefit of humankind.Malawi welcomes the recent admission of Tuvaluas the 189th Member State of the United Nations. Onbehalf of my Government and the people of Malawi  Iextend our support and best wishes to the Governmentand the people of Tuvalu.Time and again  Malawi has spoken in favour ofgranting the Republic of China on Taiwan the role thatit deserves in the international community. The hard-working and peace-loving people of Taiwan haveclearly demonstrated that they are ready to activelycontribute to the goals and ideals for which the UnitedNations stands.We therefore appeal to the Organization'smembership to look beyond narrow politicalconsiderations and face the geopolitical realities thatobtain on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. Thecontinued isolation of Taiwan does not bode well forthe spirit of globalization  which we all acknowledge has to be all-inclusive.Finally  allow me to reaffirm the commitment ofthe Government of the Republic of Malawi to live up tothe obligations enshrined in the Charter of the UnitedNations. This is the only universal body that is wellplaced to take us all into the millennium."
"118",4991,"MYS",55,2000,"I join otherspeakers in congratulating you  Sir  on your election asPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-fifthsession. I am confident that with your vast experienceand diplomatic skills you will be able to guide theproceedings of this Assembly to a successfulconclusion.I would also like to express my delegation'sgratitude to your predecessor  Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab for the effective manner in which he guided the workof the last session of the General Assembly.Let me also take this opportunity to commend theSecretary-General for his great dedication to theOrganization and the many contributions he has madein the service of the international community.There are great expectations on the part of theinternational community that in the new century theUnited Nations will be a more effective Organization.Indeed  its continued relevance  especially to thedeveloping countries  which comprise the majority ofthe membership of the United Nations  will  to a largedegree  depend on their perception that it is attuned totheir concerns and responsive to their needs. TheOrganization must continue to serve the interests of allits Members  big or small  strong or weak. It must bemore transparent and democratic in its decision-makingprocesses and work methods.In this context  the reform and restructuring of theOrganization continues to be a matter of greatimportance. Much has been done through the processof reform effected by the Secretary-General  but reformis a continuous and ongoing process and shouldcontinue to be vigorously pursued to ensure the UnitedNations increased effectiveness and efficiency especially in facing up to the challenges of the newcentury. As modernization of the Organization entailsadditional resources  the critical issue of financing theUnited Nations must also be seriously addressed andresolved as soon as possible.More intensified efforts should be made to bringto conclusion the deliberations on one of the mostimportant aspects of the reform process: therestructuring of the Security Council. Clearly  thenecessary compromises must be made if the ongoingdeliberations on the reform of the Council are to makeany progress at all. We look forward to your leadership Mr. President  in unblocking the current impasse sothat this important organ of the United Nations can befully revamped  modernized and made more effective.Malaysia continues to support expansion of the Councilin both categories of its membership. Any expansion inthe permanent category should include both theindustrialized and the developing countries. If there is7no agreement on expansion of the permanentmembership  the Council should be enlarged for thetime being in the non-permanent category.A central objective of reform of the SecurityCouncil should be to ensure its effectiveness in themaintenance of international peace and security.Equally important is the need to enhance the Council'sunity of purpose among its members  especially thepermanent members  so as to avoid the situation thatnecessitated the taking of international action outsidethe Council by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization(NATO)  as in the case of Kosovo  when the Councilwas unable to act. Notwithstanding the specialcircumstances of Kosovo  future internationalinterventions should be made only with the expressapproval of the Security Council  in the interest ofpreserving the role and authority of the Council asenshrined in the Charter  as well as of ensuring thelegality and legitimacy of all such actions.Another aspect of the work of the SecurityCouncil that should be thoroughly reviewed relates tothe imposition of sanctions on Member States  whichhave often brought untold suffering on the generalpopulace  particularly women and children. Sanctionregimes of the future should be established only whenabsolutely necessary and should be specificallytargeted  time-bound  subject to regular review andlifted when no longer necessary. The interests of allparties to the conflict should be addressed in order toachieve a just and lasting peace. We have seen toomany conflicts that seem to be resolved on paper butcontinue to remain outstanding on the ground.We should strive in the new century to make ourworld a safer place. We should strive to get rid ofweapons of mass destruction — particularly nuclearweapons  but also chemical and biological weapons.We must intensify global efforts to reduce existingstocks of these horrendous weapons  culminating intheir total elimination. The major Powers and othersthat possess and manufacture these weapons bear aspecial responsibility. We should all play our part inensuring that there is no let-up in the global effortstowards nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament.We should also limit the production anddeployment of ultra-sophisticated  high technologyconventional weapons  many of which are being usedin the wars of developing countries  resulting in theironic situation of third world countries fighting theirwars with first world weapons  thanks to the aggressivemarketing efforts of arms vendors of the developedcountries. The developing countries can ill afford thearms race that this will trigger  nor the huge defenceexpenditures to sustain the use of these weapons.We must ensure that genocide  “ethnic cleansing”and other crimes against humanity that wereperpetrated  for instance  in Rwanda  Bosnia andHerzegovina and Kosovo  are never allowed to becommitted again anywhere else in the world. Morestrenuous efforts should be made to apprehend indictedwar criminals so as to send a stern warning to others.They should not be allowed to get away with theirheinous crimes with impunity.Undoubtedly  the maintenance of internationalpeace and security can be better served through moreeffective use of preventive diplomacy. This has beenhighlighted by the Secretary-General in his MillenniumReport (A/54/2000) and should be seriouslyconsidered.The Organization will have to develop a moreeffective early-warning capability and deal withemerging conflict situations through more effective useof the mechanism of preventive diplomacy. A moreproactive approach in preventive diplomacy wouldrequire even closer coordination and collaborationbetween the Security Council and the Secretary-General  who would have to put his good offices role toeven greater use.However  that should not become an excuse toimpose anything on Member States or to interfere intheir internal affairs. There are growing tendencies forthe developed countries  in the name of civil society democracy and human rights  to set standards inaccordance with their own moulds for the developingcountries to follow. We even ignore the fact that manyof the problems confronting the developing countriesare the vestiges of the colonial past. We want to leaveyesterday behind and move to today and the future  butthe pace appropriate to the particular countryconcerned should be followed.United Nations peacekeeping operations shouldbe empowered with clear and well-defined mandates adequate resources and strong international support irrespective of where they take place. There should beno perception of selectivity in their launching. In thisregard  it is especially important that peacekeepingoperations in Africa — notably in Sierra Leone  the8Democratic Republic of the Congo and Ethiopia andEritrea — be strongly supported by the internationalcommunity. At the same time  for peace to be viable itis essential that peacekeeping missions incorporate thenecessary elements of disarmament  demobilizationand reintegration of ex-combatants  with the necessarysupport of the international community.My delegation commends the frank and forthrightreport (A/55/305) of the Brahimi Panel on UnitedNations Peace Operations. The Panel's boldrecommendations deserve the detailed and carefulconsideration of the membership of the Organization.Thereafter  we must demonstrate the urgency seriousness and political will to follow up on thoselaudable recommendations  lest the Panel's report meetthe fate of many United Nations reports in the past forlack of the necessary political will.On another conflict situation  it is a matter ofgreat concern to Malaysia that one of the longest-running conflicts of this century  the Arab-Israeliconflict  remains unresolved. Successive opportunitieswere not grasped due to the lack of seriousness on thepart of the Israeli Government to pursue the path ofpeace. We are disappointed that the Israeli Governmentfails to live up to the expectations of the internationalcommunity and lacks the boldness of vision  as well asthe will and courage  to grasp the once-in-a-lifetimewindow of opportunity to seal a lasting peace betweenIsrael and Palestine and Syria in the interest of regionalpeace and security.The aspirations of the Palestinian people for anindependent and sovereign homeland can no longer bedenied. We look forward to welcoming in the very nearfuture an independent State of Palestine among thecommunity of nations here at the United Nations  aswell as in other international organizations. Equally  welook forward to the return of Syrian Golan withoutfurther delay. Israel must bury the suspicion anddistrust of the past and look to the future in anenvironment that will create opportunities andchallenges in a peaceful and stable Middle East.Since the East Asian financial crisis there hasbeen increasing recognition of the nature of theproblem of  and the need for reform of  the existingglobal financial and economic systems  whichMalaysia has strongly advocated. It is my hope thatefforts in that direction will continue to be pursued bythe Bretton Woods institutions  even if the worst for theaffected Asian economies may now be over and thosecountries are now recovering. It is dismaying that somequarters are suggesting that  with the end of the crisis there is now no urgency or even necessity for reform.Given the universality of its membership  the UnitedNations is well placed to make an importantcontribution to promoting the reform process particularly in the context of its own increasingdialogue and interaction with those institutions. Itwould be the height of folly and irresponsibility to waitfor another round of speculative currency attacks to joltus into action.East Asia's traumatic experience is also a strongreminder of the negative effects of globalization ondeveloping countries. While globalization is inevitableand is becoming a permanent feature of the newinternational order and system  it is far from being apanacea. Indeed  the United Nations HumanDevelopment Report indicates that globalization hasled to the marginalization of many developingcountries  resulting in an increasing disparity ineconomic attainment between nations. This conclusionis not surprising  given the existing inequitableinternational economic order and the differing access totechnology.With all its potential benefits  globalization in itsunfettered form is likely to do more harm than good tothe small  vulnerable economies  at least in the shortand medium terms  unless measures are put in place toprotect them. It will bring about not free trade  but anunfair and inequitable exchange: the inflow of capital goods and services from the developed North in returnfor the outflow of hard-earned foreign exchange fromthe poor countries of the South. The notion of a levelplaying field  which is the central creed ofglobalization  would perpetuate the present inequitiesin favour of the strong  developed economies at theexpense of the vulnerable economies of the developingworld. It would only ensure the continued dominationof the weak by the strong.For globalization to be universally embracedwithout reservation there must be in place certainground rules to regulate the conduct of free trade ingoods and services to ensure an equitable exchangebetween unequal partners predicated on a win-winproposition. At the same time  the principle oftransparency should be applied across the board toinclude currency traders and market manipulators  whoare now somehow exempted from such a requirement 9as well as from payment of taxes. Until and unlessthese measures are instituted  globalization will be seenby the developing world as a largely predatoryideology of the rich nations for the exploitation andsubjugation of poor ones.That impression is further reinforced by theintolerance of dissenting of some of its promotersviews in their zeal to prescribe the one-size-fits-allapproach towards globalization. The developingcountries should be allowed to pursue globalization attheir own pace so as to enable them to develop socialand institutional structures to fully benefit from theprocess while minimizing its negative impact. Formany countries  the price to be paid for globalization aspresently interpreted  particularly the loss ofindependence  would be simply too great for them tobear. This is not the time for us to re-examine theconcept of the nation State and the sovereignty ofnations in order to accommodate the needs of the giantmultinational companies that operate across borders.In the meantime  in order to brace themselves forthe full impact of globalization  developing countriesmust forge enhanced cooperation among themselves ina true spirit of South-South cooperation and on thebasis of mutually beneficial “smart partnerships” withthe involvement of the private sector. This wouldfacilitate a useful exchange of ideas and experienceamong them on the globalization process. Malaysia ispleased to share those ideas and experiences with itspartners from the developing countries  and has doneso in the past several years in the context of theLangkawi international dialogue. We are pleased to seethat those dialogues have been emulated by Africathrough the South African international dialogue.Indeed  in an increasingly complex future world it isonly appropriate for the developing countries todevelop such synergies through strategic linkagesamong themselves as well as with the developedcountries.To assist in the process of globalization  it isincumbent upon the international community to ensurethat the developing countries  particularly the leastdeveloped among them  continue to receivedevelopment assistance to enable them to make theleap out of chronic poverty. Indeed  given the intrinsiclink between peace  security and development  theOrganization must continue to be in the vanguard ofglobal developmental efforts  upon which so much ofthe world depends. It is imperative for the UnitedNations to carry out its developmental mission witheven greater vigour at a time of increasingly scarceresources and exploding populations. This is where thecontinued role of the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme (UNDP) can be especially critical  withadditional resources and more effective programmes particularly for vulnerable small island and landlockedStates and States in Africa  where in a number of caseseconomic performance has fallen back rather thanprogressed since independence.Notable gains have been made in several Africancountries. However  Africa's ability to rise out ofchronic poverty can be attained only with continuedinternational assistance  including forgiveness of itscountries' external debt  without which many of themwill remain trapped in the vicious circle of poverty violence and natural or man-made disasters. In thisregard  Malaysia reiterates its strong support for  andlooks forward to  the convening of an internationalconference on financing for development in the year2001 involving all major stakeholders  including theprivate sector. The convening of such a forum isimperative  as there can be no development without thenecessary financing to support it.Along with the Millennium Summit  this sessionof the General Assembly will be remembered for among other things  paving the way for the kind ofUnited Nations that will eventually emerge to serve theinternational community  at least in the early decadesof the twenty-first century. While the shifting patternsof relationships among nations have yet to find a finalform and the future is far from clear  there is nodenying that in the increasingly complex andinterconnected world of tomorrow  the United Nationsis likely to play an increasingly critical role. To thatend the Organization must continuously place itself atthe forefront in the search for solutions to globalproblems."
"119",5018,"NAM",55,2000,"This is neither the placenor the time for me to repeat what my head of Stateand I have said in speeches regarding most of thecritical national  regional and international issues. Onthose issues Namibia's position is unchanged  and myviews remain valid. There are  however  some specificmatters that I feel require reiteration. That is what I amgoing to do today.Not too long ago in these corridors  anunprecedented 150 heads of State and Governmentparticipated in the historic Millennium Summit  whichwas appropriately dubbed “We the peoples: the role ofthe United Nations in the twenty-first century”. TheMillennium Declaration  which was the result of thatconcerted effort to meet the daunting challenges of thiscentury with boldness and courage and in a truly globalunited front  is destined take its place alongside the7Charter of the United Nations as one of the mostseminal documents of all time. In responding to thepeoples' fervent clarion call to redefine and vigorouslysupport the United Nations mandates and programmes and to meet the challenges of HIV/AIDS  malaria andother diseases that threaten to decimate our populationswhile leaving millions of others too weak to derivevalue from life  the world leaders undertook before thewhole world to save humanity from the scourge of war fear and want.The citizens of the world paid witness to thesober promises of the Millennium Summit. They waitin earnest for Member States to make good on thepledges made in the Millennium Declaration. They  thepeoples  as our ultimate constituencies  are indeed theones we must serve. However  they are scepticalbecause of failures to make good on previous pledges.Yet they expect us to implement the undertakings wemade at the Summit  committing whatever resources ofmaterial or of the heart are called for. For our part therefore  we must find the collective political will tomobilize the necessary resources to implement thecommitments. We must also reconnect with the passionthat drove the leaders of the world  determined to sparehumanity the devastation of war and deprivation  tofound the United Nations.In responding to this clarion call  Member Statesmust forge a new global partnership between thewealthy and powerful nations and those whose presentcircumstances leave them mired in the seeminglyintractable maze of a merry-go-round type ofdevelopment. The North must be gracious andgenerous  and give enough of what has been acquiredfrom global resources to assist poor and weak countriesto help propel them into the orbit of sustainable andirreversible social and economic growth.For its part  the South must not only take soberstock of our present challenges  but also devote energyand creativity to genuinely engage all our countries in acommon effort at social development and humansecurity. To do so  we must rise above the temptation tosettle scores through armed conflict; place the will andgenius of our peoples at the helm of nationalreconstruction; and give prominence to the credowritten in stone on the wall which adorns the courtyardadjacent to the General Assembly  to turn our swordsinto ploughshares. It is the marriage of this dualcommitment of the wealthy and strong  and thepresently poor and weak nations  which carries in itswomb the child of a new world  aglow in global peace development and prosperity.Alongside the Millennium Summit were othermajor activities of great importance at the UnitedNations and elsewhere in New York. The SecurityCouncil conducted its own high-level consultations culminating in a categorical commitment  especially toAfrica  towards development  peace and security on thecontinent. The conference of presiding officers of theworld's parliaments resolved to work closely with theUnited Nations in pursuit of people-centred goals. TheWorld Peace Summit  which brought together religiousleaders from practically all faiths  in its declaration ona commitment to global peace  in addition torecognizing gender equality  declared all religions to beequal and condemned any violence perpetrated in thename of religion. The non-governmental organizations which in their summit earlier in May had called for aglobal solidarity in which corporations woulddemonstrate a greater sense of social responsibility especially in the pursuit of the benefits ofglobalization  reaffirmed their advocacy for socialchange in their Department of Public Information/Non-Governmental Organization Forum in August.Together  participants in all these gatherings sought tohelp redefine the pivotal role of the United Nations andall other world organizations in the new millennium inuplifting the peoples of the world.The active role of grass-roots organizations  bothin their own conference and in their interaction with allthe other conferences  is a clear sign that “We thePeoples” are actually now firmly reclaiming ourlegitimate right to be heard wherever States arediscussing a new beginning in human relations and thefuture of the United Nations — our common House.Bearing this in mind  the world's leaders made aspecial commitment to Africa to implement specialmeasures to address the challenges of povertyeradication and sustainable development through suchactions as debt cancellation  increased investment andgreater access to markets and technology. All humanfootprints start with the first lonely step.We had witnessed a robust and generous spirit ofteamwork on the part of Member States in preparingfor the General Assembly's Millennium Summit andgalvanizing a partnership for a successful outcome. Inthe fullness of time  it all came together  and we got itright  to the satisfaction of all. It was collaboration8rather than competition. Thorns and all  what abeautiful rose it turned out to be.In Africa  we say that no one man can put hishands around a baobab tree. It requires many handsjoined together to form a circle around that proverbialtree. I thank all my collaborators. We are all winners and the integrity of the United Nations does not justremain intact  but is enhanced. I remember  though what my President and Co-Chairperson of theMillennium Summit  Mr. Sam Nujoma  stressed in hisclosing statement:“[W]e have adopted a historic Declaration with avision for the future ... The Declaration in itselfwill not put bread on [the] tables [of the peoplesof the world]  stop the wars  erase poverty ... Wecannot  therefore  afford to go back home fromhere and continue business as usual.” (A/55/PV.8)That is the question and  indeed  the challenge for theUnited Nations and the global community. Hiscounterpart  the President of Finland  Ms. TarjaHalonen  echoed those sentiments in her own closingspeech.Sir  against the backdrop of those profoundcircumstances and events relating to the MillenniumSummit  we welcome a fortunate coincidence whichhas set the stage for your unanimous election asPresident of the fifty-fifth session of the GeneralAssembly  together with the eminent members of yourBureau. I congratulate you all warmly and assure youof Namibia's steadfast cooperation.In my acceptance speech of 14 September 1999  Icomplained about a creeping but steady derogation ofthe General Assembly's functions and powers  contraryto the letter and spirit of the relevant provisions of theCharter of the United Nations. This situation has hardlychanged for the better during the past year. If anything the encroachment has intensified. I have thereforedecided to speak up  so that we no longer take thingsfor granted in the ensuing months.I found the Office of the President of the GeneralAssembly to be the main target of this unacceptabledenigration. In the animal kingdom  the predator goesfor the head or the jugular to incapacitate its prey.Well  that seems to be the case here as well. For sometime now — prior to my tenure of office — we hadbeen discussing practical ways and means ofstrengthening the Office of the President to ensure itscapacity and effectiveness.In light of this  I would suggest – subject  ofcourse  to the President's disposition – an earlyplanning meeting involving the President  theChairman of the Fifth Committee and the Chairman ofthe Advisory Committee on Administrative andBudgetary Questions to review this situation and to actupon what has already been agreed  including adequateresources for the Office of the President. No Presidentof the General Assembly should be subjected to thewhims of faceless bureaucrats as if he or she wereasking for personal favours.In this context  two key paragraphs in theMillennium Declaration are apropos. First  paragraph30 underscores the commitment to“reaffirm the central position of the GeneralAssembly as the chief deliberative  policy-making and representative organ of the UnitedNations  and to enable it to play that roleeffectively”. (resolution 55/2  para. 30)This is a clear and categorical reaffirmation of thecentrality of the Assembly  notwithstanding theexisting and desirable division of labour orcomplementary functions among the principal organs.Secondly  in paragraph 31  the heads of State andGovernment collectively state:“We request the General Assembly toreview on a regular basis the progress made inimplementing the provisions of this Declaration and ask the Secretary-General to issue periodicreports for consideration by the GeneralAssembly and as a basis for further action.”(ibid.  para. 31)I would make another suggestion. Under thePresident's authority  the Bureau should act as anexecutive arm of the Office of the President superintending the work of the Assembly andinteracting vertically with the heads of the other UnitedNations bodies. We always have a solid team in theBureau consisting of the President  21 Vice-Presidentsand the Chairpersons of the six Main Committees forthis crucial task. I was privileged to have a team ofable ambassadors and  at times  even higherpersonalities assisting me  to all of whom I remaingrateful. The Bureau should be formalized as apolitical mechanism. What we should be striving for is9a formalized system of regular consultations and bettercoordination of mandates and action in which the righthand knows what the left hand is doing at all times.While I will leave these hallowed halls soon andreturn to my duties as Namibia's Minister of ForeignAffairs  Information and Broadcasting  my heart andsoul will always be walking the routines of the GeneralAssembly. Namibia's celebrated case for self-determination  freedom and achievement ofindependence and the greater part of my own personalstory — perhaps a bit unlike that of any of mypredecessors as Assembly Presidents — are written onthese majestic walls. Indeed  it is actually here andnowhere else that one can appreciate the roots and thesystemic evolution of the United Nations itself.Now I want to express some views of my ownabout the latest buzzword: globalization. In theprocess  I will also respond to what some say – that thepeoples of the third world should not run away in frightfrom globalization. Frankly speaking  globalization ismerely a new name for an old  cruel and unjust systemwhich was imposed willy-nilly upon the peoples of thethird world in the past. Globalization is at least 500years old in the case of Africa. As someone bluntly putit  “globalization is the reformation of what we used tocall capitalist imperialism”. That is what he said; Ithink he has a point.That globalization forcibly introduced theiniquities of the slave trade  colonial oppression  thedispossession of land  racial bigotry and the destructionof our precious lives and cultures is a matter ofhistorical record. We cannot be blamed for harbouringpainful memories of the marauding usurpers fromEurope peddling the virtues of a civilizing mission.Those uninvited intruders anchored their merchantships along the coast and put up their foreign flags.Next  millions of people ended up dead  others wereshipped off to the diaspora  while the rest becamevictims of a brutal system of colonialism. That  too  isa matter of record.The more the benefits of globalization areadvertised  the more all of it sounds hypocritical andself-serving. Nobody is suggesting that we must runaway from globalization. At the same time  we willkeep reminding ourselves of the lessons of history lestwe forget the ultimate truth that the lion will not liedown with the lamb. Mind you  industrialization wasnot bloodless or painless either.If perchance globalization is to have genuineefficacy  then we in the third world  who constitute byfar the majority of the globe  must infuse it with ourown vision  our wisdom  our sense of equity and fairplay  the essence of the hard lessons we have learnedfrom our history and experience. In such aneventuality  we will have to redesign the basicparadigm of globalization.On the one hand  it is said that many AfricanStates are at risk of missing out on the opportunitiesoffered by globalization; on the other hand  Africansare repeatedly being told to find answers themselves toAfrican problems. Well  which is it? This was neveractually said about any other continent or peoples attheir worst hour of imminent disaster. I must confessthat I do not know how Europe survived the blackplague  which decimated its population  killing manyhundreds of thousands. But I know  at least  somethingabout contemporary European history of the past 50years. I think of the devastation and misery in thatcontinent after the Second World War. Concertedpolitical will  massive resources and a gigantic plan ofaction were put in place to save Europe. It was thefamous Marshall Plan that we Africans were forced toread about in schools that did it. Europe was pulledback from a precipice because of that comprehensiveand coordinated action of solidarity and today isbuilding a strong Union together. It is clear that therewas no idea of abandoning Europe to its own fate. Butit was not only that.There is another instructive example  that of theremarkable Alliance for Progress. That laudableinitiative helped Latin America to emerge from aneconomic and social morass and restored in the peoplean empowering confidence for the future. Today  wesee the great Southern Cone Common Market(MERCOSUR) and other important regional economicand trade groupings fostering economic growth  fullemployment and the generation of wealth for thebenefit all in that vital part of the world. For me  thatrepresents the true meaning of human brotherhood and“prosper thy neighbour”. Africa's key Westerncooperating partners should not hold the view thatthose two examples are unique circumstances from theremote past or that they are far removed from thehardships and misery that Africa and its peoples arefacing today.Only when pledges made by world leaders aretranslated into concrete programmes and substantial10resources are made available to achieve the time-boundtargets set by the Millennium Summit can we in Africatake comfort in and draw strength from the recentinspiring commitments. Alhough nobility of mind is anecessary prelude to magnanimity  performance is theonly vindication of its efficacy. This is because humanbeings are not known for mental quantum leaps disregarding embedded social consciousness. Humanstend to hold on to painful memories and to keepreminding their tormentors of their obligation. Hence the persistent demands in Africa  in Europe  in Asiaand in other places for atonement  reparations andcompensation and insistence on the return of all stolencultural artworks  precious relics and sacred icons fromabroad to their place of origin — lock  stock and barrel.Africans  who were wronged more than  or atleast as much as  any other group of people  arelegitimately entitled to justice on political  legal  andhumanitarian grounds. Now is the time to settle thatunfinished business and moral deficit.My good friend said the other day that the bestform of diplomacy is to tell the truth. I have sometruthful things I want to direct to my own camp — thethird world. My remarks will be of a general nature andwill likely annoy some of my friends. But in Africa candour  no matter how distressing it can sometimesbe  is not only a form of democracy  but also alanguage for protecting and strengthening the family.So I am sure that they  too  will understand  because allof it comes from my heart.I believe we urgently need to review our prioritiesand map out a new strategy in order to effectively  andin unity  deal with the battles ahead. Once again  wemust stand up for our legitimate and just rights. Mybrother Foreign Minister from a small Caribbean Statehas pointed out that “there are new forms of warcurrently being waged on the small  the weak and thevulnerable” in the countries of the South. While this isa confirmation of the obvious  the situation is quiteserious.Ironically  in the South we are wagingunconscionable and destructive wars against oneanother  militarily invading and occupyingneighbouring States under the pretext of security oralleged historical reasons. In the process  we create  byomission or by commission  convenient troubledwaters for outsiders to fish in. Nations are burning  andpeoples are dying from bullets  hunger and infectiousdiseases at the same time. We are destroying ourselves.This must stop. We really have nobody to blame butourselves. Rationalizations and excuses made after afait accompli stink to high heaven. We must regroupand concentrate on development  poverty eradication regional cooperation and integration. We have agreedto promote a culture of peace  to practise tolerance andto enlarge opportunities for peaceful coexistence. TheHavana South Summit and its plan of action gave us animpetus to push ahead in unity and solidarity for ourcommon survival. The people are tired of war; theywant food security and life-saving human progress.They want creative leisure and the right to a coherentand planned future for their families and themselves devoid of fear and heart-rending traumas of violence.We have before us the current report of theWorking Group — the full title is undulycumbersome — which  for more than six years now has been dealing with the reform and increase in themembership of the Security Council. When the reportis debated  Namibia will give its specific views on itscontent. Suffice it for me to take this opportunity toheartily commend and congratulate Ambassadors Johnde Saram of Sri Lanka and Hans Dahlgren of Sweden who served as Vice-Chairmen under my leadership  fortheir total devotion and hard work that produced thatthoughtful report.I strongly urge Member States to read the reportcarefully and reflect on the constructive proposals thatare offered in it. While the negotiations on reform mustcontinue  and given the fact that we now have a muchclearer picture in respect of the specific open questions we should revisit the earlier — all or nothing —“package deal” approach. The reform process cannotjust continue ad infinitum.It was by no means meant to become an end initself. We ought to take a cue from the urgings of theworld leaders to move on and show concrete progressas soon as possible. The emphasis on the role of theUnited Nations in the twenty-first century necessarilymeans that we complete the overall reform withoutfurther delay  so that the United Nations can performthat role effectively. For the developing countries  thehour is already too late. We have nothing to gain bydragging our feet.I would like also  in just a few words  to expressmy astonishment about the contradictory commentsthat I heard recently about the question of goodgovernance. Domestically  in the developing countries good governance has been turned into a sort of a rigiddogma by foreign Powers. But when we call for rapiddemocratization of and transparency in internationalrelations  open trade and financial rules and goodgovernance  they simply ignore our views willy-nilly.What do we make of this paradox?At least we have now agreed that there is nocommonly accepted definition and practice of goodgovernance anywhere. This was established during theconsultations for the Millennium Summit'spreparations. It is therefore better for us from now onto put more emphasis on transparent and accountablegovernance  based on the rule of law  while wecontinue debating its essential properties that areacceptable to all.At this stage  I will touch on some issues thatrequire reiterating for clarity's sake. To begin with South-North dialogue encompasses a broad field  frompolitical and diplomatic exchanges through trade poverty eradication  investment  technology industrialization  capacity-building and financing fordevelopment to the empowering of people.A recent cover story in Time magazine featuredour esteemed Secretary-General. It called him adreamer. But  to my mind  in today's world of doomedpragmatists and cynics who try to defy any belief in thepossibility of a better world for all of us  howrefreshing it is that the United Nations is led by anAfrican who is not afraid to dream! In a variation onthe lyrics of a popular song  what the world needs noware bold dreamers whose knowledge of the challengesto humanity cannot be questioned  but who believe inthe capacity of men and women to rise above their best to move even farther beyond the horizons of humancapability.That said  questions relating to development politics  economics  finance and security unavoidablyoverlap. So also do the challenges of world peace human rights  human development and human security social change and prosperity. We cannot  therefore avoid stressing inclusive and interdependent globalgovernance that militates against war  fear and want.Only in this way will all of us be able to partaketogether in a culture of peace  dialogue  sharing and thecommon advancement of humanity.In such a kinder and inclusive world that we wishto live in  a dreadful notion of humanitarianintervention  by whatever name  does not fit in. Manyof us expressed strong reactions against it as adangerous idea when it surfaced last year. Namibiaremains unconvinced and will continue to oppose anyform of unilateral humanitarian intervention outside theCharter. Whether we like it or not  this is still a worldof diktat by the rich and the powerful against the poor the weak and the vulnerable. The South is incapable ofinitiating any humanitarian intervention in the North.But the reverse is not only possible; it can be anominous certainty. Can Kuwait  Cyprus  Saint Lucia orNamibia really dare launch any humanitarianintervention anywhere in the world? They just cannot.Quite simply  in a world of lopsided military might humanitarian intervention is yet another code-name forcolonization. This issue is on the agenda and will nodoubt be debated again in the Assembly. Namibia willair its strong views when we come to that.The Charter shows the best way forward to ensurethe maintenance of international peace and security.What we  the Member States  should concentrate on therefore  is to speed up the tardy process of reforming restructuring and democratizing our Organization thebetter to pursue its lofty goals and to implement theresolutions and decisions that enjoy overwhelmingconsensus.This  in a way  brings up the excellent and timelyBrahimi report (A/55/305) on United Nations peaceoperations. The report constitutes a major buildingblock which can provide a basis for discussing andresolving all relevant issues and ideas for concertedefforts in the field of preventive diplomacy  conflictresolution and all other challenges and problems ofpeacekeeping and peace-building.The next subject I want to deal with is therecently signed United Nations Global Compact withtransnational corporations  this time initiated by theUnited Nations. We in Namibia  a country whichactively promotes smart partnerships and win-winoutcomes for government and business  labour andother key players in civil society  see this move as awelcome beginning. However  as is said  trust butverify.Not too long ago the United Nations used tomaintain at Headquarters a watchdog centre fortransnational corporations to monitor their nefariousglobal activities and sinister dirty tricks against the12interests of the people. It was closed down for reasonsnot yet known.Many of us from the developing countries oughtto remember the call by our leaders in the 1970s for anew international economic order and what became ofit. The United Nations Centre on TransnationalCorporations was a sincere undertaking to establish adata bank and provide Member States with relevantinformation for follow-up and decision-making. Thecall for a new international economic order was theSouth's version of globalization. Yet our leaders werediscredited and the initiative itself wasunceremoniously killed. Its replacement is alreadywreaking havoc on our slender prospects formeaningful economic autonomy.Today  out there in the real world  many armies ofgrassroots organizations and progressive trade unionsare back again on the streets demanding thedemocratization of international economic and traderelations  transparency  accountability  justice and fairplay for the poor  the weak and the vulnerable. This isnot a passing wave  but a telling sign of things yet tocome.The United Nations should  therefore  avoidbeing caught in the middle of the crossfire. Thesituation requires vigilance and leadership to ensurethat the corporations do not entangle the Organizationin their unsavoury dealings  as some of them arealready being accused of doing. I am aware of thewritten commitments  agreed rules and broad principlesin the Compact. But that is one thing. That aside  this isonly the beginning  and things will perhaps go wrongdown the road. I myself encouraged constructivepartnership between the United Nations and the privatesector. That does not mean  however  that all thatglitters is gold.One more matter of deep interest to my country and indeed to Africa  is information andcommunication technology — ICT. The informationand communication technology revolution is the mostsignificant social  political and economic phenomenonsince the Industrial Revolution. Its ability to transformsocieties is commonly acknowledged. Several weeksago the Economic and Social Council summit  heldhere at United Nations Headquarters  focused totally onit.Yet  ironically  and to some extent in an uncannyway  this economic panacea has been presented toAfrica not as a tool for self-development and jump-starting global competitiveness  but as yet another“crime of incapacity” used to further overburden analready embattled people.Our challenge  the challenge to all of us here  andto all those who have had a head start in mobilizingthis new capacity for the creation of wealth and a betterworld  is: what can we do  what must we do  to enableAfrica and other developing countries to gain access tothe tools of information and communicationtechnology  so that we can take ownership of our ownsocial development and achieve full employment andprosperity?Those who control this powerhouse must actquickly and generously to share the benefits of thismagic wand  especially since the sons and daughters ofAfrica and of the developing world are in fact amongthe major players in creating this new knowledge. Tothose who may begrudge Africa's access to informationand communication technology  I say  “Just think: ifinformation and communication technology enablesAfrica to create wealth rather than manage poverty then in a few years Africa will be so developed thatyou will no longer have to endure the guilt of turningus away from your front steps.”In thanking the Secretary-General and his loyalDeputy  Ms. Louise Frechette  for their unstintingsupport and encouragement  I would be remiss if I didnot also mention the General Assembly's chiefstewards and staff members for their expertise and hardwork. I extend the same sentiments to the security andprotocol officers for rendering such outstandingprofessional services. My heartfelt gratitude goes toone and all.In conclusion  for Namibia the year 2000 broughtrededication to service  celebration and thanksgiving. Itmeant awesome responsibilities in the GeneralAssembly  including during the Millennium Summit; inthe Security Council; in the World Health Assembly;and lately in the chairmanship of the Southern AfricaDevelopment Community (SADC)  our subregionalbody. One needs allies  friends and partners for all thisto happen  and we are lucky to have many of themthroughout the world. We sincerely express ourimmense indebtedness to all of them.I know that I have been long-winded. I had a fewthings to say.13"
"120",5063,"NER",55,2000," wish atthe very outset to convey to the countries andinstitutions represented here a message of sincerefriendship from the people of Niger along with itsfervent wish to maintain and continue to strengthen thelinks of peaceful coexistence and of fruitful andmutually beneficial cooperation with all the otherpeoples of the world.My warm welcome and hearty congratulations goto Tuvalu  the latest country to join the United Nationsfamily.With the 24 November 1999 presidentialelections and the 31 December 1999 legislativeelections  our people emerged from a period of politicalinstability and economic decline with every confidencein the resiliency of the democratic institutionsestablished by our 18 July 1999 constitution  and withstrengthened determination to ensure that the universalideals of peace  freedom  justice and equity will prevailin Niger  throughout Africa  and everywhere in theworld.34We are participating in this great gathering at thebeginning of the twenty-first century  proud of beingamong the democratic nations and committed  at homeand internationally  to the establishment of institutionaland legal provisions based on free and equalparticipation by all  on transparency  on responsibilityand on solidarity.Today's Niger is experiencing the same freeing ofcreative forces that results from the triumph offreedom  and the same upsurge in individual andcollective initiative that is today being generated indemocratic societies everywhere. We are no lessoptimistic about the inevitable triumph of the universalvalues of which the General Assembly is the shrine.But we also feel the same wrenching pain over theuncertain future caused by the persistence of conflictsand the destitution of the vast majority who are crushedbeneath the burden of debt  endemic diseases  illiteracyand  above all  the troubling inadequacies of theremedies prescribed to deal effectively with the illsafflicting humankind.Hence our even more profound attachment to theprinciples and ideals of the Charter and our fullconviction that the United Nations  which is at risk ofbeing out of step with current developments towardsincreasingly participatory management of our commonpublic resources  will undertake the necessary reformsto make its institutions and organs more responsive tothe aspirations of the people they are supposed torepresent.Refashioning the Organization to match the newcentury that is beginning  to make it a real instrumentof change and to renew our hope goes far beyondsimply restructuring its main bodies  subsidiary bodiesand specialized agencies. We must also strivevigorously to open up the entire system to increasinglyactive partners  such as Parliaments  governmentalregional organizations  non-governmental organizations organizations of civil society  the media and the privatesector  without ever losing sight of the primaryvocation of the United Nations as an expression of thenational will of Member States. This would greatlyincrease the international community's capacity foraction in such varied areas as peace and internationalsecurity  the fight against pandemics  especiallyHIV/AIDS  poverty eradication  the resolution of thequestion of debt and  generally speaking  the promotionof sustainable development in the world.For many countries represented here the primaryongoing source of anguish comes from the absence ofbasic physical security for citizens who are victims ofarmed conflict  and the unacceptable proliferation oflight weapons and small arms  which States that areunstable and economically drained have difficultyhalting. Other forums  including the Organization ofAfrican Unity  have pointed out ways of resolving theconflicts in Sierra Leone  Angola and the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo  in close cooperation with theUnited Nations.With regard to the Middle East  the recent failureof the Camp David process should further strengthenour determination in the tireless search for a just andlasting peace that can restore the inalienable rights ofthe Palestinian people  including their right to anindependent State  and ensure the return of the GolanHeights to Syria. In Western Sahara  it is time that therelevant United Nations resolutions were implementedfor the self-determination of the Sahrawi people. Inaddition  the Iraqi people continue to be victims of anembargo that chiefly affects the most vulnerablesectors of society  including women and children. It ishigh time that the international community took thenecessary measures to alleviate the pain of the Iraqipeople.With regard to small arms and light weapons which are one of the major challenges facing theinternational community  my Government feels thatconcrete and sustained measures should be taken atthree levels — national  regional and worldwide — tocombat the illicit trade  proliferation and use of thistype of weapon. In this regard  my Government ispleased that a United Nations mission recently visitedthe Niger in order to evaluate in the field the relevanceof the request for financing submitted by myGovernment.It is a pleasure for me to warmly thank theGovernments of all interested States  particularly ofFrance  Germany  Japan and Norway  for their financialcontributions to the United Nations fund to assistStates in the collection of small arms  which made thatmission possible.A draft submitted by my country forms part of thesubregional and regional initiatives aimed at halting theillicit traffic in small arms and light weapons  such asthe Moratorium adopted on 30 October 1998 by theConference of Heads of State and Government of the35Economic Community of West African States and theintegrated project on security and development calledProgramme for Coordination and Assistance forSecurity and Development.The handover  on 5 June  of weapons held byvarious groups of the former rebellion and the lightingon 25 September 2000 of a flame of peace at Agadez Niger  create hope for a return to calm for the people ofthe Niger and the full implementation of projectsdesigned with the welcome assistance of bilateral andmultilateral partners of the Niger. In this regard  theconvening of the United Nations Conference on theIllicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in AllIts Aspects next year bodes well. For the Niger the goalof that Conference should be to develop and strengtheninternational  regional and national efforts to prevent combat  limit and eradicate illicit traffic in small armsand light weapons through strengthening nationalcapacities in the areas of customs  police  justice andinformation.Never before has humankind had such wealth andso much potential to create common well-being. Yettoday more than half of the world population still livesin destitution  excluded from the benefits ofglobalization and of the digital revolution. We cancertainly welcome the unanimous will expressed by theinternational community to reduce poverty by half by2015. But we need to go beyond statements of faith toestablish a real international development strategyfirmly based on the eradication of absolute poverty andon reviving growth in the developing world  andparticularly in Africa  the most vulnerable region.The treatment of the question of the external debtof poor countries is one of the best barometers bywhich we can measure the real degree of theinternational community's commitment in the searchfor appropriate solutions to eradicate poverty. TheHeavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) DebtInitiative  the present framework for debt alleviation  istoo slow and too selective and comes with restrictiveeligibility requirements that need to be made moreflexible; otherwise  many countries will remain inperpetual poverty. Hence the urgent need to give freshimpetus to this Initiative.It is also essential to cooperate closely at theinternational level in order to further strengthen thecohesiveness of the coordination mechanisms of thevarious initiatives for Africa  so that that continent canbenefit more from development assistance.Moreover  while not a panacea  information andcommunication technologies are important factors  forthe developing world in general and for Africa inparticular  of growth and integration into the globaleconomy. The United Nations has a leading role to playin creating a partnership framework that wouldpromote initiatives aimed at closing the digital divideso that technological benefits will not remain a remotepromise.The recent high-level debate of the Economic andSocial Council on the role of information technologyhighlighted in a timely manner the urgent need to makethe digital revolution a tool for development and tofairly distribute its benefits through internationalcooperation. My country also fully supports therecommendation of the high-level expert group contained in the Secretary-General's report  calling foruniversal access to new technology to be set out in aGeneral Assembly resolution as a basic human right.The global partnership against AIDS in Africa whose vitality was demonstrated during the DurbanConference  must henceforth be based  among otherthings  on the mobilization of sufficient resources  onprevention and on access to drugs.In an altogether different area  my delegationbelieves that particular attention should be given to theinsidious problem of malaria. Increasingly resistant tothe medical treatment used so far  this illness — whichabove all affects the most vulnerable populations ofwomen and children — is currently a source ofprofound concern for Africa. This was confirmed bythe recent summit of heads of State held at Abuja Nigeria  on the issue. That meeting highlighted theimportance of preventive action and of increasing themeans to combat malaria. There is thus a need for theinternational community to give this problem the fullattention it deserves and to contribute further tomobilizing the necessary resources for the research prevention  treatment and eradication of that disease.At the threshold of the new millennium  the timeis certainly right to rethink development. As theSecretary-General said at the tenth session of theUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development(UNCTAD)  held in Bangkok  the time has indeedcome for a new global deal for least developedcountries. That new global compact will be aimed at36correcting imbalances and at making it possible foreveryone to participate in the new world economy andto share equally in its benefits. Today  it is undeniablethat globalization has been accompanied by heightenedinequalities and that  given the way it has evolved  itwill not be able to meet the expectations of poorcountries  whose rural and urban populations arepaying a heavy social price for that process.Moreover  the failure of the recent World TradeOrganization (WTO) Conference in Seattle hascompromised the launching of what was supposed tobe the development cycle that was finally to make itpossible to attain the benefits of the much-touted tradeliberalization. That development  it has been said inpassing  is constantly being slowed by theprotectionism of industrialized countries.The United Nations  as the democratic anduniversal body with the mandate to achieve theobjectives of development  must more than everpromote reform and coordination of the internationalmechanisms of trade and finance. To that end  ourcommon Organization has the necessary moralauthority to regulate the process of globalization in thecommon interest of all. There is therefore a need tostrengthen its role and to put in place rules for goodglobal governance that are capable of promoting — inthe words of that hallowed phrase — globalization witha human face.With the holding in 2001 of the internationalconference on financing for development and the thirdUnited Nations Conference on the Least DevelopedCountries  we hold out the resolute hope that there willbe greater mobilization of financial resources  bettercoordination of policies and more effective cooperationamong development actors  in particular amongGovernments  the United Nations system  internationalfinancial institutions  the private sector and civilsociety  so as to achieve the major objectives ofpoverty eradication and development.The praiseworthy efforts of the United Nations topromote and consolidate new and restored democraciesdeserves strong support  as that is in keeping with thewill of our Organization to meet the aspirations of thepeoples of the world.We in Niger fully appreciate all the valuableassistance given by the United Nations system andfriendly countries for the restoration of democracy.After more than a decade of political and institutionalinstability  Niger — one of the least developedcountries of the world  which is bowing under theweight of the debt burden and the impact of thedownward trend in official development assistance andof climatic vagaries — has seen a return to democracy in accordance with the profound aspirations of ourpeople. However  as was so well put in his swearing-instatement by the President of the Republic  Mr.Mamadou Tandja “We are aware that the support of theinternational community is essential to succeed inthis recovery. We therefore appeal to all countriesthat support peace and solidarity and tointernational organizations to accompany us inour efforts  on the basis of mutual beneficialinterests and with strict respect for nationalsovereignty.”We would like formally to reiterate here ourgratitude to the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme  the United Nations Population Fund  theUnited Nations Children's Fund and all of Niger'sdevelopment partners for the invaluable support theyhave constantly given my country and its people duringtheir most difficult times.By chance the schedule has it that Niger isspeaking just before the end of the general debate ofthe fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly  the socalled Millennium Assembly. What  then  could bemore natural than for me to conclude my statement byrepeating our satisfaction with the outstanding workdone by our brother  Mr. Kofi Annan  at the head of theuniversal Organization? Whether it be in the area ofmaintaining international peace and security or that ofdeveloped countries' providing development assistanceto the least developed  the Secretary-General deservesour full trust  support and encouragement.Namibia's Minister for Foreign Affairs  Mr.Theo-Ben Gurirab  your predecessor  Mr. President was a good President. His old companion in thestruggle  the late Mr. Johnny Makatini  as demandingas he was in his lifetime  would have been as proud aswe at seeing the unequalled diplomatic talents Mr.Gurirab displayed for a whole year. I pay humbletribute to him here on behalf of Niger. I say to him:Theo  you will always be a freedom fighter.As for you  Mr. President  we know that the torchthat has been passed to you is in good hands. Yourpersonal competence and Finland's tradition of alwaysstanding with the weakest leads us fervently to believethat the Millennium Summit's conclusions will find inyou a true and committed advocate  so that at last ourOrganization can acquire the new habits required bythe advent of the twenty-first century."
"121",5109,"NGA",55,2000,"Please allow me to sharewith Mr. Holkeri the joy of his election to thepresidency of the fifty-fifth session of the GeneralAssembly. He can rest assured of Nigeria's support andcooperation. May I also express the same sentiment onbehalf of the Group of 77. To his predecessor and mycolleague  His Excellency Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab ofNamibia  Nigeria and the Group of 77 wish to expressour pride in and appreciation of the most distinguishedmanner in which he discharged his duties as thePresident of the fifty-fourth session. We are indeedvery proud of him.May I also commend the Secretary-General  Mr.Kofi Annan  for the manner in which he has piloted20and continues to manage the affairs of the UnitedNations. I would also like to thank him for hismillennium report  which has identified some of thepressing problems and challenges facing mankind.In the past few weeks here at the United Nationsa lot of reflection and deep thinking have taken placeamong world leaders  all in an attempt to morecoherently define the future. The end of onemillennium and the beginning of another warrant allthese efforts to find such a purposeful definition. Fifty-five years ago the United Nations was formed as aglobal bulwark against armed conflict on a world scale such as the Second World War. Over the years itsmandate of preserving international security hasbroadened from strictly preventing such armed conflictto cover also fundamental issues of socio-economicsecurity for humanity. For example  in many of thedeveloping countries the United Nations manifests itspotential more through the United Nations Children'sFund  the World Health Organization  the UnitedNations Educational  Scientific and CulturalOrganization and other agencies than in SecurityCouncil resolutions  comparatively speaking. It is alsofrom the activities of these United Nations agenciesthat the underprivileged sectors of poor countriesbenefit directly  activities from which these samecountries  including those in Africa  have come toimbibe the idealism regarding the United Nationsability to harmonize the totality of progress to thebenefit of all human stakeholders.To a great extent this idealism has not beenmisplaced. In fact  at no other time has the possibilityof a global family been more real than now. Thisprospect must  I am sure  have been very exciting to somany of us and must have been the basis for hailing theUnited Nations system for its own role in andcontribution to these achievements. But as myPresident  Chief Olusegun Obasanjo  aptly observedhere less than two weeks ago “Although the world has generally become asafer place to live in  thanks to the contributionsof the United Nations  we must all feel deeplyworried that the message of hope which theOrganization has been spreading is yet to reachthe millions of humankind for whom it isintended. For the vast majority of our peoples grinding poverty has remained a fact of theireveryday existence.” (A/55/PV.7)This reality of grinding poverty has raisedconsiderable apprehension in some United NationsMember States about their fate in the new millennium.There is a clear basis for this apprehension  given thatthe past millennium was  for most of these countries characterized by extreme poverty  heavy indebtedness wars of attrition and the resultant mass ordeal andanguish for both their immediate and distant victims absolute vulnerability to epidemics such as cholera malaria and typhoid  the rage of the HIV/AIDSpandemic  the scourge of natural disasters  serioustechnological backwardness and a digital dividebetween them and the others  and by profoundeconomic decline and infrastructural decay. In the lastdecade in particular  whatever hopes were raised bysome initiatives aimed at mitigating African and thirdworld underdevelopment have dwindled to nothing asthe world emerged from the cold war into a moreproblematic concept called globalization.The globe  which is the symbol or logo of theUnited Nations  depicts humanity. From the word“globe” has been derived a phenomenon calledglobalization  which explicitly connotes a worldwithout national borders  with particular reference tocommerce  in which humanity is one huge market.Apart from thus unfortunately associating the nobleand emotive word “humanity” with the materialism ofcommerce and the market  globalization automaticallyraises other questions for three quarters of humanityoutside the orbit of industrial competence.In a global economy all the actors in thateconomy should also be stakeholders. But what stakedoes Africa have in a global economy? Economically it is heavily indebted  some of its countries committingup to 55 per cent of gross earnings to debt servicingand payment. What can the little that is left do for thedomestic economy? What does an economy thatproduces virtually nothing in industrial terms have tooffer  and  moreover  how can it compete in a globaleconomy? What is the income level of the averageAfrican  relative to that of his or her counterparts inmany countries of the West  vis-à-vis the capacity topatronize the goods and services which globalizationoffers? How does globalization facilitate democraticconsolidation? How can the core values of liberaldemocracy  such as the rule of law  the preservation ofhuman rights and good governance  be sustained by aGovernment that lacks the resources to competentlyprovide a minimum of social service delivery and thus21sustain legitimacy and regime credibility? In whatways would a typical regime in Africa be able tocontribute its quota to democratic consolidation withthe debt overhang  the exchange and interest ratepractices in the international financial architecture  theprices offered for raw materials relative to the prices ofindustrial goods and services  the limited trade accessand the conditionalities tied to loans and aid?As a responsible member of the internationalcommunity and as the chair of the G-77  Nigeria isobliged to draw attention to the context of our presentsituation. What is clear to me now is that the dream ofa global family cannot be attained if the present worldarchitecture of power and the reward system continues.The dialogue of the Organization of African Unity  theNon-Aligned Movement and the G-77 with the G-8countries has so far shown that a great deal can beachieved from that approach to the issues in question.As President Obasanjo again said in a separate speech it is imperative for the world to seize this moment tobegin to get the future right  since such a solemnmoment in the history of mankind as the recentMillennium Summit  may not always present itself. Weare talking of dialogue that takes the issues on board ina holistic manner  as opposed to the current practice ofabstracting merely one or other manifestation of thesystem — for example  in the case of wars of attritionand the idea of international humanitarian intervention.The debate so far has brought to the fore theproblem of the contradiction between sovereignty andintervention. Of course  nation States  even those onthe verge of evaporation  would be sensitive to theword “intervention”. But  more than that  discussion ofthe issue has brought out the one-dimensional nature ofthe treatment of some issues or problems in terms ofwhat we include in or exclude from the definition. Inthis particular case  the debate so far has concentratedon war situations or armed conflicts featuring massiveloss of life.What of other situations where loss of life is alsoof a serious magnitude but not as a result of war orarmed conflict? What of the silent genocide occasionedby the HIV/AIDS pandemic  epidemics and naturaldisasters such as famine  drought  flood  etc.? Whatabout the situation that arises when sanctions lead todeaths on a serious scale? All these should find a placein a proper and systematic discussion of humanitarianintervention aimed at giving succour to those who maybe trapped in tragedies other than wars.Similarly  is there no other way by which theworld can arrest the proliferation of small arms andlight weapons in Africa and other parts of the South?Certainly the world knows about the nature and typesof weapons used in the prosecution of these wars where they are manufactured and by whom  theprocesses by which they are traded and acquired andthe key facilitators of these processes  includingnational governments and arms merchants. What if thesearch for solutions focused on these areas?These and many other weighty global issues werediscussed at the first ever South Summit held inHavana last April. That Summit was a definingmoment for the Group of 77 countries which ponderedthe challenges of the twenty-first century. In Havanathe South resolved to forge a new and meaningfulpartnership with the industrialized nations. Wedemanded equal partnership in decision-making thataffects the whole of humanity. That was the messagethe leaders of the South took to the G8 Summit inOkinawa. The outcome of that consultation vividlydemonstrates that meaningful partnership is a must forthe new century. Certainly the interests of mankindcompel a more inclusive participation of all segmentsof our global community."
"122",5154,"NIC",55,2000,"Ibegin by congratulating you  Sir  on your well deservedelection to the presidency of the General Assembly atits first session of the millennium. Your proven skilland vast experience guarantee that you will ably guidethe work of this session. I wish also to express ourgreat friendship for and gratitude to Finland  thecountry you so honourably represent  whose closefriendship with Nicaragua has earned our sincereaffection. Let me also thank your predecessor Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  for the dedicated way in whichhe guided our work at the fifty-fourth session.I wish next to express very special thanks for thecontribution made by the Secretary-General  HisExcellency Mr. Kofi Annan  who has prepared avaluable report (A/54/2000) on the role of theOrganization in the twenty-first century; the report wascentral in stimulating the discussions conducted by ourheads of State or Government at the MillenniumSummit — an unprecedented event that laid thegroundwork for giving fresh momentum to the UnitedNations.The process of renewing the Organizationrequires the strengthening of its organs and institutionsso as to enhance the effectiveness of its endeavours inspheres such as the maintenance of international peace24and security  poverty eradication  the strengthening ofhealth and education programmes and the struggleagainst the destruction of the environment. Without adoubt  that depends on us  the States Members of theUnited Nations; we must guarantee the Organization theresources and other means it needs to fulfil its mandateand fully to play its role as a centre for exchange ofviews and for coordinating the efforts of the world'speoples.In that connection  let me reaffirm the need toreform the Security Council  an organ that is of vitalimportance to peace and security. Such reform shouldinclude democratic  equitable geographicalrepresentation and a better balance between developedand developing countries so that the Council will beable to respond fully and effectively to the presentneeds of our peoples and to future challenges facingthem in the new millennium. Here  we see the veto asanother element of this sensitive issue that should beaddressed seriously with a view to limiting itsapplication to very specific situations and to possiblyeliminating it. For those reasons  we believe it to be ofparamount importance to reach consensus on all theissues that are inherent in the very structure of the newinternational order.We wish also to stress the importance of speedilybeginning a process of international discussions aimedat attaining greater consensus and effectiveness inresolving humanitarian emergencies. In another vein we believe that we must reaffirm our commitment tomaintain and strengthen the universal mission of theUnited Nations to ensure that all the world's peopleswithout exception enjoy fair representation. This bringsme to reaffirm before the Assembly how important it isto give consideration to the longing of one people toparticipate with legitimate representation as a fullMember of the Organization: I refer here to theRepublic of China.Another important matter that the Organizationshould continue in the new century to address withgreater determination is the war against drugtrafficking  organized crime and terrorism. Indeed  theflow of drugs is rapidly increasing in our countries  andin but a few years has become one of the most seriousof problems  one that directly affects our economic political and social life. To address that criticalsituation  we must give priority to strengthening thenational institutions that are mandated to combat thisscourge  to enacting and updating national legislation and to increasing international cooperation andcoordination in this sphere. Here  let me observe thatNicaragua has strict laws to punish drug traffickers and has established a national drug-control plan underwhich institutions work together in a coordinatedmanner to attain the stated objectives. We are alsoworking constantly towards greater internationalcooperation.At the outset of the new millennium  we see anurgent need to deepen and accelerate progress on waysand means to achieve world disarmament  especiallywith respect to weapons whose great destructivepowers actually threaten life on our planet. Wetherefore welcomed the outcome of the 2000 ReviewConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  which reaffirmed theconviction that full and effective implementation of theTreaty and of the non-proliferation regime in all itsaspects plays a vital role in the promotion ofinternational peace and security.Similarly  we focus special attention on theproblem of conventional weapons and on the existenceof anti-personnel landmines  which also pose a threatto human safety and security. We therefore believe it isa priority to meet the obligations taken on by eachState under international and regional conventions onthese subjects. In Nicaragua  one of the gravestconsequences of the armed conflict that was fortunately  overcome in the 1990s is undoubtedly thepresence of a vast number of anti-personnel landminesthroughout our territory  a situation that even todayclaims numerous innocent victims. Accordingly  mycountry  with the support of the internationalcommunity  is making an enormous effort to resolvethe problem permanently. Along with mine-clearanceactivities  we have begun the process of destroyingmine stockpiles  and have thus far destroyed more than40 000 mines  in strict compliance with the OttawaConvention on the Prohibition of the Use  Stockpiling Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines andon Their Destruction. Nicaragua reaffirms itsdetermination to spare no effort in the preparations forthe third meeting of States parties to the OttawaConvention  to be held in Nicaragua in September2001.We also believe it to be of the utmost importanceto reaffirm our commitment to tolerance and respect fordiversity. In that connection  we support thepreparatory work for the World Conference against25Racism  Racial Discrimination  Xenophobia andRelated Intolerance.It is essential for the future of the Organizationand for that of our peoples that we make a greatereffort always to comply with the purposes that half acentury ago were laid down in the San FranciscoCharter  especially with respect to the maintenance ofinternational peace and security. This can happen onlywith a firm commitment to non-violence and to theprinciple of the peaceful settlement of disputes throughthe procedures established by international law. That isthe key element in preventing future conflicts withgrave and enduring consequences for mankind.For us  it is a source of satisfaction that one of thelast vestiges of the cold war is on the way to a peacefulresolution. Here I refer to the dialogue between the twoKoreas  which has been launched at the highest leveland which will without doubt mark the beginning ofpromising prospects for the Korean peninsula.Nicaragua also shares the concern of theinternational community at the persistence of certainconflicts  particularly on the African continent; thesehave caused devastating damage to property and theloss of countless lives in countries such as Angola  theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  Sierra Leone Burundi and the Sudan. It is therefore gratifying that insome of those countries steps have been taken to find asolution to their conflicts. These include the 18 Junesigning of the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement byEthiopia and Eritrea  and the implementation of theDjibouti peace initiative for Sierra Leone. We also hailIsrael's withdrawal from Lebanon in accordance withSecurity Council resolutions  and the stepped-upefforts  since the Camp David summit organized byPresident Clinton  to find a peaceful settlementbetween Israel and Palestine.In the same vein  my country is convinced of theimportance of the principle of the self-determination ofpeoples; we note the urgent need to hold the pendingreferendum in Western Sahara as soon as possible. Tothat end  all obstacles to that process must beovercome. Similarly  my country  convinced of theimportance of the principle of the self-determination ofpeoples  makes an appeal regarding the pressing needto hold  as soon as possible  the referendum pending onWestern Sahara. To that end  all obstacles to theprocess must be overcome.Much progress has been made in this century.Some of the most important achievements have been inthe field of the technology revolution. Consequentlytoday we have the great responsibility and duty tobegin this new millennium by pooling our efforts toachieve adequate levels of technology transfer todeveloping countries in order to prevent globalizationfrom becoming a negative phenomenon thatexacerbates the marginalization of the poorestcountries.The advantages and the disadvantages entailed byglobalization require the developing countries to worktogether in order to increase their opportunities tosuccessfully confront this phenomenon. An example ofthis is the decision of the Presidents of Guatemala Nicaragua and El Salvador to sign a tri-nationalagreement aimed at giving fresh impetus to the CentralAmerican integration process by providing anappropriate political framework for the establishmentof a regional customs union  a process launched by ElSalvador and Guatemala and which Nicaragua andHonduras have recently joined.Apart from integration initiatives  continuedefforts to achieve solidarity through cooperation fordevelopment are vitally important. Nonetheless  wefeel it must be emphasized that cooperation activitiesmust be accompanied by appropriate management thatoffers favourable conditions for small economies tohave access to large international markets  obtainingfair prices for their exports of raw materials andmanufactured goods. In this respect  we warmlywelcome the decision to convene the high-levelintergovernmental event on financing for developmentin 2001. That event is of paramount importance to theefforts being made to achieve the objectives establishedby the Millennium Summit.The strengthening of the multilateral trade systemis also of great importance  which includes  amongother things  the prompt and urgent convening of around of trade negotiations within the framework of theWorld Trade Organization (WTO) in which problemsare addressed in a comprehensive and integral manner to lead to an effective reduction of tariff and non-tariffbarriers. Free trade and the rules governing it should beimplemented within the WTO framework so that theybenefit all  particularly the poor countries.It is also essential that the most heavily indebtedpoor countries be able to aspire to break the vicious26circle of poverty. In this regard  as stated by Mr.Arnoldo Alemán Lacayo  President of Nicaragua during the Millennium Summit “the unbearable weight of an immense externaldebt [represents] an insurmountable barrier toovercoming poverty and unemployment. In thisrespect  we are pleased to note the interestrecently shown by the developed countries andmultilateral financial institutions in seekingalternatives that would substantially relieve thesituation of the heavily indebted poor countries.We hope that this interest will soon be reflectedin specific and meaningful actions  so thatcountries such as Nicaragua can break thisvicious circle of poverty and look towards afuture with greater opportunities and expectationsfor sustainability and progress.” (A/55/PV.3)Another important challenge to which we mustdevote great effort is the conservation of naturalresources and the global environment; this is vitallyimportant for the future of humanity  as well as for theprevention of and response to natural disasters.Nicaragua has been cruelly punished by naturalphenomena; the effects of hurricane Mitch  whichlashed the Central American region in 1998  and ofstrong telluric movement shook the eastern part of ourcountry  causing loss of human life and considerablematerial damage are still fresh. Given that reality Nicaragua  with the valuable assistance of the UnitedNations Development Programme  became the thirdLatin American country to adopt a modern law to takethe necessary measures to establish an integratedsystem for disaster prevention and response. Moreover despite its limited resources  Nicaragua has channelledgreat energy into the search for a model of sustainabledevelopment and of conservation of its naturalresources. In that regard  the Government of Nicaraguahas established the National Council on SustainableDevelopment  a pluralistic body in which all the mainsectors of civil society participate  in order to promoteactively  in accordance with Agenda 21  theimplementation of this model of sustainabledevelopment.Our leaders have had the historic opportunity toundertake decisive commitments for the future ofhumanity. Nicaragua fully shares and reaffirms itscommitment to the basic values contained in theMillennium Declaration: freedom and equality  so thatwe may all live decently  without poverty or violence but rather in good health and with education; equityand solidarity  since all peoples of the world have theduty to share and to exchange knowledge andexperience that tomorrow will be decisive for humandevelopment; tolerance and non-violence  since we canforge ahead only if people respect each other and ifStates are always prepared to understand each otherand resolve their differences through peaceful means;and respect for nature  in order to be able to leave toour children a future in which they will feel proud andoptimistic  in which they will walk with their headshigh  confident that they are on the right path.Today is the time to sow  so that tomorrow wewill be able to harvest. Today is when we must beaware that we have a shared responsibility  collectiveand individual  to strengthen the United Nations inorder to be able to build a more just  secure andequitable international system for all."
"123",5201,"NLD",55,2000,"“We  thepeoples” is a powerful rendition of world affairs and adaunting portrait of life for future generations. It tookintellect and diplomatic savoir-faire to state a complexcase in such a concise and forceful way. We aregrateful to the Secretary-General and his staff forproducing it.“We  the peoples” are of course the openingwords of the Charter  and I want to take them as a pointof departure. Other speakers have done so before meand have argued in favour of a more robust structurefor keeping the peace in the world community. Theyare right. The United Nations role in the area ofpreventing or limiting armed conflict was conceived asits principal purpose. The Brahimi report has shownhow  in spite of that  the United Nations peacekeepingfunction has in fact become its Achilles heel. TheBrahimi recommendations deserve to beimplemented — the sooner the better. At present  theNetherlands Government and parliament are debatinghow to improve our national contribution topeacekeeping.15“We  the Peoples” can lead to reflections on atotally different side of the United Nations reality aswell. I  for one  would take this opportunity to argue infavour of closer ties between the United Nations andthe private sector.In 1945 the world was run by States. The Charterhinges on that very assumption. It covers all aspects oflife as they were prevalent at the time  from peace andsecurity to social justice  from economic cooperation tohuman rights. Despite its ambition  the Charter hardlymentions any other actors besides States. Non-governmental organizations appear in the Charter onlyonce. The private sector is not referred to at all. Inother words  the Charter conforms to a model ofgovernance as old as the Peace of Westphalia  a statesystem going back to the mid-1600s.In order to strategize for the future  we need toask ourselves: who  in actual fact  runs the worldtoday; where and how are world affairs conducted; andhow can we position the United Nations accordingly?The United Nations is made up of Member States.That is fitting and proper. States will be the custodiansof foreign relations for a long time to come. But theirroles have changed significantly with time. States canno longer be thought of as the hard billiard balls ofinternational relations. Internationalization has alteredthe concept of sovereignty. Nor are Sates autonomousentities as before  pursuing self-defined nationalinterests. Their actions are now much more shaped byeconomic pressures  information flows  and populationmovements. For States  too  globalization is here tostay. Other actors have entered both the domestic andinternational scenes. Civil society is one. The privatesector is another. Since 1945  civil society  made up ofnon-profit organizations  has blossomed along a widespectrum  beyond any expectation of the UnitedNations founding fathers. Many non-governmentalorganizations operate across national boundaries. Atthe present time  the United Nations system couldnever hope to operate properly without the assistanceof non-governmental organizations  not to mentionnormative thinking and advocacy. Non-governmentalorganizations have acquired access to the UnitedNations at different levels  and participate in many ofits discussions.Although a potent actor on the domestic andinternational levels  the private sector has beenvirtually ignored by traditional United Nationsdiplomacy. The business community  and notablytransnational corporations  were viewed by many as thecompetitor  if not as the enemy of international publicinterest. Documents critical of multinationals werebeing issued by the United Nations and the specializedagencies until recently. Confrontation rather thandialogue. I am not contending that there were nogrounds for that position: quite the contrary. However nowadays we see a growing awareness in the businesscommunity of the necessity of responsible corporatepolicies and of a role for private enterprise in thepursuit of interests that go beyond maximizingimmediate profits. As an example  I refer to the GlobalAlliance for Vaccines and Immunization  in which thepharmaceutical industry closely cooperates withinternational organizations  Governments and otheractors.We need to build on that. Indeed  the time hascome to expand the concept of a partnership with theprivate sector. Why? Two reasons. First of all  theworld is up against incredible odds and  secondly  theprivate sector does exist and wields a lot of power inthe international arena.About the odds: take a sustainable future  whereelementary laws of ecology must be respected. Noteven the most powerful Government can put a stop toglobal warming — nor all the Member States of theUnited Nations combined. A sustainable future needsto be pursued in conjunction with industry  civil societyand the scientific community. For equitable workingconditions  and other forms of social justice  Statesneed to involve the private sector. The same is true forfighting corruption  the spread of small arms  wastingwater or AIDS.We have truly entered an era that is very differentfrom the one in which the United Nations was born —an era in which the course of humanity and the qualityof life on earth have more and more become a sharedresponsibility; an era where Governments  the privatesector and civil society are drawn ever more closelytogether. They all have a stake in global governance.The so-called global public goods are a matter for all ofthem together.The private sector has a stake in the future of theplanet  too. Of course  it is here to do business. But noplanet  no profit. Companies should find it in their owninterest to assume a responsibility equal to their weightin international relations and the influence they have at16the domestic level. Chief executive officers  too  wanta livable world for their grandchildren. The privatesector must be called upon to enter into a responsiblecorporate partnership in sync with other actors at theinternational plane. True  the role of each actor needsto be different. Their motivation can remain different too — as does the legal basis on which they act. Buttheir determination needs to be the same: thedetermination to secure the longevity of life as weknow it and to secure for everyone on the planet anequitable share of its bounty.Different roles  shared responsibility. Thatconcept needs to take root in this Organization as well.The United Nations cannot credibly hope to play agalvanizing role in meeting the challenges of thecoming century if it cannot show that its debates andits action platforms reflect the real world outside theconference rooms. If we want to see the United Nationsas “unique in world affairs” — as the Millenniumreport puts it — it must be able to show that all playersare on the stage.The Secretary-General's Global Compact couldnot have come at a more opportune moment. It is themere beginning of a process  but it is off to a promisingstart. The Global Compact deserves the active supportof the international community  and it deserves to bejoined by other multinationals. I do understand thetrepidations of some non-governmental organizationswho fear that multinational corporations will drapethemselves in the United Nations flag and becomeuntouchable in the pursuit of profit. I understand  too the apprehension felt by diplomats in this hall  whohave a lifetime invested in the exclusivity of the Stateand its monopoly on multilateral discourse. But theGlobal Compact is not a Trojan horse.And I will go even further. We have given civilsociety structural access to the United Nations system.By contrast  the access we are giving to the privatesector  with the notable exception of the InternationalLabour Organization  has been ad hoc  not structural.In the future  we must create appropriate channels ofcommunication with the private sector  inside thisOrganization  where they  as well as Governments andcivil society  can try and get a hold on the convulsionsof our time — a forum where  at the very least  theycan deliberate and begin to break down the barriers ofmistrust that have divided them for so long.That is the first reason why the United Nationsneeds to broaden its scope and become more inclusive.The second is the power of the private sector. Manycompanies have turnovers larger than the nationalbudgets of some Member States  and the same is truefor the personal fortunes of some chief executiveofficers. The relationship between States and theprivate sector has altered dramatically over time. Stateswere once thought of as bulwarks against harmfuleconomic impact from abroad. Economic weight wasviewed as a trump card in the power play amongnations. Today  States are increasingly serving asinstruments for adjusting domestic policy to therealities of the present-day world economy. They havebecome intermediaries between the world economy with its own structure of power  and domestic societies.This brings up the question of where world affairsare being conducted and how they have caused a shiftin the style of diplomacy. Economic globalization hasshifted the focus of attention to forums other than theUnited Nations here in New York  notably to theInternational Monetary Fund  the World Bank  theWorld Trade Organization and  on a regional level  theEuropean Union. Policies are tested in the margins ofthe World Economic Forum in Davos or decidedelsewhere. Brussels has become a hub of world affairs.That focus has brought on a different cast of playersthan in the days of Talleyrand and Metternich. ForeignMinisters now work shoulder to shoulder not only withdevelopment ministers  but also with finance and tradeministers  as well as with central bankers. Internationalaffairs  whether we like it or not  are increasingly abouteconomics.Forging a relationship with the private sector istherefore indispensable if the United Nations wants topreserve its relevance over the long haul. Themultilateral system  for its part  must seek closer tieswith other centres of power and with the businesscommunity. Mr. Kofi Annan has been vigorouslypursuing closer relations with all these various forums and we encourage him to do more of the same.Responsible corporate partnership is also aboutprotecting the weak. The United Nations was set up notonly to guarantee peace and security  but also to securefreedom from want. Despite its obvious advantages globalization is leaving too many victims by thewayside. The gap between the rich and the poorcontinues to widen  and the poor suffer the most  inwar and in peace. Meanwhile  the private sector wields17a great deal of power in its decisions as to where it willbuy  sell and invest. Those decisions may bear directlyon the quality of life in many developing countries.Even though the odds are staggering  the UnitedNations system can make a difference in reducingpoverty  gender inequality and child and maternalmortality. But it can make a difference only from aposition of strength and from a platform shared byother actors at the international level: from a positionof shared responsibility. The Millennium Summit hasdeclared poverty eradication the United Nationsnumber one priority. We applaud that. But fightingpoverty is not only a moral imperative  as it always hasbeen; it has also become an economic one. That isanother reason for the United Nations to become moreinclusive of the private sector.The Secretary-General's report (A/54/2000)  “Wethe peoples”  duly poses the question of how to takethe United Nations forward. Whatever the wayforward  it needs to be a bold one. For too long wehave been remoulding old ideas. While doing so  wehave kept the United Nations on a very short leash hardly allowing it to stray off the beaten path. More ofthe same is not enough. In other words  the UnitedNations is bound to miss its cue if we  the peoples pursue our business as usual. The future will pass usby.The alternative is an avenue that is much moreambitious. It amounts to using the United Nationssystem as a vehicle for the development of a newvision of world politics  a vision for the “post-Westphalian” era. In such a vision  present trendswould be given legitimacy and a conceptualframework. In such a vision  the principle of non-intervention yields to the defence of human rights;sovereignty is further reappraised; there is room forcivil society and the private sector; and economics arealso held responsible for social and development goals.Such is the road less travelled  but the only one thatcan make all the difference."
"124",5246,"NOR",55,2000,"﻿First of all  I would liketo congratulate you  Mr. President  on your assumptionof your important position. I would also like towelcome Tuvalu as a new Member of the UnitedNations.Norway is committed to a strong and effectiveUnited Nations. For decades  we have pursued a policyof translating our commitment to the United Nationsinto substantial contributions to the various activitiesof the United Nations system. That is why some 60 000Norwegians have served in United Nationspeacekeeping operations. That is why Norway todaycontributes 1 500 military and civilian personnel toUnited Nations and United Nations-mandatedpeacekeeping operations around the world. That is whywe are supporting the peace and reconciliation effortsof the United Nations in the Middle East  Colombia Cyprus and Sudan. And that is why a relatively smallcountry of 4.5 million inhabitants is one of the largestdonors of voluntary contributions to the economic social and humanitarian programmes of the UnitedNations. This year  Norway is providing $1.3 billiondollars for development cooperation. My Governmentplans to increase that amount substantially over thenext few years. A large part of that will be channelledthrough the United Nations system.At the first session of the General Assembly inthe twenty-first century  and after the successfulMillennium Assembly last week  it is time to take stockand act upon the decisions we have made. Here is whatNorway will give priority to in the time ahead.We will focus on the root causes of conflict andput the fight against poverty  underdevelopment andenvironmental degradation at the top of our agenda.Financing for development is essential. Norwayreached the 0.7 per cent target more than 20 years ago.We are currently devoting 0.9 per cent of our grossnational product for official development assistance and my Government has pledged to reach a full one percent.We will increase our support through themultilateral development agencies  including our6support to the United Nations Development Programme(UNDP).We will continue to advocate a morecomprehensive approach to peace-building. Conflictprevention  humanitarian relief and long-termdevelopment cannot be regarded as separate tasks.They must be part of an integrated and coherentstrategy of human security.We will continue to combat malaria  tuberculosisand other diseases. Malaria alone takes two lives everyminute  of every day of every year  mainly those ofchildren and pregnant women. We will significantlyincrease our contribution to the vaccination of children so that they do not die of easily curable diseases.We will intensify our efforts to help contain andreduce the spread of HIV/AIDS  which in manycountries has become the single largest threat todevelopment. We will focus even more strongly onAfrica  as Africa needs a new and better deal. We callfor a renewed commitment to Africa and are preparedto contribute substantially to this effort.The United Nations has mounted more peaceoperations during the last 10 years than during theprevious four decades combined. We have witnessedsignificant successes  but also uncovered disturbingand tragic weaknesses. Far too often  and frequentlyat great cost to the people we were supposed toprotect  the United Nations has relied on last-minuteefforts and ad hoc arrangements. The rich and powerfulMember States must honour their promises to the weakand defenceless.Norway supports the recommendations in thereport of the United Nations Panel on PeaceOperations  headed by Ambassador Brahimi. We standready to engage in a broad dialogue on how to ensurethe speedy and efficient implementation of therecommendations contained in the Brahimi report.Together with our partners  we will push forwardtowards non-proliferation of weapons of massdestruction. We will work for further reductions innuclear arsenals with a view to eliminating them building on the important results of the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) ReviewConference here in New York.We will continue to combat illicit trade and thespread of small arms. We should make full use of theopportunity provided by the United NationsConference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms andLight Weapons in All its Aspects to take firm steps tocurtail this deadly traffic.None of this can be done  however  if we do notsecure a sound financial basis for the United Nationsitself. We must put United Nations finances on a moresecure and predictable footing. We must close the gapbetween the tasks we ask the United Nations to carryout and the resources we make available to it. Zerogrowth is clearly not sufficient. We cannot expect theUnited Nations to carry out new and additional taskswithout additional funding.No one must be allowed to commit war crimes orcrimes against humanity with impunity. Norwaytherefore strongly supports the Statute establishing anInternational Criminal Court. Now we must seek itsspeedy implementation.To effectively meet our common challenges  wemust build new partnerships between the UnitedNations  civil society and the private sector. TheGlobal Compact' is one such initiative. The GlobalAlliance for Vaccines and Immunization' (GAVI) isanother. Early next year Norway will host aninternational conference in Oslo on the role of theprivate sector in promoting investment and economicdevelopment in the least developed countries.We will continue to support efforts to enabledeveloping countries to take full advantage of thebenefits of multilateral cooperation. In particular  wewould like to assist the least developed countries including small island developing States  to benefitmore fully from joint international efforts  includingthe legal regime for the seas and oceans established bythe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.Globalization provides opportunities forunprecedented growth  but it can also lead tomarginalization and isolation. In our globalized world markets have become global much faster than politics.There is an urgent need to adapt the internationaltrading and financial systems so that every country canobtain its fair share of the benefits of globalization.In our shrinking world  providing humanitarianaid and emergency relief to people in need is theresponsibility of every Government. Norway willincrease its humanitarian efforts  which are alreadyamong the most intensive in the world  both7bilaterally and through United Nations agencies andnon-governmental organizations.We will to the best of our ability continue tofacilitate peace efforts in countries where the parties toa conflict request our involvement. Ultimately however  the responsibility for lasting peace rests withthe parties themselves.Finally  we reiterate our call for reform andenlargement of the Security Council in terms of bothpermanent and non-permanent members. Broadermembership and increased transparency are essential tothe legitimacy and effectiveness of the Council.For the first time since 1979  Norway is seeking aseat on the Security Council. We hope to be elected after 22 years  based on our contributions to the UnitedNations and on the principles of fair rotation. Wetherefore ask for the support of the Assembly. Norwaywill deeply respect a mandate from the Assembly. Wewill be attentive to its voices and concerns. We willremain committed to help those who suffer frompoverty and war  disasters and famine to place a strongUnited Nations at the centre of world affairs  to ensurethat those who have the strongest backs bear theheaviest burden. We ask the Assembly to allow us toserve all Members."
"125",5292,"NPL",55,2000,"I join previous speakers incongratulating the President on his well-deservedelection to preside over this Millennium Assembly. Iam confident that  with his wisdom and consummatediplomatic skill  he will steer the Assembly to asuccessful conclusion.Let me also express our appreciation to Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  Foreign Minister of Namibia  for his24exemplary leadership as president of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-fourth session  especially in therun-up to the Summit. Secretary-General Kofi Annanalso deserves our unqualified tribute for his innovativeleadership to prepare the United Nations for greaterchallenges ahead.Nepal wholeheartedly welcomes Tuvalu as thenewest member of the United Nations family. Wecongratulate the people and Government of that Pacificisland country on this happy occasion of joining theworld body as an independent nation.Last week the heads of State and Governmentassembled in this Hall of the people to pondermeasures to address the challenges of the twenty-firstcentury  and reaffirmed their faith in the UnitedNations as the central instrument for promoting peace prosperity and justice. The vision given us by theSummit's Millennium Declaration will be a guide forthe global community  and particularly for the UnitedNations  in the days ahead. Nepal welcomes theDeclaration and pledges its commitment to implementit with the utmost seriousness.My Prime Minister  addressing the Summit expressed the view that the future will judge us by theability of our leadership to make a difference inpeople's lives. We in Nepal expect the globalcommunity to work in cooperation and solidarity  in atrue spirit of partnership  to change for the better thedestiny of every man  woman and child around theworld.As we enter a new century and a new millennium the world is replete with paradoxes. It now has fewerinter-State wars  but numerous civil wars. Science andtechnology have made unprecedented advances  butdiseases like AIDS still defy treatment. More peopleenjoy democracy and freedom  but terrorism still drawsyouth. The walls of frontiers are crumbling in theglobalized economy  but the assertion of culturalidentity has increased. The United Nations has to workin the midst of these paradoxes.The United Nations has succeeded remarkably inbringing peace in some situations and failed in others.Its involvement has eased tensions in the CentralAfrican Republic and Tajikistan. East Timor is headinginto independence in relative calm. Kosovo is engagedin building democratic institutions. Israel haswithdrawn its forces from southern Lebanon  awithdrawal which has vastly improved the prospects ofa comprehensive peace in the Middle East.Still durable peace remains as elusive as ever. Inessence  it entails a culture of peace founded ondisarmament and the peaceful resolution of conflicts as well as on measures that remove the root causes ofconflict — poverty and exclusion.Lasting peace cannot be secured until nuclearweapons  which constitute the major threat to globalsecurity  are eliminated in a time-bound manner. Norcan it be achieved without the complete eradication ofother weapons of mass destruction. We consider thatweapons delivery systems and the so-called nationalmissile defence systems threaten the peace as well.Small arms and light weapons have killed morepeople than all weapons of mass destruction combined.We must turn our backs on the guns by controllingsmall arms and light weapons. In this context  wewelcome the proposed conference on small arms to beheld in 2001.Conflicts disturb Africa  Asia  Europe and LatinAmerica. The Middle East is yet to conclude the finalsettlement and be at peace with itself. The Balkans arestill rife with dispute  though of a lesser extent now.South Asia is in the perennial pain of low intensity war.Terrorists are on the prowl in many places  exploitingthe fragility of States. As a result  thousands ofinnocent lives have been lost. The action of theSecurity Council  which is the world's sentry  has beentoo little  too late in many situations; it has letemerging disputes descend into full-blown conflicts.Nepal urges the Security Council to act in a timelymanner  promptly  decisively and adequately to preventconflagrations.Nepal has always been an active participant inUnited Nations peace operations. Nepalesepeacekeepers have served with impeccableprofessionalism and dedication and have earned a namefor themselves. Many valiant Nepalese Blue Helmetshave laid down their lives in the service of worldpeace. The recent death of Private Devi Ram Jaishi  aNepalese peacekeeper  while defending peace in EastTimor  rekindles our commitment to abiding peace wherein no one needs to lose a father  husband or sonto violence.As host to the United Nations Regional Centre forPeace and Disarmament in Asia and the Pacific  Nepal25is strongly committed to enhancing the Centre'scontribution to peace and disarmament  and is fullyprepared to meet its obligation to house the Centre inKathmandu.The report (A/55/305) of the panel on the UnitedNations peace operations provides a wealth of ideas toput peacekeeping on a sound footing and to improvepeace and security in the world. My delegation agreeswith the tenor of the report  and will be willing toexamine it in greater detail as it comes up for closerscrutiny.A survey of the present trouble spots on earthwould lead us to one unmistakable conclusion: mostconflicts have poverty and exclusion at their root. Alltoo often  we tend to treat the symptoms  not the cause.Nepal strongly believes that a durable peace willcontinue to elude us as long as we do not eliminatedehumanizing poverty and deprivation. Prime MinisterKoirala aptly described at the Summit the vicious circleof poverty and conflict  and asked the worldcommunity to redouble its efforts to reduce poverty insearch of peace. That deserves serious consideration.Today more than one fifth of humanity lives onless than a dollar a day. Poverty  illiteracy and diseasesare rife in the poor countries. Unemployment amongyouth is rampant. A growing population finds itselfscrambling over shrinking resources in a stagnanteconomy  which has been the case in most developingcountries. The AIDS pandemic has become a majorscourge of the developing world  particularly in Africa.Unscrupulous leaders  often for narrow political gains fish in the troubled waters and incite violence  whichshatters the fragile economy further  making the nextcycle of violence inevitable and even more deadly.If we are ever to achieve lasting peace  we mustreduce poverty and build peace from there. Wesubscribe to the targets  suggested by the Secretary-General in his report (A/54/2000)  and adopted by theSummit  to reduce poverty and promote developmentin the developing countries. World conferences  oneafter another  have concluded that this is the only wayforward. A series of their mid-term reviews hasreaffirmed this conclusion; yet  sadly  nothing muchhas changed.In global forums  both North and South haveagreed to work together for accelerated growth anddevelopment in the South  to open the markets in therich countries to the products of the poor countries andto improve access of the developing countries totechnology in the advanced countries; to relieve thepoor countries of their debt obligations; and to promotesocial development and human rights. The globalcommitments are forgotten before the ink on themdries. We must narrow the gap between what we sayand what we do.Most advanced countries have  for instance sorely lagged in meeting their pledges of developmentassistance. More aid now means no need for it later.Nepal commends those rich countries that have met theaid targets  and urges others to do so. It is disturbingthat the United Nations funds and programmes  whichare the main sources of unconditional assistance  havebeen facing a decline in their resource base; we call onthe global community to replenish their fungibleresources.Although global trade has increased several timesin the last few years  the developing countries —especially  the least developed ones — are losingground as their share in world trade diminishes  duemainly to the declining terms of trade for them.Globalization has gained momentum as people  tradeand services move across borders at an exceptionalspeed. And information technology has opened a wholenew vista of communication  including e-commerce.Much as both of these phenomena have potentialbenefits for all  they have benefited some more thanothers  widening the disparity between the rich and thepoor. We believe that the wealthy countries  togetherwith the World Trade Organization  must work towardsmore equitable and rule-based trade to narrow theincome gaps  promote equitable globalization andbridge the digital divide.Countries in the South are sinking under theunbearable burden of foreign debt. While we appreciatethe Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt (HIPC)Initiative of the rich countries  we also urge them toexpedite its implementation and expand its scope tocover all the least developed countries and othercountries in serious difficulties  not of their ownmaking.Foreign direct investment has become a motor ofgrowth for a few  but the vast majority of developingcountries remain untouched by this new phenomenon.Understandably  markets drive investors in theirinvestment decisions  yet Nepal believes that ourdevelopment partners can encourage investors  through26a vigorous guarantee and incentive scheme  to invest inthose countries that have yet to see much foreign directinvestment.The unsustainable patterns of production andconsumption in the rich countries  together with thepopulation pressure in the poor countries  have taken ahigh toll of the environment  the common humanheritage. The global agreements to promote sustainabledevelopment and to reduce greenhouse gases remainlargely unfulfilled. As for Nepal  we have takenmeasures to preserve the environment throughestablishing norms  reducing pollutants  extending theforest coverage and building the green component intodevelopment projects. We are also studying the KyotoProtocol with a view to becoming a party to it.The least developed countries  particularly theland-locked ones like Nepal  are confronted with themost formidable challenges of development. Over theyears poverty in these countries has increased and theirshare of world trade has sharply declined. In Nepal  forinstance  more than 50 per cent of the people areilliterate and live below the poverty line. Lack ofaccess to the sea not only makes transportation difficultfor us  but also deprives us of sea-based resources.These disadvantaged countries therefore need specialmeasures to overcome their development constraints including better transportation facilities for the land-locked countries so that they can reduce poverty andjoin the global economic mainstream. We believe thatthe conference on the least developed countries to beheld in Brussels next year will open up a new vista ofcooperation for their development.Nepal hopes that the high-level event onfinancing for development next year will find reliablemeans for funding development in the developingworld. It must energize both North-South and South-South cooperation to fulfil shared objectives.As a functioning democracy  Nepal is committedto human rights and good governance. We have aGovernment that is accountable to people and pledgedto serve them best. As democracy  development andhuman rights reinforce each other  we strive to promotethem together so that people have the opportunity torealize their full potential. Nepal is a party to mosthuman rights instruments  and we hold the view thatcivil and political rights are as important as economic social and cultural rights — including the right todevelopment  for the healthy progress of society.Therefore we oppose any selective use of human rightsvalues to suit vested political interests.I also wish to report to the Assembly that Nepalhas recently freed the remaining few thousand bondedlabourers and established the National Human RightsCommission. During the Summit we also signed theoptional protocols to the Convention on the Rights ofthe Child  protocols on the sale of children and onchildren in armed conflicts.Today more than 22 million people have takenrefuge outside the country of their origin  and millionsare displaced within — sometimes because of naturalcalamities  but very often because of theirGovernments or because of terrorists. Nepal itself hasnearly 100 000 refugees from Bhutan; their presencehas created economic  social and environmentalproblems for us. Nepal believes that both State andnon-State actors must respect the human rights of theweak and vulnerable  including those of women andchildren.The security of small States has remained aperennial concern for us. During the cold war the fearwas of being trampled in the super-Power rivalry; inthe post-cold-war era the fear is that small States willbe economically  militarily or politically bullied if theyact in a manner that incurs the wrath of the strongerStates. It is saddening that even the United Nations isforced frequently to acquiesce to the designs of thepowerful. We urge the international community touphold the rule of law and the rich and powerfulcountries to respect the right of small States tosovereign independence  something they zealouslyguard themselves.Whenever there are problems anywhere on thelength and breadth of the planet  the United Nations iscalled on to inspire and act  without necessarily beinggiving the requisite resources. Since there is noalternative to the United Nations  we must revitalizeand reinforce it through comprehensive reforms so thatit can rise to the challenges of changing times. It isimperative to restore the primacy of the GeneralAssembly  which is the closest thing to a worldparliament  so as to bring the will of the peoples tobear on vital global policies.The Security Council reform process has draggedon for quite a while. Although there is no quick fix  norshould one be pursued  it is time to give reforms shapeand make the Council more representative in27composition  more transparent in function and morecapable of keeping peace. The Security Council  bydoing too little too late  has often proved part of theproblem  rather than of the solution. We must changeit.Now that the recent Summit has recognizedpoverty and social exclusion as the principal cause ofconflict  it is critical that we focus our attention onreinforcing the Economic and Social Council on a parwith the Security Council on economic matters. Wemust work towards making the Economic and SocialCouncil capable of coordinating the funds andprogrammes within the United Nations and with theBretton Woods institutions  the World TradeOrganization and other outside bodies.Nepal applauds the Secretary-General for thesilent and continuous revolution at the United Nationsin search of economy and excellence. Indeed  there is aconstant need to regenerate and reinvent the worldbody to attune it to the emerging challenges in achanging world.Sadly  the United Nations has to limp from oneyear to the next as some of the key contributors fail tolive up to their treaty obligations. We believe that thecardinal principle for apportioning financial obligationshould be the capacity to pay based on one's share ofworld gross national product  with specialresponsibility on the part of the permanent members ofthe Security Council in peacekeeping budgets. It ismorally indefensible to make the poorer countriessubsidize the richer countries to keep the UnitedNations and its peacekeeping activities going. We callon all Member States to pay their dues in full  on timeand without conditions.South Asia has one fifth of the world's people but lacks recognition and clout commensurate with itssize and potential. The only way for it to gain the placeit deserves is through regional cooperation. Yet we inthe region have not been able to work closely andcohesively for the greater good of our peoples. TheSouth Asian Association for Regional Cooperation isvirtually at a standstill. Nepal urges all fellow SouthAsian countries to work collectively for the sharedprosperity of our peoples. Time will not be kind to us ifwe fail to seize the opportunity."
"126",5309,"NRU",55,2000,"Mr. President  allow meto join previous speakers in congratulating you on yourassumption of the presidency of the fifty-fifth sessionof the General Assembly. Nauru  like yourGovernment  has full confidence in your ability toconduct the affairs the Assembly effectively andefficiently. Through you  Sir  Nauru congratulates theoutgoing President  His Excellency Mr. Theo-BenGurirab  Foreign Minister of Namibia  for a job welldone which climaxed with the successful andunprecedented Millennium Summit.The Republic of Nauru has just passed its firstanniversary as a Member of this esteemed Organizationwith a Permanent Mission in New York that is just ninemonths old. The admission of our brother island fromthe Pacific  Tuvalu  as the 189th Member of theOrganization  is a most welcome development. Onbehalf of my Government  I extend to Tuvalu our warmwelcome into the brotherhood of nations.My delegation commends the Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  and his team at the Secretariat fortheir well-crafted report entitled “We the peoples: therole of the United Nations in the twenty-first century”.The report has captured  in one document  the agonyand ecstasy of the United Nations as it journeyedthrough its triumphs and failures over the past 55 yearsof its existence.The purpose of our presence in this parliament ofthe peoples of the United Nations is not to bask in theecstasy of past achievements but to pledge anew ourcommitment and determination to face the problemsthat continue to confront humanity  and to support thelaunching of the United Nations on a new crusade toengage the tempestuous challenges encapsulated inchapter VII of the Secretary-General's report. Inconjunction with this  the heads of State orGovernment of Member States have mandated theAssembly  by their solemn act of adopting the outcomedocument  to implement the call for action.It is further encouraging to hear ForeignMinisters expound upon and reinforce thecommitments that their respective heads of State or22Government made at the Millennium Summit. It is nowfor the doers to deliver the goods  so to speak. It is herethat the greatest challenges lie. It is indisputable thatthe issues before us are not new but are unfinishedbusiness  and the most difficult on which to makeprogress. The problem is in the interaction betweenMember States for the purpose of delivering agreedinstruments that will act as platforms by whichMember States will be obligated to adopt andimplement at the national level.It is therefore my delegation's strong view thatour first priority is to revitalize and further strengthenthe foundation for collaboration and cooperationamong Member States on the one hand  and betweenthe United Nations and the appropriateintergovernmental organizations and non-governmentalorganizations on the other. That is  not only must weresolve to provide the United Nations with theallocated resources and processes to perform its taskseffectively  but we must also repair the negativeundercurrents and detrimental practices that inhibit theachievement of desired outcomes.In this regard  Nauru considers the followingactions to be necessary steps towards this goal.First  we must revitalize the work and restore theauthority of the General Assembly as the onlyuniversally representative body of the United Nations.Second  there is a need to address the ongoingmarginalization of the smaller and less affluentMember States.Third  we must expedite the reform of theSecurity Council. Nauru believes that an expansion inSecurity Council membership is the politically correctaction to take  and we urge participants and facilitatorsalike to expedite the work of the Working Group.Fourth  the preference for unanimity as the meansof deciding on issues under consideration is  in ourview  a major factor behind the delay in reachingagreed solutions and has on more than one occasionresulted in the dilution of outcomes. Setting such ahigh standard  when the principal organs of the UnitedNations come to decisions on a two-thirds majoritybasis  is self-defeating. Nauru takes the view that aunanimous outcome should be a target only  and not arule.Fifth  financial resources need to be shored up.The timely and unconditional payment of assessedcontributions will enable the United Nations todischarge its responsibilities in a timely manner.Voluntary contributions are also a very essential sourceof funds to support the work of the subsidiary bodiesand agencies through trust funds established under theUnited Nations. Nauru commends those Member Statesthat contribute to such trust funds over and above theirassessed contributions  and we also recognize andpraise the important contribution that private trustfunds such as the Ted Turner Foundation make to thework of the United Nations and its main agencies.Sixth  a number of covenants remain dormant dueeither to the lack of signatories to bring them into forceor to the lack of ratification by States that have signed.We thus call for all States to make a commitment tobringing outstanding international agreements intoforce.Seventh  the Secretary-General's reforminitiatives of 1997 must be brought to bear in theshortest time possible so that the limited resources ofthe United Nations are put to work more on theprogrammes of action and less on running theadministrative machineries. We urge that theSecretariat continue to review its operations on atimely basis as it strives to do more with less.The President of the Republic of Nauru  in hisintervention in the round-table discussion  expressedhis disappointment that the core responsibilities of theUnited Nations regarding the rights of peoples to self-determination and freedom from alien domination didnot rank as importantly as the other issues currentlybefore us. The fact that there are still 17 countrieslisted in the Special Political and DecolonizationCommittee  coupled with the non-settlement of long-standing disputes between States over their borders and the continuing existence of stateless people  maybe indicative of the priority that these issues receivewithin the United Nations.For Nauru  the continued refusal of the UnitedNations to deal with the plight of the millions ofChinese on the island of Taiwan is tantamount toavoiding its core responsibilities. By no stretch of theimagination could we be convinced that the Republicof China on Taiwan is a province of China. Nauru hasno doubt that the condition that unification should takeplace through “peaceful” means  adopted by the UnitedStates and its allies as part of their “one China” policy has helped maintain relative calm in the region. It is23incumbent upon the United Nations  under theappropriate Articles of the Charter  and theinternational community to find a lasting solution tothe problem. The United Nations cannot claim to be atruly universally representative world body as long asthe people of Taiwan continue to be excluded from thisOrganization.East Timor is a classic case of the United Nationsnot paying attention to the concerns of the Pacificregion. Undoubtedly  had the United Nations  throughthe Security Council  acted at the time it was promptedto do so by the Governments of the region  the humancarnage and immeasurable damage to property wouldhave been far less  and perhaps even avoidedaltogether.It is in this vein that Nauru is raising the matter ofWest Papua. Our head of State stated Nauru's positionon the issue in his intervention at the MillenniumSummit  and I will therefore not repeat it here.However  the Nauru Mission to the United Nations hasbeen instructed to take the necessary steps towardsputting together a resolution on West Papua's call for anew and democratically run referendum on thequestion of independence from Indonesia  in the spiritof the 1962 New York Agreement between theNetherlands and Indonesia. We ask for the Assembly'ssupport of this just cause.Flowing from these issues of security and peaceis the issue of the safety and survival of humankindfrom weapons of mass destruction  illicit trade in smallarms and light weapons and the pandemic of theHIV/AIDS virus. Despite the establishment of severalinitiatives by the United Nations in its effort to makeprogress on and expedite the question of disarmament it is sad to note that progress is at a snail's pace  duemainly to resistance by most nuclear-weapon States todisarm. In the Pacific region  which has been declareda nuclear-weapon-free zone by the Rarotonga Treaty the transboundary shipment of nuclear fuel and otherradioactive material in the waters of States parties tothe Waigani Convention are banned. Our effortsthrough the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)process  as well as bilateral and multilateral initiativesto protect our ecosystem and seas against accidentsfrom these shipments in the high seas of our region have been met with strong opposition by shippingStates that  unlike us  are not dependent on the sea andits ecosystem for their livelihoods.In this regard  Nauru supports the call by theSecretary-General to convene a special session of theGeneral Assembly to address the nuclear disarmamentissue  as we are not satisfied with the pace of progressin the other forums.At the other end of the scale  small arms and lightweapons obtained through illicit trade account formuch of the political  ethnic and criminal killings andhuman suffering that occur in the less affluentcountries of the world. The tranquil South Pacific hasnot been spared from this deadly trade. The UnitedNations will be convening the first Conference on theIllicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in Allits Aspects next year  and it is our hope that MemberStates will not put national political interests ahead ofthe desires of the international community to eradicatethis illegal and offensive activity.International efforts to contain the HIV/AIDSepidemic from spreading have not been successful inthe least developed and developing countries particularly in Africa. The prohibitive cost of treatmentand social attitudes are the major constraints that thesecountries face in combating the pandemic. We aresatisfied with the efforts of the United Nations tocombat the epidemic  efforts that are largely beingcarried out through the World Health Organization andthe Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS.However  it is obvious that the United Nations needsthe help of affluent countries to provide medicine andmedical experts in support of its efforts. In this regard Nauru has joined in the sponsorship of a draftresolution calling on the General Assembly to take upthe issue and deal with it under its authority.Poverty continues to be the major concern for thedeveloping world. The fact that the number of leastdeveloped countries is stagnant at 48  with thepossibility of another 3 countries being added to thelist  is testimony to the fact that current programmesare not working. The Secretary General's reportentitled “We the peoples” lists some ambitiousinitiatives to accomplish freedom from want forhumanity. We strongly endorse the call for setting time-bound goals in making resolute commitments to theworld's poorest and most vulnerable. Next year'sconference on least developed countries and financingfor development will be our first test since theMillennium Summit of our sincerity to move fromrhetoric to action on the important issue of povertyalleviation.24The Pacific is a region that demands specialattention. Projections by the Economic and SocialCommission for Asia and the Pacific estimate growthin the Pacific region to be only about 2 per cent duringthe next three years  as compared to around 6 per centfor the rest of Asia. My own country is expected toexperience several more years of negative growth  asour single resource and industry — phosphate —comes to the end of its natural life.Small island developing States  and the Pacificislands in particular  face special difficulties is makingthe transition to globalization. They will need time toadjust to changes in the external trade regime and tothe consequent changes in their economies. Ourparticular vulnerabilities should be recognized asjustifying special consideration to deal with such issuesas the global process of trade liberalization. Theremoval of special protective regimes continues tooccur.The South Pacific Applied GeoscienceCommission has been developing an environmentalvulnerability index with input from both the UnitedNations and the Commonwealth Secretariat. Nauru along with the other small island developing States inthe Pacific  is gratified at the support it has receivedfrom several developed countries to finance the projectto fruition. We urge that this work be incorporated intothe work of the United Nations  especially into thework of the Committee for Development Policy andthat of the Bretton Woods institutions.For all of us in the Pacific  the ocean is our majorresource. It provides us with food  income from thesale of fish stocks caught in our respective zones and through the natural cycle of evaporation andcondensation  it is also a vital source of our freshwater. It may also prove to be the source of the demiseof many low-lying Pacific islands from global warmingand the resultant rise in sea levels. The Rio Conferencein 1992 provided the foundations for internationalaction. The Montreal Protocol on Substances thatDeplete the Ozone Layer is an important step forward.But those responses may prove to be too few  toolittle and too late for many small islands. We urge thecommunity of nations to implement the 1997 KyotoProtocol. Nations and the private sector mustincorporate “green accounting” into their practices inorder to integrate the environment into economicpolicy. Suitable regulations and incentives need to bedesigned into the web of governance.Agenda 21 and the Barbados Programme ofAction continue to be the guiding principles for thesustainable development of our region and theprotection of our environments. My delegation ispleased to note that the World Bank has adopted muchof the relevant language in its programmes but it  andthe rest of the developed countries  need to commit tomaintain and  where possible  to expand overall levelsof support for small States' development  in terms ofboth advocacy and the provision of technicalassistance.Fishing offers the best hope for the futuresustenance of the smaller island countries that have nomineral resources and/or tourism to contribute to thenational treasury. Nauru therefore reaffirms theimportance of the sustainable integrated managementand conservation of living marine resources in theworld's oceans  and the obligations of States tocooperate to that end. We again call for an end tounsustainable and damaging practices  such as drift-netfishing  offshore dumping and high-seas pollution.Illegal  unreported and unregulated fishing is a threat tothe economic development of coastal States in thePacific  Caribbean and Latin American regions  whosenational incomes are heavily dependent on the exportof fish. The efforts by the United Nations to convenethe first open-ended informal consultative process onthe oceans and the Law of the Sea has enabled States toaddress those issues with a view to reporting thedeliberations of the consultation to the GeneralAssembly for its consideration and further action.Another area where small States  including ourown  have been successful in generating income for thenational treasury is in the provision of onshore andoffshore financial services. However  pressure has beenapplied by the Financial Action Task Force on MoneyLaundering and the Organisation for EconomicCooperation and Development (OECD) to blacklistcountries that do not meet the anti-money-launderingstandards of those international bodies. We understandand accept the need to have an anti-money-launderingregime  and many small island States have gone a longway to implement those requirements.For its part  the Government of Nauru recentlyissued a letter of commitment to the United NationsOffice for Drug Control and Crime Prevention to25undertake the United Nations minimum performancestandards on anti-money-laundering initiatives.Regrettably  the compliance level has been raisedunilaterally by the OECD to include harmful taxcompetition — which has nothing to do with money-laundering and other financial crimes. This is wrong ininternational law and violates both the letter and spiritof many United Nations resolutions regarding theintervention of international organizations in thedomestic jurisdiction of States. Such unilateral actionis not acceptable to Nauru.For the Pacific region  the question of theequitable representation of the 11 Pacific islandcountries in the bodies and commissions of the UnitedNations is of vital importance. Until 20 years ago  itmay have been reasonable to have Australia and NewZealand in the Group of Western European and otherStates and a handful of Pacific islands in the AsianGroup. However  with the increase in membershipsince that time  and the addition of a number of Pacificisland nations in recent times  it is incumbent upon theUnited Nations to review the groupings.Oceania is a distinct and internationallyrecognized region of the world. The Asian Grouppresently constitutes member countries from theMiddle East  Central Asia  China  Japan  the twoKoreas  the member countries of the Association ofSouth-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Pacificisland countries. The 11 Pacific island countries aredrowning in the Asian Group  while Australia and NewZealand  the godfathers of the Pacific island countries are marooned in the Group of Western European andother States.The parliaments of the ASEAN membercountries  Japan  the Republic of Korea and the Pacificisland countries are members of a regional body calledthe Asian-Pacific Parliamentarians Union. It is a well-recognized body in the various regional andinternational parliamentary forums. This model couldbe used as the basis for a new regional group within theUnited Nations  with the inclusion of Australia andNew Zealand. In our view  this new grouping wouldprovide the best opportunity for those Member Statesto be equitably represented in the work of the UnitedNations.In conclusion  Nauru would like to reiterate theimportance of Member States making concerted effortsto strengthen the fundamentals of multilateralism. Atthe same time  the United Nations must assert itsleadership role through the coordination of all keyplayers in keeping the peace and fighting poverty andtransboundary crimes  as well as with regard tohumanitarian initiatives  the protection of human rightsand the rights of the child  and in the fight againstinequity and inequality. Only through suchcollaborative efforts can we move the United Nationsin the direction that our leaders have agreed it must go."
"127",5356,"NZL",55,2000,"I begin by joiningothers who have congratulated you  Mr. President  onyour election. I also assure you of the New Zealanddelegation's full cooperation as you carry out yourimportant duties.I also welcome the admission last week of ourneighbour and friend Tuvalu into the United Nations.The admission of four new Pacific nations in the spaceof a year contributes to the truly universal character ofthe Organization.This general debate is taking place at the start ofa new century and a new millennium. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has called upon the MemberStates of the United Nations to harness the symbolicpower of the millennium to meet the real and urgentneeds of people in every part of the world. This is anappropriate time to recommit ourselves to the beliefs the values and the principles that led to the birth of theOrganization 55 years ago.Like many other Members of the Organization New Zealand is a small country that tries to take aprincipled and independent view of the world. In 1945 in San Francisco  we played an active part through theLabour Prime Minister of the day  Peter Fraser  inframing the Charter in which heads of State andGovernment reaffirmed their faith here last week.We have always viewed the maintenance ofinternational peace and security  and the practical taskof peacekeeping  as key roles of the United Nations.We are currently making our largest-ever contributionto the United Nations peacekeeping operation in EastTimor. This commitment underlines our full support forthe central role of the United Nations in building astable  democratic and economically viable East Timorin partnership with its people. So do the non-militarypersonnel and development assistance we haveprovided to help the East Timorese create essentialservices.Just over a year ago  the East Timorese peoplevoted overwhelmingly for an independent future  and Ihad the privilege of being part of the United NationsMission in East Timor (UNAMET) group that oversawthat electoral process. We recall the horrors whichfollowed as pro-integration militias laid waste to theterritory  slaughtered innocent people and forcedthousands of East Timorese into West Timor.Relative calm and stability has been restored inmost of East Timor  and we remember here today thesacrifices made by peacekeepers from Australia Bangladesh  Nepal and my own country who in recent24months laid down their lives to help achieve this. Butthe militias continue to hold sway in the border areasamong the refugees in West Timor. Unless broughtunder control  these militias will destabilize both Westand East Timor.The murder last week of three United Nationshumanitarian workers in Atambua in West Timorrepelled us all. New Zealand was able to respondquickly  along with Australia  to the United Nationscall for help in evacuating their colleagues and non-governmental organization personnel from Atambua.We committed helicopters with security and medicalelements from our forces serving on the border with theUnited Nations Transitional Administration in EastTimor (UNTAET). This airborne evacuation  which hadthe cooperation of Indonesian forces  was successful.But the pain and the outrage we feel at the murder ofthree United Nations humanitarian workers remainsundiminished.The Security Council  in its resolution 1319(2000)  insisted that the Government of Indonesiadisarm and disband the militia immediately to ensuresafety and security in the refugee camps and forhumanitarian workers  and to prevent cross-borderincursions into East Timor. It also called for those whohave carried out attacks on international personnel tobe brought to justice. These are binding obligations.The world awaits action to implement them withoutfurther delay.Besides East Timor  New Zealand is at presentcontributing to 12 other peacekeeping operations including in Kosovo  on the borders of Syria  Israel andLebanon  in the Prevlaka peninsula and in SierraLeone. New Zealand personnel also serve with thePeace Monitoring Group in Bougainville  theMultinational Force Organization (MFO) in Sinai andwith the Stabilization Force (SFOR) in Bosnia. Beingconscious of the many challenges faced by the UnitedNations in meeting its peacekeeping responsibilities we greatly welcome the Brahimi report. We trust thatthe report's important recommendations will receiveserious and expeditious consideration during thisMillennium Assembly session  with a view to theirearly implementation.As the Brahimi report points out  weak mandatesand poor resourcing underlie most of those operationswhich did not succeed in their objectives. We areconcerned too at the tendency to rely overly on“coalitions of the willing” to carry out operations thatshould be undertaken by the United Nations. Thefailure of some Member States to pay their assessedcontributions on time  in full and without conditionsimposes an impossible burden on the Organization andon troop contributors. We agree that the scale ofassessments for peacekeeping needs revision to make itmore equitable and transparent. Any revision must beestablished in accordance with the longstandingprinciple of apportioning expenses according toMember States' capacity to pay.Heads of State or Government agreed at theMillennium Summit to intensify their efforts to achievea comprehensive reform of the Security Council in allits aspects. In the past seven years of debate on thismatter  it has been shown just how difficult an issue itis  especially in regard to how the Council might beenlarged. There is no agreement on this aspect at thistime. And yet I am sure that most Member Stateswould agree that the Council must be made morerepresentative of today's membership as well as moretransparent in its working methods and moredemocratic in its decision-making. If there is to beprogress towards an overall package deal on reform then compromises will have to be made.At the heart of any reform  in New Zealand'sview  must be the curtailment of the veto  if indeed itcannot be eliminated. We have argued this case since1945  and we believe that it is even more relevanttoday. A device which 50 years ago might have had theutility of preventing the permanent members fromusing the Organization to make war on one another hasin recent times served to frustrate the will of the widermembership. I believe there is very broad agreement inthe General Assembly on the need to deal with the vetourgently  so that the Security Council can be moreeffective in carrying out its important responsibilities.I would not want to suggest that there has been noprogress at all on Council reform. There have  in fact been some major steps forward in opening up theCouncil's meetings and briefings to participation bynon-members. We are grateful for that. I would alsolike to reaffirm New Zealand's strong support for theOpen-ended Working Group on Security Councilreform  whose deliberations have contributed to thisprogress. In our view  the Working Group continues tobe the appropriate forum in which to pursue effortsaimed at reforming the Council  because it is essentialfor the health of the Organization that any reform25package enjoy the widest support and buy-in. Councilreform is too important a matter for back-room deals.The Millennium Declaration contains someimportant guidance on human rights  democracy andgood governance. For example  all countries areenjoined to strengthen their capacity to implement theprinciples and practices of democracy and respect forhuman rights  including minority rights. This could notbe more timely for my own region  the South Pacific where over the past year we have seen the collapse ofdemocracy and governance in some countries in theface of disputes over land and economic disparities andas a result of ethnic tensions.There are no easy solutions to some of theproblems the region faces  but one thing is clear  andthat is that the answer to these problems is not to adoptpolitical systems that discriminate against particularethnic groups  as some in Fiji this year have sought todo. To do so simply breeds a deeper sense of frustrationand exclusion  which is a recipe for further instability.Small States  especially small developing countries likeour neighbours in the Pacific  face particular challengesfrom globalization. They are uniquely vulnerable toexternal impacts. We need to find fresh and moreeffective means to development.It is essential to help countries build forthemselves inclusive and democratic forms ofgovernment that in turn take account of cultural values.Underpinning this must be robust and accountableinstitutions  respect for the rule of law  independenceof the judiciary  an effective press  strong civil societyand  above all  greater public education to foster amore widespread understanding of democratic valuesand processes.The Millennium Summit provided heads of Stateor Government the opportunity to take action on arange of treaties which are fundamental to thedevelopment of international human rights law andinternational humanitarian law. My Prime Ministertook action in respect of six  and I record here inparticular New Zealand's ratification of the OptionalProtocol to the Convention on the Elimination of AllForms of Discrimination against Women  the RomeStatute of the International Criminal Court  and the twoOptional Protocols to the Convention on the Rights ofthe Child.The practices of child prostitution  childpornography and the appalling exploitation of childrento fight wars are a disgrace and a crime againsthumanity which must be expunged. We encourageothers also to sign and ratify these agreements. I shouldalso add that we greatly welcome the recent decisionby the Economic and Social Council to establish aPermanent Forum on Indigenous Issues.At the Millennium Summit  world leaders agreedto strive for the elimination of weapons of massdestruction  particularly nuclear weapons. The outcomeof the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treatyon the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) inMay  where the five nuclear-weapon States gave anunequivocal political undertaking to accomplish thetotal elimination of their nuclear arsenals  demonstratesa new determination to achieve a world free of nuclearweapons. This is a matter of real urgency. We mustpromote the implementation of the new commitments.New Zealand  with its new agenda partners  will submita draft resolution during this session of the GeneralAssembly.New Zealand will also  in partnership with Brazil promote a southern hemisphere free of nuclearweapons. In addition  we will  along with Australia Mexico and Japan  urge all countries that have yet todo so to sign and ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. We will also support furtherpreparations for the United Nations Conference on theIllicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in AllIts Aspects and join calls for adherence to the OttawaConvention on the Prohibition of the Use  Stockpiling Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines andon Their Destruction.New Zealand urges caution regarding decisionson missile developments that could impact negativelyon nuclear disarmament  lead to a new nuclear armsrace or be inconsistent with the commitment to thetotal elimination of nuclear weapons. This is no timefor complacency. The United Nations disarmament andarms-control machinery must engage again innegotiations and other work on the new programme ofaction agreed at the NPT Conference.Leaders also declared their resolve to minimizethe adverse effects of United Nations economicsanctions on innocent populations. Sanctions are animportant tool at the Security Council's disposal toencourage compliance with its resolutions  but theymust be appropriately targeted for maximum effect.They should not impose blanket measures which harm26innocent populations and even strengthen the grip ofdespotic regimes. We support efforts within theOrganization to develop proposals for smarter  moreeffective sanctions which apply pressure where it wewill have maximum impact.The Millennium Declaration also speaks of theneed to protect our common environment. My PrimeMinister announced during the Summit our intention tobecome party to the Kyoto Protocol to the UnitedNations Framework Convention on Climate Change bymid-2002. I also wish to recall a particularachievement over the past year in the holding of theinaugural session of the United Nations Open-endedInformal Consultative Process on Ocean Affairs andthe law of the sea. This is a significant step forward inproviding an appropriate forum for discussion of cross-cutting oceans issues. The success of this processshould be judged by the extent to which there isenhanced global understanding of oceans issues and anincreased willingness to cooperate and coordinatecross-sectorally to address them.Finally  the Millennium Declaration sets somekey goals for development and poverty eradication andurges meeting the special needs of Africa. This year New Zealand was able to increase its core funding ofthe United Nations Development Programme by morethan a third and of the United Nations Children's Fundby almost a half. We believe that the United Nationshas a key role to play in the coordination of officialdevelopment assistance delivery. The preparations forthe event on financing for development are an excellentdemonstration of leadership by the Organization and asignificant step forward in furthering cooperation withthe Bretton Woods institutions. The crushing andseemingly never-ending debt burden  especially on thecountries of Africa  must be urgently reduced. We mustalso address more effectively the scourge ofHIV/AIDS.Leaders at last week's Summit provided thisMillennium Assembly with a clear direction and astrong mandate. Our countries have delegated us theresponsibility to realize that vision of a better worldand we must ensure through our efforts anddetermination that we do not fail them."
"128",5401,"OMN",55,2000,"I wish to extend to you Mr. President  my sincere congratulations on yourelection to the presidency of the fifty-fifth session ofthe General Assembly  the Millennium Assembly. Weare confident that your expertise and knowledge ofinternational issues are an outstanding asset that willenrich the deliberations of this session and help theAssembly reach a successful conclusion. We assureyou of our readiness to cooperate with you in fulfillingthe objectives to which we all aspire.I wish to extend our gratitude and appreciation toyour predecessor  Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  Minister forForeign Affairs of the friendly Republic of Namibia for the successful manner in which he steered the workof the previous session. That session was marked by agenuine desire to enhance and reinvigorate the work ofthe General Assembly.I would also like to take this opportunity toexpress our warmest appreciation to Mr. Kofi Annan Secretary-General of the United Nations  for hisstrenuous efforts and commendable endeavours topromote the role of the United Nations and thedevelopment of its organs  in order to cope withexpectations attached to the Organization in the thirdmillennium.The Sultanate of Oman welcomes the accessionof the Republic of Tuvalu to United Nationsmembership. We hope that its membership will enrichthe efforts of the international community to reach thenoble goals of this important international forum in amanner that satisfies the hopes and aspirations of allpeoples of the world.Our heads of State and Government have alreadydescribed our main concerns and preoccupations during18the Millennium Summit. They perceptively identified anumber of lofty values and principles that will guidepresent and future generations towards secure andstable living conditions based on cooperation andpeace. If this goal is to be achieved  we must remainfully committed to it.We bid farewell to a century  the memory ofwhich includes a host of calamities and humansuffering  due to both natural and man-made causes.That century was also marked by many bold andvisionary initiatives that greatly benefited humanity.This stage of the third millennium ischaracterized by great technological progress that hasopened vast horizons for development and prosperity.Yet the emerging international order  commonly calledglobalization  has created and increased economic social and political disparities at both the internationaland national levels. Globalization presents manyconcerns and challenges to developing countries sometimes with unpredictable results. This is a realhindrance to the growth and progress of developingcountries  limiting the effectiveness of their economicintegration into a globalized economy.We in the Sultanate of Oman supportglobalization. However  present indications andapproaches  stemming from the World TradeOrganization  point toward wealthy countries bandingtogether with the aim of using that Organization as atool to advance their own interests  to open the marketsof developing countries for their own trade and todeplete natural resources of developing countries regardless of any negative economic and social impact.One of the most important factors that led to thefailure of the Seattle Conference to achieve itsexpected conclusions was the aggregation of about 20countries within the Organization attempting to imposetheir philosophies on the entire world. This conduct isbased on an old doctrine of discriminatory policies andselectivity  which insinuates the presence of hiddendisputes among various countries. If the World TradeOrganization were to be transformed into a wrestlingarena  globalization and free trade would not then beable to meet the needs of developing countries.Furthermore  if developing countries are tosurvive and to uphold the basic rights of their citizens they must obtain their fair share of the fruits ofglobalization. It is necessary to enact laws andregulations and to honour agreements in an equalmanner that applies to all  because the dominance ofminority law contradicts the principles of goodgovernance. Therefore  it is incumbent upon us todevise new measures to assure the utilization of ever-growing technological progress so as to achieveprosperity and development for all.The international economy continues to prosperafter the setback of the 1997-1998 recession  followingthe economic crash of emerging markets. We need toredouble our efforts in order to avoid recurrence ofthis. When the G-8 countries met in Okinawa  Japan they were obliged to consider the problems of thedeveloping countries. The financial assistance offeredby the G-8 was itself vivid proof that advancedinformation technologies are designed in such amanner that they can be monopolized by some and notaccessed by others  except with great difficulty and atcolossal cost. However  we still welcome some of thedecisions of the Okinawa Summit  particularly thefinancial assistance pledged to combat certaindebilitating diseases.The decision of the G-8 to invite the Group of 77 for the first time  to its deliberations was not merely aceremonial event. It made the vast disparity that existsbetween developed and developing countries all themore tangible. The Okinawa Summit addressed theproblem of debt  which we believe should be totallyabolished  and reviewed the policies of theInternational Monetary Fund and international financialmechanisms. Among those policies  the fluctuation ofinternational currencies in particular has createddifficult economic conditions for developed countries let alone for countries with small economies that haveto trade their resources for hard currency.The stumble of the Asian economies occurredbecause of the power of the free market  and largelybecause of currency instability. The prosperityachieved by the Association of South-East AsianNations (ASEAN) during decades of dedicated workevaporated. Developing countries therefore have everyright to take all necessary precautions against therecurrence of a similar situation.Together with a number of other countries  theSultanate of Oman has played a constructive role inestablishing and launching the Indian Ocean RimAssociation for Regional Cooperation. It has done sobecause the countries of the Indian Ocean possessnatural resources and enjoy a geographic location19between three continents and because it is convinced ofthe importance of that region as a vital economic veinfor all its member States and their peoples. Thelaunching of this new Association to join the manyregional economic groupings that exist in the worldtoday is a manifestation of the firm desire of itsmember States to promote such a grouping  whichenjoys huge potential and looks forward to creating ahuge market.Based on my country's belief in the importance ofregional cooperation as a means to propel the wheels ofdevelopment and exchange expertise in different fields we are working on an agreement to establish a regionalcooperation group for fisheries in the Indian Ocean. Wehope that that initiative will soon see the light of day thereby bringing about many benefits in the service ofregional stability and development. In this context  welook forward to a pragmatic translation of theobjectives of the General Assembly Declaration of theIndian Ocean as a Zone of Peace.Since the dawn of the Omani renaissance  on 23July 1970  we in the Sultanate of Oman have embracedpeace and dialogue as basic principles. We areconvinced that dialogue is the natural foundation uponwhich all forms of conflict between States and peoplescan be resolved. Throughout history  mankind hasaspired to enhance confidence on the basis of agreedcreative ideas that deepen and widen common interestsand mutual benefits. We believe that dialogue  ratherthan conflict and confrontation  will always remain thesurest path to security and stability.The tripartite Camp David summit on the peaceprocess in the Middle East was an extremelysignificant political step and a display of uniquecourage by the summit participants. The summitimposed upon itself the task of discussing andnegotiating the fundamental issues of a final settlementin an unprecedented and distinguished manner particularly with regard to the future of Al-Quds Al-Sharif. We express our admiration for  and appreciationof  the historic role and great efforts made by thePresident of the United States  Bill Clinton. Despite thefact that the summit did not produce a final agreementbetween Palestine and Israel  it nevertheless opened thedoor for dialogue on the most complex issues.Significant progress has been achieved on those issues and the summit established an important understandingof the true scope of peace and the spiritual andemotional sentiments attached to it. It is now vital toconclude an agreement that will lay the cornerstone forlasting peace.In our view  there has been tangible and clearprogress regarding the positions and claims of eachparty as well as their capability to complete thenegotiations. We are confident that the continuation ofnegotiations and contacts between Palestinians andIsraelis  on all levels  is the proper and responsible wayto reach the desired objective of establishing a just comprehensive and lasting peace. We look forwardwith confidence to a second round of negotiationsbetween the Palestinians and the Israelis  with thecontinued sponsorship of the United States. Time hasbestowed upon all parties a historic opportunity to putin place a solid foundation for peace.We reiterate our full support to the Palestinianpeople and their rights to self-determination on theirland and to establish an independent Palestinian Statewith Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital. In order tostrengthen the pillars of peace and security in theregion  there is no other sovereignty possible in Al-Quds Al-Sharif except that of the Palestinian State. Weexpect the State of Israel to understand this fact  whichmeans that the sovereignty of the State of Palestineover Al-Quds Al-Sharif would also allow Israelis fullfreedom of access to worship and conduct their ritualsin peace and security.We strongly support the position of the sisterlySyrian Arab Republic concerning the restoration of itsland to the line of 4 June 1967. We encourage Israel toresume negotiations on this important track inaccordance with legitimate international principles andresolutions  particularly Security Council resolutions242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and the principle of land forpeace. Israel should not feel exposed to security threatsin the future because a peace founded on thoseprinciples  whether that peace be with Syria  Palestineor Lebanon  will build an effective relationship andpartnership that will serve the purposes of security andstability. This  by itself  is one of the most importantguarantees of mutual security and stability  especiallyif it is based on economic development within thecontext of globalization.Despite all serious international and regionalefforts to alleviate the suffering of the brotherly peopleof Iraq  the overall situation in Iraq continues todeteriorate as a result of the economic embargoimposed on that country over the last 10 years.20Therefore  we call for the establishment of amechanism to end the siege and to lift the embargo thathas undoubtedly done great harm to the people of Iraq.Despite the fact that sanctions regime wereintended as a political mechanism to guarantee thatGovernments fulfil their commitments in accordancewith United Nations resolutions  that mechanism hasnow become a weapon that harms the basic rights ofpeoples and societies. This clearly contradicts the letterand spirit of the Universal Declaration of HumanRights. Accordingly  we call upon the Security Councilto adopt new policies and effective mechanisms thatwill relieve the suffering imposed on States such asIraq  Libya and the Sudan.The Security Council  in accordance with itsresponsibilities as enshrined in the Charter  should playa positive and unifying role in the maintenance ofinternational security and stability  with the aim ofdeveloping new vision  for economic globalization.The mechanisms available to the Security Councilwith regard to Iraq are no longer positive tools. UnitedNations inspectors have exerted substantial efforts toeliminate weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and havedestroyed such known weapons. This could representsufficient grounds to review the situation once againand determine how to end this tragedy. Newmechanisms could be established that would enable theSecurity Council to continue monitoring Iraq'simplementation of relevant United Nations resolutionsonce economic sanctions have been lifted.We do not believe that it is justifiable to punish apopulation simply on the basis of fear and suspicion.The Security Council should protect the Iraqi peoplefrom the deterioration of their living conditions. TheUnited Nations has a historic responsibility tocooperate with Iraq in order to minimize the intensesuffering that could befall the people of Iraq in future.We look forward to Iraq's positive cooperation inclarifying the fate of the Kuwaitis who remain captiveinside Iraq.We deeply appreciate the efforts made by theSecretary-General in preparing his annual report. It isimportant to be willing to adopt a new vision for therestructuring of the United Nations  in particular theSecurity Council  as its principal organ  whose primaryresponsibility is the maintenance of international peaceand security. We should consider the expansion of itsmembership to promote equitable representation  andreassess United Nations activities in regions of conflictand tension  ensuring that there is no interference inStates' internal affairs.We fear that the United Nations could become adirect participant in regional conflicts  which wouldentail financial and moral obligations that it may not beable to fulfil.We have in the past emphasized the need forinternational cooperation  which the United Nationscan foster in support of regional organizations toachieve peace and development.The problems of the African continent areintensifying  and it is vital to uncover the causes ofthese problems. It is incumbent upon the internationalcommunity to work together and redouble its efforts ina positive and effective manner to resolve currentpolitical and social problems as well as amelioratedeteriorating health conditions. The United Nationsshould elaborate a solid plan in which all States wouldparticipate and contribute to the development of Africainstead of fighting for control of its wealth.We are facing real challenges  which we must beprepared to confront with courage if we are to focus onall aspects of development. We are in need of a newcentury and a new millennium marked by a soundbalance between material values and humankind'slegacy of ethical and spiritual values. We are in need ofa world in which the strong sympathize with the weakand help them out of their plight. We need a plan ofaction to increase the standard of living of all peoplesthroughout the world."
"129",5447,"PAK",55,2000,"Mr. President  it gives megreat pleasure to join preceding speakers in offeringyou the Pakistan delegation's warm felicitations onyour election. We pledge to you our wholeheartedcooperation in your efforts dedicated to the success ofthis historic fifty-fifth session of the GeneralAssembly.I also take this opportunity to pay tribute to theleadership of the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan.His commitment and dynamism have reinforced therightful role of the United Nations in addressing thechallenges of our times.The millennial transition is unique in the lives ofthose fortunate to witness it. We are fortunate  too  thatwe start this session in the glow of the MillenniumSummit. We shall be inspired in our work by theringing commitment of our leaders to values andprinciples fundamental to the maintenance of peace andsecurity; by the resolve of our leaders to free peoplesfrom the scourge of war  on the one hand  and to freehumanity from dehumanizing poverty  on the other.Their determination to protect the environment promote human rights  democracy and goodgovernance  and to meet the special needs of Africa will be our guide and mandate in our deliberations.It will be our duty at this and future sessions ofthe General Assembly  to translate the Millennium13Declaration into action. This is no doubt a difficultchallenge. But it is a challenge we must meet. Onlythus can we contribute to the building of a future betterthan the past.To all these ends — at once necessary as well asnoble — our leaders pledged to spare no efforts tomake the United Nations a more effective instrument ofinternational cooperation.What is needed  if I may borrow an apt phrasefrom the Secretary General's report  is a strongercommitment to action — action to achieve peace  andaction to achieve development.Each of our States can and must take action onboth fronts. But individual efforts cannot achieveoptimum results. All of us need to work withdedication and a strong sense of commitment in acooperative and harmonious environment to promotethe twin objectives for a better future.The Millennium Declaration emphasizes thedetermination of world leaders to save peoples fromthe scourge of war. Also the Secretary General's reporthighlights peace and security as:“a central objective of the United Nations at thedawn of the twenty-first century  as it was whenthe Organization was founded over half a centuryago”. (A/55/1  para. 29)The problem is how to prevent war and achievepeace. The solution is not difficult to find. What isneeded is a stronger commitment to action. Given thatcommitment  crises and conflicts can be prevented andpeace can be achieved. Peace not merely possible; it isrealizable through a civilized approach to conflictresolution based on justice and international law andthe principles of the Charter  the United Nations canensure effective remedial action to maintain peace andsecurity.People watched with relief as the worldcommunity joined together to prevent genocide inBosnia and Kosovo. With the commendablecooperation of the Government of Indonesia and theimaginative contribution of the Secretary-General  weapproached the situation in East Timor in a similarway. The imaginative and diligent efforts of thePersonal Envoy of the Secretary-General  AmbassadorJamsheed Marker  to promote the settlement in EastTimor are a matter of pride for the people of Pakistan.These are all examples of how the United Nations andthe international community can and should act toaddress conflicts by implementing its principles anddecisions.In the Middle East  too  the peace process hasmade steady  if agonizingly slow  progress. For thegains so far made  tribute is due to the idealistic effortsof the peacemakers and the realistic approach of thePalestinian and Israeli leaders. The residual issues aredifficult and delicate  involving as they do principles oflaw and equity on the one hand  and deep emotions onthe other. Yet we ardently hope that the peace processwill succeed soon. Final settlement of the Palestinianquestion will be a crowning achievement and amomentous contribution to peace in the Middle East.Security Council resolutions 242 (1967)  338(1973) and 425 (1977) are imbued with anirreplaceable international sanctity. Theirimplementation involves the prestige and credibility ofthe United Nations. An end to occupation and thereversion of holy Jerusalem to Palestinian sovereigntywill ensure reconciliation and durable peace in theMiddle East.The Kashmir question  involving the life andfuture of the people of the State  has been the rootcause of tensions in South Asia since 1947. Itssettlement is an indispensable condition for peace andstability. The ten million people of that State will notbe denied their right to freedom. They seek nothingmore than the fulfilment of the commitments containedin the resolutions of the Security Council. Their rightto decide their own future cannot lapse. The passage of53 years has only compounded the tragedy of theKashmiri people and prolonged their travail. The longdelay has only heightened the terrible dangers inherentin the festering dispute.According to the All Parties FreedomConference  72 000 Kashmiris have been killed since1989. Thousands more have been tortured and maimedor have disappeared. The massive human rightsviolations in Kashmir  and the repression and brutalityperpetrated on the Kashmiri people by occupationforces  are a grave crime of State terrorism.In a desperate attempt to undermine and suppressthe Kashmiri Freedom Movement  the perpetrators ofrepression and violence against the Kashmiri peoplehave tried to portray the freedom struggle as terrorism.Such propaganda did not carry credibility in the pastand it cannot do so now. It is familiar to all those who14have won freedom after protracted struggles againstcolonialism and foreign occupation.Pakistan has consistently vowed to seek apeaceful settlement of the Kashmir dispute. Two yearsago  the Security Council once again emphasized theneed to resolve the dispute  which has been the sourceof tension and conflict in the region. The provisions ofArticle 33 of the Charter place an obligation onMember States to settle disputes through recourse tonegotiation  inquiry  conciliation  mediation  arbitrationor adjudication. Each and every one of these means isacceptable to Pakistan. Faced with the intransigentrejection of peaceful means  the Security Council has aresponsibility to act. The Charter empowers theSecurity Council to do so. What is needed is a strongercommitment to action. In its absence  mere talk ofcrisis prevention and dispute resolution will lackcredibility.Afghanistan remains trapped in a terrible tragedy.Its protracted war of liberation in the 1980s left itdevastated. The internecine war in the 1990s hasinflicted further ravages. The economy of the countryis in shambles. Drought in southern Afghanistan thispast year has added to the misery of the people of thisancient land.Tied to the Afghan people by bonds of geography history and culture  the people of Pakistan view thetragedy in Afghanistan with a deep sense of sympathy.Despite economic stringency  we continue to provideshelter to 1.5 million Afghan refugees. The interruptionof the food supply from  or via  Pakistan would furtheraggravate hardship and trigger a fresh influx. That iswhy Pakistan is opposed to sanctions that hurt people.No people except the Afghan people themselveshave suffered more from the conflict and instability inAfghanistan than the people of Pakistan. It is naturaltherefore that Pakistan should support all efforts forpeace and reconciliation in Afghanistan. We wereencouraged to note a similarity of approaches by theForeign Ministers of the six contiguous countries  theRussian Federation and the United States at the “Six-plus-Two” group meeting convened on 15 Septemberby the Secretary-General. Pooling our resources andinfluence  we should make more energetic efforts topersuade the Afghan parties and assist the Secretary-General of the United Nations in his efforts to promotea broad-based Government acceptable to the Afghanpolitical parties and ethnic groups.We support the Islamic Republic of Iran as itleads a parallel effort for peace in Afghanistan onbehalf of the Organization of the Islamic Conference(OIC). We also appreciate the efforts recentlyundertaken by Turkmenistan. In our view  all theseefforts complement and reinforce each other.In his report on the work of the Organization(A/55/1)  the Secretary-General referred to the influxof war materiel to Afghanistan from outside. Pakistanurges not only a ceasefire but also a ban on the supplyof military equipment to the Afghan parties and theestablishment of a monitoring mechanism for itsenforcement. We also remain cognizant of theimperative of respect for sovereignty. The Afghanpeople have a history of fierce resistance againstoutside interference. Engagement with the AfghanGovernment offers better hope for amelioration thanattempts to drive it into a corner and isolate it. TheUnited Nations has been providing humanitarian reliefin Afghanistan. Programmes aimed at rehabilitationand reconstruction may help bring the country backinto the international mainstream sooner. That is alsothe more compassionate way.Pakistan  itself a victim of terrorism  condemnsthat evil in all its forms and manifestations  whethercommitted by individuals  groups or States. OurGovernment has ratified nine international conventionsagainst terrorism and we join all international efforts tocombat this menace.Pakistan has historically supported all proposalsand agreements aimed at the limitation  progressivereduction and eventual elimination of weapons of massdestruction. For over a quarter of a century we madeefforts and initiated proposals to keep our area free ofnuclear weapons. Also  Pakistan has been prepared tosupport universal and non-discriminatory measures andproposals. Pakistan voted in favour of theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty in 1996 andintended to sign it along with all others  especially thedesignated States. The process of bringing that Treatyinto force was derailed due to events not of our ownmaking. Even then  Pakistan was not the first toconduct tests in 1998. Pakistan will not be the first toresume them. We still hope the Treaty can be broughtinto force. Pakistan will not obstruct the realization ofthat aim. Our Government continues efforts to builddomestic consensus in favour of signing the Treaty.15Meanwhile  restraint and responsibility remainthe guiding principles of our nuclear policy. Pakistanwill not enter into any nuclear arms race. Our sole aimis to retain minimum credible deterrence. I wish toreaffirm in this Assembly that our nuclear capability isonly meant to deter aggression against Pakistan; itposes no threat to any country.We support efforts aimed at the prevention of thevertical or horizontal proliferation of nuclear weapons.During the past year we have further strengtheneddomestic regulations against export of nuclearequipment or materials. Our power reactors are underinternational safeguards.Pakistan is prepared to cooperate in efforts tointroduce restraints on the development  productionand deployment of ballistic missiles. To be successful however  such efforts must be non-discriminatory.Their aim must be stabilization of the situation.Any use of nuclear weapons is inconceivable.However  the Charter obliges Members to refrain fromthe threat or the use of any force. The worldcommunity should  therefore  emphasize no-first-use offorce  nuclear or conventional.At the global level  Pakistan supports calls for thecontinued observance of the Anti-Ballistic MissileTreaty. The militarization of outer space would be adisservice to hopes for the maintenance of existingrestraint and stability.Pakistan will participate in negotiations on theproposed fissile material cut-off treaty and make apositive contribution to evolving a fair and an equitabletext that all countries can support.In his address to the Millennium Summit  theChief Executive of Pakistan  General PervezMusharraf  stated:“The best assurance for the consolidation ofglobal peace lies in the economic developmentand prosperity of all regions and all peoples.Economic progress in one region supports andcomplements prosperity in the other.” (A/55/PV.4)Development is not a zero-sum game.Accordingly  the Millennium Declaration commitsworld leaders to“making the right to development a reality foreveryone” (resolution 55/2  para. 11) and freeingthe entire human race from want.Globalization raised hopes  as it offeredopportunities for faster economic growth  higher livingstandards and accelerated benefits from the flow ofknowledge and technology. But there have beendisappointments. Experience has shown that thebenefits of globalization have been uneven and that thenumber of people living in poverty has actuallyincreased. Technological and information revolutionshave accentuated global inequality  and a new digitaldivide has led to the marginalization of a large numberof developing countries.Global trade regimes benefit the rich  and theSouth has become poorer. Competition  standards  avariety of non-tariff barriers  increasingly complextrading practices  protectionism in selected sectors suchas agriculture  and restrictions on technology transfersall militate against the interests of the developingcountries. They find it hard to secure adequate returnsfor their products or to attract investment to improvetheir competitiveness. As a result  economic disparitiesare widening. This belies the promise of free marketsto ensure the well-being of all.The failure of the World Trade Organizationmeeting in Seattle last November and dissenting voicesheard in Washington last April make it clear that theinternational economic system needs to be fixed.Concerted global action is required for sustaineddevelopment to benefit and protect weaker economies.The industrialized countries have a specialresponsibility to adopt bold initiatives. Professions of adesire for the eradication of poverty must first lead tothe establishment of an international economic policyframework responsive to the needs of the developingcountries.One important area is the debt issue. In one of theinteractive dialogues the Secretary-General proposedthat the United Nations could mediate betweencreditors and debtors to address the debt problem. Wewelcome this proposal. Our Chief Executive  speakingat the same meeting  suggested that developingindebted countries should be allowed to utilizeresources allocated to debt servicing for thedevelopment of the social sector  especially educationand health care. Substantive debt relief throughinnovative approaches will go a long way to helpdeveloping countries ensure global harmony andregenerate a new economic partnership between theNorth and the South.16A holistic approach to deal with problems ofdevelopment and poverty eradication is necessary.While we welcome the Secretary-General's initiative tobridge the digital divide  the emphasis must remain onaddressing mass literacy  capacity-building infrastructure and basic health facilities. Similarly multilateral trade regimes should be development-oriented. Environmental concerns about the prudentuse of natural resources must be pursuedsimultaneously with emphasis on sustained economicgrowth in the South.The High-level International IntergovernmentalEvent on Financing for Development  which will beheld next year  must involve the world's finance  tradeand development organizations in discussing the issuescomprehensively. The conference should promote goodgovernance at the international level. It must addresshow we can manage globalization appropriately so thatits benefits reach everyone  ensuring universalprosperity.The upsurge of democracy in the past decade hasbeen a good omen for the start of the new millennium.This salutary trend can only be sustained throughequitable economic development. Unless thedeveloping nations are able to have a fair share inrising levels of global prosperity  the advocacy ofdemocratic values and human and social standards willremain hollow.In Pakistan we are addressing the challenges ofboth economic revival and institutional reforms thatemphasize accountability  good governance and thedevolution of power to grass-roots levels politicalinstitutions. In this endeavour  the Government isbanking on the support and enthusiasm of our people.We believe that democracy is  first and foremost empowerment of the people  based on stronginstitutions.The world community is well aware of theravages inflicted on fragile economies of developingcountries and their poor people as a result of corruptionand the transfer of illegal funds to safe havens abroad.They are often the worst victims of such malpracticedue to socio-economic forces within and bankingpractices outside their countries.The welfare of humanity in developing countriesdemands international cooperation for the preventionof corruption. Such cooperation was urged inresolutions 53/176 of 15 December 1998 and 54/205 of22 December 1999. The South Summit  held in Havanain April 2000  also requested remedial action.Transfers of illicit funds from developingcountries will not make the rich countries much richer but they will make the poor countries poorer. It is aparadox that some rich countries have such lax lawsthat they provide safe havens and encourage privatebanks to launder illicit funds looted by corrupt personsfrom poor countries by facilitating the establishment ofsecret accounts. That is tantamount to theencouragement of plunder  indeed  of financialterrorism.The nexus between corruption and the failure ofdemocracy was recognized also in the FinalDeclaration issued by the meeting of the Community ofDemocracies in Warsaw  held from 25 to 27 June 2000.It emphasized the need to combat corruption  whichcorrodes democracy. We need  therefore  to takeeffective action. We propose that the General Assemblyshould proclaim a policy of zero tolerance of all typesof corruption and urge a ban on the laundering of illicitfunds.The United Nations has emerged as the onlyforum with the universal recognition and authority toaddress the entire spectrum of issues relating to humanaspirations for peace  justice and development. To meetthese growing expectations  this world body must bestrengthened. Its role must be reinforced in order toensure a better future for the world.We support the call for enhancing the capacity ofthe United Nations in the areas of conflict preventionand peacekeeping. In this regard  we commendMr. Brahimi and members of the high-level Panel fortheir extensive report. As an important participant inUnited Nations peace-keeping operations  we inPakistan look forward to discussions on the usefulideas and concepts that have been presented in thereport to enable the United Nations to respond moreeffectively to existing and incipient conflicts andthreats to international peace and security.No other aspect of reform of the United Nationsmerits as close attention as the need to make theSecurity Council more democratic  transparent andaccountable. Periodic elections of a larger number ofmembers will make the Security Council not only morerepresentative but also more responsive to theaspirations of the world community. That will enhancethe capacity of this vital organ to contribute to the17maintenance of international peace and security and tothe realization of the purposes of the Organization.That objective will not be achieved by the creation ofnew centres of privilege which detract from thecardinal principle of the sovereign equality of States.For the same reason  the decision-making processneeds to be made more democratic.For the Security Council to command universalrespect  its reform should have the general agreementof the membership. Nothing should be done in haste orin a manner that divides the membership or impairs theauthority and prestige of the Council.In this increasingly interactive world  we sharewith other nations the desire for a peacefulenvironment and mutually beneficial cooperation  andwe see a pivotal role for the United Nations. Theuniversality of the United Nations gives it a stature andlegitimacy that is unprecedented in history. TheOrganization should begin the twenty-first century bydemonstrating a clear commitment to addressing andresolving the key development and security challengesfacing our peoples. It must be enabled to apply itsimmutable principles and its decisions consistently andforcefully to ensure durable peace  sustained economicprogress and a better future for all humanity."
"130",5490,"PAN",55,2000,"Allow me to convey to you  Mr. President  the warmcongratulations of Her Excellency  Mireya Moscoso President of the Republic of Panama  together withthose of her Government and the people of my country on your election to serve as President of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-fifth session. Your designation toguide the debates in this forum is highly gratifying tothe Panamanian delegation  not only because of yourown brilliant political record and your well-knowndevotion to the well-being of the Finnish people  butalso because of the noble way in which you hererepresent the lofty ideals of sovereignty and universalcooperation in pursuit of world peace  sustainablehuman development  human rights  democracy andjustice — traditional mainstays of Finland's foreignpolicy and of the activities of the United Nations.Panama shares with so many other States Members ofthe Organization your concern to put these ideals intopractice  and that is what I shall be addressing today inmy statement.I am also glad to pay tribute to  and express mygratitude for  the activities of the Secretary-General 7Mr. Kofi Annan  who has devoted particular effort inthe last year to the maintenance of international peaceand security  the reform of the Organization  and thepromotion of human rights  gender equality and theenjoyment of the rights of the child. Panama sharesthese and other concerns of the Secretary-General.Indeed  as the other members of the Ibero-Americancommunity are aware  upon an initiative of PresidentMireya Moscoso announced at Havana in Novemberlast year  the next Summit of Heads of State andGovernment of Ibero-America  which will take placeshortly in Panama  will be dedicated to discussing theproblems facing children and young people in ourregion. In the preparations for this meeting  whichPanama has undertaken with the greatest enthusiasm the national Government has received the support oforganizations devoted to the well-being of the world'schildren and young people. These include the UnitedNations Children's Fund (UNICEF) — a UnitedNations agency which has selected Panama as its newregional headquarters and to whose noteworthyactivities  in fulfilment of its mandate  I am glad to paytribute on this occasion — together with agenciesresponsible for promoting culture  particularly theculture of peace  including the United NationsEducational  Scientific and Cultural Organization(UNESCO)  another United Nations agency which hasdone extremely valuable work in promoting universalunderstanding through education  technology andcommunication.With respect to gender equality  we are glad to beable to state that in recent years our country has madesignificant progress  particularly with respect to thepolitical participation of women. Indeed  since1 September last year a woman has guided the destinyof our nation. From January this year our SupremeCourt of Justice has been presided over by a woman.During the review conference on women held in thecontext of the special session of the General Assemblyin June 2000  the delegation of Panama signed theOptional Protocol to the Convention on the Eliminationof All Forms of Discrimination against Women  whichmakes it possible to have recourse to an internationalbody in case of the denial of such rights. Furthermore Panama has made significant improvements in accessfor women to education and health. However  muchstill remains to be done  particularly with respect toequal access to economic resources. In this area  whichis closely bound up with sustainable humandevelopment  my country hopes to make significantadvances  particularly through internationalcooperation.On this point  international cooperation  I shouldlike to share some brief thoughts and place them beforethis distinguished body for consideration. More than 40years ago one of my predecessors in the post ofMinister for Foreign Affairs  Dr. Miguel J. Moreno addressed this General Assembly on the topic ofinternational cooperation for development. On thatoccasion Minister Moreno stated:“Economic development  and internationalcooperation for the attainment of suchdevelopment  are not only necessary if worldpeace is to be achieved  but also representimportant means of cementing it and making itdurable.” (A/PV.749  para. 176)Dr. Moreno added:“Social tranquillity and national political stabilitydepend on economic development and on thebenefits which the peoples derive therefrom  asdo also a better understanding among the nationsand international harmony; all these areindispensable for world peace.” (A/PV.749 para. 178)These wise words are as true today as they werewhen they were uttered at the thirteenth session of theGeneral Assembly in 1958. It is this wisdom that hasguided the renewed emphasis that the United Nations in the last decade and through its United NationsDevelopment Programme (UNDP)  has placed on thepromotion of sustainable human development. Thisconcept is the axis and basis of our President'sgovernmental plan. Our Government recognizes thatwithout measures to promote human development economic growth can make no sense and have nomeaning.Although it may be boosted by economic growth human development is much more than economicgrowth  for human development means enhancing thecapacities of human beings as individuals and asmembers of the community by measures that provideaccess to emancipating education and to better healthand transport services  measures to permit participationin an economy and a culture that respects humandignity  that encourage the prudent use of naturalresources  and foster and enlarge the exercise of the8fundamental duties and rights of the human individual.Given this multidimensional nature and thePanamanian Government's concern to work towardssustainable human development and to promote humanrights  the Panamanian delegation expresses itssatisfaction at the contents of the latest UNDP humandevelopment report  which considers the link betweenhuman rights and human development. The reportexplains that human freedom is the common purposeand the common motivation of human rights andhuman development.In the years that have elapsed since our return toconstitutional government our country has madesignificant advances. Under our Government we havebegun a process of repealing legislation that restrictsfreedom of expression and we have invited the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights  a significantregional agency  to assist us in promoting theenjoyment of human rights in Panama. Also recently through a process of cooperation involving the majorpolitical movements in the country  we have adoptedby consensus the basic elements of a Panamaniansecurity policy based on the doctrine of humansecurity  an extremely important component ofsustainable human development. That doctrine upholdsindividual and grass-roots communities as constant clear-cut points of reference for the responsibilities andpurposes of the State's security strategy  and is basedon taking preventive measures designed to reducevulnerabilities and minimize the risks threatening theopportunities and rights of individuals and ofcommunities. I am particularly gratified to be able tostate that Panama is one of the few countries to haveadopted the human security doctrine as a State policy.We hope that this will be a matter for more in-depthdiscussion and analysis at the next Summit of theAmericas to be held in June 2001 in Quebec  Canada.In the context of this and other aspects ofsustainable human development and the exercise ofhuman rights  Panama firmly believes in internationalcooperation and has recourse to it in order to promotethe lofty objectives that are the inspiration for StatesMembers of the United Nations. At the recentMillennium Summit  whose purpose was to set a clearcourse for the United Nations in the twenty-firstcentury  Panama  among other things  called for StatesMembers to return to the pursuit of the original spiritof the Charter of the United Nations. Pursuant to thisrequest  it is our hope that the members of the SecurityCouncil will assume the obligation of representing thegeneral interests of the international community insteadof acting according to their individual strategic militaryor political interests. The general interest of theMembers of the Organization indicates that the timehas come to engage in debate and reach someconclusion as to the way in which we can expand thenumber of permanent and non-permanent members ofthe Security Council while restricting and regulatingthe use of the veto. We have expressed our agreementwith the need to reform the Charter of the UnitedNations in order to achieve this objective and others provided such reform is based on the principles ofdemocracy and equitable geographic participation.Panama wishes here and now to reaffirm itscommitment to the principle of self-determination ofpeoples  articulated in the Charter of the UnitedNations  and to the use of mechanisms for the peacefulsettlement of conflicts. The dangerous disputes whichriddle and split our world from the China Sea to theMagreb  and which may degenerate into domestic ortransboundary outbreaks of violence  must beaddressed with a sense of urgency by the UnitedNations. This would be possible within a structured conflict-prevention programme that provided forspecialized support to nations to guide them and assistthem in a fair and orderly  peaceful negotiation of theirinterests. Accordingly  we recommend recourse to themoral and technical presence of the United Nationswithin such processes  engaged in by small States besetby hostile Powers  or by racial or religiousintolerances. Likewise  we recommend recourse to theUnited Nations in support of negotiations onreunification or self-determination that other peoplemay wish to embark upon  with the aim of preserving aprosperous  democratic way of life or of securing forthemselves the benefits of development.The Republic of Panama nowadays is a fullysovereign State glad to have recovered the exercise ofsovereignty throughout its national territory  and tohave proved its resolve and ability to fulfil thecommitments stemming from its participation in thisgreat international community. Panama has the will andthe capacity not only to administer efficiently andtransparently its greatest asset  the Panama Canal  butalso to cope successfully with the growing demands for9international maritime traffic and to ensure the securityof our inter-oceanic waterway.The Canal and the reverted lands will be thedriving force behind the development of thePanamanian economy in coming years. Among otherlarge-scale projects  we are now executing theextension of the Culebra Cut  a $1 billion investmentthat  once completed in the year 2001  will permitsimultaneous passage of Panamax vessels through thissection of the Canal. Once this work is completed projects will be begun to expand the Canal's waterbasin. Moreover  consultations and studies are underway with a view to building the third set of locks which will make it possible for the inter-oceanicwaterway to be used by post-Panamax vessels and willincrease the efficiency of the Canal by 25 per cent. Allthis will benefit world trade. Lastly  in the coming yearbidding will be opened for the construction of a secondbridge over the Canal in order to help unite our land which is currently divided by the Canal.In the lands recovered and now devoted tonational development  former military installations ofall kinds have been expertly retooled for commercialcivilian use. Among other things  the former Albrookair base has become a centre for domestic air and landtransport; the former School of the Americas has beenconverted into a hotel of the Meliá international chain with its own convention centre; the Coco Solo militarybase  which enjoys a unique location at the Atlanticmouth of the Canal  today houses the internationalmaritime cargo ports of Manzanillo and Coco Solo which complement the international port of Balboa onthe Pacific  all interconnected by a trans-isthmus railsystem for container transport; and in the forts ofDavis  Corozal and Cocol'  processing centres are nowbeing developed for exports  with the backing ofinternational capital.With input from the International FinancialCorporation  studies are being undertaken to convertthe Howard air base into a multifunctional air and seacargo centre for the Pacific side of the Canal. Thedevelopment of the Sherman base  which is a genuineecological gem  seeks to link the protection of thecountry's historical patrimony and environment witheconomic development. Fort Clayton is now the baseof an educational and industrial complex known as theCity of Knowledge  where the regional office of theUnited Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) for thehemisphere will be located. The City of Knowledge isalso home to regional campuses of Texas A & M andMcGill Universities and a continental-level regionalcentre for human rights. All of this will contribute tothe Government's plan to make Panama a centre ofinternational agencies.In order to take full advantage of internationalcooperation  Panama has adopted a policy ofstrengthening its links with the various majorinternational organizations  including those that arepart of the United Nations system. In this way we arestriving to move forward and contribute to worldwidepeacemaking by converting former military bases intocivilian and commercial areas that will enhance worldpeace.This is an appropriate occasion to place on recordthat Panama categorically rejects the actions of theOrganisation for Economic Cooperation andDevelopment (OECD)  which has unilaterally devisedtaxation standards that its members are trying toimpose outside their jurisdiction  in open violation ofresolutions of the General Assembly. On this point Panama is grateful for the support of the majorityleader of the United States House of Representatives who on 7 September wrote to the United StatesSecretary of the Treasury  Mr. Lawrence Summers strongly condemning this action. There is a need for acareful examination of the flight of billions of dollarsin capital from developing countries to the financialinstitutions of the first world which are trying totighten the so-called qualifications that are used toexert pressure  with obvious objectives.Panama is committed to the fight against thelaundering of money stemming from drug traffickingand other unlawful activities. We believe that allcountries should work together to eliminate thisscourge. This effort should be carried out throughlegitimate mechanisms of international institutions thatare representative not only of the industrialized Northbut also of the emerging countries of the South  such asthe United Nations and the various regionalorganizations.In the spirit of international cooperation  to whichI previously referred  and in consideration of the mostbasic concepts of justice  we are today calling for thecooperation of the General Assembly in resolving adispute between Panama and the United States ofAmerica  as a result of the bases operated by the armedforces of that country on our territory throughout the10last century. In this forum  in September last year  ourPresident stressed her confidence that the outstandingdifferences surrounding this issue that still persistedbetween Panama and the United States would beresolved satisfactorily in a reasonable period of time.Unfortunately  despite the efforts and goodwilldisplayed by the Panamanian Government thesedifferences have still not been settled.In his powerful report entitled “We the peoples:the role of the United Nations in the twenty-firstcentury”  and with respect to certain matters relating totrade  the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  proposesthat States Members follow a line of conduct consonantwith environmental and human rights standards. Healso urges States to fulfil their obligations vis-à-visuniversal values and the common standards that haveemerged from countless conferences and extensivenegotiations and that have taken the form of historicresolutions and conventions under the auspices of theUnited Nations. By extension  we believe that thisappeal to States applies not only to trading matters butalso to all the other aspects of relationships amongnations. His profound words express the vast ethicalfoundation of the United Nations.In another part of his report the Secretary-Generalwarns of the risk that environmental degradation among other factors  may heighten social and politicaltensions in an unforeseeable and potentially dangerousfashion. We are particularly gratified by this clearvision on an issue whose various facets are alreadyhaving a serious impact not only on many developingnations but also on the most developed.In view of these very wise appeals and warnings as well as of the predominant role that the UnitedNations plays in the maintenance of international peaceand defence of the principle of sovereignty  in a formalnote  to the Secretary-General I have requested him tobring to the attention of the United Nations the failureof the United States of America to fulfil its obligationsso that the Organization can assist in bringing about anearly resolution of the dispute arising from the refusalof the United States to fulfil the commitments derivedfrom the unauthorized military use by its army ofsignificant portions of Panama's national territory. Ihave informed the Secretary-General of the facts andformally requested that my note be circulated as adocument of the General Assembly and that it bebrought to the attention of the Security Council.I take this opportunity to wish the GeneralAssembly a fruitful year of deliberations under theguidance of its President. I should like to express mysincere hope that this year will be one of significant meaningful and tangible achievements for theOrganization in the treatment of the most importantitems on its agenda  to the benefit of all mankind."
"131",5537,"PER",55,2000,"At the outset  I would like to join those whopreceded me in congratulating you on yourappointment as President of this last General Assemblyof the twentieth century. Peru is pleased that arepresentative of Finland  a country everyone knows iscommitted to the objectives of the Organization  issteering the work of the fifty-fifth session of theGeneral Assembly.I am convinced that  under your leadership wewill achieve the mandates that are necessary to begin topursue the vision developed by our Heads of State andGovernment at the recent Millennium Summit.I should also like to welcome and congratulateTuvalu for its incorporation into the United Nations.This will undoubtedly represent an importantcontribution to the different spheres of work of theOrganization.The Millennium Summit has revealed theenormous challenges that lie ahead and theoverwhelming need to forge a new form ofinternational order that will allow future generations toenjoy a world free from the threats of war  poverty injustice and environmental deterioration and  at thesame time  one built on freedom with the participationof each of the great cultures that are part of mankind without preference or prejudice.It is extremely important that when we are aboutto conclude not just a century but also a millennium on31 December  we stop for a moment along the way toreflect on the future of international relations. Peru iscertainly not a decisive country in the development ofglobal relations. Nevertheless it would seem that one ofthe characteristics that appear at the end of thetwentieth century and that will certainly be emphasizedin the twenty-first century is the basic role that allcountries of the world  whether large or small  have toplay in shaping the international order. And  in thissense  the perspective of a country  such as Peru thatfully shares Western civilization and yet at the samehas its own characteristics that are the legacy of ancienttimes  may be of interest in carrying out the healthyexercise of approaching the subject from a differentangles.24Peru emphatically reiterates that the global orderthat must shape the conduct of the differentinternational actors within the century beginning on lJanuary  must be based on the essential principles ofthe Charter which  contrary to certain beliefs that webelieve to be mistaken  have not only not lostrelevance  but are increasingly important for peacefulcoexistence  collective security and also for a realpossibility for the development of all the specificgroups that form part of the abstract element that wecall mankind.May I emphasize  in particular  the rights thatrefer to the sovereignty of States  to non-intervention intheir domestic affairs and to the legal equality betweenStates. These basic principles  which were incorporatedin the Charter in San Francisco  have allowed thedevelopment of effective mechanisms of self-controland the stabilization of the international system.That is why we must renew our commitment tothese rules of international public law  restoring thefunctionality that is theirs. Only thus can we ensurethat the democratic values that prevail in contemporarysociety will apply and be enforced within aninternational system whose emerging features appear toseek new forms of exclusion.The world today is not the same as the world of50 years ago. Change and globalization are constantlyreshaping reality at a rapid rate and are attempting toimpose upon us a new sense of commonality  newmorals and a new political ethic that dogmatically andin a partisan manner define what is proper andimproper.Full respect for the international legal ordertherefore acquires enormous significance since it is theonly element that can illuminate the common path reducing arbitrariness and subjectivity. This is also thebest way and the most effective mechanism for the fullprotection of human rights and human freedom  whichare undoubtedly requirements that no member of theinternational community may evade.But this new reality also imposes on us a need forcommitment to the principle of shared responsibility.The profound interdependence posed by globalizationalso assumes a collective determination by all themembers of the United Nations community to combinetheir efforts and resources for the resolution ofproblems that have systemic effects or effects of aninternational nature. I refer in particular to theachievement of lasting economic growth within thedeveloping countries; poverty elimination; confrontingthe real threats to peace of an international scope;public health problems and endemic illnesses that aremainly linked to poverty; finding sufficient financingfor development; the digital divide; migration and thefree movement of labour; environmental protection andconservation; the world drug problem  beyond a purelymilitary perspective; the scourge of terrorism and thevarious forms of international crime  including moneylaundering  arms trafficking and internationaltrafficking in people.It is highly important for Peru that each of thesecommon problems be tackled within the framework ofthe United Nations and that common  coherent andcomprehensive answers be found. We must be capableof finding effective solutions with sufficient politicaland financial support. In this context  let me expressour particular satisfaction over the commitments madeby the heads of State and Government to focus theinternational community's attention in the comingyears on poverty reduction  so that by the year 2015nearly 600 million people will have overcome theirstate of chronic poverty.Similarly  I wish to emphasize the imaginativeand constructive proposal presented by the President ofPeru  Mr. Alberto Fujimori  at the Millennium Summit to use the money illegally earned by captured drugtraffickers to alleviate the foreign debt of the poorestcountries and  in general  to utilize those funds tocontribute to the fight against poverty in the world.There are undoubtedly many and very difficultchallenges that we must face during the next century.This is the time of wealth and technologicaldevelopment  but also the time of struggle againstpoverty. This is the time of globalization  but also thetime of the respectful recognition of cultural diversity which is an asset as important as  or more importantthan  biological diversity. This is the time of thegreatest use of natural resources by man  but also thetime of environmental conservation. This is the time ofthe universal spread of democracy  but also the time ofdemocratic respect for the different ways in whichdemocracy is lived.Mankind has reached some basic consensuses atthis stage of its development. All the peoples of theworld share certain values and certain goals  such asfreedom  democracy  equality before the law  respect25for human rights  the need to eliminate poverty  thedevelopment of creativity and the need for man toalways surpass itself. This has been the contribution ofmodernity  the contribution of the latest centuriesconsolidated in the twentieth century. But it is also truethat humanity is not made up  fortunately  of a singleculture. It is also true that these values should findconcrete forms of their realization through differentmentalities  in different latitudes  at different periods inthe history of each people. That is why post-modernity that world of the next century  must know how toconserve and deepen the values that are the legacy ofmodernity and carry forward its goals as much aspossible. But it must also acknowledge diversity; itmust know how to resolve dynamically the dilemmabetween unity and multiplicity.Perhaps the most complex of all these challenges the most difficult of all the coincidentiae oppositorumthat the twenty-first century will demand is to build aninternational system based on a genuine democracy.And by this I mean a democracy that does not consistof imposing a political form in the image of and similarto a specific system that is promoted as a model  ademocracy that is not built on the basis of a merecheck-list of institutions that have been taken from aspecific democratic experience and turned intomandatory universal guidelines. Democracy is thepractice of diversity and tolerance. It is a recognitionthat with regard to each subject  including the idea ofdemocracy itself  there can be different interpretations and none of them is entitled to ban the others. The taskthat awaits us  then  during the next century is tospread and promote democracy but  above all  tofurther examine its own meaning to avoidcontradictions which would lead to its destruction.How can we spread democracy withoutendangering democracy itself? On the other hand  howdo we save diversity and particularity without endingup with outdated nationalism? These are the majorproblems of our time. They are the major dilemmasthat will have to be resolved in the twenty-first century.Any idea of a crusade  even in the name ofdemocracy  is undemocratic  because it is intolerant.And I would almost dare to say that any principle ofsocial organization that seeks to impose itselfuniversally has an undemocratic base. Thus paradoxically  the missionary enthusiasm fordemocracy ends up affecting the nature of democracyitself.Democracy  in fact  implies a delicate and fragilebalance between the universal and the singular.Singularity should not be sacrificed on the deified altarof universality. Singularity should not be dissolvedwithin a claimed universality  and the singular shouldeven less be confused with the universal  assigning anabsolute value to what is no more than the historicexpression of a culture and of a time.The attempts to apply on an international scaledomestic policies and local interpretations of valueshave always failed. In the second half of the twentiethcentury  we witnessed the spectacular collapse ofSoviet communism  which claimed to be the politicaldoctrine of the future  with which  following Hegel  wewould see the end of politics and therefore of historyand enter into a sort of rebuilt earthly paradise. Theclaimed communist universality saw the birth withinitself of particularities and differences. Afterwards ithad to face other doctrines and world visions that werealien to its principles and values; and contrary to whatcommunism expected  those different perspectives didnot vanish when faced with the presumed Marxisttruth. Rather  they won the ideological battle and madecommunism and Soviet Russia disappear. I amconvinced that the same will happen with any doctrine whatever its perspective and the values that support it that claims to lead the world to the end of history.This forces us to rethink certain ideas that are toohastily — and  to my mind  inconsistently — becomingcommonplace. There is a certain scorn towards the ideaof sovereignty and towards the idea of the culturalidentity of peoples  under the pretext of building auniversal society. Nevertheless  I believe that  eventhough they will need to be transformed and adapted toa new globalizing outlook  those ideas will continue toprevail in the world of the future if we favour agenuinely democratic way of thinking  in whichfreedom can also exist under cultural and ideologicaldifferences.There is no doubt that there is a crisis in thenation-State  because the seemingly essentialidentification between the State as the political andjuridical organization of society and the nation as acultural organization is false: multinational States doexist. The solution in these cases of disparity betweenthe political and cultural organization is not to abandonthe concept of State and sovereignty  letting them beabsorbed within one of the supranational  globalizingconstructs; rather  it lies in achieving within the State26an acknowledgement and complex integration ofmulticulturality. It is necessary to articulate diversity atboth the State and international levels instead ofimposing some sort of homogeneity that will alwaysfeel like a strait-jacket.The new international order cannot be built by asingle nation  culture or ideology  but by the interactionof the different attitudes that make up humanity. Froma genuinely democratic and liberal point of view  wemust avoid the temptation of the new dogmatism perversely subtle and with a powerful imperialistvocation: the myth of “political correctness”.In this regard  building a new international orderfor the twenty-first century does not mean solving amathematical equation or scientifically designing amodel to be applied generically to all the countries ofthe world in a vain attempt to create a universalinternational society. Reality sweeps away allabstractions with the wealth of its multiple points ofview. Moreover  reality is always dynamic andeffervescent. It is always in a permanent state oftransformation  thanks to freedom  the definingelement of the human being.Therefore  politics  whether domestic orinternational  is an art  not a science. A domestic orinternational order must be the result of a complexinteraction between different  and even opposing elements  just like a work of art. Creating the work ofart that will be the new international order implies notdestroying what is counter to it  but  rather  combiningit; combining unity with diversity and freedom withorder. To put it in Nietzschean terms  we have to unitethe Apollonian with the Dionysian. To build a purelyApollonian society is to fall into a new form ofdogmatism and cultural dictatorship  even though paradoxically  the intention is to establish democracy.Building a purely Dionysian society means slippinginto chaos and therefore destroying the social contract.The society of the future must be capable ofliving with diversity and expressing different points ofview  world visions and interpretations of democracyitself in order to establish an organization ofhumankind that creates not a single and homogenousinternational society  but an embodiment of the wealthof social and cultural diversity in search of peacefulcoexistence and reciprocal cooperation without burdensor conditions."
"132",5584,"PHL",55,2000,"The twentieth centurywas one of great trials and great achievements. Thenew century will be what we make of it. Whatever hasbeen won in the name of peace  the hunting season inhistory is not quite over. Tension between nations hasnot disappeared. Ethnic strife  religious extremism economic inequity and social injustice continue to fuelconflict. Agents of terror and transnational criminalsstrike everywhere.Despite the new wealth of nations  1.2 billionpeople live on less than $1 a day. The 32 poorestAfrican countries do not earn much more than therichest man on earth. And  despite the grinding povertyof billions  the world spends $145 per capita onmilitary forces. We must do better — much better —than this.Our Organization received the needed impetus atlast week's Millennium Summit. That should not besquandered. The fifty-fifth session of the GeneralAssembly must reflect the new global covenant forpeace and progress. As always  the United Nationsmust be at the forefront of this great enterprise. We arehere to lead.The Philippine delegation sees this MillenniumAssembly as a bridge to link three divides: those of thepast and the future; of experience and vision; and ofpromise and fulfilment.Fifty-five years ago our Organization arose fromthe ashes of war. Some founding Member States werevery young  just recently set free from centuries ofcolonial rule. All were still preoccupied with tasks ofrebuilding lives and neighbourhoods shattered by theGreat War. The ideological divide was to becomedeeper and wider. The foundations for the walls andcurtains that defined an era were just being laid. Forthe average person then a truly global community wasno more than an ideal  remote and all but removedfrom the day-to-day lives of mostly rural  agriculturalpopulations.Now we are all part of the global village.Interdependence is a recognized and accepted fact.“Globalization” is on the lips of everyone  sometimeswith scorn  at other times with affection  but alwayswith the discernment that it is the wave of the future.Above all else  that future belongs to all the world'speople  to both the affluent and the destitute  to boththe strong and the weak. With everyone's directinvolvement in charting and realizing our common10destiny  we open the door to the fullest flowering ofhumanity's potential. We also affirm human dignity.“Wiring” the world's cities into the informationgrid of the twenty-first century is indeed one wiseinvestment we should be making today. But if anyonewere left out  if the “digital device” were but to echoand perpetuate social injustice on a global scale  wewould not have moved far from where we started. Thepast would simply repeat itself.To empower people is to build our bridge to thefuture. The world's leaders were therefore on the markwhen they enshrined freedom  equality  solidarity tolerance  respect for nature and shared responsibilityas the fundamental  people-empowering values of thetwenty-first century. Now  it is this Assembly's turn toemploy those values and take steps to achieve thespecific objectives set by the Summit for peopleempowerment.Let us buckle down to work and ensure that by2015 all children will be able to complete primaryschooling and  beyond that date  that they have theopportunities to pursue higher levels of education. Forlet us face it  education is the best tool for protectinghuman rights  promoting democracy and advancinggood governance.But because a sound mind will work better in asound body  let us win the battle against disease including HIV/AIDS  which lays to waste millions inthe world's poorest regions. Let us take action todrastically reduce maternal and under-five childmortality from their horrendous current rates and toachieve the lofty goals of the “Cities Without Slums”initiative.Let us invest in humanity. Let us launch in thisAssembly nothing short of a Marshall Plan for theworld's people. Let us build this human bridge to ourfuture  now.The United Nations has both the experience andthe vision needed for success. Our Organization hasboth the privilege and the duty to lead our world intothe future with confidence. We know how to do it.To sustain the United Nations capacity to carryout its tasks  deep institutional reforms must now takeplace. A more energetic and financially stable worldOrganization  led by a proactive General Assembly andstrengthened by a truly representative and transparentSecurity Council  must now emerge.For the new covenant on peace to prosper  theUnited Nations must remain  without equivocation ordoubt  the first and last peacemaker and peacekeeper ofthe world. It should also be the vanguard thatchampions the rule of law in international as well as ininternal affairs.Preventive diplomacy must be our principal toolin warding off conflict. We must reduce the use offorce. But where we need to use it  as in self-defence orunder Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter  weshould be guided by international legal norms andpractice.United Nations peacekeeping operations shouldbe prosecuted with clear and well-defined mandates adequate resources and strong international supportwherever they take place. The report of the BrahimiPanel on United Nations Peace Operations deserves oururgent and careful consideration.More than ever  the United Nations must nowgather together the political will of all nations to bringabout the final stage of disarmament and the much-awaited arrival of a nuclear-weapon-free world.Towards this end  we must support the Secretary-General's call to convene a conference on nucleardangers  actively participate in the 2001 small armsconference  negotiate a comprehensive conventionagainst terrorism and progressively improve weaponsand arms budget transparency measures.The central role of the United Nations does notand should not stop at matters of international peaceand security. It should also be at the heart of our effortsto promote prosperity for all. It should lead the chargeagainst poverty and the efforts to halve  by 2015  theproportion of people whose income is less than onedollar a day.Along with the Bretton Woods institutions andother multilateral organizations and fora  the UnitedNations is well placed to make important contributionsto the reform of global economic and financial systems.For our goal is not only to have a borderless world forunfettered trade and investment. We should found aglobal economic regime that builds productivecapacities  not income gaps; that promotes openness not corruption; that rewards enterprise  not greed.In all these  partnerships with the private sectorand with civil society are indispensable. Every man women and child is our co-stakeholder and partner. Forwhat we are trying to build is a new global order wherehuman security goes beyond mere military security;where law upholds human dignity and both people andState uphold the law; and where political pluralism andcultural diversity are requisite to the attainment ofcommon human objectives.In other words  peace and prosperity must restmore on human cooperation than on anything else. Forin this global village  cooperation is the only tenableway to bridge experience and vision.The United Nations Millennium Declarationembodies our collective hope: the promise of a truecommunity of nations working together for a morepeaceful  prosperous and just world. We know thatbetween this promise and its fulfilment lies a tortuousroad  yet we must tread its length. In this journey  thefirst and most important step we should take is toremove the greatest source of danger and discord  thatis  underdevelopment. For if one is not free of want  hecannot be free of fear.In the developing world  the toll from decades ofturmoil and abject underdevelopment has been sodebilitating that only international relief can help someof us back to our feet. Many of us may cry for safetynets. But not even fish welcome life inside a net. Whatwe need is a new deal for the poor countries.Development is particularly difficult for countriessaddled by mountains of crippling debt. Some 1.6trillion dollars is now owed by developing countries several of which have to use up to 95 per cent of theirhard currency revenues to service debt. In themeantime  development assistance is declining. Thisyear  grants to developing countries may total 40billion US dollars — a mere half of what it was aquarter century ago.As earnest for our collective future  we shouldhave meaningful debt relief for the world's heavilyindebted poor countries immediately. Let us also seethe fulfilment of the promises of overseas developmentassistance (ODA) made three decades ago. Furthersteps must be taken at the third United NationsConference on the Least Developed Countries nextyear. We must ensure its success to help our brothersand sisters in Africa  in landlocked developingcountries  in nations particularly vulnerable to naturaldisasters and in least developed countries in all regionsof the world. At this Assembly  we should do ourutmost to guarantee that all preparations necessary forthe success of this conference are made.We must also redeem the pledge of our leaders tomake every effort to ensure the success of the high-level international and intergovernmental event onfinancing for development in 2001. By investing thisevent with the active participation  goodwill andexpertise of all stakeholders  including the privatesector  from the preparatory stages to the plan'simplementation  we may yet achieve what severalUnited Nations Development Decades have not.The world's people took heart from the boldnessof spirit and resolve our leaders expressed in theUnited Nations Millennium Declaration. They werereassured that we intend to take the world into thefuture as partners and not as adversaries. They wishedfor clear direction from our leaders  and they receivedit. Now  they look to us in this Millennium Assemblyfor concrete action. Let us rise to the challenge andbuild the bridges to peace and prosperity for all theunited nations."
"133",5603,"PLW",55,2000,"It is indeed an honour and aprivilege for me to address this body on behalf of theGovernment and the people of the Republic of Palau.President Kuniwo Nakamura sends his warm greetingsand wishes everyone a successful deliberation duringthis fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly. Healso wishes to congratulate and welcome the newestMember of the United Nations  our good Pacificneighbour and friend  Tuvalu.During the recently concluded MillenniumSummit  we addressed many global issues that poseproblems and threats to mankind at the national regional and international levels. These problems mustbe seriously looked into by this body and otherinternational and regional organizations so that theirsolutions may be found or remedies provided toalleviate the suffering they impose on our world and itspeoples. These problems – ranging from hunger poverty  tuberculosis  malaria and the spread ofHIV/AIDS to global warming and environmentaldegradation and vulnerability – are not just theresponsibilities of the countries or regions that are mostaffected; every member of the global community mustplay its part in order for this planet and its inhabitantsto survive these destructive forces.Today  we live in an era in which the productionof food is at an all-time high. Advanced technology inthe area of food production  improved farming andagricultural methods are readily available and can besuccessfully applied to widespread areas that aretraditionally not suitable to agriculture and farming.In a similar context  medical research andinformation can and should be shared universally. Anintegrated approach to intervention in the field ofHIV/AIDS is critically called for in many developingcountries. Collaborative health-research projectsfocusing on the biology of this disease and thedevelopment of tools for its prevention and control —including  diagnostics  drugs and vaccines — must alsobe made available and affordable to the many thirdworld countries seriously plagued by this disease. As aglobal community charged with the responsibility forthe security of mankind  we must confront the realdanger of HIV/AIDS and work collectively towards theeradication of that horrible disease.Uncontrolled and unregulated human activitieshave affected and will continue to affect ourecosystem  thereby endangering and threatening ourvery existence. Global warming is a difficult andscientifically complicated phenomenon. Even today scientists are still divided on this issue  particularly onits causes and effects. While some agree that theemission of greenhouse gases and human and industrialactivities are responsible for climate change and globalwarming  others maintain that the changes occurnaturally and that  because the earth is so resilient tosuch changes  none of these occurrences will havepermanent effects.However  as a small island country in the Pacific Palau has seen and experienced the actual impact of sealevel rise  unpredicted weather patterns and an extremerise in sea water temperature  all of which are signs andindications of global warming and climate change.Many island countries all over the world have alsoexperienced these catastrophic changes. Let us  asworld leaders  work individually and collectivelytowards the real resolution of global warming. Theblueprint and foundation of this important task are set23forth in the United Nations Framework Convention onClimate Change and the Kyoto Protocol. Let us fulfilour roles.During the Millennium Summit  we alsopresented institutional issues that should be seriouslyconsidered by the entire membership of thisOrganization. Two further issues were raised by Palauduring the Summit: open membership andrepresentational participation in all bodies of theUnited Nations. The lack of action on these issues onour part  as a body  is quite contrary and detrimental tothe objectives of the United Nations.With regard to open membership  Palau believesthat any State that meets the traditional and standarddefinition of independent State should be allowedmembership in the United Nations. To that end  it is theposition of the Republic of Palau that the contributionsof Taiwan to the global community  particularly thedeveloping countries  more than qualify the Republicof China on Taiwan to fully participate in the UnitedNations as a full-fledged Member. We strongly supportfull membership of the Republic of China on Taiwan inthe United Nations and appeal to all States members ofthis body for their support.Countless achievements concerning the welfareand security of this planet and its inhabitants have beenaccomplished by this body since its inception 55 yearsago. Many important organs and bodies within theUnited Nations have been created  and some have evenbeen reorganized since then to further promote andenhance the institution's objectives and goals.However  one very important organ within theUnited Nations system  the Security Council  hasremained virtually unchanged since its inception. Palautruly believes that this important organ should bereorganized and restructured to increase bothpermanent and non-permanent members in order tostrengthen the Council's work and effectiveness. We therefore  maintain our support of the MillenniumDeclaration  expressing the determination to intensifyour efforts to achieve a more comprehensive reform ofthe Security Council.Reform can only materialize if we all agree to acommon formula by which the number of permanentand non-permanent members should be increased. TheRepublic of Palau further maintains that any increase inthe permanent membership of the Security Councilshould reflect a Member State's contribution tointernational peace and security and its capability toeffectively carry out the objectives of the Council. Afew countries have surely reached that plateau to serveas permanent members of the Security Council.Finally  the Republic of Palau reaffirms itscommitment to global partnerships in this world ofinterdependent economies as an essential step towardsthe achievement of sustainable development. At thefifty-fourth United Nations General Assembly  the VicePresident of the Republic of Palau  His ExcellencyThomas Remengesau  Jr.  addressed the Assembly andspoke of a tri-partite scientific project involving theUnited States of America  Japan and Palau that wasstill in its developmental phase. I am deeply honouredtoday to inform this Assembly that last month theGovernment of Japan completed the constructionalphase of the project and officially handed over thefacility to the Government of the Republic of Palau.The next phase is to furnish the facility with the rightequipment and tools necessary for scientific research.When fully completed  the Centre will providescientists and researchers with a state-of-the-art facilityfor research in the area of coral reefs and marineorganisms. Medical research can and will also beconducted in this facility. In addition  the Centre willserve as a tourist attraction  as different exhibits onmarine life and a large aquarium will be on display.At this juncture  I would like to convey ourgratitude and thanks to the Governments of Japan andthe United States of America for their support in thisnoble endeavour and welcome any input andcontributions from the scientists and researchers of therest of the Member States to utilize the facility  sincewe all work towards the common goal of safeguardingand utilizing our environment for the betterment ofhumanity.The Palau International Coral Reef Centre projectis a clear example of cooperation between developedand developing nations in promoting sustainabledevelopment. Financial resources and mechanisms environmental utility and transfer of sound technology cooperation and capacity-building have been madeavailable to support this important initiative.The Republic of Palau continues to be challengedand challenges every Member State to build on theachievements of the last eight years that have passedsince the Rio Summit  to look critically at the problems24that are still facing us and to make firm commitmentson further progress."
"134",5644,"PNG",55,2000,"Onbehalf of the people and Government of Papua NewGuinea  I join previous speakers in congratulating you Sir  on your election to your prestigious post. Yourunanimous election as President of the GeneralAssembly at the dawn of the new millennium showsthe high esteem in which the international communityholds both you personally and your country  Finland.We are confident that you will guide the historic fifty-fifth session to a successful conclusion.The skill with which your predecessor  Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab of Namibia  cooperated to develop thetheme of the recent Millennium Summit  and presidedover the drafting of the outcome document and ensuredthe smooth management of the Summit earned oursincere appreciation for a job very well done. We alsocongratulate him on his very positive contribution toour collective deliberations during the previous year.May I also take this opportunity  through you  Sir to heartily congratulate the heads of State of bothFinland and Namibia on their magnanimousstewardship and successful conclusion of the recentunprecedented large assembly of approximately 150heads of State and Government in New York  whichpaved the way for the pursuit of our common visionand security into the twenty-first century.Beyond the millennium celebrations  this is atime for reflection and looking ahead. The MillenniumSummit took place on the eve of the twenty-fifthanniversary of Papua New Guinea's independence. Thesame anniversary also marks the first quarter century ofmy country's membership of the United Nations. It istherefore an apt occasion both for reflecting onexperience and for looking ahead.My particular focus is on the changing characterof  need for and potential for international cooperation.The conjunction of the millennium with Papua NewGuinea's silver anniversary invites us to take a numberof different time perspectives: the short  medium andlong terms. For those of us who have been privileged toplay an active part in public life during this period  italso provides the opportunity to compare the ambitionswe had 25 years ago with the challenges we face now.As the Secretary-General recently reminded us inthe very title of the document (A/54/2000) he preparedto guide and stimulate the Millennium Summit  theUnited Nations was formed in the name and with theobjective of furthering the common purposes of “Wethe peoples of the United Nations”. In similar fashion the Constitution that came into effect when my countrybecame independent was made and adopted in thename of “We the people of Papua New Guinea”.2As someone who had the honour of participatingin making the Papua New Guinea Constitution  I amvery mindful of the national goals and directiveprinciples we set for ourselves at independence. Whilesome have a distinctively national character — such aspreserving  developing and building on Papua NewGuinean ways — others resemble challenges that theUnited Nations faces today. They include suchuniversal challenges as promoting integral humandevelopment  equity and participation  and sustainableuse of natural resources and the environment. Theyalso include the challenge of maintaining strengthening and making mutually beneficial use ofnational sovereignty and self-reliance.But look at us now. What have we achieved?What remains to be done? The most striking feature ofcontemporary Papua New Guinea is the way in whichwe have had to trim our objectives. Our situation is obviously  not unique  but it certainly warrants themost careful consideration.When the present Government  led by the PrimeMinister  The Honourable Sir Mekere Morauta  came tooffice in the middle of last year  we set ourselves fivevery carefully defined objectives: to restore integrity toState institutions; to stabilize our national currency —the kina — and the national budget; to removeobstacles to investment and growth; and to continue theprocess of working for lasting peace in Bougainville bypeaceful means.The national goals and directive principlescontinue to guide our long-term ambitions and plans.But experience and the realities of governance in theage of globalization have required us to focus on muchmore specific  short- and medium-term objectives. Wecannot blame others — or even such largely impersonalprocesses as economic and technologicalglobalization — for every aspect of our currentsituation. Much of the responsibility lies with leadersand institutions at home. Both fortunately andunfortunately  it is part of the human condition at thestart of the twenty-first century that we are not on ourown. Despite important differences in origins processes and outcomes  our situation is not unique.Many other developing countries face similarchallenges in the short and medium terms.International cooperation is an important key tocollective self-help  both between countries withsimilar weaknesses and strengths  and betweencountries that are different and complementary —especially rich and poor.As regards global cooperation  as a member ofthe global community Papua New Guinea is able todraw on support from the World Bank  the InternationalMonetary Fund  the Asian Development Bank  ourdevelopment cooperation partners in Europe  and theAsia-Pacific countries that have formed themselvesinto the Friends of Papua New Guinea.While my delegation has come to New York todiscuss global issues and explore the potential forglobal cooperation  Papua New Guinea alsoparticipates in various forms of regional  interregionaland bilateral cooperation. Papua New Guinearecognizes the value of  and is firmly committed tofurther strengthening  global cooperation throughbodies like the World Trade Organization (WTO).My Government is disappointed that the nextround of World Trade Organization (WTO)negotiations has been delayed  and calls for them to beheld at the earliest possible opportunity.As one of the countries where increasing areas ofland are already becoming unusable or actuallydisappearing as a result of rising sea-levels caused byclimate change  we believe in the urgent need for fullimplementation of the Kyoto Protocol.On an issue where the very survival of certainmembers of the global community is clearly at stake —and where global security depends on coordinatedglobal action — there must be no backsliding  nocompromises  and no special cases allowed because ofinability or unwillingness to honour global agreementsfor whatever reason.Papua New Guinea is pleased to welcome ourclose island neighbours and very good friends fromTuvalu to membership of the United Nations.What a terrible tragedy it would be if theinternational community were to fail them at the verytime when they  together with other small islandStates — including countries which joined the UnitedNations last year — are assuming the responsibilitieswhich go with becoming full participants in theOrganization's affairs.Certain security issues  such as climate change require a global approach. So do efforts to limit the3proliferation that would bring about the completeelimination of nuclear weapons.Global cooperation is the only means by whichthe international community can realistically hope toachieve the objective which the Secretary-General setfor the Millennium Summit of ensuring thatglobalization becomes a positive force for people instead of leaving them behind in squalor  especially indeveloping countries.However  as the Secretary-General also suggestedin his report (A/54/1) to the fifty-fourth session of theGeneral Assembly  different regions have differentproblems. Even similar problems in different settingsmay require different approaches. Security policies thatwork in one region may not work in others. The road tosuccess can require complementary national  regionaland global efforts.Thus  Papua New Guinea is addressing theunwelcome spread of small arms and light weapons byimposing a complete ban on the issuance of new gunlicenses. We support efforts to deal with the spread ofillegally obtained or held arms through the PacificIslands Forum.We look to the forthcoming United NationsConference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms andLight Weapons in All Its Aspects to provide a globalframework and global support for the efforts thatindividual States and regional organizations are takingto deal with the problem within their respectivejurisdictions.When it comes to the management of oceanresources  Papua New Guinea sees regional andinterregional cooperation as complementary tomeasures designed to ensure the sustainable harvestingof fish in national waters.We therefore welcome the agreement recentlyconcluded under the auspices of the Multilateral High-level Conference on fisheries with the purpose ofensuring sustainable fishing for tuna and highlymigratory species throughout their ranges in theWestern and Central Pacific.Papua New Guinea would also like to see bothbroader and deeper cooperation between coastal Statesin other aspects of oceans and ocean-bed management including deep-sea mining.In terms of regional cooperation  suchcooperation is indispensable to dealing successfullywith many important global and national issues. Butregional cooperation can itself have a variety ofdifferent dimensions and employ different means.In the South Pacific  for example  two of ourclosest neighbours  Fiji and Solomon Islands  areexperiencing internal difficulties that have given rise toserious concern on the part of their friends.We do not condone the illegal overthrow ofdemocratic and constitutional Governments or otherthreats to the security of the Governments and citizensof other States  but  regrettably  and despite repeatedefforts by previous Papua New Guinea Governmentsand other States  the main intra-regional body engagedin promoting regional cooperation in the South Pacific the Pacific Islands Forum  does not have a mechanismfor dealing promptly and effectively with challenges tothe security of States in the region.It has  therefore  been unable to arrangeconsultations  let alone facilitate a coordinatedapproach  to the situations which have arisen followingarmed challenges to the Governments of Fiji andSolomon Islands. Some of our neighbours haveresponded by looking for support outside the region.With the recent addition of six additional Pacificmembers to the African  Caribbean and Pacific (ACP)group of States party to the Lome Convention  14Pacific island States now have access to a verypractical mechanism for dealing with such situations.The upshot is that  when Ministers andAmbassadors from Pacific ACP member States met inCotonou  Benin  in June for the signing of the newframework agreement between the ACP and theEuropean Union  we decided to set up a ministerialmission to report on the situations in Fiji and SolomonIslands.In doing so  we were mindful of the need for  andgrateful for the support of  the European Union.The offer made by the French Minister forEconomic Cooperation at the regional forum of theAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) toensure that the European Commission would defermaking a final decision on sanctions until the PacificACP Ministerial Mission had reported was especiallywelcome because of the meaning and support it gave toour effort at regional cooperation.4The imposition of sanctions against a country canbe a very blunt instrument indeed  causing innocentand powerless people to suffer at the same time as thepowerful and influential  and sometimesdisadvantaging them even more. Even so-called smartsanctions can have wide  unintended effects whileleaving their objects largely unaffected.When a small group of armed men try to takeover a Government  imposing sanctions that affectinnocent men  women and children can be not onlyineffective but even counter-productive.Sanctions might leave armed youths unaffectedand in a position where they are even unable toappreciate  or are indifferent to  the widerconsequences of their actions.The underlying causes of inter-group tensions inSolomon Islands and the events which followed theattempted civilian armed coup in Fiji could be difficultto identify  and are beyond influence by sanctions.It is  therefore  vital that serious difficulties suchas those currently affecting Fiji and Solomon Islandsbe properly studied and carefully addressed.Sometimes  the people best equipped tounderstand such situations and identify underlyingcauses are neighbours with similar cultures or othershared values.In terms of the ACP Ministerial Mission  at therequest of other Pacific ACP States  I have recently hadthe honour of leading the Pacific ACP MinisterialMission to Fiji and Solomon Islands.My colleagues included the Ministers for ForeignAffairs from Cook Islands  Mr. Robert Woonton  andVanuatu  the Honourable Serge Vohor  as well as theMinister for Education from Samoa  the HonourableFiame Naomi Mata'afa.With the active support of the Governments ofboth countries  we followed a crowded itinerary ofmeetings with the Prime Ministers  ministers andofficials in Fiji and Solomon Islands  members of theprevious Governments of both countries and businessand trade union leaders  as well as a wide cross-sectionof other elements of civil society  including women'sorganizations. We were also able to interview victimsin towns and rural areas  and to examine instances ofdestruction at first hand.My colleagues and I are currently working on ourreport. We expect to present it to the EuropeanCommission  the ACP-EU Joint Assembly and otherACP  EU and joint bodies in October.The commitment made by the French Minister forEconomic Cooperation  whose country currently holdsthe presidency of the EU  means that the region — or at least  our report — has been given the opportunity toinfluence events. The process on which we haveembarked is  therefore  more meaningful than anyexisting alternative. We  the Pacific ACP members offered to share our report with the Pacific IslandsForum  and the support our initiative has received fromthe region reflects our commitment to widercooperation  not to mention our unwillingness tobecome involved in even the appearance ofcompetition between rival regional bodies or groups.The initiative has been welcomed and praised both in the region and further afield. It sets an examplewhich is worthy of close study both for the precedentsit sets for cooperation among Pacific ACP States and asa possible model for similar efforts in other regions.With regard to the Bougainville situation  Fiji andSolomon Islands are not the first States in our region toexperience serious internal difficulties  though we praynot only that there will be real improvement very soonbut that they will be the last States to experience suchdifficulties.After more than eight years of armed conflict —from 1989 to 1997 — the part of Papua New Guineaknown as Bougainville is now at peace. Theprogressive political settlement is moving ahead. TheLincoln Agreement on Peace  Security andDevelopment on Bougainville commits the parties topeace-building on several levels  from weaponsdisposal and the re-establishment of civil authority through reconciliation among former combatants toreconstruction of infrastructure  restoration of services economic and social recovery and early resumption ofthe kinds of development which are part of the returnof normalcy.The national Government is committed to such amultidimensional approach. It is the way by which wehope to cooperate in building for a lasting peace bypeaceful means. The priority which the Prime Ministergave the Bougainville peace process more than 12months ago remains in place. Evidence of itscontinuing significance can be seen in the initiative he5has recently taken to meet key Bougainvillean demandswithin the framework of the Papua New GuineaConstitution.The Government  which took the initiative ininviting our neighbours  Australia  Fiji  New Zealandand Vanuatu  to set up the neutral  regional PeaceMonitoring Group (PMG)  values the contribution itsunarmed personnel make to promoting mutualconfidence on the ground. The PMG's success can bejudged from the peaceful way in which it is nowbeginning to disengage by substantially reducing itssize. The process needs greater support from theBougainvillean parties so as to avoid the vacuum whichhas followed the departure of similar peacekeepingoperations elsewhere  by cooperating in the re-establishment of policing  courts and correctionalinstitutional services  as well as by strengthening theinstitutions at community level that help to maintainpublic order  dispense justice and uphold the rule oflaw.As the initiator of the request for the UnitedNations observer mission in Bougainville  and as itshost  Papua New Guinea appreciates the support whichthe Security Council and other organs of the UnitedNations provide for the Bougainville peace process. Weare determined to keep on working for lasting peace bypeaceful means within a flexible framework which willallow Bougainville a high degree of autonomyconsistent with the integrity  security and sovereigntyof the nation.With regard to social and economic issues  as adeveloping country with 25 years of independence Papua New Guinea is experiencing very great difficultyin improving national performance as measured byhuman development indicators. In some areas  ourrecord is actually becoming worse. The currentGovernment's five main objectives are intended tofocus attention and effort where they are most needed.Our determination to pursue them is already making avery real difference  especially as far as economicmanagement and the delivery of Government servicesare concerned.Structural adjustment  including quitefundamental public sector reform  is one of the keymeans of bringing about often long-overdue change.We need the continuing support of our economicpartners to succeed  including access to markets;increased investment in priority areas  such asdownstream processing  which provides increasedopportunities for productive employment; and aid onconcessional terms. The recently concluded partnershipagreement between the ACP countries and the EU is anexample worthy of much wider emulation.As a developing country that achievedindependence only a quarter of a century ago  PapuaNew Guinea is firmly committed to the properpreparation for orderly decolonization. Impressed withthe progress being made to implement the NoumeaAccord  we continue to believe very strongly that therights of the indigenous Kanaks of New Caledoniamust be respected. Conscious of the consequences ofother forms of decolonization  we welcome the re-emergence of East Timor as an independent entity. Welook forward to receiving a delegation later this year todiscuss how we might develop technical and otherforms of mutually beneficial South-South cooperation.Meanwhile  even as we continue to deepen andbroaden cooperation with other Pacific islandcountries  we respect the integrity of our otherneighbours and continue to benefit from the exchangeswhich flow from our status as a special observer atAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)meetings. In the broader arena of Asia-Pacificcooperation  we value our membership of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Forum andcontinue to work towards honouring the reciprocalcommitments APEC members have made to liberalizemarkets. APEC includes some of our closest bilateralpartners and friends. Common membership  and theprocess of developing economic ties with other APECeconomies  do not detract from other aspects of PapuaNew Guinea's foreign relations. They do not affect thecommitments we have made to such good friends as thePeople's Republic of China. We will not allow them todo so.In conclusion  I should like to say that  25 yearsafter independence  Papua New Guinea has one of thelongest unbroken records of constitutional anddemocratic government among countries that havebecome independent in the last 50 or so years. We haveexperienced difficulties  and had some near misses.The stresses and strains which have affected our systemof Government have tested our strengths. In doing so they have increased our understanding of countriesexperiencing serious internal difficulties — althoughnot our sympathy for those who deliberately violatedemocratic principles or established constitutional6practices — while reinforcing our commitment to goodgovernance  both at home and abroad.Apart from the obvious consequences that thiscommitment has for Papua New Guinea's response tocountries experiencing serious internal difficulties including our preference for a positive  forward-looking approach and not negative sanctions  it alsounderlies our support for United Nations reform.The reform must extend from improvingadministrative performance to making the SecurityCouncil more representative of United NationsMembers as a whole. It must  in fact  extend to theperformance of United Nations Members themselves especially when it comes to paying their dues in atimely way and in full.The millennium marks an important turning pointin the calendar  and  because of my country's silveranniversary  in Papua New Guinea's history too. TheUnited Nations is also at a critical turning point  withthe Secretary-General drawing members' attentionback to the original basis and focus among the peoplethe Organization should serve.The recent review of United Nations peace andsecurity activities has produced an excellent reportwhich challenges us to turn another corner and ensurethat the increased responsibilities which theOrganization has assumed since the end of the cold warhelp to keep and build peace in very differentconditions.I conclude by paying tribute to the vision whichparticipants in the Millennium Summit have expressedon our behalf. In doing so  let me add that the realchallenge we face is  emphatically  not to make morespeeches  but to turn their wise words into practicalforms of cooperation which help us achieve commonpurposes without sacrificing the diversity which is thebasis of our need and ability to engage in global self-help."
"135",5690,"POL",55,2000,"Allow mefirst of all to congratulate Mr. Harri Holkeri on hiselection as President of the Millennium session of theGeneral Assembly. The Polish delegation expresses itssatisfaction that the presidency of this session has beenentrusted to an eminent statesman from Finland  acountry with which we have ties of friendship andcooperation based on common values and aspirations.He may count on my delegation's full cooperation inthe performance of his important tasks.29My congratulations also to the Assembly'soutgoing President  Minister Theo-Ben Guribab  for theoutstanding commitment and skill he displayed duringhis presidency.On behalf of Poland  allow me also to welcome tothe United Nations the new Member  Tuvalu.I should also like to express my appreciation tothe Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for theoutstanding manner in which he has demonstrated hisqualities of leadership and good judgement  and inparticular for his inspirational report  “We the peoples:the role of the United Nations in the twenty-firstcentury”.Although the start of the new millennium is still afew months away  a new era actually began a littleearlier. It was marked by the demise of the world'sideological polarization into East and West anddivision into three worlds  and by the emergence of theworld economy. Humankind enters this new era  theage of globalization  with the immense opportunity toexpand the spheres of freedom and prosperity broughtby the triumph of democracy and advances intechnology  especially the achievements of theinformation revolution.Behind us we have left the twentieth century  anage of extremes and profound contradictions. It was anage of man's triumphs and downfalls  alternatingsetbacks and advances in the evolution of theinternational community. On the one hand  we havewitnessed of amazing scientific  technological andmaterial progress  the spread of human rights anddemocracy and the development of universalinternational institutions. On the other hand  it was alsoan age of the most horrendous dramas in contemporaryhuman history  of the tragedies  atrocities anddevastation of two world wars  of the utmost contemptfor the human being  and of genocide and blindviolence perpetrated by utopias intent on thus building“brave new worlds”. The Polish poet and Nobellaureate in literature in 1980  Czeslaw Milosz  wrote inThe Witness of History that the twentieth century'soriginal contribution to the history of the human racewas “the near disappearance of the concept of values”and concluded: “The extermination camp became thecentral fact of the century.”Nonetheless  the end of this century seems tobring more optimism. This is not only the assessmentof the Foreign Minister of reborn and democraticPoland. It is also the personal feeling of a man who having been a prisoner of two totalitarian systems  theNazi and the Communist — incidentally  I am  I think the only Foreign Minister to hold this “distinction” —has known the sufferings specific to this century  and itreflects the hope ingrained in human nature. But aswell as destruction and hatred  I have also been  sinceas long ago as the days of the Holocaust  a witness ofand participant in a struggle for the dignity and therights of the human being and the process of mycountry's recovery of independence and arduousconstruction of democracy.My history of active participation in transformingthe conditions of human existence  in its individual andcollective dimension  began in the yard of theconcentration camp of Auschwitz. Later  enlistment inthe Polish resistance and  in particular  participation inassistance for the inhabitants of the Warsaw Ghetto.Next  the unimaginable inferno of the Warsaw uprisingin 1944 and the death  as it seemed at the time  ofWarsaw. Finally  the end of the war. I remember the joyand hope with which we greeted the United NationsCharter and the Universal Declaration of HumanRights. They gave me strength when I found myselfhaving to survive the ordeal of years in Communistjails. From them  too  I drew inspiration on the journeythat eventually led me and my political friends toGdansk  the city for which our allies were unwilling todie in 1939 and in which the next great turning-point inthe history of the past century was launched in 1980.Indeed  two weeks ago we celebrated in Polandthe twentieth anniversary of the foundation of theSolidarity movement  the Polish revolution that was atfirst suppressed at gunpoint by the totalitarian regimebut that  becoming an emblem of hope  weatheredrepression and an unfavourable set of internationalcircumstances. The rebirth of Solidarity in 1989 andthe Polish Round Table opened the way to historicchanges  including the fall of the Berlin Wall and thecollapse of the Communist bloc  and in consequenceset in motion a sweeping transformation of theinternational system. Having been involved for over 60years in these processes  as a writer  historian university lecturer and  currently  Foreign Minister  Ifeel — if the Assembly will forgive the personal toneof this confession — as if I were a living  physicalsymbol of humanity's stormy voyage through thehistory of the past century.30But let me also say that the traumatic experiencesof my nation have made the Poles exceptionally awareof the value of peace and any manifestations of goodthat are lastingly present in international life. Makingour contribution to the positive culmination of thetwentieth century and working towards therevitalization of the message of the United Nations and thereby opening up new prospects for theOrganization  we see ourselves as full and activemembers of the global family of nations. A furthersource of the sense of security and confidence thatfortifies us in this role within the United Nations is thatwe have become a member of the North AtlanticAlliance and are forging ever-closer ties with theEuropean Union  which we expect to join in the nearfuture.Bolstered by our accomplishments in the pastdecade  having reclaimed our place on the internationalstage  we are eager to participate together with othernations in this generally perceptible shift towardsvalues. A yearning for a world imbued with moralvalues is visible in all civilizations and religions. Thisis especially evident in the waning of the unlawful useof force in international life. The recent outbreaks seenhere and there are an echo of divisions and conflictsthat are fading along with the twentieth century. Thispositive tendency can be observed in Europe  in theMiddle East  in North-East Asia and in other parts ofthe world. Contributing to it is a growing respect forhuman rights and appreciation of the economic andsocial factors involved in their full achievement.Against this background  the Polish people holdin great esteem the peace mission of John Paul II  thePope from Poland — a Pope whose pontificate  like thewhole course of his life  personifies  beacon-like  anunwavering adherence to values and  through thesymbol of open arms  understanding and reconciliation.The Pope's position not only fills us with pride but isalso a model for our international behaviour. Thebearings guiding our actions  including here in theUnited Nations  are tolerance  openness and respect forthe dignity and rights of the individual  minorities andwhole nations. We are determined to oppose every kindof discrimination and prejudice  whether on ethnic national  religious or social grounds. In this cause Poland is and will continue to be a staunch ally of theUnited Nations.We are entering the twenty-first century with theimmense potential generated by the newest phase of therevolution in science  technology  masscommunications  the opening up of frontiers  thedevelopment of inter-societal ties and theuniversalization of democracy and human rights. Mostof these phenomena are encompassed by the commonterm “globalization”. For a number of years assessment of their consequences has  especially in thewake of regional financial crises  been growingincreasingly contentious. Sometimes they are treated asa force of nature sweeping all before them  as morallyneutral processes that can do good or harm and thateventually will bring prosperity to all peoples or be asource of crises  inequality and instability withinnations and on an international scale.Globalization has unquestionably beneficialeffects in the sphere of trade  production  the spread ofmodern technologies and capital flows. Theliberalization of international trade  the growth ofworld output and the prosperity of societies shouldbring a more equitable sharing of the benefits ofglobalization. At the same time  there are loomingdangers  harmful side-effects and new problems whosescale and nature we are not yet capable of identifyingcorrectly. The challenge facing us is to work togetherto steer these processes in such a way that it is theirblessings that are mainly felt by humanity  and thatthey are prevented from creating new divides in theworld. We must do everything in our power  includinghere at the United Nations  to ensure that theseprocesses mean the globalization of good.Faced with the opportunities  but also the threats presented by the evolution of human civilization at thethreshold of the third millennium  the internationalcommunity needs to organize around a question ofbasic importance to the direction of its futuredevelopment. That was the purpose of the Governmentof Poland when it decided  together with theGovernments of Chile  India  the Republic of Korea Mali  the United States and the Czech Republic  toinitiate broader international collaboration in the causeof consolidation and promotion of democracy in theworld.In this gathering there is no need to argue thevirtues of democracy. No one disputes the positiveinterrelationship between democracy and human rights internal and international peace  economic growth andprosperity and better realization of the principles ofjustice and solidarity. At the same time  we cannotignore the threats to democracy  which are primarily of31an internal nature. They affect countries in the processof democratic transition as well as so-called maturedemocracies. They cover a wide spectrum  rangingfrom poverty and economic underdevelopment  ethnicconflicts and organized crime to corruption and theexclusion of whole sectors of public life  notablyfinance and the media  from democratic control  whichsaps the foundations of democracy and demeans it inthe eyes of society. Democracy  its condition andprospects  can and should be no less a legitimatesubject of international debate and cooperation than theother great issues of our times: human rights disarmament  the environment and the like.Imbued with this belief  we embarked  inconjunction with a number of other States  onorganizing in June of this year an internationalconference  “Towards a Community of Democracies”.A total of 107 States accepted our invitation. Speakingat the Warsaw conference  Secretary-General KofiAnnan said “One of the greatest challenges tohumankind in the new century will be thestruggle to make the practice of democracyequally universal. In that struggle  nations inwhich democracy is already well established willneed to be vigilant in preserving thatachievement”.The participants in the conference adopted the WarsawDeclaration  in which they reaffirmed theircommitment to its catalogue of democratic values andstandards. They also undertook to pursue informalcooperation to strengthen and promote democracy invarious international organizations. For obviousreasons  the key question will be what can be done toadvance this cause in the framework of and through theUnited Nations.Let me take this opportunity to recall anotherPolish initiative that also falls within the current ofresponses to the harmful side effects of globalizationprocesses. In 1996  at the General Assembly  Polandsubmitted a proposal to frame a universal legalinstrument  the first of its kind  that could help uscombat one of the greatest dangers of our times:international organized crime. At this session the textof that Convention will be presented to the GeneralAssembly for its approval.The central issue of successive internationalagendas is security. Though preserving internationalpeace and security is the main purpose of the UnitedNations  States have also looked to other ways toensure their security: through creation of balance-of-power systems  arms races and even the use of force.Today we are trying to achieve such goals by differentmeans. Anachronistic doctrines of geopolitics andspheres of influence are now fading into history. TheRoman maxim  “If you want peace  prepare for war” —Si vis pacem para bellum — is becoming irrelevant.Nevertheless  the problem of security remains apressing one  as the numerous conflicts andhumanitarian dramas in various parts of the worldmake all too clear. In addition to crises and warsinherited from the old international order  we areplagued by conflicts which spring from poverty  ethnicand religious strife or the atrophying of States' abilityto perform their basic functions: providing the peopleliving within their borders with internal security anddecent conditions of existence.This new situation  in which security depends notso much on purely military factors as on socialstability  on observance of human rights and the rightsof national minorities or on access to drinking water enhances the role of the United Nations  which candraw on unique experience and a wide range of non-military instruments for ensuring security. Fullerinvolvement by the United Nations in the securitysphere as provided in the mandate deriving from itsCharter requires determined continuation of reform ofthe Organization in this field  starting with a practicalredefinition of the role of the Security Council thatwould extend its purview to non-traditional threats tointernational security.The Security Council must do what  inaccordance with the Charter  is expected of it byMembers and respond more decisively to signs ofbudding conflicts or humanitarian disasters. TheKosovo drama  like many others  could have beenavoided if Security Council members had displayedsufficient imagination and resolve at the right time.That would also have enabled us to avoid last year'sarguments and controversies over the issue ofhumanitarian intervention. The inability of the SecurityCouncil to respond robustly in such situations willopen the way to further precedents for sidestepping theCharter and United Nations mechanisms in the securitysphere and could thereby lead to disintegration of thissystem.32The success and effectiveness of the proposalsand recommendations contained in the Secretary-General's Millennium report will depend on thedetermination of the Security Council as the system'slynch-pin. Poland endorses the report's perspective oninternational problems and approach to tackling them.We are in favour of stronger legal instruments forstabilizing the international order; this refers tosituations involving threats to security and use of force to respect for human rights and to arms control andlimitation. In all these areas we must preserve theprimacy of the United Nations system over regional orunilateral measures  which are acceptable only in theexceptional circumstances in which the SecurityCouncil and United Nations mechanisms are foundwanting.In this context I should also like to pay tribute tothe Brahimi report on United Nations peace operations.As a long-standing and very active participant inUnited Nations peacekeeping missions  Poland is infavour of streamlining the machinery for conductingthem — from decision-making to presence in thefield — and ensuring their greater effectiveness bywidening and making more adequate the array ofinstruments with which such operations are equipped.This means both the possibility of the use of force bythe units deployed in an operation and a wide spectrumof peace-building and post-conflict rehabilitationcapabilities. I refer also to action aimed at advancinghuman rights and laying the groundwork for democracyin the institutional and civil society sphere. In ourview  in further work on the recommendations of thereport  greater emphasis should be put on the questionof cooperation between the United Nations andregional organizations  an area in which lie manyhitherto untapped opportunities  as well on as a morecreative approach to conflict prevention.We no longer seek foundations for a futureinternational order in military capacities  but to an evergreater degree we are trying to build it on fair andrespected laws. The maxim Si vis pacem para iustitiamwhich adorns the facade of the Palace of Justice in TheHague no longer has quite the idealistic ring that it hadseveral decades ago. But we are also aware that thoughadministering justice through law is an indispensablecondition of peace  it is not yet a sufficient condition.Our times  in which conflicts and instability are often aresult of poverty and underdevelopment  require theapplication of a new maxim  a contemporaryparaphrase of the old ones: Si vis pacem parasolidaritatem.Here  we are entering the domain of theinternational economic order  in particular its financialand trade dimensions. This is a sphere in which theUnited Nations system must be much more active thanhitherto or run the risk of being sidelined by the newand powerful non-State actors in international life. Therecently fashionable  if ill-defined  formula of globalgovernance should at the practical level be developedin the United Nations framework or in concert with not parallel or counter to  the United Nations. First andforemost  it is essential to intensify international effortsto promote stability and predictability in internationaleconomic relations  which includes strengthening thenew international financial architecture of a system andinstitutions based on transparent rules.What is also needed — and this is a point thatclearly emerges from the reports of the maininternational organizations  the Secretary-General'sreport included — is a new approach to development.One has to agree with those who maintain that there isno greater challenge today than global sustainabledevelopment and that United Nations success or failurewill be crucial to the outcome of efforts by theinternational community.One of the key challenges facing the internationalcommunity as it enters the twenty-first century ispoverty reduction  especially in the least developedcountries. Success in this field requires wideapplication of the principle of solidarity ininternational economic relations. If globalization is tobe harnessed to development and poverty reduction more is needed than just better coordination among theorganizations active in the socio-economic sphere. It isalso necessary to stop perceiving development andpoverty reduction solely as technical problems. Toattack them effectively  there has to be a coherentpolicy that comprises not only financial and technicalassistance but also substantive measures in the sphereof education  culture  good governance  rule of law democratic institutions  etc.International solidarity will not deliver results inthe shape of building up the production capacities ofthe poorest countries and enabling them to reapbenefits from globalization processes without seriousefforts on the part of these countries themselves  in33particular rational economic policies and the ability tomake effective use of development aid.Poland is joining in international endeavours tofurther effective management of internationalinterdependence  with an appropriate role played by theUnited Nations system and a key role by internationalfinancial institutions in the organization ofinternational economic and financial cooperation. Inthe framework of a poverty reduction strategy  we areparticipating in the implementation of the HeavilyIndebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. Poland alsosupports the European Union proposal that WorldTrade Organization (WTO) members  including in thefirst place the industrialized countries  should within ayear of the conclusion of a new trade round abolishimport tariffs and quotas on basically all exports fromthe least developed countries.It is precisely in order to stress what we believeto be the crucial significance of solidarity inmaintaining peace  security and solidarity throughoutthe world that the Polish Government  mindful of theexperiences of our recent history  will — together witha few other countries — propose that the UnitedNations proclaim 31 August as “InternationalSolidarity Day”; it is the date of the establishment ofthe free and independent Solidarity trade union inPoland in 1980.The qualitatively new feature of the situation atthe turn of the century is not only the extent but thegreater complexity of the tasks facing ourOrganization. Greater still are the expectationsassociated with it of individuals  diverse groups nations and the whole international community. It isessential that we not only understand the nature of thenew problems but also deal more effectively with thematters that have to be tackled by the United Nations whether or not they form an explicit part of themandate deriving from the Charter. In roles rangingfrom preserving peace to human rights  and fromdevelopment to protection of the natural environment the United Nations is irreplaceable. It is preciselybecause of the nature of threats such as environmentaldegradation in the contemporary world that a speedyand comprehensive response by the United Nations isneeded. The sense of “one earth  one human race”requires solidarity-driven and responsible action by allthe system's participants.The tasks and expectations associated with theUnited Nations require that its role in internationalrelations be strengthened. The system must continue tobe the legal and institutional infrastructure of theinternational order. No other formula providessufficient legitimization for the performance of thisrole. The United Nations Charter and Organization areindispensable  in the first place  to small and medium-sized countries. Marginalization of the United Nationswould lead to anarchy  in which the only law would bethe will of the great Powers and increasingly powerfulnon-State actors.The extremely positive trends towardsinvolvement of non-governmental organizations inUnited Nations activities — a trend steadfastlychampioned by Poland — must remain consonant withthe intergovernmental character of the Organization whose universal mandate stems from the legitimacy ofthe States which are its Members. Within this systemwe must  however  be mindful not only of the rights ofStates but also of their obligations.Accountability does not apply only to individuals though here we are in favour of prompt entry into forceof the treaty establishing the International CriminalCourt. We cannot allow the United Nations to tolerate asituation of non-accountability of States for violationsof international law.The successes of any organization  its usefulnessand effectiveness  are not only a matter of thedetermination and unanimity of its members. Muchalso depends on the resources at its disposal  theefficiency of its procedures and the competence of thepeople operating them. In the past  United Nationsofficers have provided innumerable examples of theirdedication in pursuing the Organization's activities  oftheir commitment to serving the ideals actuating theUnited Nations. Better use needs to be made of theirpotential through constant adaptation of theOrganization's structures and mechanisms to changingtasks. That will also make for much better dispositionof the Organization's budget.In our drive to rationalize the United Nationsbudget  our focus should not be on ways of reducing it.The real problem is that there is not enough money todo all the things that everyone expects the Organizationto be doing. The United Nations budget should betailored to the tasks that we ask it to perform  but alsomore effectively. We are also aware that the34Organization's regular budget and its peacekeepingbudget should be based on the principle of the abilityto pay and on realistic economic indicators. Poland isprepared to accept any reasonable and fair changes thatmay be agreed on the future scale of contributions. Wewill play a constructive part in negotiations on thisproblem."
"136",5716,"PRK",55,2000,"On behalf of thedelegation of the Democratic People's Republic ofKorea  I should like first of all to congratulateMr. Harri Holkeri on his election as President of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-fifth session. I believethat the present session will produce the desired resultsunder his leadership. I pay tribute to his predecessorMr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  who made a great contributionto the successful conclusion of the fifty-fourth session.I wish also to express our great appreciation for theefforts made by Secretary-General Kofi Annan tostrengthen the role of the United Nations.The central role of the United Nations in the newcentury should be to establish international relationsand order to make the new century independent peaceful and prosperous. No country can either defendits national dignity or achieve social and economicdevelopment when its national sovereignty is violated.26This is the lesson for mankind on the threshold of thetwenty-first century.It is the common aspiration of the world's peoplesthat the twenty-first century should be a century ofindependence  peace and development. Genuine peaceand prosperity on our planet can be achieved onlywhen the sovereignty of all countries is respected.We regard independence as our life and soul. Theidea of independence runs through all domestic andforeign policies and lines of the Government of theDemocratic People's Republic of Korea. This is thebrilliant embodiment of the independent policy of thegreat leader General Kim Jong Il. The realityprevailing on the Korean peninsula clearly testifies tothe justness of the independent policies consistentlycarried out by the Government of the DemocraticPeople's Republic of Korea.Without independence  it is unthinkable that ourcountry could overcome the manifold difficulties andadvance the building of a powerful nation convincinglyalong the road chosen by its people.The independent foreign policy of theGovernment of the Democratic People's Republic ofKorea makes a tangible contribution to peace andstability in North-East Asia. It can be said that it isentirely because of our firm adherence to independencethat our country has been able to play a buffer-zonerole effectively in the intersection of the divergentgeopolitical interests of several countries. We takepride in the independent foreign policy of ourGovernment  as it contributes to maintaining thebalance of power and preventing a war in North-EastAsia.The independent policy of the Government of theDemocratic People's Republic of Korea also gives fullplay to its vitality in advancing the cause of peace andreunification on the Korean peninsula. The GeneralAssembly at its twenty-eighth session in 1973unanimously welcomed the three principles ofindependence  peaceful reunification and great nationalunity which had been agreed upon by the north and thesouth of the Korean peninsula. These three principlesof national reunification are the grand programme ofreunification put forward by President Kim Il Sung  thegreat leader of our people  and constitute the mostessential component of the three-point charter fornational reunification defined by the respected GeneralKim Jong Il.At the historic Pyongyang meeting in June thisyear  the leaders of the North and the South reaffirmedthese three principles of national reunification  and onthis basis the North-South joint declaration on solvingthe reunification question independently by theconcerted efforts of our nation was made public. Thesummit meeting and the resulting joint declarationrepresent a historic milestone  marking a turning-pointin achieving the cause of independent reunification ofour nation.Amidst the increased spirit of nationalindependence and reunification  North-Southministerial talks for reconciliation and collaborationare being held and the reunions of separated familiesrealized. Mutual visits between the North and the Souththrough  inter alia  direct flights between Pyongyangand Seoul are now commonplace  and a project isunderway to re-link the railways between the North andthe South of Korea.This is the brilliant fruition of our independentpolicy and the result of a warm love for the nation andstrong desire for reunification. It is none other than theKorean nation that is responsible for Korea'sreunification question. Korea's reunification should beachieved independently by the concerted efforts of theKoreans in the North and the South  as stated in theNorth-South joint declaration. Reunification will comeabout if both sides take realistic and practical measuresfor establishing a reunified State by making the most ofcommon elements of the federation and theconfederation proposed by the North and the Southrespectively.The independent reunification of our nation willsurely lead to a lasting peace on the Korean peninsula and we believe that this will in turn contribute to peaceand security in Asia and the rest of the world.The turning point created on the Koreanpeninsula is a positive development of globalsignificance. We consider that the present trendtowards the improvement of North-South relations andreunification is a process that should be valued for thesake of peace and security in North-East Asia as well.If this process is to continue to gain momentum  thecountries concerned should work in support of theprocess  rather than disturbing it.The United States has created our non-existent“missile threat” in order to justify the establishment ofits “theatre missile defense” and “national missile27defense” systems. Nevertheless  it gives rise toworldwide concern about its danger.Our missile programme is of a peaceful nature for all intents and purposes. All countries have an equalsovereign right  recognized by the United Nations  toconduct research on and make use of the outer space. Itis therefore totally unfair for the United States to takeissue only with our rockets while many other countriesare launching their own space rockets. If hostilerelations are removed and confidence is built betweenthe Democratic People's Republic of Korea and theUnited States  there will be ways to address theconcerns on both sides.The recent incident that prevented the Presidentof the Presidium of our Supreme People's Assemblyfrom attending the Millennium Summit is  after all  themanifestation of the continued hostile policy pursuedby the United States against the Democratic People'sRepublic of Korea  in labelling our country a“terrorism-sponsoring nation”. In this regard  we notethat the United States has recognized its responsibilityfor the incident and given assurances that suchincidents would not occur again. We also note therecently stated United States position that it has noreason to perpetuate its hostile relations with ourcountry. If this position is put into practice  we will beready to respond in a positive way at any time.Another factor that casts a shadow on positivedevelopment on the Korean peninsula is the suspiciousfuture of Japan. Whether Japan revives its militaristspectre or becomes a peace-loving country is a seriousquestion directly linked to peace and stability in Asia particularly in its neighbouring Korean peninsula.Continued evasion by Japan on settling its past withour country is the main factor that makes us suspiciousof its future orientation. Moreover  such suspicion isincreased as we witness Japanese moves to findpretexts for justifying its rearmament by targeting ourcountry as its “enemy”.Should Japan take the path of militarism  it willobviously strain its relations with other Asian countriesand exert negative effects on the improvement ofNorth-South relations. We hope Japan will not go inthis direction. Japan should find its future in a sincereand early settlement of its past. Now that the North-South joint declaration is being smoothly implemented new  sound international relations will be established inNorth-East Asia once the hostile relations between theDemocratic People's Republic of Korea and the UnitedStates  and between the Democratic People's Republicof Korea and Japan  are resolved.In conformity with this encouraging process  theUnited Nations should also take practical measures todismantle the “United Nations Command”  a legacy ofthe cold war  thus making a due contribution to thisprocess.In order to establish fair international relationsand an international order that will properly representthe new century  it is important to successfullyovercome the challenges to the United Nations Charter.The most serious challenge posed in internationalrelations at present is the emergence of the concept of“humanitarian intervention”.The United Nations is based on the principle ofsovereign equality. The Charter enshrines the principlesof respect for sovereignty and non-interference ininternal affairs as a cornerstone of internationalrelations.These are the major principles based on thereality in which big and small countries exist in theworld. All countries aspire to independence andstruggle to defend their national sovereignty.Encroachment upon the sovereignty of small countriesby big Powers in exercise of power politics is an act ofhigh-handedness  as already judged by the times.“Humanitarian intervention” is a dangerous conceptthat could beautify such acts of high-handedness andeliminate the essential spirit of the Charter.The international relations of the new centuryshould serve to terminate arbitrariness and high-handedness  such as threatening sovereign States byforce and imposing sanctions on them  and to fullyimplement the purposes and principles of the UnitedNations Charter. International peace and securityshould be achieved by strengthening the role of theUnited Nations  not by arbitrariness  high-handednessand intervention by any individual big Power.The role of the United Nations in the field ofdisarmament  particularly nuclear disarmament  shouldbe enhanced. Despite an ever-growing desire andexpectation by international society for disarmamentafter the end of the cold war  the disarmament processis at a standstill  faced with new challenges. Realityrequires that the nuclear disarmament process be turnedinto a United Nations process  instead of being left to28the nuclear-weapon States alone. We are of the viewthat the fourth special session of the United NationsGeneral Assembly devoted to disarmament should beheld as early as possible  taking into due considerationthe demand of a large number of countries.Another challenge to be effectively countered bythe United Nations in international relations is anattempt to politicize the human rights issue. Along withthe use of force  the human rights issue constitutes oneof the two factors straining international relations. Thisis demonstrated in the reality in which United Nationsmeetings that address human rights issues are oftenconverted into an arena of confrontation  notcooperation. In fact  there is no more grave humanrights violation than abusing the human rights issue forpolitical purposes. The United Nations should enhanceits role decisively to ensure that fairness is fullyobserved  and not acquiesce in the application ofdouble standards when dealing with human rightsissues.The twenty-first century should be a century ofdevelopment. Durable international peace and securityare inconceivable without the eradication of povertyand the solution of social and economic problems. Afair international economic order which is conducive tosustainable economic development for the developingcountries should be established as early as possible. Inparticular  it is imperative that the United Nationsfurther the analysis and assessment of the nature anddanger of globalization  as well as its impact on thedeveloping countries  and take necessary measures. Inthis regard  we believe that the Declaration and ActionProgramme adopted at the South Summit held in Cubalast April can serve as an excellent basis for thatpurpose.In order for the United Nations to play a rolecommensurate with the requirements of the newcentury  it should be democratized through reform ofits structure. The main purpose of United Nationsreform is to ensure democracy and strict observance ofthe principles of justice and fairness in all its activities.The General Assembly has now been relativelydemocratized  but it does not have sufficient authority.In contrast  the Security Council has authority andaction capability but falls short of the desired degree ofdemocracy. In particular  the present structure of theSecurity Council leaves a vacuum which allows theUnited Nations to be used as a tool of high-handedness for the Council monopolizes decision-making power onsuch critical issues as enforcement action  including theuse of force. The twentieth century witnessed suchcases on several occasions.We hold that the enhancement of the authority ofthe General Assembly is a prerequisite for ensuringdemocracy in United Nations activities. The Assemblymust be empowered at least to review the issues ofinternational peace and security and to approve majordecisions and resolutions of the Security Council onthese issues.In reforming the Security Council  priority shouldbe given to increasing the number of non-permanentseats  thus correcting the present imbalance in regionalrepresentation. It is also imperative that effective waysbe sought to ensure strict observance of the principlesof justice and fairness in United Nations activities.We consider that one means to this end will be torestore the confidence of the international communityin the United Nations by redressing those issuesmishandled in the past by the United Nations  incontradiction to the purposes and principles of itsCharter  by force of arbitrariness and high-handedness.Independence  peace and friendship are thefundamental ideas of the foreign policy of theGovernment of the Democratic People's Republic ofKorea. The Democratic People's Republic will remaintrue to this idea and faithfully discharge its obligationsas a Member State of the United Nations  so that theUnited Nations can become a truly effectiveorganization that creditably serves the aspirations andrequirements of the new century."
"137",5761,"PRT",55,2000,"It is with thegreatest pleasure that I congratulate you  Sir  on yourassumption of the presidency of this MillenniumAssembly. I pay tribute also to the outgoing President Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  and reiterate to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  my praise for his vision and10for the remarkable and courageous manner in which heis carrying out his duties.My French colleague has already addressed theAssembly on behalf of the 15 member States of theEuropean Union  a statement with which my countryfully associates itself.I will now touch upon questions of particularimportance to my country  Portugal.As the Prime Minister stated here during theMillennium Summit  the United Nations finds itself ata turning point which necessarily calls for the exerciseof reflection on the future of the Organization. In thisera of increasing globalization  we should give theUnited Nations the means to accomplish the missionsthat we have entrusted it with  turning the Organizationinto the foundation of a more stable  united andcohesive international community.The international community faces three greatchallenges at the turn of the millennium: to strengthenour action on behalf of peace  to contribute to theeradication of extreme poverty  and to guaranteeenvironmental conditions conducive to perpetuatinglife on earth.The increasing use of peacekeeping operationsover the last decade  which we have encouraged conclusively demonstrates their importance. Theresults that we have obtained on the five continents tellus with certainty that we have chosen the right path. Tocontinue this effort effectively  the United Nationsmust have at its disposal the necessary resources  bethey financial  technical  civilian  political or military.A credible peacekeeping capacity is in itself adeterrent to conflicts and therefore an integral part ofthe global system of conflict prevention  of which theUnited Nations should be an essential component. Inthis regard  Portugal welcomed with satisfaction theBrahimi report on peace operations. We believe that itslist of recommendations point the way to a process ofreform that will strengthen the capacity of the UnitedNations in conflict prevention  peacekeeping andpeace-building. We should take advantage of themomentum that has been created and concentrate onobtaining concrete results within the next year or two.I would stress  however  that crucial questionswill always be of a political nature. We must muster thenecessary courage to broaden the scope of theresponsibilities of the United Nations. Let us notdeceive ourselves. As the Secretary-General  Mr. KofiAnnan  stated  it is our function to intervene. Allow meto go ever further and to say that it is our duty to doso — to intervene in time  effectively and on the basisof international law.Portugal is ready to do so  as it has shown in thepast. We have participated in peacekeeping operationsin Mozambique  Angola  the Central African Republicand Guatemala  and today we are participating inUnited Nations missions in East Timor  Bosnia Kosovo and the Western Sahara  with more than 1 000peacekeepers. Portugal is currently the 11th-largestcontributor to the United Nations peacekeepingoperations  and first among its European Unionpartners.During the Portuguese presidency of theEuropean Union  we gave decisive impetus to thecreation of the European Union's capacities tointervene  which we see as being offered in the serviceof international peace and cooperation. In the year2003  the Union will have at its disposal a force of50 000 to 60 000 military personnel  to which 5 000police will be added  as well as a civilian structure forcrisis management.This aspect of Portugal's external activities willcontinue to be favoured  and the importance we attachto them is equally reflected in our candidacy for thepresidency of the Organization for Security andCooperation in Europe for the year 2002.In a globalized world  the existence oftremendous  economic asymmetries is a factor ofpermanent tension and conflict. Indeed  about half ofthe world's population lives on less than $2 a day.The turn of the millennium is an opportunity forus to reaffirm our will to combat and eradicate povertyon a global scale. It may be a utopian vision at thispoint  but with our combined efforts it is a goal thatmay be within our reach.In the time that it takes to deliver each of thesestatements in the General Assembly  around 300children under the age of 1 will die. Is this acceptable?Obviously not. Could it be  then  that the human andfinancial resources necessary to fight this tragedy areso great that they force us into accepting it? Theanswer again is no. Many of those deaths could beavoided through better management and without anincrease in resources. Health  like education  should bea priority sector for development assistance.It is vital to combine efforts  policies andinstruments. Direct development assistance must becomplemented by mechanisms to resolve thelongstanding problems of the poorest countries throughreform of the regulatory institutions of the globalfinancial and economic system and through agreementsthat allow poor countries to access the markets ofdeveloped countries without trade barriers.I should like to stress in particular the importanceof developing cooperative mechanisms between theUnited Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions namely a revitalized Economic and Social Council. Ourpriority should be to redefine the role of eachinstitution and to avoid any duplication of effort in afield where the United Nations should play a leadingrole.It is equally important to give responsibility tothe countries receiving aid by demanding that funds beused efficiently or requiring good governance. In thisregard I should like to emphasize that the fight againstcorruption should be a priority of all our Governments.The Millennium Declaration states clearly thatthe principal challenge today is to ensure thatglobalization becomes a positive reality for the entirepopulation of the world  and not a new factor ofexclusion.Only the United Nations is in a position topromote the partnership for change that Kofi Annanreferred to in his report entitled “We the peoples”.Poverty  sadly  is also closely linked to infectionand to contagious diseases such as AIDS  malaria andtuberculosis  which cause millions of deaths every yearand which  in Africa  are laying waste to an entiregeneration and posing a tragic threat to futuredevelopment. More than ever before  it is vital tomobilize the energies of civil society  institutions andthe international community at large to fight infectionand contagious diseases. The European Union and theUnited States recently agreed  at Lisbon  to strengthentheir cooperation in the fight against those scourges.Turning to the environment  we must always bemindful of the fact that economic growth and progressmust not be achieved at any cost  least of all at the costof the future. The United Nations must continue toguide the way on environmental matters  as it has sincethe United Nations Conference on Environment andDevelopment  held at Rio de Janeiro in 1992. But theresponse from States has fallen short — often veryshort — of what we committed ourselves to do inpolitical statements and even in international treaties.Let us not delude ourselves: the United Nations playsan instrumental role in this crucial  strategic area  aswas reaffirmed in the Millennium Declaration  but it isonly States that can produce results. This is not a jobthat can be subcontracted to the United Nations.Here  civil society should use all its influence  bybringing pressure to bear on  and calling to account Governments that think they can deal withenvironmental issues by opting out  as though theywere simply matters of sovereignty. We can no longerthink in that way. Global warming affects us all. Toface this common problem  we need common action ona global scale.For geographical  historical and political reasons Portugal is a country that is linked to the oceans. Forthat reason  we recognize their importance both to theland ecosystem and to the renewal of energy resourcesvital to the sustenance of millions of people. Wewelcome the launching of an informal consultativeprocess on the oceans and the law of the sea  and weattach particular importance to the debate on scientificresearch on marine matters.Let me speak briefly about an initiative to whichmy country attaches great importance. In June  atWarsaw  a group of more than 100 countries  united byshared beliefs  endorsed a declaration entitled“Towards a Community of Democracies”. Theparticipants recognized that there was no single modelto determine how the will of a people should berespected. The Community of Democracies will play arole in uniting the efforts of all countries that believe arepresentative democratic system to be the system thatbest meets that objective.I wish now to speak of some regional matters thatare of particular importance to my country. Africa isone of the great priorities of Portuguese foreign policy.The first Africa-Europe Summit was held during thePortuguese presidency of the European Union  and onthe basis of a Portuguese proposal. The Summit openednew vistas in the relationship between Europe andAfrica which will surely make possible a joint processof reflection on the challenges and problems that the12two continents face. The second Africa-Europe Summitwill be held at Lisbon in 2003.West Africa is at present one of our mainconcerns on the continent. In that connection I wouldmention the situation in Casamance in Senegal; therecent conflict in Guinea-Bissau  from which thecountry is only now beginning to recover; the seriousconflicts in Sierra Leone and Liberia; the problem ofrefugees from those countries and their consequencesfor Guinea; and the instability along the borders of allthose countries.The persistence and potential spread of thosetensions and conflicts seriously threaten the security ofthe entire subregion of West Africa  which could havegrave political  economic and humanitarianconsequences. It is therefore necessary for theinternational community to give greater attention tothis sensitive region of Africa while there is still time.With respect to Angola  we deeply regret the factthat the war is continuing  which we believe is due tothe lack of implementation of the Bicesse and Lusakapeace agreements  and to UNITA's violation of therelevant Security Council resolutions. In our view those instruments continue to be the reference point fora political solution to the Angolan conflict. Wewelcome the strengthening of the sanctions regimeagainst UNITA and reiterate our pledge to cooperatewith the Security Council's sanctions Committee. Weconsider that the presence of the United Nations onAngolan territory continues to be of fundamentalimportance  from both a humanitarian and a politicalperspective. Only thus can the United Nations quicklystep in to support any political solution that mayemerge. I welcome the intention of the AngolanGovernment to organize elections and to hold them in2001. Promotion of the values of tolerance anddialogue and of democratic principles is essential toguarantee a lasting peace.One year after the referendum that allowed thepeople of East Timor finally to exercise their right toself-determination  the United Nations faces a newchallenge: administering East Timor in its transitionalperiod and creating the necessary foundations for anew independent and democratic State that will be afuture member of the Association of South-East AsianNations and of the Community of Portuguese-SpeakingCountries — and that we hope can be admitted tomembership of the United Nations by 2001. Portugalhas always supported East Timor and will continue todo so. Our total financial assistance  not counting ourparticipation in the military component of the UnitedNations Transitional Administration in East Timor  willreach an estimated $50 million this year  and willremain at that level in 2001 and 2002. Much remains tobe done  but the able leadership of Sergio Vieira deMello and the exceptional qualities of Xanana Gusmãoallow us to look to the future with optimism.The tragic events that took place in Atambua on 6September  in which three members of the staff of theOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner forRefugees lost their lives  deserve unanimouscondemnation by the international community. Theytestify to the impunity with which the militias act inWest Timor. Two days after those events  furthermilitia activity took place along the border  which ledto the death of 11 people  this time of Indonesiannationality  who were assisting various non-governmental organizations and internationalorganizations. We welcome the swift response of theSecurity Council in adopting its resolution 1319 (2000)and in deciding to dispatch an evaluation mission toWest Timor.The new democratic Government of Indonesiahas  in general  shown a spirit of cooperation. It is nowtime for it to honour its commitment to re-establish lawand order in West Timor  disarming and dismantling itsmilitias. Their continued existence destabilizes thetransition process in East Timor and is an affront to thecivilian and military authorities of Indonesia disturbing the consolidation of the democratic regimein that country. For our part  we stand ready to workwith the Indonesian Government  helping it to resolvethis problem. It was in that spirit that the PortuguesePrime Minister proposed here last week a stability pactfor East Timor. It is in that spirit that we willparticipate in the quadripartite summit to be held soonat Jakarta  which will bring together high-levelrepresentatives of Indonesia  East Timor  Australia andPortugal.Guaranteeing peace  fighting poverty  protectingthe environment and leaving a better world for futuregenerations: that is our duty at the turn of themillennium. Only through democracy can Governmentsrespond to those aspirations of our societies. Only areformed and ever more democratic United Nationswill be able to help us face this common challenge."
"138",5807,"PRY",55,2000,"Before I begin  I should like to make apersonal comment. As a former official of the UnitedNations Population Fund  I should like to express mygreat pride and personal satisfaction at being able tospeak to the Assembly today and to address thosecountries with which I have worked  together with myother colleagues in the United Nations. All of us  ofcourse  share a hope that our dream of a better worldwill come true.It is a great source of satisfaction to see thePresident preside over the work of this Assembly familiar as I am with his great personal andprofessional skills  which guarantee the success of ourwork. I should also like to express to his predecessor Minister Theo-Ben Gurirab  our gratitude andrecognition of the efficient work he has done.Similarly  I would like to thank the Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  for the detailed report on the work ofthe Organization that he has presented. It describes theimportant work carried out by the United Nations overthe past year as well as the challenges for the future.I should also like to express on behalf of myGovernment our pleasure at the entry of Tuvalu as anew Member of our Organization. This is an importantstep forward along the road of universality  which isthe aspiration we all share.The recently concluded Millennium Summit wasa useful instrument for reflection by our Heads of Stateupon the present and future of the Organization. ThisOrganization must adapt its structures and mechanismsfor action to the new challenges facing humanity. I amcertain that the numerous suggestions that have beenmade will help establish clear lines of action so theUnited Nations can operate more efficiently andeffectively.At the last summit of the Rio Group  which tookplace in Cartagena de Indias  Colombia  the Heads ofState who comprise this political consultationmechanism endorsed the Cartagena Declaration as oursingular contribution to the Millennium Summit and tothe future of the United Nations. It is our intention toensure appropriate follow-up to the initiatives andaspirations expressed in this document in order to makecertain that they become a reality in the future for thebenefit of all humanity in terms of democracy  tradeflows  better dynamics in international relations interms of human security and the pursuit of multilateralsolutions.I fully agree with the Secretary-General of ourOrganization when he says that the conclusion of onecentury and the turn of the millennium provide us witha unique vantage point for reflecting upon our commondestiny. Fifty-five years have passed since the creationof the United Nations  and during that period we haveseen many auspicious as well as many worrying events.Let us pause for a moment and think about all the goodthat we have done and the good that we have failed todo  as well as upon what we have done wrong orshould not have done.The conclusion of the cold war  of which thisOrganization was one of the most important theatres seemed to herald a period of peace and prosperity forhumanity  in fulfilment of the Biblical mandate to beatour swords into plowshares. Nevertheless  humanity isstill facing terrible threats  not only to its security —because war and violence persist in new and moresophisticated forms — but also threats to its veryexistence  in light of the prospect that our planet maybecome uninhabitable as a result of human activities.Consequently  in the new millennium the UnitedNations will be equally if not more important than itwas in the previous millennium. Our Organization mustof course adapt to new times. The reform of ourOrganization cannot be postponed any further. Thestructures of its main organs must adapt to the newcharacteristics of the international community  with theincreasing number of nations which belong to it. Wemust adapt to the increasing role of civil society  thespread of the system of representative democracy  theglobalization of our world markets and the intolerablepersistence of serious social deficits in most of ourStates.23In particular  our Organization must adapt so thatour efforts towards development are renderedappropriate for each individual wherever he or she maylive and wherever his or her community may belocated  and wherever we want to see our familiesgrow.The human being as the centre of developmentwill continue to be at the centre of our mandate  as wellas the commitments assumed by each and every one ofour countries at summits of the United Nations over thepast decade. The efforts made by each man  woman orchild to take advantage of the opportunities offered byglobal markets and new economic trends is first andforemost a local and community effort and secondly anational effort  which can create opportunities forgrowth and ensure participation for each man and eachwoman.The reorganization of the United Nations  and inparticular its system of development  must ensure thatit can respond creatively and flexibly to thesecommunity and national efforts. This will make itpossible progressively to improve for each individualdaily access to health  education  sanitation services technology and reasonable credit  as well as theequitable participation of women in productiveactivities. In that way  we can ensure the integration ofall our citizens into the global market and make certainthey can benefit from this process.It is vital that the cooperation activities of theUnited Nations be well structured and have a realimpact on our populations  in particular women children and adolescents. It is essential that theseactivities create an environment of national dialogue ineach of our countries with a view to harmonizing viewson development and creating consensus on the meansfor achieving growth  in order to give true meaning tosocial and productive investments and to meet thequalitative demands of civil society.National consensus must necessarily be the basisfor global consensus  and today more than ever it mustbe the basis for consensus among integrated groupsthat wish to negotiate with each other. However  areorganized and renewed United Nations  in theultimate analysis  must be the guarantor of thewell-being of each of our citizens. The United Nationsexists so that all of our citizens can benefit from newtrends in trade  development and technology in order toachieve growth as individuals and as families and toimprove their quality of life and feel that they live in abetter world where their sons and daughters will beable to continue to grow  in peace.Turning to another subject  we are concernedabout the delay in the adoption of a decision about thefuture composition of the Security Council  because wefeel that its enlargement cannot be postponed. Itscomposition must become more equitable andrepresentative and allow for a better political balance.This gradual process of democratization must beginwith an increase in both categories of members permanent and non-permanent  and it should alsoinclude both developed and developing countries.Special attention should be given to the fact that thedeveloping countries are now under-represented in thatvery important body. Paraguay also believes that thisreform should include the gradual elimination of theveto rights of the permanent members.We welcome the Brahimi report  whichestablishes a valid framework for the reform andstrengthening of United Nations peacekeepingoperations. Paraguay has always supported suchoperations as a fundamental mechanism contributing toworld peace and security.I should also like to refer to the regular budget ofthe Organization  in connection with the aspirations ofsome developed countries to reduce their contributionsto a lower percentage. We believe that this should notmean that the assessed contributions of developingcountries would increase to unprecedented percentages even though the figures involved may seem to othersmodest or insignificant. It is paradoxical that somedeveloped countries would have their contributionsreduced precisely when they are enjoying excellenteconomic growth  while other countries that areexperiencing difficulties would see an increase in theircontributions.It is in this context that we must seriously studythe scale of assessments so that when we adopt it thisyear we will achieve a fair and equitable distribution ofthe financial burden of this Organization. We hope thattogether we will find balanced solutions and equitableformulas and timetables for redistributing thebudgetary burden so that we can promote andreactivate the participation of large and small States inour Organization.International relations have acquired a newdimension as a result of the revolution in computer24technology  telecommunications and communicationsin general. The effect of this is what we callglobalization  which has both positive and negativeconsequences. On the one hand it has produced achange in the consciousness of human beings  who forthe first time feel they are part of a whole — that is  ofhumanity in its entirety. On the other hand  it hasincreased the divide between the poorest countries andthe more advanced countries owing to the advantagesaccruing to those that are better prepared for thedismantling of national barriers. In these conditions solidarity takes on a new urgency. It is an act of justicefor those peoples who see all their potential progresssubordinated to this process.In this regard  we fully agree with recentstatements made by the representative of the Holy Seeduring the special session of the General Assembly onsocial development  to the effect that the benefits ofgreat scientific advances must be shared by all peoplesand should not be enjoyed exclusively by the few.Otherwise we will merely be perpetuating differencesand widening the gap between rich and poor countries.We know that decades of development assistanceunder past conditions have not succeeded very well ineradicating poverty and cultural backwardness in vastregions of the world. Nevertheless  this should notbecome a pretext for reducing the amount ofdevelopment assistance  especially multilateralassistance  nor should we see any increase inconditionality. We believe fully in the multilateralapproach  and we should totally reject conditionalitywhen determining how to provide developmentassistance. Nor do we wish to justify the lack of goodgovernance in many nations  which has meant in somecases that efforts were wasted to a great extent andonly fuelled corruption and caused the loss of age-old noble traditional practices.In the recent elections for the vice-presidency ofthe Republic  my country demonstrated once again thepreference of our region for representative democracy.In the elections  which all observers consideredexemplary because of the discipline  civic spirit andparticipation shown by the citizens  we saw theelection of the opposition candidate  of the radicalliberal party  Mr. Julio César Franco. The fact that twoparties  until now adversaries  can share power is farfrom negative. Rather  it constitutes an opportunity toestablish lasting political stability through theestablishment of a Government of national unity thatcan efficiently foster the institutional and economicreforms needed in our country in order to achievesustained progress.I would like to take this opportunity to expressour gratitude — to the international community  to ourfriends in the Southern Common Market(MERCOSUR)  the Rio Group  the European Unionand the Organization of American States  and to theUnited States of America  Japan  the Republic of Chinaand other countries around the world — for theirconstant support for our process of democratization. Iwould like to say to all of them that thanks to theirefforts Paraguay is continuing along the road todemocratic growth.We are certain that the spread of democracy andthe increasing exercise of its freedoms by peoples willbring greater effectiveness to our State institutions inthe short term. This  together with the increasing roleof the private sector  can create fertile ground forinvestment and the transformation of productiveactivities in a large part of the world  leading to areduction in unemployment and poverty.International cooperation  for its part  mustestablish clear priorities and offer what each of usneeds. It cannot be simply humanitarian aid  althoughhumanitarian aid is fully justified in emergencysituations. Instead  international cooperation should beaimed at the integral  sustainable development ofpeoples. These are two words that are used andmisused — “integral” and “sustainable”. When we say“integral”  we understand it to mean that aid must tryto come to grips with the entire set of developmentproblems of each country and of each individual  inorder to guarantee respect for human rights — not onlypolitical rights but also economic and social rights; andmerely partial solutions should not be offered.When we say “sustainable” we mean thatassistance must not become an addiction for thebeneficiaries. It should empower them to continuealong the road to progress relying on their own effortsand should guarantee growth for future generations.Combating poverty means building peace. Thesecurity of the world must be based on the eliminationof the underlying causes of violence  two of theprincipal causes being ignorance and poverty. Thisdoes not exempt us  however  from taking effectivemeasures to limit the use of the instruments ofviolence  from their most deadly form  such as25weapons of mass destruction  to the more conventional including small arms. In the latter case  my countrysupports the initiative to establish an international legalinstrument with specific measures to check the illegaltrade in such weapons.The preservation of our natural environment is agreat source of concern and a subject for reflection.Paraguay  like many other developing countries  givesextremely high priority in its national policies topreserving the integrity and diversity of our naturalheritage  handed on by our ancestors. This is not onlybecause on it depends our current and future wealth but also because we are fully aware of our graveresponsibility to all humanity  since we are theguardians of resources needed for its very survival.Paraguay reaffirms its resolve to continuerespecting and implementing the principles establishedin Agenda 21. In this regard  we attach high priority tothe participation of the States parties in the legalframework developed during the implementation phaseof the Agenda. With great pride I report that Paraguayis a fully fledged party to the most importantinternational agreements on the environment.In this area  finally  it is important to mention theneed to come to grips with the grave problem of theunsustainable use of water resources. It is necessary tointensify scientific cooperation and research in order toreduce the effects of environmental disasters  bothnatural and man-made.We believe that an equitable and fair trade systemis vital for our development. In this regard  we rejectany intent to perpetuate protectionist measures in thedeveloped countries  particularly subsidies foragricultural production and exports  as well as the useof technical regulations as trade barriers againstmanufactured products. We claim our right to freeaccess to the world's markets for those goods in whichwe are competitive.On this occasion  as we highlight the importanceof reaffirming our commitment to this Organization  Ibelieve it is appropriate to stress the essential role thatthe international legal framework can play in theachievement of our common objectives. In this regard the Government of Paraguay has paid special attentionto the invitation by the Secretary-General to allMember States to take advantage of this opportunity tostrengthen our support for the international legalframework by signing  ratifying or acceding to treatiesdeposited with him that bear a special relationship tothe spirit and objectives of the Charter of the UnitedNations.In this respect  I am very pleased to announce thaton behalf of the Government of the Republic ofParaguay I have signed the following internationalinstruments: the Optional Protocols to the Conventionon the Rights of the Child — on the involvement ofchildren in armed conflict  and on the sale of children child prostitution and child pornography; theInternational Convention on the Protection of theRights of All Migrant Workers and Members of theirFamilies; and the International Convention on theElimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. Ishould also note that the Rome Statute of theInternational Criminal Court  of which Paraguay wasone of the first signatories  is in the process ofparliamentary approval.I conclude by reaffirming the conviction of mycountry's firm belief in the United Nations  which ismore necessary than ever in order to meet the greatchallenges of peace and development  which  despitesignificant progress  continue to be an urgent need of agreat part of humanity."
"139",5826,"PSE",55,2000,"At the outset allow me to convey toMr. Holkeri our congratulations on his election asPresident of this session of the General Assembly expressing our full confidence in him and wishing himevery possible success. This session has specialimportance for Palestine and we hope that during itsproceedings and under his leadership historic steps willbe taken in our favour. I should also like to thank HisExcellency Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  President of thefifty-fourth session  a fighter for freedom and a fighterfor peace  for his excellent leadership during the courseof the past year. I would be remiss if I failed to seizethe opportunity to express our special thanks toMr. Kofi Annan  Secretary-General of the UnitedNations  for his effective leadership and for his specialinterest in the situation in the Middle East and thepeace process there.As we meet in the wake of the MillenniumSummit  it is incumbent upon us to seek to build upon22its outcome beginning with implementing theMillennium Declaration and adopting it as a guide forour work in the next era. This should be the case notonly with regard to globalization and future social andeconomic issues  but also with regard to one of themain tasks not fully achieved during the past era  namely  the achievement of self-determination bypeoples under colonial domination and foreignoccupation. That task will not be fully achieved untilIsraeli occupation comes to an end and the PalestinianState has been established in accordance withinternational legitimacy. For us this is the stepnecessary to place ourselves side by side with othermember States on the road to development  democracyand prosperity and so that we may be allowed to carryour small share of responsibility towards theinternational community and its future tasks.As President Yasser Arafat mentioned in hisaddress to the Millennium Summit  the PalestineCentral Council met to consider the situation as theagreed date between the Palestinian and Israeli sidesfor reaching a final status agreement  13 September2000  approached; that date was also the deadline ofthe agreed-upon extension of the five-year interimperiod that originally ended on 4 May 1999. ThePalestine Central Council addressed this situation witha high level of responsibility towards our people andtowards the peace process and took a difficult decisionseeking a balance between the natural and historicrights of the Palestinian people to their State  based onthe partition resolution 181 (II) and in accordance withthe Declaration of Independence of 1988 and our rightto establish this State at the end of the interim period on the one hand  and preserving what some have calledthe last chance for the peace process and for reachingan agreement between the two sides through anadditional extension and the decision to continue thenegotiations for the next five or six weeks on the other.The Council thus decided to delay the establishment ofthe State and at the same time mandated the ExecutiveCommittee and the presidency of the Palestine NationalCouncil and the Legislative Council to take thenecessary steps in this regard  including completion ofthe constitutional declaration and laws for presidentialand parliamentary elections  as well as the submissionof an application for membership for the State ofPalestine in the United Nations  followed by a reporton these steps to the Central Council no later than 15November 2000  the anniversary of the Declaration ofIndependence.That decision means first and foremost our desireand commitment to reach an agreement with the Israeliside if that side is truly ready for that. Secondly  it alsomeans the agreement by the Palestinian side topostpone the establishment of the State  not only untilthe end of the transitional period and its extension  butuntil the end of the realistic opportunity for achieving apossible final agreement at the present time. Webelieve that no one can expect us to go beyond that andaccept the continuation of the present transitionalsituation that is impossible to endure. We furtherbelieve that all States  including those that haveadvised us to postpone  will understand this and willthus be ready to provide the necessary support for oursteps  including support for the application of Palestinefor membership in the United Nations.The assumption of power by the current IsraeliGovernment was coupled with a chorus of positivevoices that led to increased hope for rapid and honestimplementation of the agreements signed by the twosides aimed at achieving a final agreement in theagreed time. We honestly wanted to believe this anddealt with that Government positively and with fullcommitment to the agreements. But the stubbornrealities began to impose themselves on the ground regardless of the wishes and the artificial positivevoices. The current Government did not implement anyof the provisions of these agreements except thoseprovisions that the former Government had explicitlycommitted itself to in implementation of the Wye RiverMemorandum of October 1998. This Government hasnot carried out one centimetre of redeployment morethan Mr. Netanyahu had committed himself to  and ithas also failed to carry out the third redeployment.Illegal settlements  which are destructive to the peaceprocess  have continued  even in Jabal Abu Ghneim which was the reason the General Assembly convenedits tenth emergency special session. A number of otherillegal measures and practices have also continued creating a negative and tense climate. Amidst all ofthat  final status negotiations started and we witnessedIsraeli foot-dragging and procrastination that we couldnot understand and that has led to more doubts andtension.Then came the Camp David Summit  for whichthorough preparation was needed before beingconvened  something that was not accepted by theIsraeli side. Despite everything  the Summitrepresented a very important opportunity to move into23a new  serious phase of negotiations through thepersonal involvement of President Bill Clinton and hisSecretary of State and the rest of his team. We highlyappreciate all the efforts made for the success of theSummit. For our part  we spared no effort in the samedirection. However  we believe that Israel's lack ofreadiness to comply with the terms of reference of thepeace process prevented the success of such efforts.In the wake of the Summit a campaign waslaunched by some parties and some biased mediaorganizations to absolve the Israeli side of itsresponsibility and to place undue pressure on thePalestinian side. For example  some say that the Israeliside progressed from its original positions during thenegotiations more than the Palestinian side. That isfactually incorrect  in addition to being the wrongyardstick to apply. It is incorrect because thePalestinian side has progressed from its originalposition more than the Israeli side  but that happenedwith the start of the peace process and the acceptanceof the bases of such a process. The Palestinian side hasaccepted  despite the historic injustice  establishing itsState in accordance with the partition plan  which gaveus less than half of mandated Palestine  and hasaccepted as the basis for settlement Security Councilresolution 242 (1967)  which gives us less than aquarter of mandated Palestine. Is there a moremomentous concession than this? Is it possible toforget that and only look at positions taken during theCamp David negotiations  regardless of the past?It is also the wrong yardstick to apply because theappropriate yardstick should be the closeness of thesides to the agreed basis of the peace process and theircommitment to Security Council resolution 242 (1967) the implementation of which is the goal of the peaceprocess  and not the extent of their movement fromoriginal positions  especially if such positions wereillegal and irrational. Needless to say  the Palestinianside has fully adhered to this resolution and has neverattempted to circumvent it  whereas the Israeli side hasnever stopped pursuing positions violating thatresolution and aiming to usurp more and morePalestinian land and rights.Let us have another look at the positions of theparties on some specific issues  so that all may beaware of the details of the situation. With regard toJerusalem  the first kiblah and the third of the holysanctuaries and the cradle of Jesus Christ  the otherside claims that it made substantial concessions whilethe Palestinians did not. It also claims that we have notshown enough sensitivity towards the holy sitespertaining to Judaism. All of this is incorrect. Thesigned agreements state that Jerusalem will be an issuefor negotiation  which means the whole ofJerusalem — occupied East Jerusalem and WestJerusalem  which is under de facto Israeli control. Forour part  we have accepted that West Jerusalem shall beunder Israeli sovereignty and become the capital ofIsrael. We have demanded the end of the occupation ofEast Jerusalem so that it may come under Palestiniansovereignty and be the capital of Palestine. We haveaccepted that the city shall be open  and have acceptedall kinds of guarantees for freedom of conscience worship and access to all holy places under Palestiniansovereignty. In return for such flexibility  Israel is notsatisfied with recognized sovereignty over WestJerusalem  but seeks also to usurp parts of occupiedEast Jerusalem.With regard to the Jewish holy places  we fullyrespect their sacredness  and Islam recognizes the threemonotheistic religions — Judaism  Christianity andIslam — and all their prophets. Thus  we have shownevery possible flexibility  even with regard to thoseplaces on lands in occupied East Jerusalem  to whichresolution 242 (1967) is applicable. We have acceptedthat the Western Wall of Al-Haram Al-Sharif  which isknown to the Arabs and Muslims as Al-Buraq Wall andto the Israelis and Jews as the Wailing Wall  shall beplaced under Israeli control  bearing in mind itssacredness to Judaism and consistent with the situationsince the British mandate on Palestine. In return for ourflexibility Israel not only seeks sovereignty over theWestern Wall  but further challenges our sovereigntyover Al-Haram Al-Sharif and seeks to maintain someform of sovereignty over it  something that will not beaccepted by any Palestinian  Arab or Muslim leader not now and not in the future.We have recently taken a major additional step inthis regard by indicating our readiness to accept acertain mechanism for ensuring that no excavations areconducted under Al-Haram Al-Sharif  or even ourreadiness to accept Muslim sovereignty over Al-HaramAl-Sharif through the Al-Quds Committee of theOrganization of the Islamic Conference (OIC). Thisrepresents the utmost that can be done in terms ofdealing with an Arab and Muslim trust over Palestinianland.24With regard to another important issue  namely Palestinian refugees and their rights  the Palestinianside has upheld their rights in accordance withinternational law  like any other refugees in the world and in accordance with relevant United Nationsresolutions  in particular resolution 194 (III)  includingtheir right to return and to compensation. At the sametime  we have shown our readiness to accept specificimplementation mechanisms to be agreed upon. Inreturn for our flexibility  Israel refuses to recognize itsresponsibility for this human tragedy and refuses torecognize the rights of the refugees  including theirright to return  and wants only to compensate them  andeven that at the expense of others and not in itscapacity as the party that seized their lands andproperties. Yesterday the Assembly heard Israel'sspokesman repeat what has been said  attempting notonly to deny Israel's responsibility but also denying theindividual property of the refugees  more than 5.5million dunams of land  legal and full property ofindividuals. The Acting Foreign Minister attempted toput an end to that in an address to the Assembly.The third important issue is that of settlementsand borders. We have affirmed that settlements areillegal and must not be built on Palestinian lands.Furthermore  Israel must withdraw to the armisticelines of 1949  which are commonly known as the linesof 4 June 1967. At the same time  and in order toresolve some of the demographic problems illegallycreated by Israel  we have shown our readiness toaccept changes in the border lines on the basis of fullreciprocity. In return for such flexibility  Israel stillattempts to appropriate more land and to annex otherparts of occupied Palestinian territory. However  wegenerally feel  or at least hope  that the differences onthis and the remaining issues are less sharp than thedifferences I indicated regarding the two previous ones and it is hoped this might signify a real change in theIsraeli position regarding all issues.We have not lost hope yet. We are still committedto the peace process and to serious and continuousnegotiations in the coming weeks. Yet this morning wewere surprised to hear the spokesman of the IsraeliGovernment announce that the negotiations aresuspended. We hope that the Israeli positions aretactical and that the Israeli side will in the finalanalysis respect its commitment to the bases of thepeace process. We want an agreement  an agreementthat will remove us from the cycle of confrontation andthat will carry forward both sides  and the entire regionand its future generations  to a new era. Such anagreement must be balanced  reasonable and based oninternational law  the basis of the peace process. Thisrequires a continuation of the necessary efforts andunbiased support of the two cosponsors of the peaceprocess  particularly the United States of America other concerned parties in the region  the EuropeanUnion and interested parties throughout the world. Weare ready and look forward to such a historic agreementbetween the two States  Palestine and Israel.During the Millennium Summit much was saidabout the United Nations and its past and future role.We wish to add that the United Nations isindispensable when it comes to the question ofPalestine and the situation in the Middle East. We havealways emphasized the permanent responsibility of theUnited Nations for the question of Palestine until it iseffectively resolved in all its aspects  and while wealways called for more United Nations involvement inthe Middle East peace process  others have attemptedto exclude and neutralize it. We are convinced that inthe coming decisive period the role of the UnitedNations will become more important  no matter whatthe circumstances. If we were  God forbid  to arrive ata dead end despite all our strenuous efforts for thesuccess of the peace process  then we would come tothe United Nations and expect to receive its protectionand support. We will work to obtain membership and tocontribute to the resolutions of the United Nations  theestablished committees and the relevant programmes sothat all might provide an additional boost for theachievement of our people's legitimate rights including their right to the establishment of theirindependent State with Jerusalem as its capital  aftersuch a long period of trial and tribulation.If our hope is fulfilled and we are successful inreaching a final agreement with our neighbours  thenwe expect that the need for the United Nations and itsorgans will be greater. The United Nationsresponsibility in all its forms will continue until theend of the implementation period and there will be aneed to legitimize some aspects of the agreement andperhaps to complement them. There will also be a needfor United Nations assistance during theimplementation period with regard to many aspects  inparticular with regard to Palestinian refugees  includingthe continuation of the work of the United NationsRelief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the25Near East. We will then propose the specificreactivation of the United Nations ConciliationCommission for Palestine  which was established byresolution 194 (III) and is composed of the UnitedStates  France and Turkey  and the use of the records ofthe Commission related to land ownership in Palestine.These records were updated by the United NationsSecretariat  in cooperation with the Committee on theExercise of the Inalienable Rights of the PalestinianPeople  and can now be used. In any case  the need forthe United Nations will increase  and we call forpreparedness for that eventuality.There are other aspects of the Arab-Israeliconflict that must be resolved in order for acomprehensive peace to be achieved in the region. Inthis context  we reaffirm the necessity of reactivatingthe Syrian-Israeli track of the peace process as well asthe need for Israel to accept the principle of fullwithdrawal from the occupied Syrian Arab Golan to thelines of 4 June 1967. We declare our solidarity with oursister country  Syria  and support its just demands including Israeli adherence to the terms of reference ofthe peace process. We also express our great happinessat the Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon. Wecongratulate the brotherly Lebanese people on theliberation of their territories and support their otherdemands regarding the achievement of peace betweenLebanon and Israel. In this context  we affirm ouragreement with regard to rejecting the resettlement ofPalestinian refugees in Lebanon and the need for themto return to their homes  and  until then  we expectthem to benefit from normal living conditions.With regard to Arab national security and theprinciple of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons  wereaffirm the need for Israel to accede to the Treaty onthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  and to putall its nuclear facilities under the supervision of theInternational Atomic Energy Agency. We also supportattempts aimed at establishing a region free fromweapons of mass destruction in the Middle East andbelieve this to be an essential condition for establishinga new reality in the region  which we all seek toachieve.In the context of the wider Arab region  thesuffering of the brotherly Iraqi people is still a sourceof real concern for us all. We call for a speedy end totheir suffering. We also call for the total lifting ofsanctions imposed on sisterly Libya and brotherlySudan. We also call for the peaceful settlement of theissue of the three islands between the United ArabEmirates and Iran in a way that preserves the rights ofthe United Arab Emirates in these islands. We alsoexpress our happiness for the recent steps taken inSomalia and express our hope that the stability andreconciliation process will continue. We reaffirm theneed for efforts to be made to resolve problemseverywhere  including  inter alia  those of Cyprus  ofthe great African continent  particularly the Horn ofAfrica  of the Democratic Republic of the Congo andof some of the surrounding countries. The resolution ofsuch problems will represent an important contributiontowards placing that continent on the road todevelopment and progress.Before concluding I must once again express ourdeep thanks to our brothers and friends everywhere particularly to fraternal Arab countries  Islamiccountries and non-aligned countries  as well as to allother friends for their principled and continuoussupport. Let this year be the year that will bring to anend the historical injustice that has befallen our people and let it be the beginning of a new life in the MiddleEast for all States  peoples and future generations."
"140",5872,"QAT",55,2000,"I should like at the outset to extend mycongratulations to Mr. Holkeri on his election topreside over the work of this important fifty-fifthsession. It is indeed important because it is the firstsession in the new millennium. We are confident thathis experience and diplomatic capability will be  Godwilling  great assets in our effort to achieve the desiredsuccess. I also extend my sincere thanks to thePresident of the fifty-fourth session  His Excellency Dr.Theo-Ben Gurirab  and to his friendly country Namibia  noting that his outstanding efforts had atremendous impact on solving numerous difficultiesand achieving good results in many matters during thepast session. I should further like to express my thanksand appreciation to His Excellency  Secretary-GeneralKofi Annan  who tried his utmost and has notcompromised  in his effort to realize the goals aspiredto by all peoples of the world. We also appreciate hisendeavour in preparing the report before us.A few days ago the world witnessed a great eventin time and place  hosted in this building. This verysame hall was crowded with a unique assemblage ofworld leaders who came from every corner of the globeto attend the Millennium Summit. The attendance of somany leaders and their desire to participate signifiesmany things  most important of which is their firmrecognition of the role of the United Nations  whichrepresents the hope of the peoples of the world for theachievement of a peaceful coexistence that guaranteessecurity  peace and well-being for all. The SummitDeclaration has deeply impressed us all. We trust thatthe role of the United Nations will grow stronger whenStates  particularly the great Powers  look beyond theirnarrow  short-lived interests  work in the interests ofthis Organization  and firmly abide by its Charter forthe settlement of disputes by peaceful means and byresorting to the international judicial system. Thatwould be a civilized demonstration of the progressachieved by nations and an acknowledgement of thesignificance and fairness of the rule of law  which is aninstrument of security and peace  whose decisionsdeserve respect and full obedience.We  in the State of Qatar  under the leadership ofSheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani  the dearlybeloved Emir of the country  give the United Nationsand all its international organizations their dueappreciation and respect as part of the philosophy ofour system  which is based on truth and justice  bothinternally and externally. We consider democracy andhuman rights to be essential targets that we strive toattain according to our special cultural  religious andsocial characteristics. We thank God that we are aimingin the right direction.As the Assembly is well aware  we live in aregion that has for two decades been plagued bydisasters and crises. No sooner does one problem calmdown than another erupts like an active volcano. Butmany good people from the Arab Gulf  and honourablepeople and lovers of peace from other parts of theworld  are trying their best to establish security in aregion of great importance to present civilization  asthe region has embedded in it a sizeable portion of thesources of energy needed by all. No sooner had theIraqi-Iranian war  which devastated the region and leftit with bleeding wounds  come to an end and peoplehad hopes of a period of rest during which the woundscould be healed  than another crisis occurred  greater indimensions and more complex this time  namely  thesecond Gulf War  the invasion of Kuwait and itsliberation and the economic boycott of Iraq  which hasgone on for a decade so far  killing people  particularlychildren  the ill and the ageing. All of us now knowthat the sanctions have failed to achieve the goal forwhich they were established. Their course has changedso much that they have become like a plague afflictingpeople. Not only do we call for the lifting of sanctionsimposed on Iraq and putting an end to the suffering ofits people  but also for a reconsideration of the issue ofimposing sanctions  whether by individual States orthrough the United Nations  for recourse to sanctionshas completely failed  leaving behind merely rancourand hatred.In referring to the humanitarian situation in Iraqand realizing that humanitarian matters are indivisible we welcome the Secretary-General's appointment ofYuli Vorontsov to be his representative regarding thefate of Kuwaiti prisoners and missing persons  so as tobring this phase of human suffering to an end. TheState of Qatar sincerely hopes that through concertedbilateral and regional efforts a solution will be found to17the problem of prisoners and missing persons  whetherthey be our Kuwaiti or Iraqi brothers.In this context I should like to note that last yearmy Government welcomed the positive developmentand the progress that had been made for the settlementof the “Lockerbie” question. We commend thecooperation and positive response by the Libyan ArabJamahiriya and its fulfilment of its obligations. On theother hand  we emphasize the necessity andinevitability of lifting the sanctions imposed on Libya which had been temporarily suspended  because thewhole issue had been referred to a court following theextradition of the two Libyan suspects. Consequently there is no longer legal justification for thecontinuation of such sanctions.The principle of dialogue or recourse to theinternational judicial system referred to at thebeginning of my address  fully applies to the disputebetween the Emirates and Iran over the occupiedislands. The State of Qatar strives  within the tripartitecommittee established by the Gulf CooperationCouncil  which includes our sister States the Kingdomof Saudi Arabia and the Sultanate of Oman  to reach asolution acceptable to both parties through bilateraldialogue or recourse to international arbitration.Similarly the Middle East question is foremost inour priority concerns. An endeavour to solve thisquestion was launched but it faced obstacles andimpediments that prevented the attainment of themuch-sought-after peace based on legitimateinternational resolutions  particularly Security Councilresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  which were thefoundations of the peace process. The Arabs considerpeace their strategic option  yet a comprehensive peaceis still beyond reach  owing to Israeli intransigence inflexibility and disregard of the basic rights of theArab nation. This intransigence was an impediment topeace on the Syrian-Lebanese track. Israel's refusal towithdraw to the 4 June 1967 borders did not meet theminimum conditions placed by the Syrian ArabRepublic  consistent with United Nations resolutions.Simply because of a few metres Israel wasted a rarechance for peace.The situation on the Palestinian track  which isthe core and crux of the dispute in the region  is nobetter. At the Camp David summit the Government ofIsrael proved that it was captive to the extremist wingof its people and that it was not mature enough to takethe brave decision of bringing to an end a conflict thathas lasted for half a century. Moreover  Israel'sinsistence on the occupation of East Jerusalem isprovocative to the feelings of millions of Muslims andChristians throughout the world. Israel must abide bySecurity Council resolution 242 (1967)  on the basis ofwhich the peace process was launched and which callsfor its withdrawal from all Arab lands to the borders of4 June 1967. Furthermore  the conflict will not come toan end without solving the question of Palestinianrefugees  in accordance with General Assemblyresolution 194 (III).This leads to the question of Israeli settlements inoccupied Arab territories. These settlements are timebombs standing in the way of any resolution to theconflict. Extremist Zionists planted these settlements toblock any peaceful solution  in contradiction ofnumerous General Assembly and Security Councilresolutions that explicitly declare them illegitimate.The State of Qatar  declaring its full support of thelegitimate Arab demands on the Syrian  Lebanese andPalestinian tracks  hopes that the voice of reason  loveand peace will eventually prevail  that a just and lastingpeace in the Middle East will be achieved  and that anindependent Palestinian state  ruling over allPalestinian national territory with Al-Quds Al-Sharif asits capital  will be established. The United States ofAmerica  whose efforts in the peace process areappreciated  is called upon more than at any time in thepast  to exert pressure on Israel to respond to thechallenges of peace and not miss this historicopportunity as a result of narrow  short-livedambitions; the alternative to the peace process is toodangerous for international peace and security  andcould lead us all into a maze whose outcome would beknown only to God.The State of Qatar supports attempts made atnational reconciliation in our sisterly State  the Sudan and endorses the efforts of the Sudanese Governmentin this respect  and hopes that goodwill and sinceritywill lead to consensus so that people's efforts will bedirected towards development and reconstruction. Atthe same time it requests that foreign parties refrainfrom prolonging the crisis at the expense of thebrotherly people of the Sudan  who pay the price withillness  hunger and blood.We also support the tireless efforts of thePresident and the Government of Djibouti to solve theelusive and chronic Somali problem  and thank God18that those efforts have been fruitful. Here we extendour congratulations to His Excellency  PresidentAbdikassim Salad Hassan  the elected SomaliPresident. We wish him and his Government everysuccess. We assure him that he will find in the State ofQatar the necessary help and support in order to sail theboat of national reconciliation safely to land. We alsohope that our Somali brothers will help treat eachother's wounds  put an end to the chaos and destructionthat has befallen their country for a decade  andrespond to the hopes and aspirations of their people who dream of security  peace and a life of honour andfreedom  like all peoples of the world.This leads us to the entire region of the Horn ofAfrica  where war  drought and famine have inflicteduntold suffering on its people  with whom we haverelations of kinship and neighbourhood. We wish themstability and every good  and we hope that their effortswill be directed towards action and construction.The State of Qatar looks closely and with concernat what is plotted against our sisterly State  Indonesia the most populous Muslim State and one that has aprominent place in the minds of all Muslims. Intriguesare being secretly contrived to dissect this peacefulMuslim State under the pretext of human rights andother means of deception that fool nobody. Weemphasize our strong and unreserved support for thesovereignty of Indonesia over all its territories  and forits territorial integrity and national unity. Events inIndonesia constitute a domestic affair  the like of whichoccurs in many States in the world. The IndonesianGovernment  God willing  is capable of putting an endto such problems among its citizens  regardless of theirrace  religion or orientation. We realize too thatfinancial difficulties and poverty are among the mainfactors of these internal problems.It is hoped that this session  the first in the newmillennium  will give us a strong impetus to reflect onour world today with all its disparities embodied in thedaily life of hundreds of millions of people. A closescrutiny of the world will reveal a rich  developedNorth enjoying prosperity  democracy  economicstability and ample opportunities for creativity andinnovation  and a poor South  many of whose States tryhard to catch up with the march of civilization andprogress and utilize all their capabilities for thedevelopment of their infrastructures and theadvancement of their people. However  other States ofthe South continue to suffer from war and conflict bothbetween States and among citizens of the same country thus causing their suffering to increase and theirresources to be wasted on acquiring weapons instead ofbeing used for education  health and the building ofinfrastructures.Since economic factors contribute enormously tothe continuation of wars and disputes  it is incumbentupon us to solve the causes of these crises. That canonly be achieved with the cooperation of all particularly the rich States of the North. Foremostamong those crises are indebtedness and theaccumulation of interest that exhaust the income ofmany States of the South. We hope that the States ofthe North and their creditor institutions will respond tothe numerous appeals to write off  either wholly orpartially  the debts or interest of the poorest countrieswhich strive to upgrade their fragile economies. Wemust also conduct a comprehensive review of theinternational banking system by holding aninternational conference in which all countries of theworld participate  with the aim of establishing a wise fair and just pilot policy for the world economy in thenew millennium  taking into consideration the issue ofdevelopment in third world countries and directinginvestment and capital towards the establishment of agenuine partnership that promotes such development.Globalization has impacted every region andtransformed the world into a small village  no part ofwhich can be separated from the other parts. Therefore the transfer of technology  especially information andcommunications technology  must be accompanied bytransparent globalization  rather than selectiveglobalization wherein third world countries are nomore than markets for the products of developedcountries and large corporations.The process of reforming the United Nationsattracts the attention of all States  and I have referred toit on other occasions at past sessions. The Secretary-General's efforts are outstanding in this respect. For therealization of an active Organization respondingharmoniously to contemporary requirements  its workhas to be activated  the number of its employees whodrain its resources has to be cut back  and the dynamicsof its work  both at Headquarters and in its bodies organs and offices elsewhere  have to be changed.Moreover  the process of reforming the SecurityCouncil requires the Working Group to proceed until itachieves the goal for which it was established. The19Working Group has indeed gone a long way in thatrespect  particularly with regard to the second clusterrelating to procedural matters in the work of theCouncil. As for expanding the Council and increasingits membership  the State of Qatar is committed to theposition of the Arab Group and the countries of theNon-Aligned Movement that calls for a minimumincrease of up to 26 members  taking into considerationequitable geographical distribution and the fact that thelast increase in its membership took place in 1963. Wealso endorse the continuation of the Working Group which  God willing  will reach a consensual solution.At the same time we emphasize the right of the Arabworld to a permanent seat in any impending increase.A few terms and ideas have recently gainedcurrency  and though they sound good they imply agreat threat to States and nations. Danger is notinherent in these terms but is rather a consequence oftheir interpretation or application. Intervention inhumanitarian cases is one of these ideas that can beexploited by the great Powers to justify interference inthe internal affairs of States and the violation of theirnational sovereignty. Promotion of democracies in theworld  the code of conduct and good governance are allrelative  and if they were to be used according to theirpresent interpretation  the world would run accordingto a single style of democracy and one culture wouldprevail. This is so serious that it would eliminatepluralism  which is an enriching factor in the work ofthe United Nations  since it indicates diversity anddifference among peoples and nations. This very samediversity contributes positively to world interests promotes humanitarian and cultural exchanges andenables each of us to accept other cultures and coexistwith them. True democracy is one that is freely chosenby any people for its mode of governance withoutoutside intervention.The year 2001  the United Nations Year ofDialogue among Civilizations  may offer us a goodopportunity to demonstrate more tolerance andcommunication among nations for the benefit ofhumanity. I should like here to refer to the address byHis Highness  Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani  thebeloved Emir of Qatar  on 5 September 2000 when thedialogue among civilizations initiative was launched and to His Highness's emphasis on the significance ofdialogue and communication as an alternative todispute and conflict.Peacekeeping forces play a very important role establishing security and stability in many differentregions suffering from conflict and war  and as timepasses  the cost of operating these forces rise. At thissession the Fifth Committee will discuss the issue ofcontributions to these forces. We maintain that theFifth Committee is the best forum for this  but sincethis process is linked to Members' assessedcontributions to the regular budget  we believe thatfinalizing the scale of assessments first is a reasonablepriority. Our delegation will actively take part in thework of that Committee with the aim of reaching aconsensus  without which we cannot find a solution tothe problem of committing any State to something itcannot meet in the future. We stress that all aspects ofthe economic situation of each State should beconsidered  particularly the emerging economies thatrely on one source of income and that are subject tomarket volatility. My country is one of those States.Finally  the State of Qatar firmly believes in theimportance of the role of the United Nations inestablishing security  stability and peace throughout theworld  and it also believes in the importance ofrespecting the United Nations Charter and its loftygoals  and the need to adhere to the Charter ininternational relations. We trust and hope that thefuture will be bright  when all peoples of the globe willrealize their goals and aspirations and will positivelycontribute to the process of building  development andinnovation."
"141",5918,"ROU",55,2000,"I amdelighted to extend to Mr. Harri Holkeri  the new25President of the General Assembly at its fifty-fifthsession  my sincere congratulations on his election.I warmly welcome Tuvalu  the latest newcomer tothe United Nations family.I cannot continue without expressing my sincereappreciation to our dedicated Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  under whose leadership the winds ofchange keep on blowing.I hail the results of the Millennium Summit. Theviews expressed by leaders from all over the worldhave shown how crucial it is  at this point in history  toreshape our Organization so as to respond adequatelyto the great challenges of our times.From this rostrum  and in other forums  politicalleaders have endeavoured to describe their perceptions expectations and concerns with regard to the all-encompassing manifestations of globalization. Lastyear  my predecessor stated that the United Nationswas all about institutionalized solidarity. Bearing thisidea in mind  we are convinced that the United Nationsshould reshape its role in such a way as to manageglobalization in the interest of all nations and to correctits excesses.Globalization creates opportunities forcommercial  economic and financial expansion.However  improved technological competitiveness andwider economic freedom do not automatically producegreater equity.The contribution of globalization to thebetterment of the human condition will remain limitedto a small number of individuals  social categories andcountries unless it is oriented towards the commongood. This implies that  in the new context ofintegration and participation in the globalizationprocesses  good governance should intelligently andpredictably combine economic reforms with socialresponsibility  adjust the system of education andprofessional training  and initiate institutional reformsthat are able to achieve long-term internal stability andemployment  individual security and social justice  andthe protection of national economic interests  resourcesand the environment.The process of globalization creates a newbalance of power between States  non-governmentalorganizations and transnational corporations. What isin question today is how to use their potential in orderto influence the course of globalization so that it canhave a much more positive impact on people's lives.This means bringing globalization closer to the peopleby promoting human values and democratic principlesand practices; an open  inclusive and pluralisticpolitical culture; economies that sustain a decent lifefor all citizens and prosperity for societies as a whole;and institutions that protect both individuals  with alltheir rights and fundamental freedoms  and thecommon good. Nothing can really benefit the citizensof a country if  at the same time  it prejudices theprevailing international standards of a democraticworld.(spoke in French)We need to pool our efforts in order to enlarge thesystem of values shared by the internationalcommunity. In this globalized yet conflictual world  themanifestation of solidarity can provide a sound basisfor progress and prosperity for individuals and nations.From this perspective  I am convinced that solidarity inthe creation and allocation of educational capital isessential for the access of young people to theopportunities for progress engendered by globalization.I strongly support better access for young people to thenew technologies based on information andcommunication through investments in informaticseducation  based on firm partnerships amongGovernments  business communities and non-governmental organizations. In coping with the newinformatics reality of globalization  good governancehas to act with vision  responsibility and solidarity.Access to educational capital in computer sciencesshould not create new demarcation lines across theplanet  but rather should unite the world  primarilyyoung people  by providing new opportunities forprogress  communication and professional success.Access to digital education will also mean civicemancipation  greater transparency and less corruption.The first key word — solidarity — that I havetried to illustrate should be accompanied by a second:responsibility. For the United Nations as a whole andfor its Member States  responsibility is another way toreact to the forces of globalization  both domesticallyand internationally. That is why Romania welcomes theset of priorities and recommendations formulated bythe Secretary-General in his report to the MillenniumAssembly.Member States know that responsibility requiresthem to give the Organization — in what I would call a26“peace ritual” — the political support and concretemeans necessary to improve the management ofglobalization and to fulfil its mandate. This role is notan easy one. In an era of the most advancedtechnological capabilities  poverty continues to be apainful reality. While there is increasing acceptance ofthe universality of human rights  innocent peoplecontinue to fall victim to inter-ethnic wars. In fightingterrorism  drug trafficking and organized crime  Statesfind that the perpetrators are as well-armed as theirpolice forces. The lack of determination or promptnessin preventing the degradation of the environmentendangers life on our planet. The United Nations muststrive to give globalization a human face.Within our own Organization  responsibility alsomeans that we have to strengthen the authority of theUnited Nations in the maintenance of internationalpeace and security; pursue the process of reforming theSecurity Council  once we have agreed that an increasein its membership is justified; be more effective inassisting Member States to cope with their seriouseconomic and social problems; and enhance theOrganization's capacity to mount and deploy peacemissions on a timely basis.In recent years  we have witnessed the increasingrole of non-governmental organizations and other non-state actors  in particular the powerful transnationalcorporations. There is a need for them to assumeincreased responsibility as well. Non-governmentalorganizations should be prepared to mobilize moreeffectively the resources of civil society in the serviceof the public well-being.As for the transnational corporations  we areaware of their role in stimulating the forces ofglobalization and also in reaping its fruit. It is only fairfor them to assume responsibilities beyond the bordersof their profit. There is a long way to go  so it is hightime to set out in this particular direction.The Global Compact initiative launched by theSecretary-General should be built upon. In Romania we have already explored its potential and the resultsare promising. We believe  indeed  that the businesscommunity can enhance support and enact a set of corevalues in the areas of human rights  labour standardsand environmental protection. After all  profit ismeaningless if it does not lead to the improvement ofthe human condition for all.(spoke in English)We believe that all Member States  includingRomania  can assume a share of the collectiveresponsibility. Indeed  my country is doing its best tomake its own contribution to the goals and purposes ofthe United Nations. First  Romania is party to themajority of the key multilateral treaties andconventions identified as such by the Secretary-General in the context of the Millennium Summit.Secondly  we submitted a valuable resolution entitled “Promoting and consolidating democracy”  thatwas adopted by the Commission on Human Rights on25 April this year. Encouraged by its success  we willinvite the General Assembly to adopt this resolution atthe current session. We are convinced that all membersof the General Assembly are prepared to reiterate theirrecognition of the values  principles and practices thatgive meaning to a democratic society.Thirdly  Romania is a strong supporter of theUnited Nations role in peacekeeping. Our peacekeepershave served in various places where we had no specificnational interest other than maintaining peace on behalfof the world and of the innocent people who make upthe majority of victims of conflicts and disputes. Wehave worked hard to diversify our contribution topeacekeeping. Romania is also proud to be part of thefirst Multinational Stand-by Forces High-ReadinessBrigade. That is a clear way of expressing support forenhancing the United Nations capacity to deploypeacekeepers rapidly and effectively. In the samecontext  we welcome the work of the Panel on UnitedNations peace operations  which has provided aconvincing outline for an important reform of thisparticular function.Fourthly  we also believe that the time has comefor us to try to review the peacekeeping scale ofassessments. As a concrete contribution to this effort  Itake this opportunity to announce that Romania iswilling to gradually move from Group C to Group B ofthe assessment mechanism for peacekeeping. Weappeal to all Member countries to work together to putan end to the current financial crisis.Fifthly  in the same vein  let me emphasize thatRomania has increased its voluntary contribution to theUnited Nations Development Programme's work in ourcountry. This is one way of reiterating our support forand interest in the operational activities of the UnitedNations.27We have always supported creative and efficientforms of cooperation between the United Nations andregional organizations. I am pleased to announce to thisaudience that Romania is preparing to take over thehigh responsibility of the chairmanship of theOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe(OSCE) in 2001. We will work hard to make OSCE amore instrumental organization  based upon a specificcommitment to improving the life of the citizens of its54 participating States. At the same time  we will useto its best the potential for dialogue and cooperationbetween OSCE and the United Nations in conflict-prevention and crisis management  in strengtheningdemocratic institutions and the rule of law  in fightingcorruption and in other realms of common interest.Having said this  I would make a plea to MemberStates to integrate the two essential ingredients foreffective action  namely solidarity and responsibility into the concept of total diplomacy. This means thesystematic use of firm and efficient diplomacy thatshould be called upon before any dangerous tensionsburst into conflict. It also means that we should giveabsolute priority to diplomacy  prevention andcontainment  and in all circumstances use themextensively and comprehensively for the pacificsettlements of disputes. All of the means provided forin Chapter VI of the Charter and others that might becreated through our collective effort of imaginationshould reinforce the Organization's capacity to copewith threats and conflicts  whether predictable orunpredictable.Recent developments in longstanding conflictsand disputes confirm that at the end of any road pavedwith a heavy toll in human lives  material destructionand distorted mentalities  one can find a negotiatingtable. Diplomacy  if used up to the point of exhaustion can eventually prove decisive  provided all thepossibilities of statesmen  professional negotiators public opinion and civil society are comprehensivelymobilized. Intense dialogue  diplomacy and flexibilityfrom all parties are still needed in critical points of theworld  such as Kosovo. Resolution 1244 (1999) of theSecurity Council is a remarkable innovation  whichcombines the specific capabilities of the UnitedNations and some prominent regional organizationssuch as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization(NATO)  the Organization for Security andCooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Council ofEurope. Let us work together  guided by resolution1244  to use the diplomatic and material potential ofthese organizations with full positive impact on all theinhabitants of this province  irrespective of ethnicbackground or religion.I address the same appeal to responsibility to theparties involved in the Transdneister tension problem with the hope that the commitments assumed duringthe OSCE Summit in Istanbul will be respected  so thatnext year we will see concrete measures in thewithdrawal of military troops and arms from this partof the Republic of Moldova.We are aware that there are many complex andunsolved situations for which energetic enforcement isneeded. We are ready to participate in a profound andresponsible debate on humanitarian intervention. Wewould join other delegations in taking a fresh look atthe use of sanctions and seeing how effective they arewith respect to their target and what are theconsequences on the innocent civilian population orthird countries.Among the possible consequences  it is worthmentioning the irrational retaliation reactions fromcountries concerned. A case in point is the perpetuationof the blocking of the Danube — the blocking ofnavigation on the Danube — which makes all theriparian countries suffer. Procrastination  resisting thelifting of the blockade on the Danube under variouspretexts defies international law and ignores theeconomic interests in the region. Every day  shippingcompanies accumulate huge losses  which add to thealready heavy burden on the third countries in the area accumulated during the years of the Yugoslav crisis.Speaking of the situation in the Balkans ingeneral  we have to say that we are far from havingreached complete stability. We are still witnessingconfrontation between the forces of integration andthose of dissolution. Time has come to get rid of theghosts of intolerance and hatred and open the door tothe fresh air of the European spirit of integration. Theresults of the actions by the inflexible regime inBelgrade can be clearly seen today. Unfortunately  ourneighbours are forced to cope with a destroyed andisolated economy and an unpredictable politicalsituation in a Yugoslav State once viable and respected yet finding itself  today  in a process of dismantlement.Politics should be judged by its results  and not by itsintentions. We strongly wish for Yugoslavia to return tothe European mainstream  for which it must re-embrace28the values of democracy  tolerance and freedom ofexpression.The historic conflict in the Middle East is notover yet  but it is diplomacy that still gives us hope fora solution. I applaud the recent efforts made by theIsraeli and Palestinian leaders to come closer to a finalsettlement. This year we have also heard good newsfrom the Korean Peninsula  a part of the world wherehistory separated one people into two hostile parts.Romania is happy to see a fresh wave of diplomaticactions and human contacts that open new windows foran era of which the Korean people would be the firstbeneficiary.For us it is obvious that total diplomacy can besuccessful if it is constantly and solidly based onhuman realities and on the fundamental aspiration ofordinary people to a peaceful and decent life. With thecurrent  unprecedented level of knowledge we havereached  I am confident that we can find  in ourselvesand our societies  resources for greater tolerance mutual respect and dialogue  as opposed to theprimitive inclination to hatred  intolerance andaggression.It is incumbent to the United Nations  as the onlyinternational organization of universal vocation  toidentify new resources for our concerted endeavours tofind solutions to problems of global concern. I am gladto see that our position coincides in many respects withthe major ideas agreed upon by participants in theSummit. The United Nations should stubbornly keepworking to renew its profile and vigour while enteringthe new millennium. Romania will continue to be readyto add its contribution to that effect."
"142",5964,"RUS",55,2000,"The Millennium Summit has given all of usthe priority task of establishing a new and equitableworld order — an order which would meet the interestsof all and every member of the internationalcommunity and ensure adequate solutions to theproblems with which the twenty-first century isconfronting us.I am convinced that in this era of globalizationand enormous scientific and technological progress humankind can and should have a comprehensive andforward-looking strategy. While in the past centuryhuman civilization's main task was that of survival today we are confronted with significantly moredifficult problems which are much more varied interms of their scope and orientation.The strategy of survival must give way to astrategy of sustainable development aimed at ensuringthe prosperity of humankind. It must be based on therecognition of the indivisibility of internationalsecurity  the use of modern scientific and technologicalachievements for the benefit of the entire international6community  and a gradual closing of the developmentgap between the various States.These ambitious goals can be achieved onlythrough the preservation and strengthening of strategicstability in its very broadest sense.Strategic stability means further progress in thedisarmament process  reliable prevention of the spreadof weapons of mass destruction. Today nucleardisarmament and non-proliferation are no longer thesubject of exclusive interaction between Russia  theUnited States and other nuclear Powers. What isneeded is the effective involvement of multilateralUnited Nations mechanisms and the entire worldcommunity in those processes.The outcome of the Millennium Summit providesadditional opportunities for the achievement of a majorbreakthrough in disarmament in the twenty-firstcentury. This will require consistent joint efforts aimedat strict compliance with the agreements alreadyconcluded; a step-by-step reduction and eventualelimination of weapons of mass destruction undereffective international control  and the limitation ofother types of armaments; and prevention of the armsrace in new spheres.The time has come to give a new impetus to thework of the Conference on Disarmament  which hasproved in practice the effectiveness of multilateraldiplomacy under the auspices of the United Nations.Russia advocates the resumption of substantive work atthat forum on major issues on the disarmament agenda.The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons (NPT) provides an indispensable internationallegal basis for nuclear disarmament. This has onceagain been reaffirmed in full by the 2000 ReviewConference. Russia will work to ensure that thedecisions of the Millennium Assembly promote thepractical implementation of the agreements reachedduring that Conference. It is precisely for that purposethat the President of the Russian Federation  VladimirPutin  put forward an initiative on the development andimplementation  under the auspices of the InternationalAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  of an internationalproject designed to phase out the use of enricheduranium and pure plutonium in the civilian nuclearenergy sector.We are satisfied to note the increasing number ofStates acceding to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty(CTBT). Its speedy entry into force is in the interests ofthe entire international community. Having ratified theTreaty  we call on those that have yet not done so tofollow suit.We expect that the United States will followRussia in completing ratification of the Treaty on theFurther Reduction and Limitation of StrategicOffensive Arms (START II)  which will help make itoperational. We are ready to actively continue theprocess of nuclear disarmament and to move towardsthe conclusion of a START III Treaty with an evenlower threshold of nuclear warheads — down to 1 500units. But this will be feasible only if the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty remains intact. It isuniversally acknowledged that this major Treatyconcerns the vital security interests of the internationalcommunity as a whole. Its preservation is a keyelement of global stability and a strong barrier to thearms race in regard to nuclear weapons  missiles andother weapons of mass destruction.Russia will be introducing a draft resolution insupport of the ABM Treaty. We hope that  as was thecase last year  our initiative will receive broad supportwithin the United Nations.A peaceful earth needs a peaceful outer space. Atthe Millennium Summit the President of Russiaproposed the convening in Moscow of an internationalconference on the prevention of the weaponization ofouter space  to take place in the spring of 2001  whenthe fortieth anniversary of the first manned flight toouter space is to be commemorated. We hope that thisproposal will be actively supported.Strategic stability means reliable safeguarding ofinternational information security and counteractingthe use of scientific and technological achievements forpurposes incompatible with universal progress and themaintenance of international peace. Aware of the greatimportance of resolving these most urgent issues Russia will introduce for consideration by the GeneralAssembly a draft resolution entitled “Developments inthe field of informatization and telecommunications inthe context of international information security”.Strategic stability also means enhancing peaceand security on all continents  settling existing regionalconflicts and preventing new ones and cutting offexternal support for them. Millions of people must bespared the death and suffering caused by local crises.7How can this goal be achieved? It is only throughthe joint efforts of all States collectively responsiblefor the world's destiny. Experience has shown thatunilateral enforcement actions cannot guarantee alasting and fair settlement of crisis situations.The notions of sovereignty and the territorialintegrity of States are still very much alive. Disregardfor these principles and military interventioncircumventing the Security Council  whateverhumanitarian pretexts may be used  undermine the veryfoundations of the world order and pave the way forarbitrariness in international affairs.The prevention and settlement of crises shouldbecome a key element of international security in thetwenty-first century. When there is collectivedetermination and goodwill  even the most complexand major problems lend themselves to a politicalresolution.All of this calls for improvement of thepeacekeeping potential of our Organization. People in“hotbeds” of the planet — from Africa and Lebanon toEast Timor — rightly associate with the United Nations“Blue Helmets” their hopes for an end to bloodyconflicts and for the beginning of complexreconciliation processes. They expect rapid andeffective steps from us.We hope that the Millennium Assembly willprovide us with an opportunity to engage in acomprehensive analysis of the work of United Nationspeacekeeping mechanisms and outline ways to increasetheir efficiency. Such is the objective of the report(A/55/305) prepared under the aegis of the Secretary-General by the Brahimi Panel. It is important toconsiderably enhance the United Nations capacity forthe prompt deployment of peacekeeping operations.This can be done through the early completion of thesystem of standby arrangements. Peacekeeping units ofthe United Nations Secretariat need to be strengthened with provision for professional planning  control andcommand of operations.Russia consistently advocates the expansion ofcooperation between the United Nations and regionalstructures in the field of peacekeeping. Chapter VIII ofthe United Nations Charter remains the basis for suchinteraction. Any regional or “coalition” operationshould be conducted under conditions of transparencyand of reporting to the United Nations SecurityCouncil  whereas operations with enforcementelements should be carried out only with theauthorization of the Security Council.The Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)is a major regional partner of the United Nations inpeacekeeping. In many respects  it was the closecooperation between the United Nations and the CISthat made it possible to successfully resolve theconflict in Tajikistan. Such interaction willundoubtedly intensify along with the development ofthe CIS anti-crisis potential. At the same time  for astable peace to prevail in the conflict-affected regionsin the CIS area the volume of international economicand humanitarian aid for their rehabilitation should beincreased.Russia attaches primary importance to theexpansion of cooperation between the United Nationsand regional and subregional mechanisms in Africa toprovide for more effective crisis response on thecontinent. This is evidenced by the Russianparticipation in peacekeeping operations in a number ofAfrican countries.The entire experience of United Nationspeacekeeping activities in recent years clearly showsthe priority of political and diplomatic methods ofconflict settlement. It is precisely these methods thatmake it possible to minimize the suffering of thecivilian population and to find ways to a stable peace.Strategic stability means the security andtranquillity of civil society and of the individual. Thistask can be accomplished only through the combinedefforts of the international community to countercontemporary threats and challenges. These include inter alia  aggressive separatism and religiousextremism  illicit arms trafficking and organized crime.Such an abhorrent manifestation of extremism asinternational terrorism poses a direct threat to securityand stability. Today  terrorists of every stripesometimes act in a more organized fashion than doesthe world community confronting them. We expect thatthe United Nations will step up its mobilization ofinternational capacities to counteract terrorism. Suchcooperation must be based on the clear principles setforth in the Security Council resolution 1269 (1999):no support whatsoever  no safe havens for terrorists the inevitability of punishment for every terrorist act.As to those who violate these principles the SecurityCouncil must be ready to take measures against themprovided for in the United Nations Charter.8Russia intends to ratify the Convention for theSuppression of Terrorist Financing elaborated underUnited Nations auspices. There is an urgent need tocomplete work on the convention for the suppression ofacts of nuclear terrorism  and that work on acomprehensive anti-terrorism convention should bestepped up.Terrorism is often closely linked with drugtrafficking and organized crime. We welcome thecompletion of the development of an internationalconvention against organized crime. Russia intends tosign it in the nearest future. We also support theproposal on drafting an international convention on thefight against corruption.Strategic stability means promoting human rightsand freedoms everywhere. This area is an importantcomponent of the United Nations activities aimed atestablishing a new world order based on internationallaw.Russia contributes significantly to strengtheningthe universal legal regime. Our country has signed theStatute of the International Criminal Court.Speaking of pooling the efforts of States toresolve the twofold task of maintaining internationalsecurity and ensuring human security  human rights andfreedoms  we should constantly bear in mind that in thetwentieth century the rule of the ideology of racialhatred cost mankind scores of millions of human lives.Unfortunately  today  55 years after the great victory itis still premature to speak of total eradication of thebacillus of national superiority.We cannot accept a situation in which people donot have the right to use their mother tongue  aredeprived of their citizenship and jobs on ethnicgrounds  when fighters against fascism are put behindbars while former fascists find favour with theauthorities. The Organization for Security andCooperation in Europe  the Council of Europe and theUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rightsshould firmly respond to all such manifestations.Strategic stability must be based on a solidmaterial foundation. The twenty-first century will godown in history as the century of mankind'sbreakthrough to a qualitatively new level ofdevelopment only if we manage to preserve peace andinternational security and at the same time impartnecessary dynamism and depth to the process ofeconomic and technological equalization between theenormous number of developing countries and thecomparatively small group of leading countries. Thisgoal cannot be achieved overnight. This will require —under the unifying and guiding hand of the UnitedNations — a mechanism for collective democraticmanagement of the international monetary  trade andeconomic systems. They must become more rationaland fair and be targeted against poverty andunderdevelopment.It is important to make the most of thoseopportunities which have been opened up by the newtechnological revolution in order to initiate the processof bridging the gap in the levels of development.Information and communications technologies whosepotential for speeding up global development is onlycomparable to the invention of written language canserve as a driving force of that process. A chance hasemerged to skip over several traditional stages ofdevelopment through the introduction of globalcomputer literacy and information technologies.Mankind  equipped with this powerful instrument  willobtain a real opportunity to begin creating conditionsfor a decent life and the all-around development ofhuman beings everywhere on earth.Strategic stability means the preservation of aclean and healthy environment for the present andfuture generations. The United Nations has done agreat deal to mobilize international efforts in thatimportant field. The “Rio+10” Forum  to be held in2002  will provide an opportunity not only to sum upthe results of those activities but also to outline afuture-oriented follow-up programme.Russia supports the expansion of internationalcooperation within the United Nations framework inthe areas of biodiversity  climate  combatingdesertification  as well as of forest preservation.The recent increase over the last few years in thenumber of natural and man-made disasters and theconsequent growth of the scope of human and materiallosses have made disaster management one of the mostformidable global challenges facing mankind. Whileintensifying the United Nations efforts to promoteinternational cooperation in this field  special attentionmust be paid to the use of state-of-the-art specializedtechnologies for disaster management and to the searchfor innovative mechanisms for their use in the interestsof the entire international community.9The United Nations — a unique universal forumin every respect  which has demonstrated in practice itscentral role in managing international affairs — shouldbecome a guarantor of such comprehensive strategicstability. Russia welcomes the consensus reached at theMillennium Summit on consolidating the UnitedNations as the axis of the present world order. The timehas come for concrete collective measures to transformthe Organization into a sort of operational headquartersfor coordinating activities aimed at ensuring a newstrategic stability based on the principles ofmultilateralism  equality and solidarity in resolvingglobal problems.In conclusion  I would like to emphasize onceagain that the Russian Federation  for its part  is opento the closest interaction with all members of theinternational community in order to make strategicstability a cornerstone of the world order in the twenty-first century and the United Nations its reliableguarantor."
"143",6011,"RWA",55,2000,"MayI first  on behalf of our Minister for Foreign Affairs who could not be here  on behalf of my delegation andon my own behalf  join previous speakers in extendingto the President our heartfelt congratulations on hiselection to preside over the fifty-fifth session.In addition  I congratulate his eminentpredecessor  Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  and the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  on the quality and greatquantity of activities carried out during the recentSummit.I also take this opportunity to congratulate andwelcome Tuvalu  the 189th Member of ourOrganization. We hope that other potential Members such as Western Sahara in Africa  will soon be able tojoin us.The Millennium Summit — in which the Head ofState of Rwanda  Mr. Paul Kagame participated —evaluated the twentieth century and formulatedrecommendations for enhancing the work of theOrganization in the twenty-first century  nowbeginning. As a number of speakers emphasized  thetwentieth century was the era both of great andunprecedented technological triumphs and of crises asgreat as the new means of destruction.The distressing feature of the First and SecondWorld Wars was that they made use of the advancedtechnologies of the late nineteenth century and the firsthalf of the twentieth century to cause enormous humanand material devastation. In 1918 and again in 1945 allhumanity was overwhelmed by the terrifyingconsequences of a world war. “No more wars leadingto the loss of millions of human lives”; “No moregenocide”: these were the calls of the foundingcountries of the United Nations when they met in SanFrancisco in October 1945.Today  as in the past  the international communityfinds itself reliving horrors that it thought it hadbanished for ever  horrors that include the genocide inRwanda in 1994. It certainly was not a lack oftheoretical principles of public morality orinternational law that contributed to preventing orstopping this genocide. These principles had even beengreatly strengthened in 1948 by the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights  and had been widelydiffused throughout the world by many organizationsthat took up the banner of human rights.2The Brahimi report (A/55/305) was needed. Wewelcome its conclusions and recommendations  andtake this occasion to warmly congratulate ourSecretary-General  Kofi Annan  on havingcommissioned it and the two others that preceded it:the Srebrenica report and the courageous Carlssonreport. Our Organization had its failures  but theBrahimi report tells us that we can do better in thefuture. To miss this unique opportunity to reflect onwhat must be done  and how  would be to renounce ourresponsibilities and the principles and values expressedin the Charter of our Organization. Another Rwanda orSrebrenica would disgrace us all.Undoubtedly  we must look elsewhere for the truesource of the problem. It is surprising that even todaycountries that claim to embrace human rights aredelaying and using pretexts to block prosecution of theauthors of the genocide. There are even some who —afraid to accept or think about what happened — referto this genocide as what happened in Rwanda in 1994 being afraid even to think about it. To take just oneexample  I refer to the observations of Minister YerodiaNdombasi on 16 September.In sum  my delegation calls on the internationalcommunity to draw every possible lesson from thegenocide committed in our country  so that “Neveragain such a human tragedy” ceases to be an emptyphrase. Much more urgent is the question of assistanceto Rwanda for rebuilding and making good the hugematerial and moral damage caused by the 1994genocide. Such assistance was recommended in thereports of the Independent Inquiry set up by the UnitedNations and of the Organization of African Unity'sinternational panel of eminent persons. All themembers of the international community representedhere can help Rwanda rebuild and develop. And eachtime we wish to do more for the Organization andhumanity let the Brahimi report serve as a source ofinspiration.I take this opportunity to salute the SecurityCouncil discussions of 15 April  when therecommendations of the Carlsson report wereconsidered and the Council was urged to use itsinfluence to ensure that they were effectively followedup by other United Nations institutions and agencies including the United Nations Development Programme(UNDP)  from which we are awaiting specialassistance as part of the development assistanceprogramme for Rwanda. We venture to hope that thereforms under way at UNDP will lead to the provisionof assistance based on a sincere and enthusiasticpartnership according to the British model eloquentlyoutlined by Prime Minister Tony Blair during theMillennium Summit. It is a partnership steeped inequality  justice and fraternal solidarity for all. Weinvite all our partners to embrace this initiative  in theirrelations not only with Rwanda  but with all the otherdeveloping countries — especially the former colonies.The reports that I have mentioned also justly callon the international community — beyond contributingto the task of overcoming the devastating effects ofgenocide — to contribute vigorously to preventing thiscrime against humanity  in particular by suppressing it.Those who hide  protect and advocate for the criminalsresponsible for the 1994 genocide should think twicebefore persisting in this evil behaviour.I now come to the Congolese crisis  certainaspects of which can be seen as an extension of thegenocide committed in Rwanda in 1994. It is worthrecalling that after their defeat and withdrawal manymilitia members and former Rwandan soldiers whowere authors of the genocide took refuge in what isnow the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Not onlywere these former soldiers and militia members notdisarmed at the time  but they have benefited from newmilitary equipment and training  allowing them tocommit acts of genocide along the borders and preparefor a repetition of the previous widespread genocidecampaign. Is this not sufficient reason to ask aresponsible Government to act to preserve thesovereignty of its country and the security of itspeople? The Assembly can well understand that this ishardly a case of a security pretext  but  rather  of acurrent reality.The plan for a massive invasion by the genocidalforces was thwarted in November 1996 — thankGod — by the forces of the Rwandan Patriotic Army.But from May 1997 to August 1998 it was necessary toonce again repel infiltrations from the Congo and toresist other acts of genocide committed in the north-western part of our country. The horrors of thisrebellion have been the source of a number ofresolutions  but the world seems to have rapidlyforgotten them.It is in this context that our country now has amilitary presence in the Congo — a presence whoseonly purpose is to prevent a recurrence of genocide in3Rwanda by the same Interahamwe militia and soldiersof the previous regime. We have more or lesssucceeded in achieving our objectives. Since 1998 wehave captured many soldiers of the previous regimeand Interahamwe militia  contrary to what MinisterYerodia Ndombasi told the Assembly on 16 September.Most of these soldiers — there are many of them —have rejoined the army. We are continuing to hold 135of them while they await a decision.We have also succeeded in saving some of theInterahamwe and the soldiers of the former regimes  aswell as innocent civilians who had been held hostageduring all this time for purely military and politicalpurposes. In the category of liberated hostages  12 000were repatriated since August 1998  and the processcontinues. We have established centres to receive themon our borders with the Democratic Republic of theCongo  and several humanitarian organizations including the Office of the United Nations HighCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)  have also beeninvolved. This is a secret to no one  and it has beendocumented by the UNHCR at Goma and Gisenyi.Those who are against our successes say that thesepeople are Congolese citizens that we have forced intoexile in Rwanda  because their departure has created avacuum in the operations of the allies of these forces ofgenocide. They are our citizens  and no one can claimto love them as much as we do. They are at home awaiting the others with open arms.My Government welcomed the signing of theLusaka agreements in July 1999 and still upholds them.Their main principles are  first  that the inter-Congolese political negotiations should lead to a newpolitical order in the Democratic Republic of theCongo; and  secondly  that the armed groups should bepursued and disarmed  including former Rwandamilitary and the Interahamwe authors of the 1994genocide  who are still attempting to continue theirmisdeeds  encouraged by certain of our Congolesebrothers who go so far as to deny their presence onCongolese territory with the sole purpose of vilifyingus  to judge by the statement by Minister YerodiaNdombasi last Saturday.The Rwanda delegation deplores the KinshasaGovernment's recently calling into question these sameagreements  despite the fact that they are upheld by allthe countries concerned of the subregion  theOrganization of African Unity and the SecurityCouncil. Just before that  the Congolese Governmenthad created controversy by refusing to authorize thefree movement of United Nations military observers;and that free movement would not be possible outsidethose agreements  to which that country is a party.As far as Rwanda is concerned  we believe that at this time  the Lusaka agreements constitute the onlyframework that will guarantee a lasting peace in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo and in thesubregion. Any other approach in this matter would runthe risk of dangerously jeopardizing the peace processnow under way.Furthermore  the slowness and hesitationsobserved in our Organization regarding the deploymentof the forces of the United Nations Mission in theCongo must be reviewed  and advantage must be takenof the current offers to strengthen the presence of theUnited Nations in the zones evacuated by the signatoryparties of the Lusaka agreements. Any attempt toreduce the force would only lead to the kind ofcatastrophe from which the Brahimi report tries tospare us.I should like to take this opportunity to commendthe growing role of regional and subregionalorganizations in resolving conflicts. As is well known such a positive involvement has already led toconsiderable results in various parts of the world including in South-East Asia and Western Africa. It isour hope that the United Nations will adopt a similarapproach to regional contributions to its machinery forconflict resolution.If the question of conflicts in the world continuesto be one of the major preoccupations of ourOrganization  it would no doubt be a good idea to payspecial attention to their prevention. This requiresbeing attentive to the efforts made to eradicate  or atleast attenuate  the root causes of conflicts  bothdomestic and external.With respect to Rwanda  the halting of the 1994genocide was followed by courageous policies inspiredby the tragic lessons of our recent history. Thesepolicies were translated into the following actions forand factors of national reconciliation  as follows:In July 1994  a Government of National Unityand a Parliament were established including all thecomponents of the Rwanda population and all thepolitical circles of the country. This was an integrativeapproach such as had never before been known in4independent Rwanda  despite the linguistic  socio-cultural and historical advantages that militate in itsfavour.The policy of exclusion  which lasted more than30 years in all sectors of national life  from educationto employment  was eliminated. We are pleased to haveabolished  60 years after its introduction  theidentification card  which categorized people accordingto their ethnic origin and their place of origin and onthe basis of which decisions were taken to kill peopleor to spare their lives.A skilled  professional national army wasestablished  including the forces of the RwandanPatriotic Army  which liberated the country  as well asa portion of the forces of the former regime that hadseparated themselves from the perpetrators ofgenocide. We welcome their bravery and theirdiscipline. The United Nations needs troops of thistype for difficult operations in Sierra Leone andelsewhere.In March 1999 the National Commission onHuman Rights and the Commission for Unity andNational Reconciliation were established.The judicial system was rehabilitated  whichguarantees the independence of the magistrature. Thisjudicial system has been strengthened by a form ofjustice called gachacha  which  while keeping tointernational judicial norms  will benefit from majorinputs of the population at the early stages of a trial.This will have the advantage of accelerating theprosecution of those accused of genocide.In two and a half years more than 3 millionrefugees have been repatriated. This is all the morestriking since Rwanda's refugee problem  having lastedfor more than 30 years  is the most numerous andlongest-standing in Africa. At present the only onesremaining outside the country are families of criminalsresponsible for genocide and some refugees whomRwanda wants to repatriate  but who are still beingmanipulated by those criminals. Our head of Stateasked them to return in his inaugural statement at theSupreme Court  and some of them have begun to comeback voluntarily to the country.Democratic elections were held last year.Following the upcoming local elections  they will becompleted in October. These are orientations that todayguide the policy of unity and national reconciliation the need for which became clear after the genocide of1994.Beyond the eradication of genocide  there aremany challenges that deserve the attention of theinternational community at the beginning of the newmillennium. These relate to the gaps betweendeveloping countries and prosperous countries in thecontext of globalization  the reform of the UnitedNations system and many other current problems  suchas the spread of AIDS.With respect to the gap between developingcountries and prosperous countries  the nineteenth andtwentieth centuries saw gaps between industrializedcountries and poor countries grow even wider. Thisresulted from technology as well as from political andcommercial inequalities left over from the colonial era.After independence many development proposals weremade  such as the provision of 0.7 per cent of grossnational product for development assistance technology transfers  a new international economicorder favouring fair remuneration for commodities  andso on.All these strategies have been the subject of anumber of international conferences. None of them hasbeen implemented sustainably or consistently. Some ofthem have remained theoretical and have not evenbegun to be implemented as programmes. But it isnever too late.For some time now  we have been in an age ofglobalization of economies in the context of structuralgaps that have not changed much since the sixties. Mydelegation would like to emphasize the urgent need forthe preliminary adoption of certain measures tofacilitate the establishment of machinery for efficientglobalization. Is there any need to recall that theexternal debt of developing countries constitutes  inand of itself  a real handicap to their economicrecovery? How can one talk about growth in a contextwhere external debt absorbs 60 per cent or more of theexport income of these same developing countries?What will be the result of globalization in anenvironment where the competition of marketeconomies reduces in advance the role of certain partsof the world to that of eternal consumers  with themonopoly on production elsewhere? These are allquestions that deserve urgent answers and solidarity onthe part of the international community.5My delegation believes more particularly that thesuccess of globalization requires courageousaccompanying measures  such as eliminating the debtfor poor countries and providing support for economicintegration policies  in particular in Africa. Thisrequires our world Organization to endow itself withmachinery that can help to guide globalization.For some time now  the United Nations hasrightly been concerning itself  at the highest level  withthe reform of the functioning of its structures. This isan urgent matter  as it affects what is at stake for thefuture and even the survival of all of humankind  whichcan no longer be managed in the same spirit and withthe same structures as 55 years ago. We shouldremember that the number of Member States hasincreased from 51 in 1954 to 189 today; that is anirrefutable argument for democratization. In this samecontext  Africa  which has 10 times as many MemberStates in the United Nations as it did when theOrganization was founded  must occupy the place itdeserves in the major decision-making bodies of theUnited Nations  such as the Security Council andothers. The Bretton Woods institutions must alsochange their character and behaviour if globalizationand equity are to be real and consistent.In conclusion  I would like to speak about thatother challenge for our times: the AIDS pandemic. Thisdisease is currently responsible for the loss of morehuman lives that the most deadly wars. The people ofthe poorest countries are the most vulnerable in theface of this disease of the century. The delegation ofRwanda would like  from this rostrum  to make anurgent appeal to the international community to showsolidarity in the face of the threat of extinction of thehuman race that AIDS represents. Put simply  takingAIDS lightly trivializes the crime of genocide. Both areexterminating people and should be combated withvigour and determination.More specifically  aid should be provided forhumanitarian — if for no other — reasons  so that theleast developed countries can benefit from the most up-to-date medicines  at affordable prices  that can providerelief from people suffering from AIDS and do all thatthey can to contain this scourge.Furthermore  my delegation is convinced that aneffort to mobilize the greatest possible financialresources would enable scientific research to take placeto bring this disease  and others  such as malaria  whichare devastating a large part of the population  undercontrol.We hope that the twenty-first century  which isjust beginning  will usher in a world of peace andsolidarity that will meet the greatest aspirations ofhumanity."
"144",6054,"SAU",55,2000,"Itgives me pleasure at the outset of the fifty-fifth sessionof the General Assembly of the United Nations toconvey to His Excellency our sincerest congratulationfor his election to the presidency of this session. Hiselection to this important position reflects the respectof the international community for him personally  aswell as the appreciation of the Member States for thepositive role played by his country  Finland  in theinternational arena. I am confident that his presidencyof this session will contribute effectively to our effortsto achieve the objectives towards which theinternational community aspires under the present delicate international circumstances.I also wish to take this opportunity to express ourappreciation to his predecessor  Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab Foreign Minister of Namibia and president of theprevious session of the United Nations GeneralAssembly  who managed the affairs of the session withgreat competence and experience and who deserves ourcompliments and appreciation.I am also pleased to express my thanks andappreciation to His Excellency  the Secretary-Generalof the United Nations Mr. Kofi Annan  for hiscontinuous and tireless efforts to achieve peace andenhance security and stability in our contemporaryworld  as well as for the competence and ability he hasdemonstrated in leading the affairs of thisOrganization  relying on his rich and exceptionalexperience in the international arena. In particular  Iwish to commend His Excellency for his sincere andextensive efforts in organizing the Millennium Summit which  God willing  will contribute to achievingfruitful results with positive effect on our peoples andnations while ushering in a new century full ofchallenges and opportunities.On this occasion  I wish to welcome the Republicof Tuvalu to the membership of the United Nations hoping that its membership will enhance theeffectiveness of the Organization and its nobleobjectives.The present session of the General Assembly hasfollowed immediately the Millennium Summit  aunique historical event. World leaders met in adignified gathering that exemplified the unity of thehuman race and their collective endeavour to live inpeace  security and prosperity. That Summitrepresented a valuable opportunity to reflect on and todiscuss whatever might lead to a better life forhumanity. The world leaders pledged in the finalDeclaration of the Summit to exert all possible effortsto achieve peace  security and disarmament anderadicate poverty and disease. They affirmed thesovereign equality of nations  respect for theirterritorial integrity and political independence  andnon-interference in the internal affairs of States. TheSummit also provided a valuable opportunity to12evaluate the course of this Organization throughout itshistory  which has been full of opportunities andchallenges  so as to enable it to achieve its declaredprinciples and purposes.In this regard  a thorough and candid evaluationof the role of the United Nations was presented by HisRoyal Highness Prince Abdullah Bin Abdul-Aziz  theCrown Prince and the head of the Saudi delegation tothe Millennium Summit. He discussed the challengesand problems that have impeded the United Nationsfrom achieving the goals and objectives to which thehuman community aspires.His Royal Highness presented a number of ideasand notions that represent a valuable contribution toefforts aimed at promoting and vitalizing the role of theUnited Nations. He mentioned the importance oflinkage between modernizing the Organization'smechanisms and the nature of the issues it confronts.The effects of these reforms should consider theviability and performance of United Nations bodies ina way that enables the United Nations it to fulfil itsrequired role in dealing effectively with the newdevelopments in modern international relations.One of the most apparent features of the newworld order is the emerging phenomenon ofglobalization  which  as a developed framework forinternational relations  has occupied a large portion ofthe current political thought of nations. We viewglobalization as a phenomenon that should reflect thenatural closeness between nations aimed at achievingsocial justice  overall development  equality amongnations  and broadening the scope of cooperation in amanner that serves the issues of peace and security andstability throughout the world. However  and I readhere from a statement by His Royal Highness PrinceAbdullah Bin Abdul-Aziz at the Millennium Summit:“We hope that the United Nations willsupport us in standing against a globalization thatresults in the hegemony of the strong over theweak  increases the causes of the oppression andexploitation of nations  and fosters injustice andinequality in international relations. Weparticularly warn of the ramifications ofunbridled globalization and its use as an umbrellato violate the sovereignty of States and interferewith their internal affairs under a variety ofpretexts especially from the angle of humanrights issues.”The United Nations call for a civilized dialogueand declaring 2001 a year for Dialogue amongCivilizations comes at an appropriate time as acivilized response to those who propagate the themesand doctrines of conflict and inevitable clash ofcivilizations. A dialogue among civilizationsrepresents  in fact  a constructive beginning towardsachieving globalization in its positive sense and itshuman aspect  something to which all peoples andnations aspire. A dialogue among civilizations wouldcontribute to strengthening the values and principles ofunderstanding and cooperation among cultures andcivilizations. It will further promote respect for otherreligious beliefs and the cultural legacies of othernations in a way that consolidates the principles ofpeaceful coexistence and proliferates the culture ofpeace and tolerance.Deviation from the values and principles ofjustice  equality and non-compliance with the rules ofinternational legitimacy in resolving differences anddisputes through peaceful means has led to theproliferation of wars and armed conflicts in many partsof the world. This has caused painful humanitariansuffering that continues to arouse the conscience of theworld community. In our region  Israel continues totake intransigent positions and to reject therequirements for peace. This became evident during therecent talks at Camp David where the Israeli sideinsisted on maintaining positions that are diametricallyopposed to the principles of peace that were agreed toin Madrid and to what was stated in United Nationsresolutions with respect to the status of Al-Quds Al-Sharif. Both the final communiqué of the Al-QudsCommittee  which convened recently in Agadir Morocco  and the resolution of the Council of the ArabLeague  adopted at its 114th session  reaffirmed theunshakeable Arab and Islamic positions with respect tothe issue of Al-Quds Al-Sharif. It also reaffirmed theimpossibility of attaining a durable and comprehensivepeace without reaching a just solution to this problemin a way that preserves Arab and Muslim rights  inaccordance with United Nations resolutions  and thatrespects complete Palestinian sovereignty over Al-Quds Al-Sharif.Israel is making a big mistake if it believes thatthe peace process can proceed without total respect forthe legitimate rights of the Palestinians to return totheir homeland and establish their own independentState with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital. Al-Quds13Al-Sharif is an integral part of the occupied territoriesand is subject to Security Council resolution 242(1967). Moreover  a comprehensive peace cannot beachieved without Israeli withdrawal from the occupiedSyrian Golan to the 4 June 1967 line.We continue to feel for the suffering of thefraternal Iraqi people as a result of the continuingrefusal of their Government to abide fully by UnitedNations resolutions  which would allow for the liftingof the sanctions. In reiterating its concern over thesuffering of the Iraqi people  the Government of theKingdom of Saudi Arabia proposed an initiative thatwould allow Iraq to import all the materials and goodsit needed — except those that fall within the context ofmilitary items that threaten Iraq's neighbours. If suchan initiative had been accepted  the needs of the Iraqipeople would have been met and their sufferingalleviated. However  the Iraqi Government was swift inrejecting this gesture  and thus it has prolonged thesuffering of the Iraqi people. We once again express thehope that the Iraqi Government will act quickly tocomply with Security Council resolution 1284 (1999)and the mandate of the United Nations Monitoring Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC)and of other international committees concerned withthe release and repatriation of all Kuwaiti and Saudiprisoners  as well as with the return of Kuwaitiproperty. We once again reiterate the need to respectIraq's independence  unity and territorial integrity.We also strongly desire the removal of the causesof tension in the Gulf region. Accordingly  we hopethat the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iranwill cooperate with the efforts of the tripartitecommittee  which has been entrusted with creating aconducive climate for direct negotiations between theUnited Arab Emirates and the Islamic Republic of Iranin order to reach an amicable and acceptable solutionto the issue of the three islands.As regards Somalia  my country welcomed theoutcome of the national reconciliation conference which took place in the town of Arta in Djibouti andwhich included the election of President AbdikassinSalad Hassan. We hope that the other Somali factionswill join the reconciliation efforts aimed at promotingnational accord and at achieving unity and stability inSomalia.In Afghanistan fierce fighting continues and isdenying Afghanistan and its people the fruits ofliberation from foreign occupation.The Pakistani-Indian conflict over Jammu andKashmir remains a source of tension between the twoneighbouring countries. We call on both sides toexercise the utmost restraint and to solve the conflictthrough negotiations  in accordance with UnitedNations resolutions  which give the people of Jammuand Kashmir the right to self-determination.The continuation of these disputes and armedconflicts — which have claimed the lives of millions depleted huge quantities of resources and causeddestruction and serious damage to the environment —makes it incumbent upon the international communityto make every possible effort to put an end to theseconflicts and to find peaceful solutions to them. In thisregard  we look to the United Nations to make greaterefforts to reaffirm its role as a peacemaker and not justa peacekeeper. It has become evident that working toprevent conflicts from erupting is more effective andless costly than concentrating on peacekeeping.In this respect and in compliance with theprinciple of resolving conflicts through peacefulmeans  our region witnessed two important events thatmarked a positive sign in relations between nations. InJune 2000  the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and theRepublic of Yemen signed the Jeddah agreementestablishing final and permanent  international land andsea borders. This ended more than 60 years of borderdisputes. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has alsoconcluded an agreement with the State of Kuwait forthe demarcation of the shallow seas adjacent to theformer neutral zone between the two countries.The issue of disarmament is of great concern tomy country  and we call for greater efforts in this area especially as regards weapons of mass destruction. Thepresence of these weapons represents a great danger tointernational peace and security. We hope that thenuclear States will fulfil the pledges they made at the2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty onthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and adhereto the commitment to eradicate their nuclear arsenals.In this context  the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia isvery concerned about Israel's refusal to accede to theNon-Proliferation Treaty and about its decision to keepits nuclear programme outside the scope ofinternational controls. Israel's refusal to adhere to the14international will and to become part of this Treaty hasaborted all efforts exerted by the peoples and countriesof the Middle East to live in a region free from allweapons of mass destruction. Israel is the only countryin the region that has yet to accede to the Non-Proliferation Treaty  a fact that has disrupted thebalance of security and threatened peace in the region.It is this imperative to stress the need to increasethe effectiveness of the Non-Proliferation Treaty bymaking it universal and mandatory.Cooperation on social and political issues hasbecome a necessity that cannot be avoided orneglected. The economic and social problems of thedeveloping countries make it incumbent upon us all topromote policies that can alleviate the effects of theseproblems  which in most cases exacerbate tensionwithin and among nations. We believe that thedeveloped countries have an obligation to assist incombating poverty  food scarcities  drought andfamine.It is unrealistic to apply the concept ofglobalization only as a means to liberalize themarkets — removing restrictions — without alsodrafting a framework for action that stresses the needto consider the economic situation in many of thedeveloping countries and to assist them in moving to astage where they can participate in development. It istherefore important for the industrialized andtechnically advanced countries to help thosedeveloping nations without subjecting them to selectivepolicies in technology transfer. Moreover  globalizationshould be a two-way street that requires the developed industrialized nations to liberalize their markets andopen them up to products from developing nations.We are truly objective when dealing withenvironmental issues. We support conducting seriousand informed studies based on evidence  studies thattake into consideration the process of development inthe developing countries. In this regard  we call uponall States to abide by Agenda 21 and urge theindustrialized States to honour their internationalcommitments regarding the transfer of environmentallyfriendly technology to the developing countries.In conclusion  I would like to emphasise that weare facing enormous challenges in the new era  whichmakes it incumbent upon all of us to strive to achievethe maximum possible level of cooperation andsolidarity. This is not confined to political and militarychallenges  but also includes new waves of challengesthat result from the contemporary way of life with allits problems and complications and cannot be solved ormanaged except through organized collective efforts.Our firm belief in the important role of the UnitedNations in dealing with current issues and infacilitating appropriate international cooperation toaddress and contain these problems  makes us moredetermined than ever to support this Organization andhelp consolidate its constructive role.It is my wish that we enter the new millenniumwith stronger determination and commitment to ourcollective goal to establish a secure world where valuestriumph and justice  equality and peace prevail.Allah says in the Holy Koran:“Help ye one another in righteousness and pietybut help ye not one another in sin and rancour.”(The Holy Koran  V:2)May peace and the blessing of Allah be upon you Sir."
"145",6093,"SDN",55,2000,"It gives megreat pleasure at the outset to convey to Mr. HarriHolkeri on behalf of my delegation our congratulationson his election as President for this session. Aware ofhis well-known diplomatic experience and skill  we areconfident that he will lead the work of this session tosuccess. I should also like to express our appreciationand admiration for the role played by his predecessor Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  Foreign Minister of Namibia during his presidency of the previous session  and forhis co-chairmanship of the Millennium Summit.In this respect  I commend the Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  for his remarkable efforts in preparingfor the Millennium Summit and the MillenniumAssembly.On behalf of my delegation  I also welcome theState of Tuvalu as a new Member of our Organization.Last week  the Millennium Summit endorsed ahistorical declaration that laid out a strategy formeeting the challenges of the twenty-first century.Today I should like to stress that it is our duty toconcentrate  during this Millennium Assembly andthrough its different forums  on translating that visioninto decisions and resolutions to achieve and23consolidate international peace and security  totaldisarmament of weapons of mass destruction resolution of environmental problems  combatinginternational terrorism and organized internationalcrime  prevention of conflicts before they erupt andresolution of the problems of poverty and socio-economic backwardness. If we succeed during thissession  we can then say that we have contributed tocreating circumstances conducive to the achievementof human security and have liberated mankind fromfear and want.On the other hand  we believe that thisMillennium Assembly should give equal importance tothe reform of the institutions of the United Nations  asthey represent the mechanisms through which theinternational community coordinates theimplementation of plans for achieving internationalpeace and security  comprehensive sustainabledevelopment and prosperity for mankind.At the apex of these institutions stands theSecurity Council. All countries continue to call for itsreform by expanding its permanent and non-permanentmembership  in order to make it more representative ofthe current membership of the United Nations. Theyalso call for reform of the Council's working methodsand decision-making mechanisms  in order to render itmore democratic and transparent.We share the Secretary-General's view  expressedin his report to the Millennium Summit  that the mainchallenge we face today is how to transformglobalization into a positive power that benefits all thepeoples of the world. The great scientific andtechnological achievements of the last millenniumconstitute the common heritage of mankind. We call onthe international community to work out the necessaryguarantees to prevent these achievements from beingturned into a monopoly of knowledge or cultural andintellectual domination or from being used as a meansto achieve political and economic hegemony or widenthe scientific and technological gap between countriesof the North and countries of the South. While wewelcome protection of these scientific andtechnological achievements as elements of intellectualproperty  we call upon our development partners tomake this great wealth available to all humanity and toenable the developing countries to use such innovationsin overcoming the chronic problems of production food  health  education and the environment.The right to development is a basic human right.In order to guarantee that right it is imperative that weestablish a democratic  just and transparent worldeconomic order that ensures fair terms of trade betweenpoor and rich countries  increases the level of officialdevelopment assistance to poor countries and alleviatesthe debt burden crushing those countries. This is theonly viable means to enable the developing countries tobenefit from the aspects and opportunities thatglobalization and the revolution in informationtechnology offer — benefits that are still monopolizedby a very small minority of the population of ourglobe.In this regard  Sudan looks forward to the UnitedNations financing for development event and the ThirdUnited Nations Conference on the Least DevelopedCountries  which are scheduled to take place next year.We sincerely hope that their results will receive theeffective implementation they deserve by all UnitedNations agencies.This year the General Assembly convened twospecial sessions to follow up the results of the BeijingWorld Conference on Women and the CopenhagenWorld Summit for Social Development. Despite theremarkable achievements realized by nationalGovernments and the international community inimplementation of the commitments contained in thedocuments resulting from those gatherings  themajority of those commitments were not realized  forseveral reasons  foremost being the failure to fulfil thefinancial commitments undertaken in Beijing andCopenhagen and the excessive debt burden and debtservice commitments of the developing and leastdeveloped countries.We also call for more support for efforts made bydeveloping countries to eradicate ever-increasingpoverty and all pandemic and epidemic diseases suchas malaria and HIV/AIDS  especially in Africa.Sudan looks forward to participating effectivelyin the World Conference against Racism to be held nextyear in South Africa. We believe that this importantconference will help us tackle crucial issues very dearto the human race. My country also intends toparticipate in the special session of the GeneralAssembly to review the results and achievement of thegoals of the World Summit for Children.Recently  the President of the Republic of Sudanestablished an advisory body  attached to his office  in24charge of women's and children's affairs. This step isyet further proof of the special importance that thePresident attaches to the issues of women and childrenand his incessant work to strengthen achievements inthis field.We view with great interest the report (A/55/305)of the Panel of Experts prepared by Mr. Brahimi onpeacekeeping operations  because of its importance andthe new ideas and proposals it contains on thecontainment and prevention of conflicts and onpeacekeeping operations. Our delegation will certainlyparticipate in the discussion of this report in theGeneral Assembly and relevant Committees. In thisconnection  we emphasize the need to set clearmandates for peacekeeping operations  ensuring theconsent of the country receiving peacekeepingoperations and providing the necessary resources forsuch operations in order to ensure their success and toavoid any possible dangers and setbacks.My delegation expresses its deep concern aboutthe difficulties facing the peace process in the MiddleEast. In this respect  we reiterate the importance oftotal Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Arabterritories in accordance with United Nationsresolutions  in order to enable the Palestinian people torestore full sovereignty to their territories  to establishtheir independent State with Holy Jerusalem as itscapital and to enable the Syrian Arab Republic toreinstate sovereignty over the Golan Heights. We areconvinced that without implementation of theseresolutions  stability in this important region will neverbe realized and will remain a mere dream. In thiscontext  we commend the resistance and heroicstruggle of the people of Lebanon in the liberation oftheir territories.The call to reform the international sanctionsregime is gaining more momentum within the SecurityCouncil and other United Nations bodies  because thenegative effects of sanctions have compounded thesuffering of the peoples of the countries subjected tothem  in particular vulnerable groups such as children women and the elderly. The most horrible and dreadfulaspects of the negative impacts of sanctions are seenamong the Iraqi people. We add our voice to ongoingefforts to lift these sanctions.Sudan also reaffirms the importance ofmaintaining the unity and territorial integrity of Iraq and rejects any measures taken outside the scope ofUnited Nations resolutions and internationallegitimacy. At the same time  Sudan reaffirms the needto respect and comply with all United Nationsresolutions and to respect the sovereignty of Kuwait and calls for a just and urgent solution to the issue ofKuwaiti and non-Kuwaiti prisoners  throughcooperation and understanding between the partiesconcerned. We believe that it is high time to lift allsanctions imposed on the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya since it has complied with and fulfilled all itsobligations regarding the Lockerbie incident.We view with satisfaction the recent positivedevelopments in the Horn of Africa  namely  theceasefire agreement reached between our two sisterlyneighbours  Eritrea and Ethiopia. We hope thisagreement will culminate in a lasting peace betweenthe two parties  and we should like to commend theefforts deployed by President Bouteflika of Algeriatowards that end.We should also like to hail and commend theefforts of Djibouti and its President Ismail OmarGuelleh to achieve national reconciliation and restorestability to the Republic of Somalia. The Sudan represented by President Omer Hassan AhmedAl-Bashir  participated in the inauguration ceremony ofAbdihassim Salad Hassan as President of the Republicof Somalia. We call on the United Nations and theinternational community to support efforts to restorepeace  stability and security to Somalia under itselected leadership.While we fully understand the concerns of theinternational community about the ongoing conflict inthe southern Sudan  we should like to recall that theSudan is waging a war imposed by a rebel movementseeking to undermine its territorial integrity and thesafety and security of its people. We should also like torecall that it was the Government of the Sudan thatinitially invited the United Nations to undertake thetask of coordinating international humanitarianassistance for citizens affected by this conflict.Ten years have elapsed since the implementationof the Agreement known as Operation Lifeline Sudan.However  it has had to be reviewed because of repeatedviolations of its terms by the rebel movement and someother organizations participating in this process.In this regard  it is my honour to express our deepappreciation and gratitude to Secretary-General KofiAnnan and to his Special Envoy  Ambassador Tom25Vraalsen  as well as to the personnel of the Office forthe Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) forthe understanding they have shown regarding theGovernment's demands for ensuring impartiality andtransparency  as well as for determining the obligationsof all parties to the agreement and ensuring the fairallocation of humanitarian assistance among citizensaffected by the conflict on both sides. It is on the basisof this understanding that the Government hascommitted itself to ensure the safety and protection ofall relief agency personnel operating in the southernSudan.We believe it is our duty to brief the Assembly onthe current humanitarian situation in the Bahr el Ghazalarea in the southern Sudan  where the rebel movementhas recently increased its violations of the partialceasefire. This has created obstacles and securitycomplications that impeded the delivery ofhumanitarian relief to affected citizens in that area. Wetherefore urge the Assembly to bring pressure to bearon the rebel movement to stop using civilianpopulations and locations  such as hospitals andschools  as human shields and to fulfil its obligationsby halting all military operations in order to ensureunhindered relief operations to all affected populationsand to avert a humanitarian tragedy similar to the oneendured by Bahr el Ghazal in the first quarter of 1998.The Government of the Sudan has reaffirmed itscommitment to reach a just and lasting politicalsolution to the conflict in the southern Sudan based onthe Intergovernmental Authority on Development(IGAD) initiative and to respond to other initiativesintended to solve other problems. Nonetheless  thesepeace efforts have not succeeded because of theintransigence of the rebel movement  which continuesto renege on its obligations  undermining anyagreement reached.This is clearly reflected in the position of therebel movement regarding the ceasefire  which itcontinues to violate  as well as its continued rejectionof the call by the Government for a lasting comprehensive ceasefire — a call that has receivedwide support from the international community  theIGAD partners and several other United Nationsagencies  as well as regional and internationalgroupings.President Omer Hassan Ahmed Al-Bashirreaffirmed in his address to the Millennium Summit thecommitment of the Government of the Sudan to a justand lasting political solution based on the following.First  there should be an immediate and comprehensiveceasefire in order to facilitate the delivery ofhumanitarian assistance to the needy and to create aconducive atmosphere and confidence-buildingmeasures for the success of the peace efforts. Secondly there should be direct negotiations on the basis ofcurrent peace initiatives  specifically  the IGADprocess  which provides a negotiating forum for theGovernment and the rebel movement  as well as thejoint Egyptian/Libyan initiative  which is aimed atachieving a comprehensive resolution to all of theSudan's problems with the participation of theGovernment  the rebel movement and the opposition inand outside the Sudan. Thirdly  a comprehensivepeaceful settlement should be reached in order to laythe foundation for a fair distribution of power andwealth  establish rights and duties based on citizenshipand guarantee total adherence to international standardsand instruments of democracy and human rights.In addition to efforts being deployed to solve themilitary conflict in the southern Sudan  theGovernment continues to make efforts towards nationalreconciliation through direct and indirect contacts withopposition groups. Agreement has been reached to holda comprehensive national conference in which allpolitical and social denominations and factions willtake part in order to discuss national unity  freedom democracy and the system of government. Theconference is expected to agree on a national charterthat will provide the basis for a system of governmentcharacterized by pluralism  freedoms and peacefultransfer of power.The Government has taken the initiative oforganizing a preparatory meeting for this conference inKhartoum  and a national preparatory committee hasbeen formed. This will be followed by anotherpreparatory meeting to be held in Cairo to determinethe agenda  date and venue of the inclusive nationalconference. It is my pleasure to commend the efforts ofthe Governments of Egypt and the Libyan ArabJamahiriya in this regard.While efforts for peace and reconciliation arebeing pursued  the Government is undertaking thenecessary legal and administrative measures toestablish a democratic  pluralistic system that providesall the necessary freedoms. The Government is alsopreparing to hold parliamentary and presidential26elections  and has invited and welcomed theparticipation of international and regionalorganizations to supervise these elections.In the economic field  the Government continuesto implement programmes of reform and liberalizationof the economy and is encouraging local and foreigninvestment. In this context  it is my pleasure to informthe Assembly that the Executive Board of theInternational Monetary Fund decided at its meeting lastAugust in Washington to resume full cooperation withthe Sudan.The Sudan has also managed to normalize itsrelations with other international and regional financialinstitutions  and hopes that the flow of foreign aid andforeign direct investment to the Sudan will enable it toovercome its economic difficulties and relieve its debtburden. We have also started preparations to draw up adevelopment strategy for the coming decade  whichwill concentrate on poverty alleviation and onproviding basic health services  education and ruraldevelopment. Revenues from the export of petroleumwill be earmarked for socio-economic developmentprogrammes.It has now been two years since the United Statesmilitary aggression on the Al-Shifa pharmaceuticalfactory in the Sudan  which resulted in the totaldestruction of an important medical facility that used toproduce more than half of the Sudan's needs for basicand life-saving medicines. The debris of that factoryand the effects of the missile attack by the UnitedStates still bear witness to what happens when themilitary might of a super-Power is used irresponsibly.It is ironic that the same super-Power that claims to bea pioneer in protecting and safeguarding internationalpeace and security and the principles of internationallaw should resort to such an action. This gathering willrecall that immediately after that aggression  the Sudancalled on the Security Council to send a fact-findingmission to verify United States allegations concerningthe factory and its financing. Yet despite the fact thatthe whole world  and indeed several mediaorganizations inside the United States  have cast doubtson United States allegations about the Al-Shifa factory the United States Administration continues to maintainits position  contrary to all facts  thus insisting onjustifying a wrong that has deprived the people of theSudan  especially the vulnerable and children  of asource of medicine at affordable prices — less thanhalf of what those medicines cost on the internationalmarket.Convinced that rights do not die  we shallcontinue our efforts to urge the internationalcommunity  the Security Council and the GeneralAssembly to send a mission to verify United Statesallegations  and we trust that our just cause has thesupport of all peace-loving countries that guard thesenoble principles. We wish here to call on the UnitedStates Administration not to use its position in theSecurity Council to block the sending of a fact-findingmission that will show the world the truth and exposethe unwarranted aggression against a basic healthfacility.The peaceful settlement of disputes is a principalobjective and cardinal role of the United Nations. TheSudan adheres to this objective and seeks to realize itin the conduct of its foreign relations at all levels.Based on this position  and in order to realize thisnoble objective  the Sudan has continuously committeditself to respect for the norms of international law asthe only way to settle disputes and to maintaininternational peace and security.The Sudan is today one of only 62 States thathave fully accepted the jurisdiction of the InternationalCourt of Justice. Furthermore  the Sudan  during theMillennium Summit  signed the 1998 Rome Statute ofthe International Criminal Court and deposited itsinstrument of ratification for the 1997 InternationalConvention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings.By ratifying this treaty  the Sudan has become one of afew countries that have completed the process ofratification and adherence to all internationalconventions to combat international terrorism. This isindeed a source of pride to us. We believe theAssembly will agree that this record qualifies theSudan to make all possible contributions to maintainingpeace and security through the highest specializedinstitutions.Since it became a Member of the United Nationsfollowing its independence in 1956  the Sudan hascontinued to work in collaboration with the otherMember States in order to develop and sustaininternational cooperation to realize the objectives ofthe Charter in all fields. The Sudan looks forward topursuing this role in another important forum as a non-permanent member of the Security Council for theperiod 2001-2002  for the first time in 28 years.27The candidature of Sudan has been endorsed andsupported by the African continent  represented in theAfrican Group in New York  as well as by the Councilof Ministers of the Organization of African Unity(OAU) at the OAU summit in Togo last July. TheSudan looks forward with confidence and optimism toobtaining the support and endorsement of all UnitedNations Members for its candidature in the electionsthat will take place in the General Assembly in thecoming weeks."
"146",6138,"SEN",55,2000,"﻿TheGeneral Assembly has unanimously chosen you  Sir  toguide our debates. This is a tribute both to yourqualities as a diplomat and statesman and to yourcountry  Finland  for the very positive role it plays inaddressing the great issues of our modern world.Senegal is happy to convey to you  through me  itscongratulations and hopes for success in leading thissession.You were preceded in this office by HisExcellency Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  Minister forForeign Affairs of our sister Republic of Namibia  whopresided in the name of our continent  Africa. Heguided our debates successfully throughout hismandate  which was full of important events for ourOrganization.I would like at the same time to pay tribute to thework of our Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  whohas devoted himself and all his energy to ourOrganization  in an increasingly complex world. Let uspay him the tribute he richly deserves for the success ofthe Millennium Summit  which proved to the worldthat Mr. Kofi Annan has achieved what he set out todo  i.e. to restore the dignity and prestige of theOrganization as the indispensable forum forconcertation and concord  and as a peacemaker andpromoter of progress for all.I would also like  finally  to welcome thedelegation of Tuvalu  which has become the 189thMember State.History will recall that  in the framework of theMillennium Assembly  the Millennium Summitgathered in this venerable Hall our illustrious heads ofState and Government  who examined the role ourOrganization is being called upon to play in the twenty-first century. These eminent dignitaries thereby gave usa new vision of how to take up the great challengeposed by globalization  by promoting a new humaninternational order.The first half of the year 2000 was also an intensetime for the United Nations and the internationalcommunity  what with the holding in June of two majorspecial sessions of the General Assembly. These twospecial sessions  following up on and reviewing theFourth World Conference on Women  which was heldin Beijing  and the World Summit on SocialDevelopment  held in Copenhagen  producedencouraging results. My delegation cherishes the hopethat these sessions will contribute to strengthening thestatus and role of women in our respective societies bypromoting gender equality  the eradication both ofpoverty and of its feminization  and the promotion ofproductive employment and social integration. If we donot fully respect women and recognize their essentialcontribution to the progress of our societies  our worldis going continue walking on one leg  when obviouslythere are two.Despite these new perspectives and theirhistorical importance  this session is not without causesfor grave concern and even despair. Despite ourongoing efforts  a number of conflicts are persistingand deepening. From Sierra Leone to the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo  from Angola to the borderbetween Ethiopia and Eritrea  from Burundi toSomalia  from Kosovo to East Timor we hear theechoes and see the images and the horror of conflictzones.Senegal would like to here voice its great concernat what is occurring between Guinea and Liberia. Ourcountry calls upon these two countries to carry out abrotherly  peaceful dialogue in accordance with thepurposes and principles of the Charter of theOrganization of African Unity (OAU). We make thesame urgent request of the political leaders of CÙted'Ivoire  urging them to find a political compromisethat will enable the great country  CÙte d'Ivoire  whichwe love so well  to live in peace  stability and unity.It is in view of such situations that regionalorganizations  aware of the fact that Africa is paying ahigh price for all these conflicts  have resolutelyundertaken to seek political solutions  with the help ofthe international community. This is what occurred in9Sierra Leone  where the LomÈ Agreement  reachedunder the aegis of the Economic Community of WestAfrican States  allowed us to nourish hopes for alasting solution. The same can be said for Angola andthe Democratic Republic of the Congo and the twoLusaka agreements of 1994 and 1999  respectively.Unfortunately  these praiseworthy efforts often run upagainst a lack of commitment on the part of rebelmovements or armed factions to the very agreementsthat they themselves have signed.However  in spite of this bleak situation  weshould not give in to discouragement. As theconstitution of the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization says `since wars begin in the minds of men  it is in theminds of men that the defences of peace must beconstructed'.We have a moral obligation to continue to act withdetermination and perseverance  bringing theprotagonists of these conflicts to recognize andembrace a culture of peace that will allow people toprogress  committing themselves to forgiveness andreconciliation.It is in this context that my delegationcongratulates the members of the Panel on UnitedNations Peace Operations for its recent report. Thesubtlety of the analyses and the relevance of therecommendations contained therein open newperspectives for the United Nations in terms ofreducing tensions and wisely managing conflicts.Senegal attaches great importance to the considerationof the Panel's recommendations  so that a newpeacekeeping doctrine can be established.Experience has shown us that the language ofweapons  as well as feeding conflicts by illicitlyexploiting natural resources  cannot produce humanlyacceptable solutions. The only possible solution is onethat allows peoples to fully enjoy conditions of peaceand economic and social security.It is in this context that the Constitutive Act ofthe African Union was signed on 12 July at LomÈ  atthe thirty-sixth session of the Assembly of Heads ofState and Government of the Organization of AfricanUnity (OAU)  committing Africa to resolutely engagein a spirit of unity in finding African solutions to itsmany challenges. This is why the President of theRepublic  MaÓtre Abdoulaye Wade  a convinced Pan-Africanist  led to its completion the procedure makingSenegal the second African country to ratify thishistoric Act.Before LomÈ  Africa had already taken anothermeaningful decision  at the Algiers summit  byproclaiming 2000 the year of peace and concord on thecontinent.The advent of democracy in Guinea-Bissau andthe efforts to bring about a gradual return to normalityin the life of its citizens and institutions are part of theresponse to the demand for democracy. Is not therecent peaceful political transition in my country which brought MaÓtre Abdoulaye Wade to the highestexecutive position  further proof that our peoples canchoose their leaders in a sovereign and democraticfashion?I now turn to the Middle East  where my countryhas noted the major breakthroughs this year in theIsraeli-Arab conflict  at the heart of which is thequestion of Palestine. The evacuation of Lebaneseterritory by the Israeli occupation troops and the longand delicate negotiations at Camp David betweenPalestinians and Israelis give rise to hope  despite thetalks' relative failure. Our hopes include that of seeingthe creation of a space of lasting cohabitation betweenIsraelis and Palestinians  as well as between Israel andits Arab neighbours  with respect for the dignity andrights of the peoples and States of the region.It is only right to pay tribute to all the participantsin this positive development  in particular thePalestinian and Israeli leadership  who  thanks to theirpolitical courage and sense of history have opened thisavenue towards a new dawn of peace in the MiddleEast. Senegal reiterates its constant support forPresident Yasser Arafat and its admiration for hiscourage and political lucidity. He has never droppedthe olive branch to which he referred here in 1974. Ourcongratulations also go to President Clinton. Weexpress our support for the Prime Minister of Israel Mr. Barak  as well as the other actors in the peaceprocess  whom we commend for their determinedefforts in search of peace and reconciliation betweenall the peoples of the region. We hope that their effortswill soon be crowned with positive results.The year 2000 was also marked by a relaxation ofmajor importance in relations between the two Koreas.This highly significant political development willcontribute to consolidating peace and security on the10Korean peninsula and in the entire subregion of South-East Asia. The United Nations  universal symbol of thepeoples' aspirations to peace and security  should makea significant contribution to protecting the ongoingprocess between the two Koreas.It is in the name of rapprochement betweenpeoples and the principle of universality that mycountry supports the request of the Republic of Chinaon Taiwan to rejoin the concert of free nations withinthe United Nations and its specialized agencies  andthus to participate in the consolidation of internationalpeace and security.With the completion last June of the definition ofwhat constitutes crimes  and of the rules of procedureand testimony  the Preparatory Committee for theInternational Criminal Court passed a significantmilestone in the establishment of this important legalinstitution. This progress and the new ratifications ofthe Rome Statute  are encouraging signs of theinternational community's rejection of criminal faitsaccomplis  injustice and impunity. I repeat Senegal'ssupport for the process  which should bring about acredible  independent and efficient InternationalCriminal Court.Building and consolidating peace also  and aboveall  means to meeting the chronic challenge ofunderdevelopment  for  as we know  development isanother name for peace. Twenty years ago the North-South Commission on development problems stronglyemphasized that where hunger reigns there cannot bepeace  and that whoever wants to banish war must alsobanish poverty. Yet today  despite that warning  povertypersists and grows  although we have the means tofight it.We dare to hope that next year's high-levelmeeting on financing development will be a uniqueopportunity to examine in depth the causes of thedecline in official development assistance and will findways and means to redress this worrying situation: theurgent need to deal with the debt crisis  rebalanceinternational trade and deal with the risks ofmarginalization resulting from globalization.I recall President Wade's appeal  warmly receivedby his peers  for an in-depth analysis of the Africandebt and for a world summit on globalization to correctits injustices and contradictions.I would also like to reiterate Senegal's support forcooperation frameworks such as the EU-ACPagreements and the Tokyo International Conference onAfrican Development (TICAD). We hope that recentdecisions made at the G-8 Summit in Okinawa  as wellas the American initiative  `African Growth andOpportunity Act'  will be the starting point of a newpartnership based on solidarity and mutual benefits.Development is inseparable from the promotionand protection of human rights  the rule of law andsound governance  principles to which my countryremains firmly attached. By creating a human rightsunit attached to the presidency of the Republic  theHead of State has shown his personal commitment tothe protection and promoting of citizens' fundamentalrights and freedoms by the Administration and at everylevel of public life. Senegal will continue to makeevery effort to consolidate the foundations of the ruleof law  to protect human rights defenders and to honourthe obligations it assumes by its adherence tointernational legal instruments on human rights.With the momentum created by the success inSenegal of the peaceful change-over of political powerand a peaceful transition  my country feels equipped tocontinue to defend the image of a serene Africa  amature Africa  a tolerant and democratic Africa.Today  more than ever  our people wonder aboutthe political will and capacity of our States to takeadvantage of the current international climate  whichseems propitious for a dynamic of peace and for takinginto account the human dimension in technologicalinnovations.In Africa our thoughts often turn to the anguishcaused by the ravages of HIV/AIDS  although with al.6 per cent rate  Senegal strengthens the hope that thisscourge will be defeated.Fifty years ago  at the end of the planetarynightmare of the Second World War  a hope andconviction were born: that men and women throughoutthe world would do everything possible to prevent newwars from breaking out and would work together toensure respect for the right of each individual tofreedom  justice and progress. Today the intellectualand material resources available to humanity shouldlogically be increasingly dedicated to building a futureof peace  progress and shared happiness. But it must besaid that for the great majority of peoples and nationsthe international situation does not meet theiraspirations to peace and progress.In the final analysis  to build a pan-human societywhich is at peace with itself we must unite all ourenergies to create the basis for more humandevelopment with greater solidarity  bringing new hopeto future generations. This is the importance andmeaning of the Millennium Summit  in urging us tomake a collective contribution to strengthening ourOrganization for the salvation of humanity.As it has become a tradition in my country  I willleave the last word of my statement to the inimitableSenegal-Cameroon poet of love and hope  DavidMandesijop  who said:`Hope lived in us as in a citadel.'I hope the aspiration to a more just and happyworld will live within us all as an impregnable citadelso  as Mandesijop said  that spring will grow beneathour footsteps."
"147",6185,"SGP",55,2000,"First let me warmlycongratulate you  Sir  on your election  which is doublysignificant  as few Prime Ministers have held the postof President of the General Assembly. Your uniquepractical experience in both domestic and internationalaffairs will stand us in good stead as we try to reformthe United Nations. I also thank your distinguishedpredecessor  Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  for the excellentwork he has done and for ushering the United Nationssuccessfully into the new millennium.As a fellow small State  Singapore is alsodelighted to extend a warm welcome to Tuvalu  theUnited Nations newest Member. We hope that Tuvaluwill also join the Forum of Small States.As the text of my speech has been circulated  inthe interest of saving time I will not read the entiretext.The recently concluded Millennium Summitconfirmed that the United Nations  whatever itsimperfections  remains an indispensable organization.The overriding theme of the speeches in plenarymeetings was the need for the United Nations to berevitalized and better equipped to deal with thechallenges of the twenty-first century. Our immediatechallenge is to respond with concrete follow-up. Thismay be stating the obvious but doing it will not be easynor is it assured. The United Nations record ofimplementation  it must be conceded  has not alwaysinspired confidence.In his report to the Millennium Summit  theSecretary-General drew attention to a 1999 Gallup pollof some 57 000 individuals in 60 countries. Oneconclusion was that  globally  less than half of thoseinterviewed judged the performance of the UnitedNations to be satisfactory. We need to reflect on this.But it is also an unfortunate fact that the UnitedNations has not usually got credit for what it has donesuccessfully  while continuing to attract criticism forwhat it has not yet done. Thus  a critical politicalfactor — hitherto inadequately addressed — is how tomanage expectations.Managing expectations is a key to success. Thewindow of opportunity opened for the United Nationsby the end of the cold war was perhaps squandered byan overly ambitious agenda  leading almost inevitablyto disillusionment. We should not repeat this mistakeafter the Millennium Summit. To resolutely implementthe Summit's results  we must not only accuratelyidentify them  but engage in a realistic assessment ofwhat is and is not possible. Otherwise  we riskundermining the political will and support needed forthe United Nations to be effective.The United Nations serves two essential functionsfor our community of nations. It provides all of us witha valuable instrument to advance our common interests including the setting of norms for relations betweennations and on human rights. It also provides each ofus with an important avenue to advance or defend ournational interests. There is no necessary contradictionbetween these two functions. That which is in theinterest of humanity ought to be in our individualnational interests. But the practical problem is inidentifying what is common and reconciling differentnational interests.The twentieth century has seen a creative tensionbetween two apparently contradictory sets of ideals:the sovereignty of nation States and the progressiveelaboration of international law and organization.Sovereignty implies the right of each State todetermine for itself its own rules. Yet today Statesinteract within a web of complex relationships international institutions and regimes  covering anever-widening range of matters  which implies aserious limitation of sovereignty. We live with thisapparent contradiction every day.But we do not have to choose between the twoideals of absolute sovereignty or absolute internationallaw and organization. The real question is how to strikean appropriate balance to move forward.It was therefore timely for the Secretary-Generalto convene the Millennium Summit. We now have abroad consensus on what to do to meet the challengesof the twenty-first century.The question then is: how do we proceed fromhere. Taking a narrower but more focused approachmay be the only practical solution to many seeminglyintractable issues. But I do not underestimate thecomplexities of putting this into practice. Let meillustrate the complexities with reference to two of thecore functions of the United Nations: development andsecurity.14On development  earlier calls for a newinternational economic order fell on deaf ears. Thestalemate in North-South negotiations over the lastthree decades or so was the direct consequence of theresistance on the part of certain developed countries toadmit the necessity of changing the functioning of theworld economy.However  I believe that resistance can be moreeasily overcome and the urgent remedial action that isneeded may be easier to take if there is a mind-set shiftby both developing and developed countries. Thecandid debate the leaders had at the recent interactiveround table discussions saw a commonacknowledgement that both the North and the Southmust find collective solutions to the problems ofdevelopment. There was agreement that developingcountries must be given help to build up capacity tobenefit from the forces of globalization. The developedeconomies have also pointed out that they too faceserious problems that can be attributed to the pressuresof globalization. But there can be no doubt that theproblems of the South are of a far greater magnitudeand deserve far more attention. Domestic problems athome should not give the North any excuse to ignoretheir important international obligations.Today  it is commonly accepted that no country whatever its development status  can afford to opt outof the global economy or go it alone. The issue for allis to develop the national capacity to take advantage ofthe benefits of globalization while mitigating itsdownsides.The United Nations is now in its fourthdevelopment decade. A new discipline for bothdeveloped and developing countries is needed if theresults are to be less disappointing than the first three.The issue for the United Nations is to help thedeveloping countries acquire the capabilities to dealwith the pressures of globalization and to plug it.In this process  difficult domestic structuralchanges will be necessary to ensure that policies andinstitutions meet international best practices. Thesestandards are today largely Western  but can and oughtto be internationally negotiated. And it is imperativethat the developed countries avoid a sterile “one-size-fits-all” prescription. As suggested by the Secretary-General  the United Nations can play a mediating rolein the negotiations so that it will not be undertaken onthe basis of categories biased towards zero-sumsolutions. Instead  the United Nations can help develop“win-win” solutions for both developed and developingcountries.However  the United Nations cannot work inisolation. The United Nations has a role to play toensure that the international financial institutions likethe International Monetary Fund  the World Bank andthe World Trade Organization coordinate their effortsand work as one team. No other institution is betterplaced than the United Nations to do this. The UnitedNations is the natural forum for regular dialoguesamong the multilateral organizations to coordinateprogrammes that would help developing nations buildcapacity. The United Nations could also help make thedecision-making processes of these organizations moretransparent  consultative and inclusive.Turning next to security  the end of the cold warhas obviously not meant the end to internationalconflict. In the eleven years since the end of 1989 when the Berlin Wall fell  the Security Councilauthorized some 40 peacekeeping operations. But inthe preceding 42 years  it had authorized only 17. It hasbeen estimated that the total cumulative amount of theUnited Nations peacekeeping budget from 1948 to1989 was $3 billion. But since 1989  it has escalated toabout $18 billion. Not only have the numbers and thecosts of peacekeeping operations risen sharply  buttheir scope has also changed. Of the 40 peacekeepingoperations authorized since 1989  only five wereclearly in response to clear inter-State conflicts.Throughout history we have witnessed oppressiveinternal conflicts and human rights atrocitiesperpetuated by a State against its own people. Thedifference today is that with the advent of technology instant communication through television  the Internetand the role of non-governmental organizations  theseconflicts and atrocities are made known to the wholeworld instantaneously. Very few are regarded as purelylocal or regional situations. Most are regarded asinternationalized. This galvanizing of public outrageleads to expectations that the international communitymust act. Often this increases the pressures on theUnited Nations and the Security Council to takeinterventionist actions  severely testing the UnitedNations capacity and stretching its resources. Thedilemma is: how can the United Nations be responsiveto these pressures if its Members are unwilling to giveit the required resources. And if the United Nations15tries to be selective  how can it prevent itself frombeing accused of practising double standards?In 1995 Professor Paul Kennedy of YaleUniversity  who headed a team of scholars retained bythe United Nations Secretariat to study the future of theOrganization  concluded that Member States faced anurgent decision: either to reduce their demands on theUnited Nations  thereby giving it a decent chance tocarry on at a lower level of activity within existingresources  or to expand available resources so that theUnited Nations could meet what Professor Kennedysaw as inexorably growing demands from MemberStates unable to cope with the technological pace population growth and environmental pressures of thetwenty-first century. He concluded that  in the light ofglobal circumstances  opting for expanded resourceswould be the wiser choice.There is now a growing consensus that it isimportant to ensure that the United Nations hasadequate resources for its current and futurepeacekeeping activities. Discussions on how this canbest be effected are already under way and Singaporesupports them. Nevertheless  let us not forget thatevery prudent accounting must deal squarely with howdecisions are made on peacekeeping operations. Wehave to be honest here. There is no level playing field.Most of the time  most decisions are in reality made bythe permanent members of the Security Council. Therest of us have to pay our dues  but have a minimal sayin the decisions.Hence  when we review the current peacekeepingscale of assessments  we hope that the Security Councilwill also review its current decision-makingprocedures.Recent developments in Africa serve as asobering reminder of the need to undertake an urgentoverhaul of United Nations peacekeeping. The SecurityCouncil met at the level of heads of State andGovernment during the Millennium Summit to discussthe need to ensure an effective role for it in maintaininginternational peace and security  particularly in Africa.Sadly  apart from a general description  the SecurityCouncil summit did not produce any new concreteproposals for or commitments to further action. TheCouncil could and I believe should do better than this.Fortunately  the Brahimi Panel has come up witha set of concrete recommendations  which when put inplace will significantly revamp United Nationspeacekeeping. In a nutshell  the Panel advocated thatshould the United Nations decide to send apeacekeeping force to uphold peace  the peacekeepersmust be rapidly deployed with a credible deterrence and be authorized  with robust mandates  to carry outtheir mission and defend themselves. Only then can thetragedies of past peacekeeping operations be avoided.What this entails is that United Nations peacekeepingmissions must be given the necessary resources including better trained and better equippedpeacekeepers  and receive better support from UnitedNations Headquarters — in particular  an enlargedDepartment of Peacekeeping Operations. In turn Member States must have the political will to supportthe United Nations politically  financially andoperationally.I think I have said enough to underscore the pointthat a focused approach is not necessarily an easier orless complex one  but I believe that it is the onlypractical way forward.The Secretary-General's report to the MillenniumSummit was designed as a guide to action  and itshould be actively used as such and not simply praisedand then forgotten. We took the first step at theMillennium Summit by endorsing and adopting manyof the proposals of the report in the form of aMillennium Declaration. The real challenge now is tofulfil the ambitious and wide-ranging promises that wehave made to the world.Where are the material  financial and humanresources to come from to fulfil our promises? TheUnited Nations Secretariat and agencies by themselvesobviously do not have them. The United Nationscannot do everything on its own. As the millenniumreport makes clear  the necessary long-term effort todeliver the solution will have to be shared — sharedamong national Governments  the United Nations other international institutions and other importantactors  such as corporations and non-governmentalorganizations. Then  and only then  will there be anychance of success.The Millennium Summit has provided a goodbasis on which to begin the process of practicalnegotiations that will lead to real solutions  rather thanpolitical posturing  which will only complicate alreadycomplex issues. We must start somewhere. I suggestthat we start here and now.16"
"148",6218,"SLB",55,2000,"At the outset  Sir let me convey the congratulations and best wishes ofthe Government and people of Solomon Islands onyour election as President of the fifty-fifth session ofthe General Assembly. Your proven tremendous skillsas a consensus-builder and mediator will no doubtguide the Assembly to adopt useful decisions on themany important issues before us. My Government iscommitted to working closely with you and all MemberStates during this Millennium Assembly.Solomon Islands warmly welcomes the admissionof our sister nation Tuvalu as a new Member of theUnited Nations. This is further testimony that theUnited Nations is indispensable and that its body ofinternational laws is vital to the protection and securityof small island developing States. We look forward toworking very closely with the delegation of Tuvalu.The Government of Solomon Islands concurs thatconflict prevention should be the cornerstone ofcollective security in the twenty-first century. We alsoacknowledge that peace and democratic stability arecritical pre-conditions for economic growth andsustainable development. Moreover  economic anddevelopment cooperation have an important role toplay in fostering these pre-conditions.As highlighted in our Millennium Summitstatement  the ethnic crisis in our country haschallenged national peace  security and stability. It hasresulted in the loss of human lives and property  theclosure of all key industries in our economy and thedisplacement of more than 30 000 people. While it maynot be comparable to major conflicts in other parts ofthe world  the net result in human loss and suffering isrelative. Therefore  the international community particularly the United Nations  must give equalattention to every conflict situation. All MemberStates  both large and small  must be treated fairly.Challenges to the security and stability of smallisland developing States like Solomon Islands are increasingly  beyond their capacity to cope. In suchcases  the support of the United Nations and theinternational community at large is imperative. In thecontext of our crisis  our smallness and remoteness limited resources  ethnic and cultural diversity andhistory are fundamental considerations.Restoring law and order is the number-onepriority for my Government as we strive to resolve ourconflict. There is no peace without security. While apeaceful and comprehensive solution has to come fromSolomon Islanders themselves  international support tosustain the peace process is necessary. Since welaunched our national peace plan  we have made someprogress in getting the conflicting parties to the table to2negotiate and agree to a ceasefire. A ceasefireAgreement was signed by all parties concerned on 3August 2000 and a National Monitoring Council tooversee its implementation was subsequently formed.Despite some violations of the Agreement  myGovernment remains steadfast in our commitment toachieving peace. Further peace talks have since takenplace in Honiara  the capital  and a draft frameworktowards a peace agreement was adopted. A moreconclusive peace agreement will be negotiated inCairns  Australia. Recognizing the importance of civilsociety participation in conflict resolution reconciliation and reconstruction  my Government willcontinue to involve non-governmental organizations including women's and church groups.May I express my Government's appreciation tothe South Pacific Forum countries for theirunderstanding and support during this challengingtime. I wish to mention in particular the recent visit bya Pacific ACP ministerial mission led by the ForeignMinister of Papua New Guinea to assess the currentsituation and make recommendations to the jointEuropean Union/African  Caribbean and Pacific (EU/ACP) Commission. We further appreciate the efforts ofthe Governments of Australia and New Zealand infacilitating our peace process through their logisticalsupport. To sustain long-term peace  Solomon Islandswill need the cooperation of its development partnersto rebuild the economy and to foster a developmentpath that creates employment  ensures fair distributionof national resources and wealth and accommodatesour diverse cultural traditions.Only the United Nations and other internationalinstitutions have the scope and legitimacy to generatethe principles  norms and rules that are necessary ifglobalization is to benefit everyone. The leastdeveloped countries (LDCs)  including SolomonIslands  need international support to build thecapacities to enable us to become more effectively andbeneficially integrated into the global economy. TheThird United Nations Conference on the LDCs nextyear will give the international community a uniqueopportunity to review  assess and adopt policies andmeasures that could effectively address thedevelopment constraints of least developed countries.Developing and sustaining competitiveness andproductive capabilities  like all other aspects ofdevelopment  is a long and often frustrating process.My Government  however  is prepared to work withour development partners to address these problems ina renewed spirit of solidarity and shared responsibility.The past decade has witnessed the adoption ofseveral international conventions and programmes ofaction  from the environment and sustainabledevelopment to social development and theadvancement of women. Their five-year reviews despite some progress  have indicated that insufficientresources remains a major obstacle to widerimplementation  especially in rural communities indeveloping countries. New and additional resources arerequired if we are to make a difference. The UnitedNations Intergovernmental Conference on Financingfor Development next year must produce a practicaloutcome on how to mobilize financing for developmentin the new millennium. The twenty-first century shouldbe a century for better implementation of internationalprogrammes  a century for action rather than rhetoric.The economic vulnerability and ecologicalfragility of small island developing States must be anintegral basis for decisions on developmentcooperation with these States. Such cooperation in myview should continue to focus on better tradingopportunities  including market access  capacity-building — in particular  human resourcesdevelopment — and adaptation and mitigationprogrammes to address climate change and sea levelrise.Investment in renewable energy remains apriority for Solomon Islands. Access to a reliable andcost-effective energy source is imperative if our ruralpopulation is to capitalize on the opportunities of theinformation age.The international community must mobilizeresources to implement the Secretary General'srecommendations on bridging the digital dividebetween developed and developing countries.Solomon Islands is committed to reform strengthen and enhance the effectiveness of the UnitedNations system  including the Security Council  whichhas primary responsibility under the United NationsCharter for maintaining international peace andsecurity. Greater flexibility and understanding shouldbe demonstrated towards those that are striving tobecome new permanent members of the Council including Japan and Germany. A similar attitude shouldbe shown towards the reconfiguration of the UnitedNations regional groups to reflect present-day realities3and to accommodate those Member States  includingAustralia and New Zealand  which wish to be placed intheir most appropriate regional or geopoliticalgrouping.Only an inclusive and universal United Nationscan effectively perform its mandate in the twenty-firstcentury. We must show greater understanding towardsthose who request to participate in the work of ourOrganization.May I take this opportunity to reiterate the pointmade by Solomon Islands during the MillenniumSummit relating to the principle of an all-inclusive anduniversal United Nations. A case in point is that whichrelates to the reunification of China  which wouldfoster greater stability in world affairs and effectivelybolster the activities of the Organization. This newapproach by the United Nations for the two Chinas willenhance greater understanding in pragmatic diplomacyand pave the way for efforts currently under way in theKorean peninsula. This is not impossible to achieve  aswe saw just before the turn of the century in thereunification of the two Germanys.The challenges facing the United Nations in thetwenty-first century are daunting. An effective UnitedNations demands the steadfast commitment andsupport of all its Members. The rich and powerful mustpay their dues on time  in full and without conditions.Above all  the United Nations needs global politicalwill and resources to maintain peace and security promote sustainable development  addressenvironmental degradation  combat poverty and diseaseand foster respect for human dignity.Human problems will always remain with us  butthe way to resolve them should be through dialogueand discussion. This is the approach my Government istaking towards resolving the current ethnic unrest inour country. Attaining peace could be a painful andslow process  it could be fragile and imperfect whenachieved  but we believe we can do it. We must however  go beyond achieving peace. We must provideour people with the values and skills that will sustainpeace. As we enter the twenty-first century  let usreaffirm our commitment to work in partnership withothers in pursuit of global peace and human security."
"149",6264,"SLE",55,2000,"May I  on behalf ofmy delegation and the Government and people of theRepublic of Sierra Leone  add my vice to those beforeme to offer warm felicitations on your election asPresident of this epoch-making fifty-fifth session of theGeneral Assembly  the Millennium Assembly. Yourlong and distinguished career in the service of yourcountry and on the international scene makes youeminently suitable for election. My delegation isconfident that under your able guidance  ourdeliberations will be smooth and productive. Indeed we have seen evidence of that in your insistence onpunctuality. I want to assure you  Sir  of mydelegation's fullest cooperation.To our brother and colleague Mr. Theo-BenGurirab of Namibia  I convey my delegation's gratitudeand appreciation for the able manner in which heconducted the affairs of the fifty-fourth session of theGeneral Assembly.I should like to thank Mr. Kofi Annan  theSecretary-General of the United Nations  and hiscolleagues and staff  whose dedication to duty deservesthe highest commendation. I extend our specialgratitude to Mr. Annan for his insight into the problemsin my country and the objective manner in which hehas reported his findings to the Security Council. TheUnited Nations Security Council has deployed over13 000 peacekeeping troops in Sierra Leone  the largestnumber in any country at any one time. Incollaboration with my Government  it is setting up aspecial court to try all those who are guilty of the mosthorrendous and atrocious crimes against humanity. Infurtherance of its interest in bringing stability to thecountry  it has planned to send a high-level delegationto Sierra Leone to assess the situation on the ground.I should also like to extend a warmcongratulations to Tuvalu on its admission as the 189thMember of this Organization.2Following the unwarranted criminal abduction bythe Revolutionary United Front (RUF) of hundreds ofUnited Nations peacekeeping troops of the UnitedNations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL)  apeaceful demonstration by the members of civil societyof Sierra Leone was organized to appeal to FodaySankoh  the leader of the RUF  for the unconditionalrelease of the hostages and to prevail upon him tocooperate in order successfully to implement the LoméPeace Agreement  especially the Disarmament Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR) Programme.As soon as the demonstrators reached hisresidence  Mr. Sankoh's men opened fire on theunarmed and defenceless crowd  gunning down 20 andseriously wounding several others  two of whom laterdied in hospital. Subsequent events have revealed thatthe RUF had planned a bloody overthrow of the electedGovernment on the following day  9 May 2000. This atfirst put the whole Lomé Peace Agreement in doubt especially Mr. Sankoh's role as leader of the RUF.Under the Lomé Peace Agreement  Mr. Sankohwas appointed Chairman of the Strategic MineralResources Commission  with the status of a vice-president; he used this position to open secretnegotiations with a number of people for theexploitation and sale of Sierra Leone's diamonds without reference to any other person.The Government of Sierra Leone had signed theLomé Peace Agreement in the belief that it would putan end to the atrocities being inflicted on defencelesscivilians  especially women and children. Among otherthings  it provided for the demobilization  disarmamentand reintegration of former combatants into society. Itprovided for the repatriation and resettlement ofrefugees and internally displaced people. It alsoprovided for the deployment of United Nationspeacekeepers (UNAMSIL) in the country. The RUFleaders have forfeited their right to benefit from theprovisions of Lomé; however  because of its otherprovisions  my Government will revive the Agreement particularly the DDR Programme.My Government has already expressedcondolences to the Governments of those who lost theirlives during the hostage-taking. UNAMSIL is to becongratulated for the professional manner in which itfreed the hostages. Another group of bandits  the so-called “West Side Boys”  had seized and held captive 1Sierra Leone soldier and 10 British servicemen whowere in Sierra Leone to train a professional army whichwould be responsible to the democratically electedGovernment of the country. That group refused torelease the hostages  despite the long and patientnegotiations  and was even beginning to threaten theirlives.Mercifully  to everyone's relief  the hostages havenow been rescued. Unfortunately  one member of theBritish rescue team lost his life  while another wasseriously wounded. My Government has alreadycongratulated the British Government for theprofessionalism of the rescue team. At the same time we have expressed heartfelt condolences for the loss ofthe life of a member of the team.Another recent and very welcome resolution ofthe Security Council is the ban on the sale of illegaldiamonds from Sierra Leone  the so-called “BloodDiamonds”. As is well known  the proceeds from thistrade have been used to fuel the rebel war machine. Iwould like to thank the Government of the UnitedKingdom  the United States of America and Canada fortheir perseverance in opposing this horrible activity calling things by their proper names and pointingfingers in the right direction. My country is confidentthat the new arrangements for the marketing of ourdiamonds will not only end the illegal trade but willalso bring sanity into the system  to the benefit of thecountry.Thanks to the decisive actions of the SecurityCouncil and the Economic Community of West AfricanStates under the indefatigable leadership of PresidentObasanjo of Nigeria and President Konare of Mali Sierra Leoneans now see a real light at the end of whathas been a long and tortuous tunnel. The forthcomingtrials of those who have committed such horrendousand inhuman crimes against their fellow countrymenwill be a signal to would-be adventurers that such actswill no longer go unpunished.No words can sufficiently express the thanks andgratitude of the people of Sierra Leone to the SecurityCouncil  the international community as a whole andtroop-contributing countries. Following the occupationand destruction of economic areas  the carting away ofour resources  the displacement of hundreds ofthousands of our people and the wanton destruction oflife and property  I would like to appeal to all ourfriends to continue and intensify their humanitarian3assistance and to support programmes for rebuildingour country.We have just entered a new millennium  bringingwith us many unresolved problems — problems whichhave been discussed in this and other internationalforums over the years and which appear to lack anysolution. We have only one world  and my delegationbelieves that it is worth our love. We should thereforedemonstrate that love by adequately addressingoutstanding issues like general disarmament  nuclearnon-proliferation  peaceful settlement of disputes prohibition and control of small arms  prohibition oflandmines  poverty alleviation  affordable drugs andtreatment of debilitating and killer diseases such asmalaria and HIV/AIDS  advancing the Middle Eastpeace process in accordance with various SecurityCouncil resolutions  equitable trade negotiations and of course  reform of the Security Council."
"150",6311,"SLV",55,2000,"It is a source of great satisfaction for me tocongratulate you  Sir  a former Prime Minister ofFinland  on your election to the presidency of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-fifth session  whichfaithfully reflects your personal virtues and diplomaticexperience.I am also pleased to offer my most sincerecongratulations to the Minister for Foreign Affairs ofNamibia  Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  for his excellent workat the previous session  and in particular for his work tocoordinate the preparatory activities for the MillenniumSummit.Special mention should be made of Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his indefatigable work topromote the mandate of this Organization and for hisvision for strengthening its future activities  set out inhis excellent report We  the peoples: the role of theUnited Nations in the twenty-first century.With regard to the situation in El Salvador  theprocess of implementing the peace agreements hasbeen an exceptionally arduous and highly complex taskthat has been made possible by the firm political willof the Government; by the willingness of theSalvadoran people and all the country's politicalforces; and by national efforts that have enjoyed thevaluable cooperation of the international community  inparticular the group of friendly countries  which havealways remained close to us  and the United Nations whose verification work has contributed to the successof peace in El Salvador and to national reconciliation.We are now entering a new phase of our historyin which political and economic freedoms prevail. Thiswill ensure the continuity of a broader and deeperprocess requiring the cooperation and participation ofall national sectors and the renewed support of theinternational community in consolidating the progressachieved and in making further advances towards morehumane and supportive forms of co-existence withinthe framework imposed by our institutions anddemocratic Government.During this phase  we have opened up newpossibilities and opportunities for all sectors of thecountry to benefit from peace in democracy and tomeet together the challenge of continuing to work toreduce existing disparities in our society  particularlyeconomic and social ones. In this vein  poverty in itsvarious forms is and always has been a structuralproblem  of which every country in the world is aware.In our case  we are according it priority attention  notonly to ensure that these phenomena do not undermineour emerging democracy  which was won by our peoplewith so much pain and blood  but also so that we canassign it due support and social context.On this basis  President Francisco Flores of ElSalvador has focused his government plan onincreasing the levels of well-being and progress for allSalvadorans. He has concentrated his attention on themost vulnerable and dispossessed sectors in order toimprove their quality of life through a policy togenerate employment and job opportunities viaenhanced productivity  the promotion of trade andincreased investments on the basis of sharedresponsibility. As President Flores has already done inthis forum  I would emphasize the fact that the futureof our nation is in our own hands. Each individual group and sector of our society must assume its ownresponsibilities and duties in order to overcome theproblems of and obstacles to the promotion of growthand sustainable human development.Similarly  President Flores has emphasized thefact that in a globalized and interdependent world solidarity and international cooperation are vital tocomplement the efforts of the developing countries inorder to face the global challenges jointly and withgreater capacity. It must be understood that this doesnot mean that the international community  and theindustrialized countries in particular  are going to solveour problems  but rather that they can contribute to thecreation of an international environment that providesopportunities  including policies that offer greateraccess to their markets for the products of developingcountries  investment opportunities  the transfer oftechnology and information  and fulfilling thecommitments made to improve development assistance.We know that we are facing an enormous andcomplex task  and in this effort we hope that we cancontinue to rely on the valuable support of themultilateral institutions and the community of nations with whom we share interests and problems  inparticular the joint mission to preserve and consolidatepeace after conflicts have come to an end. In thisregard  as we celebrate the International Year for theCulture of Peace  I would like to reiterate theimportance that El Salvador attaches to the continuityof the efforts focused on strengthening a culture ofpeace  especially on the eve of the International16Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence forthe Children of the World.In Central America  since 1987  when theagreement on the Procedures for the establishment ofa firm and lasting peace in Central America wassigned  our peoples have welcomed with hope and havesupported national  regional and internationalinitiatives to achieve pacification in the region. Theseefforts culminated in specific agreements that made itpossible to end the armed conflicts in the affectedcountries and to carry out profound political andinstitutional transformations  which have contributed toimproving living conditions for all the peoples in theregion.Along the way we have adopted and implementedmeasures and mechanisms that  in a general sense  havemade it possible to guarantee human rights andfundamental freedoms  establishing the base fromwhich Central America can begin democratic life  freefrom armed conflicts and with legitimate andsovereignly elected Governments. These Governments in fulfilment of their historical responsibilities  haveestablished institutions and developed a process ofconsultation in order to coordinate and harmonizeefforts to overcome the profound causes of conflictsand to avoid retreating from the advances achieved.It is important to reiterate in this forum that thecountries of Central America have reaffirmed ourcommitments to make Central America a region ofpeace  liberty  democracy and development  and inparticular to foster gradually and progressively aCentral American union. This is the best route forensuring a prosperous future for the region and  at thesame time  to strengthen our capacity to confront ourproblems in the best possible way  as well as to take onthe new challenges arising from globalization andinterdependence.There is no doubt that the progress achieved atthe regional level in the coordination and unification ofthe internal and external policies of the countries of theregion represents real proof of the determination of ourGovernments to make sure that unity prevails overdivision. In our opinion there are more reasons thatunite us than divide us  and we affirm with completeconfidence that in a globalized and interdependentcontext the viability of Central America will depend onthe joint effort to build our common historic future.This is why we must reorient our efforts so that theymeet the requirements  aspirations and needs of ourCentral American people  through specific programmesthat provide our people direct and tangible benefits.Allow me to speak about other important items onthe agenda and in the current international situationthat are of interest to the Government of El Salvador.A few days ago the Millennium Summit wasconcluded  and we can say that the results obtained inthe deliberations and reflected in the final Declarationhave inspired us with hope. In particular we areheartened by the commitments made to strengthenpeace  security and disarmament. Among the mostnotable of these commitments are to eliminate weaponsof mass destruction and to fight against transnationalcrime in all its dimensions  including the globalproblem of drugs and related crimes  against the illicittrafficking in small arms  and against internationalterrorism.We also are hopeful because of the commitmentson a highly sensitive and worrisome issue for ourcountries: development and the eradication of poverty and also on the need to develop a multilateral trade andfinancial system that is open and equitable and is basedon rules that are predictable and non-discriminatory.And we are also hopeful because of the commitmentsto make sure that the high-level intergovernmentalmeeting on financing for development is a success.We should mention as well the decision to reduceby half  by the year 2015  the percentage of people onthe Earth whose income is less than one dollar a day including reducing hunger  and on access to drinkingwater  promoting equal access to various levels ofeducation and promoting gender equality  reducingmaternal mortality and the propagation of diseasesincluding AIDS  and protecting vulnerable individuals.We would also highlight the commitments madeto preserve the environment and to intensify efforts toreduce the number and effects of natural disasters. Wewould highlight as well the commitments regardingviolations of human rights  democracy and the goodmanagement of political affairs.In our opinion the issue of the strengthening ofthe United Nations deserves special attention becauseof the situation that the Organization currently faceswith regard to fulfilling its mandate  which has beenapparent during the last 10 years more than at any othertime in its history. A crisis of confidence  credibility17and capacity has increased the conviction of themajority of Member States that it is absolutelynecessary to introduce substantive changes in the basicstructure of the Organization and in its decision-making processes in order to reflect the realities of thecurrent international order  which has greatly changedsince the adoption of the Charter of the United Nations.The international situation today is morecomplex  multifaceted and uncertain  blendingproblems and conflicts that have become permanentfixtures on the international agenda  and there are newchallenges and threats that transcend national borders.These include phenomena that undermine the security sovereignty and independence of States. Takentogether  these developments provide yet furtherjustification for the existence of the United Nations  aswell as for the validity of its objectives and principles.We recognize and welcome the changesintroduced in the basic functional and administrativestructure of the United Nations in order to improve itsefficiency. Nevertheless  we share the general opinionregarding the imperative need to undertake integralreform. This reform should include substantialtransformations in the principal organs  not only so thatthe Organization can better fulfil its mandate  but alsoto overcome the contradictions underlying provisionsin the Charter so that the system will function in a trulydemocratic and transparent manner.First  we must recognize that for many years nowthe mandate of the Economic and Social Council hasbeen questioned. Therefore  we believe it is necessaryto resume negotiations aimed at adopting measures torevitalize one the main functions of the United Nations which is the promotion of economic and socialdevelopment. In particular  priority should be grantedto sustainable development  with special emphasis onfighting poverty  the fight against drugs and AIDS  theprotection of the environment and respect for humanrights. All of this is in conformity with thecommitments in the Millennium Declaration andespecially with the objectives pursued throughpreventive diplomacy. For this purpose  we believe it isappropriate to reexamine the initiative to create aneconomic security council which would be responsiblefor dealing with development problems.Secondly  we believe it is extremely important toexamine and evaluate the functions and powers of theGeneral Assembly  given that this is an essential organand the most representative body in the structure of theOrganization. Nevertheless  its decisions are limitedand are not binding upon the Member States. As aresult efforts must be made to strengthen and broadenthe Assembly's competence as a political forum inorder to ensure the true role that it must play in worldaffairs. In particular the Assembly should be givengreater responsibility in the decision-making process.This would not only strengthen the democratizationand transparency of the actions of the Organization; itwould also give the Assembly the legitimacy it requiresin order to carry out collective action.Thirdly  the reform of the Security Council is from our point of view  one of the biggest challengesfacing Member States  for my Government it is amatter of concern that after seven years of negotiationswe have not made progress on the substantive pointsrelated to the category  number and privileges of newmembers  as well as on the question of the veto  whichis currently an exclusive privilege of the permanentmembers.The differences and the inflexible positions wehave seen are unacceptable because they create asituation which  in our view  contributes to the lack ofcredibility and a loss of confidence in the system ofcollective security. It is urgent and we cannot postponeovercoming our differences and granting each otherconcessions so that we can reach a general  fair andequitable agreement in order to achieve the aims of thereform and realize the legitimate interests and hopes ofmost of the countries of the international community.El Salvador joins in the very fair demand expressed so many times in this forum  to increase thenumber of permanent and non-permanent members toinclude industrialized and developing countries faithfully reflecting the current world configuration.The numbers should reflect the current membership ofthe Organization with equal responsibilities and duerespect for geographic distribution. The use of the vetoprivilege should be limited to Chapter VII of theCharter.I would like now to refer to other importantissues which are part of the Assembly's agenda in thenew millennium. These issues have importantrepercussions for Member States as regardsinternational peace and security  as well as seriousconsequences for the future of our Organization.18On behalf of the people and Government of ElSalvador  we welcome Tuvalu as a new Member of theOrganization. This act confirms the right of people tobe represented in this worldwide Organization andillustrates the universal nature of the United Nations.The Charter was adopted on behalf of the peoplewho comprise the international community and consequently  the United Nations cannot  and must not close the door to any people which expresses itssovereign will and desire to be represented in the worldOrganization.May I refer to the special case which has beendiscussed in the Assembly each of the last eight yearsregarding the need to examine the exceptionalinternational situation of the Republic of China inTaiwan with a view to guaranteeing full respect for thefundamental rights of its 23 million inhabitants toparticipate in the activities of the United Nations.We support the establishment of a working groupin the Assembly to examine the appropriate place thatthe Republic of China should have in internationalbodies. We want to make it quite clear that our supportfor this initiative is not intended as an intervention inthe internal affairs of another Member State. Nor doesit represent opposition to the peaceful reunification ofthe Chinese people. Rather  it represents therecognition of the right of a people to realize their justaspirations  a people which exercises democratic rightsin a country with which we have had excellent relationsfor more than 50 years.El Salvador participated with great interest in the2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty onthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Werecognize that  even though the results were not exactlywhat we desired  encouraging agreements anddecisions were reached in the effort to achieve theobjectives of the denuclearization regime which seeksto encourage nuclear States to act in good faith  to meettheir international responsibilities and duties and tocontinue negotiations aimed at eliminating the threat ofnuclear war. With these ideas  we join the members ofthe international community who have expressed theirfirm support for the proposal by the Secretary-Generalto convene an international conference aimed atseeking ways to eliminate the nuclear threat.With regard to conventional weapons  we wish torefer specifically to small arms and light weapons inlight of the fact that El Salvador underwent the tragicexperience of an armed conflict during the 1980s  aconflict that was intense and of long duration preciselybecause of the entry and spread of this type ofweaponry  weaponry which entered our countryillegally in order to supply the irregular militias.However  these weapons reached other parts of thepopulation and resulted in a large number of casualtiesand the phenomenon of displaced persons and refugeesfrom the areas of conflict. This situation was solvedafter the signing of the Peace Agreement in 1992.Not only do small arms and light weapons affectconflicts  be they internal or international  but traffic inthese weapons has become a danger for public securityand a threat to stability  as well as a threat to thedemocracy and sovereignty of States  when theseweapons are used in activities that constitutetransnational threats  such as terrorism  drugtrafficking  money laundering and international crime.For this reason we firmly support the United NationsConference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms andLight Weapons in All Its Aspects  to be held in 200l.With regard to domestic or international conflictsthat continue to occupy the attention of theinternational community and our Organization  we canonly express our concern and regret that agreementshave not yet been reached to guarantee peace  despitemultilateral efforts. We urge all parties directlyinvolved in each of the countries in conflict to abandontheir individual or group interests so that through anational effort  political agreements can be reachedwhich will make it possible for lasting permanentpeace to be established in conformity with theaspirations of the peoples.May I also refer to the Middle East. Here webelieve that the recent negotiations at Camp David arean important step in the difficult road to peace. Wehope that it will be possible to achieve stable andlasting peace within sure borders for all the peoples ofthe region.In conclusion  I should like to emphasize that theMillennium Summit and the Millennium Assembly arehistoric events that could mark the beginning of a newera in the international order. Indeed  the MillenniumDeclaration is an ambitious but vital programme tocollectively resolve our common problems. Hence  it isimperative that the commitments which we have madebecome a reality and  in the short term  we should takeconcrete steps and show political will for their19implementation. The peoples and Governments of thedeveloping world will be watching closely and we shalldo our utmost to implement those commitments. Froma realistic point of view they require the decisivesupport of the developed world in order to be fullyimplemented."
"151",6336,"SMR",55,2000,"﻿Allow me first of allto congratulate you  Sir  on your assumption of thepresidency of the fifty-fifth session of the GeneralAssembly. I wish also to congratulate most sincerelythe Secretary-General on his comprehensive anddetailed report outlining the most important challengesfacing the international community in the twenty-firstcentury.9The heads of State or Government of the StatesMembers of the United Nations drew inspiration fromthis important document for the Millennium Summit which has just concluded  at which they expressed theircollective commitment and determination to adoptpolicies in favour of a globalization process benefitingthe entire world population.International cooperation among Governmentswill pave the way for an increasingly integrated systemin which all States are inevitably involved  thusbringing all the peoples of the world closer together.San Marino believes that a wider globalization processof a juridical  ethical and cultural nature  in whichsolidarity is a major concern  is a sine qua non for theachievement of genuine economic globalization.The Republic I represent is fully convinced that itis the responsibility of all countries of the world toensure economic and social development and toaddress threats to international peace and security  andthat the United Nations must play a central role inshaping our common future.Against this backdrop  the question of the leastdeveloped countries burdened with a huge foreign debtmust be re-examined  in the conviction that debt reliefmust form an integral part of the contribution offeredby the international community to worldwidedevelopment.Since the economic and social development ofmany countries is being irreparably hindered by debtproblems  international solidarity is an imperative foreverybody  just as human rights and dignity must notbe violated in the name of market laws.At the dawn of the third millennium  it isunacceptable that half of the world's population stilllives in extreme poverty  with an income of barely twodollars a day. The indifference to this problem is adisgrace to humanity as a whole  since we are all wellaware that poverty often triggers domestic andinternational conflicts and leads to exploitation andunderdevelopment.Against this gloomy background characterized byblatant contrasts  the international community mustconcentrate its efforts on the protection of the mostvulnerable  who bear the heaviest burden  and must payspecial attention to women and children  who are themain victims of poverty  violence and exploitation.Prompted by the conviction that legal cooperation  atan international level  is crucial to the protection of therights of the child  San Marino was the first country tosign  this year  the Optional Protocol on childpornography  and the second country to sign theOptional Protocol on the involvement of children inarmed conflicts. The Republic is actively preparing toparticipate in the Special Session on Children to beheld in September 2001  where progress made over thelast decade in the protection of children will bereviewed. On that occasion  the internationalcommunity will lay the foundations for ensuring thatchildren enjoy their full juridical status.Well aware that legal equality between men andwomen has become a major concern  both nationallyand internationally  San Marino welcomes the resultsof the 1995 Beijing Conference  as well as those of itsfollow-up special review session held in New York lastJune.The technology revolution  among the mostimportant ones of the last decades  has caused radicalchanges in international relations. We all hope thatinformation technology and the Internet will beincreasingly used by the poorest countries asinstruments of economic and cultural development. Inthis context  I wish to reiterate my country'scommitment and willingness to take part in the latestUnited Nations projects aimed at reducing illiteracythrough computer science and promoting theknowledge and use of new technologies in developingcountries. In this way  new technologies  far fromwidening the gap between rich and poor countries  willbenefit everybody.In this spirit  the international community as awhole has the duty to contribute to the consolidation ofdemocracy in Africa and to help its populations  underthe auspices of the United Nations  in their struggle forlasting peace  poverty eradication and the achievementof just and sustainable social development.The entire international community has the moraland civil obligation to put an end to the conflictsafflicting many African countries and to counter thegrowing instability caused by ethnic and territorialdivisions in some of these States or regions. In fact  ifinternational peace is to be attained  the right of eachindividual to live in peace and security must beguaranteed.The numerous and cruel acts of genocidewitnessed by the twentieth century recently led the10international community to set up an InternationalCriminal Court in order to prevent the authors ofcrimes against humanity from going unpunished. SanMarino  the first European country to ratify the Statuteof the Court  hopes that other Parliaments will add tothe 19 having already deposited their instruments ofratification  so as to attain the minimum number enabling the Court to be operative and become ajuridical and moral authority.On behalf of my country  I wish to thank theSecretary-General for having made the Organizationmore efficient and modern  through a series of reforms.Yet  with regard to the reform of the Security Council Member States could not make any decision in theabsence of a general agreement. In this regard  let meexpress my sincere hope for a comprehensive democratic and fair reform of the Security Councilsoon.At the beginning of a new millennium  theconsolidation of a more efficient and representativegovernance  at an international level  bridging the gapbetween the haves and have-nots  is our commonexpectation. Globalization being an irreversibleprocess  we rely on the power and ability of thisinstitution  which we believe in and which we arestriving to strengthen."
"152",6374,"SOM",55,2000,"It is a singular honourand privilege for me to be here today to address thissession of the General Assembly. On this auspiciousoccasion  I would like to take this opportunity tocongratulate you  Mr. President  on your unanimouselection to this eminent position. Taking into accountyour Excellency's wide experience in internationalaffairs  I am confident that you will successfullycontribute to the work and deliberations before thisAssembly.Permit me also  Mr. President  to pay specialtribute to your predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  Minister for Foreign Affairs of theRepublic of Namibia  who conducted the affairs of theAssembly in a most successful manner during his termof office.Our profound gratitude also goes to our able anddynamic Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. KofiAnnan  who has shown exemplary leadership anddemonstrated efficiency in managing the activities ofour Organization. Indeed  he has played a pivotal rolein the enhancement of the Organization's aims andobjectives  and in furthering peace  stability andinternational cooperation the world over.I am highly honoured to address this Assemblytoday in the presence of my colleague and brother  HisExcellency Mr. Ismail Omar Guelleh  President of theRepublic of Djibouti. In this regard  I would like to payspecial tribute for the exceptional role played by HisExcellency  his Government and the people of Djiboutiin our recently concluded national reconciliationconference  held in Arta  a resort town near Djibouti.In contrast to the previous 12 Somalireconciliation conferences  held in the past 10 years invarious capitals  the Arta reconciliation conference wasunique and more focused. While the previousreconciliation conferences were based on attempts toreconcile the personal differences and rivalries betweenpower-seeking faction leaders  the Arta conference  onthe other hand  concentrated essentially on theconstructive engagement and the interaction of thevarious components of Somali society  such astraditional clan elders and sultans  religious leaders intellectuals  politicians and representatives of thevarious sectors of Somali civil society. More than2 000 delegates from inside and outside the countryattended the conference  the deliberations of whichcontinued for more than five months.It was in the context of this transparent processthat a consensus was reached on the agenda and criteriafor participation in the conference  based on thebalanced and equitable representation of the variousclans in the country. In pursuance of this innovativeapproach  the conference conducted its business. Thisled to the general agreement on the adoption of aTransitional Charter. The Charter  inter alia  providedfor the establishment of the basic constitutional organsof the Third Republic of the Somali State: the National22Assembly  the President  the Council of Ministers andan independent judiciary. In accordance with thesetransitional measures  the first organ the conferenceestablished was the National Assembly. In turn  theNational Assembly elected the President in a fair andfree manner in the presence of observers andrepresentatives of the international community.The outcome of the Arta reconciliationconference received an overwhelming endorsement ofthe Somali people within the country and in thediaspora. Strong messages of support and pledgespoured into Arta from all regions of the country andfrom Somali communities abroad.In contrast to anarchy and civil war  whichprevailed in Somalia for the past 10 years  the creationof the National Assembly and the election of aPresident ushered in a new era for peace and stabilityand constituted the first step of restoring order andcentral authority to the country. This was indeedtranslated into reality during my recent visit toMogadishu and Baidoa. The spontaneous reaction ofthe hundreds of thousands of people who welcomed usin both cities demonstrated vividly that they wanted toleave years of civil war behind and open a new era ofpeace  tranquillity  good governance  restoration of therule of law and national unity.In this connection  let me emphasize the fact thatthe majority of the Somali people in the regions that wewere not able to visit  including the regions in thenorthwest and northeast of the country  uphold a sharedcommitment and optimism for the unity and futureprogress of the country.With regard to the warlords and individuals whostill remain outside the reconciliation process  weexpress our full preparedness to engage with them inpeaceful dialogue  and we call upon them to reviewtheir positions  hear the voice of reason  and respect thelegitimate aspirations of the Somali people to achievenational unity  social and economic development anddurable peace throughout the country.The challenges that the Somali Republic facestoday are monumental. My Government is prepared tomeet those challenges with a realistic approach. Weunderstand that our country stands today in the midstof a crisis of serious proportions. We shall exercisecare  compassion and objectivity to manage that crisisand overcome it in the end.There has been large-scale destruction of thephysical infrastructure and resources in both urban andrural areas. Generations of children have not gone toschool for almost two decades. A good number of high-level managerial staff and skilled technicians have leftthe country. The role of the international community inassisting us in peace-building  rehabilitation andreconstruction is therefore of pivotal importance for us.There should be no relaxation by the internationalcommunity in the overall effort to providehumanitarian and developmental assistance to theSomali Republic.We will engage Somali professionals andtechnical experts inside and outside the country to beactively involved in all reconstruction programmes andprojects. We will also give indigenous and internationalnon-governmental organizations and relevant UnitedNations agencies all the necessary assistance to be ableto contribute effectively to the rehabilitation andreconstruction of the country.I would like to emphasize that my Governmentwill place particular emphasis in the immediate futureon the following priority areas: first  restoration ofpeace  stability and national unity  and the formation ofan effective security force to consolidate them;secondly  disarmament of the militias and theirencampment  subsequent rehabilitation and training inall the regions of the country; and  thirdly  maintenanceof law and order through the creation of effective lawenforcement agencies and professional courts of law.Within the framework of that policy  my Governmentwill promote and consolidate peace  security and unityin the country at large.At the international level  we reaffirm ourunqualified support for the principles and objectives ofthe United Nations and pledge to cooperate withrelevant regional and subregional organizations namely  the Organization of African Unity  the Leagueof Arab States  the Organization of the IslamicConference and the Inter-Governmental Authority onDevelopment. We shall also maintain and strengthenour relations with the European Union. We would liketo open up new vistas of cooperation and economic tieswith other organizations  such as the Gulf CooperationCouncil and the Association of South-East AsianNations.My Government will promote strong links ofcooperation with the countries of the Horn of Africa23and the Red Sea based on the principles of mutualrespect  sovereign equality of States and non-interference in the internal affairs of other States  asprovided in the Charter of the United Nations. We willpromote economic partnership  open borders andcommon port services among the countries of the Hornof Africa.In conclusion  my delegation requests theAssembly to facilitate the adoption of a resolutionunder the title “Assistance to the Somali Republic”relating to the following areas of need: first  urgentassistance from Member States for the rehabilitationand reconstruction of Somalia; secondly  resumption ofsustained economic cooperation with the internationalcommunity in general and with Member States of theUnited Nations in particular; and  thirdly  a call onrelevant United Nations agencies and organizations toredouble their efforts in providing financial andmaterial assistance to the people of Somalia.Finally  I extend my profound appreciation to theUnited Nations for the commendable role it has playedin the efforts to alleviate the plight of the Somalipeople during the last 10 years. We also wish toexpress our appreciation for the efforts of the worldbody in its continued search for a solution to ourpolitical crisis throughout the decade  and for itscontinued humanitarian support and assistance to theSomali people. I am confident that the United Nationswill continue to provide support for the realization ofthe aspirations of the Somali people to stability  peaceand development."
"153",6452,"SUR",55,2000,"On behalf of theGovernment and people of the Republic of Suriname  Iwould like first of all to join previous speakers inextending my congratulations to Mr. Harri Holkeri onhis assumption of the presidency of the fifty-fifthMillennium session of the General Assembly.Allow me also to pay tribute to his predecessor Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  for the outstanding and fruitfulway in which he guided the work of the fifty-fourthsession of the General Assembly.My delegation wishes to express its deepappreciation to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his21continuing and tireless efforts in steering the UnitedNations through the uncharted waters of world affairswhile adapting it to the new global forces of change.We welcome Tuvalu into the family of nations and the Republic of Suriname looks forward toworking together with it in implementing the principlesand goals of the Organization.This Millennium Assembly is a uniqueopportunity to take stock of  and to reflect on  recentexperiences with the phenomenon of globalization which continues to dominate developments in theeconomic  political and cultural field at both thenational and international levels  affecting the dailylives of millions of people  their institutions andrelations between States.We recognize that while globalization can be apowerful and dynamic force in the promotion ofeconomic growth and development  it also poses risksand new challenges to individuals and nations alike.The fact of the matter is that globalization hasgenerated new economic disparities  as its benefitsremain highly concentrated in only a few countries.This has brought about increased vulnerability andeconomic instability  in particular to the leastdeveloped countries and to the structurally weak andvulnerable small States.Many of these countries have difficulty in copingwith the increased competition arising from tradeliberalization and lack the capacity to take advantage ofthe new opportunities brought about by globalization which in turn puts them at risk of marginalization andeven complete exclusion  the so-called big losers ofglobalization.It is for this reason that  during the recently heldMillennium Summit  consensus was reached at thehighest political level that globalization must beconsidered in the wider context of development and ofour shared responsibility to ensure that  through a moreinclusive  transparent and participatory decision-making process in international economic issues  thebenefits of globalization are accessible to all on anequal footing.We also concur with the view that the UnitedNations  as the most universal forum  has a crucial andcentral role to play in forging understanding andconsensus among its Members  so as to create moreopportunities for all  and indeed not to leave billions ofpeople in a state of poverty and exclusion. We lookforward to concrete actions to be taken in this regard.All nations have a collective responsibility toaddress current global concerns  such asunderdevelopment and acute poverty  the growinginequality within and among nations  violent conflictsand civil wars which cause untold human suffering inthe South and are fuelled by the global arms bazaar environmental degradation  refugees and migration HIV/AIDS and other threats to public health  bridgingthe digital divide and the emergence of globalcriminal conglomerates.In the context of the aforementioned  we welcomethe initiative taken by the Secretary-General to create adigital task force with the aim of bridging the digitaldivide. In order not to lag behind in our present eradominated by the advances in information andcommunications technology  the President of theRepublic of Suriname launched a national informationand communications technology initiative in hisinaugural statement on 12 August of this year in orderto catch the Internet Express without delay and topromote national access to information andcommunication services at all levels of education andall areas of the public domain. We welcome thecontribution of the Kingdom of Norway to assist thesmall island developing States (SIDS) in this regard.Last April  the developing countries met inHavana and  in a renewed spirit of cooperation solidarity and shared responsibilities  they agreed toclose ranks and implement an action-orientedprogramme to assist the developing countries inbridging the gap with their more affluent partners fromthe North. Although essential in contributing todevelopment  South-South cooperation is not areplacement for North-South cooperation; neverthelessbetter relations between the members of the South willcontribute to better relations between the South and theNorth.Unfortunately  globalization and tradeliberalization have not created the necessary conditionsto accelerate growth and development for small andvulnerable States. On the contrary  these countries havebeen further marginalized in world economic affairsand are threatened by the provisions of the World TradeOrganization (WTO)  demanding an end to the specialand preferential arrangements  enacted solely to levelthe playing field. We  therefore  reiterate our request22for the international community's early adoption of avulnerability index so as to consider assistance to thesecountries  based on their specific vulnerabilities andnot solely on their gross domestic product. We arepleased that an appeal was made in the MillenniumDeclaration to enact such a vulnerability index.Recently  the 12 Presidents of South Americaassembled in Brasilia to discuss daunting issues thatare common to the region and to pledge their politicalwill and support as a firm foundation for enhancedcooperation among their respective countries. We thankthe Government of Brazil for so gracefully hosting thisSummit. The Declaration coming out of that meeting in letter and spirit  underlined the necessity of closercooperation between our countries in order to be ableto adapt successfully to the demands of globalization.At the dawn of the new millennium  theGovernment of Suriname considers it of crucialimportance that Member States achieve tangible resultsin the areas of disarmament  arms control and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons in maintaining peaceand reinforcing international security for all States.The reform of the Security Council remainscrucial for our efforts to make the United Nations moreeffective in dealing with global peace and securityissues. So far  however  reaching consensus on how torestructure and reform this important body has eludedus as a consequence of differences among the MemberStates with respect to the scope and nature of theneeded changes. My Government reiterates its viewthat the membership of this Council should beincreased with members from both the developed anddeveloping world and considers in this context theproposals presented by the Non-Aligned Movement(NAM) as instrumental.We also believe that agreement must be reachedon defining the relationship between the Council andother principal organs of the United Nations  such asthe Economic and Social Council and the GeneralAssembly. We are of the opinion that the SecurityCouncil should focus its actions on creating a peacefulsecurity environment  while the temporarily establishedUnited Nations involvements related to socio-economicand political development in affected countries shouldbe coordinated by the Economic and Social Counciland/or the General Assembly. Such an arrangement based on the Charter provisions  will undoubtedlycontribute to greater effectiveness and efficiency of theUnited Nations  while limiting the influence of nationalpolicy considerations on its activities. Let us use themomentum created by the Millennium Summit tostrengthen our resolve in reaching a consensus on thismatter as soon as possible.The Government of Suriname wishes tounderscore the importance of the United Nations as theuniversal forum to enable Member States to reachconsensus on issues related to peace  security development and international economic cooperation.We wish to express our gratitude to the Kingdom of theNetherlands for resuming bilateral cooperation betweenour countries and to thank them for their support in thisarea.The United Nations Charter embodies lofty andnoble principles that remain valid today  as wasreiterated by all the Heads of State and Government atthe recently held Millennium Summit.In order to make the United Nations a moreeffective instrument in the hands of the world's people we must continue to be guided by these principles inconducting national and international affairs. In thisregard  it is essential to honour the commitment toproviding the necessary financial means in a timely andpredictable manner in order to enable the UnitedNations to fulfil its mandates.Finally  as we enter the new millennium in anemerging global village  we must bear in mind that weare one human family in all our diversity  living in onecommon homeland  the planet Earth  and that we musttherefore cooperate in creating a more just  moresustainable and more peaceful world in which everyonewill live in a clean environment with a fair distributionof the Earth's resources  indeed  as the Secretary-General has called for in his millennium report  a worldfree from want  free from fear  that does notcompromise the ability of our planet to provide for theneeds of our children and for future generations. Mycountry stands ready to play its part and to contributeto this  our common endeavour."
"154",6476,"SVK",55,2000,"At the outset  I wouldlike to warmly congratulate you  Mr. President  on yourelection to the presidency of the General Assembly atthis session. I am confident that your vast experienceand outstanding record of achievements will guaranteethe best results for this session. I wish you everysuccess in this crucial role. I would also like to extendmy thanks to your predecessor  His Excellency Mr.Theo-Ben Gurirab  Minister for Foreign Affairs of theRepublic of Namibia  for the productive way in whichhe managed the affairs of the fifty-fourth session. I alsowelcome Tuvalu as the new Member of ourOrganization.Globalization is definitely the most typicalphenomenon of the upcoming turn of the millennium.It is frequently criticized and at other times is accepteduncritically; however  it definitely bringsunprecedented progress and  at the same time problems and challenges. The economic boom also hasanother aspect in the form of large social differences.The environment often suffers from the industrialboom. Due to new communication technologies  directhuman contact is forgotten. I could continue in thisvein.The world community also has to face otherproblems  which are beginning to display atransregional nature — for instance  organized crime terrorism and emerging armed conflicts. Who is betterprepared to tackle all this than the United Nations —the most global institution we have.In my view  the Millennium Summit was the mostsignificant step on this very demanding road. It spelledprogress when compared with similar meetings in thepast  as this time it dealt with the urgent problems ofcivilization to a greater extent. Moreover  theMillennium Summit managed to draw the attention ofthe whole world to problems which the United Nationsconsiders to be of the greatest importance. However  tomake progress  a lot still remains to be done.Therefore  I will take the liberty of commencing mycontribution precisely with the topic of the reform ofthe United Nations.The report of the Secretary-General  “We thePeoples: the role of the United Nations in the twenty-first century” (A/54/2000) displays great promise inthis direction. The United Nations reform process mustcontinue. The key point is the reform of the SecurityCouncil. The positions and the opinions of MemberStates on the crucial issues of Security Councilreform — the increase in the number of permanent andnon-permanent members and the issue of the vetoright — unfortunately still vary greatly  making it verydifficult to achieve a substantive outcome in the nearfuture. The results of the work the Open-endedWorking Group on the Question of EquitableRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of2the Security Council and Other Matters related to theSecurity Council for the past seven years are notencouraging. Despite this  Slovakia will support therenewal of the Working Group's mandate for the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly. We considernext year's session of the Working Group to be crucialfor the further advancement of the reform processwithin this forum.Slovakia has already presented its positionregarding to the key issues of Security Council reform.We support strengthening its representative character effectiveness and transparency of the decision-makingprocess and working methods.With regard to the enlargement of the Council  weconsider the increase in the number of members in bothcategories to be justified. However  in our view  thenumber of members in both categories does not have tonecessarily increase simultaneously. The failure toreach an agreement on one category should not preventthe eventual conclusion of an agreement on theenlargement of the other. The total number of membersshould not exceed 25  in order not to jeopardize theCouncil's effectiveness and flexibility in immediatelyreacting to crisis situations. The Group of EasternEuropean States  whose membership has more thandoubled over the past years  should not be omittedfrom the enlargement of the Security Council.Since its founding  the United Nations  as theworld's universal organization  has under the Charterassumed primary responsibility for maintaininginternational peace and security. This conceptcontinues to be fundamental to the United Nations andis reinforced every time an international developmentnecessitates a call to our community for rapidpeacekeeping response.The evolution in the nature of United Nationspeacekeeping operations — from performingtraditional military functions to the greater need formultidisciplinary approaches  including interimadministration and post-conflict peace-building —along with the significant expansion of regional andinternational conflicts worldwide and the growingdemand for the involvement of the United Nations intheir prevention and settlement  puts the UnitedNations potential in this vital area to a challenging test.The need for peacekeeping has never been greater.However  such international assistance can be effectiveonly if it is based on peacekeeping operations wellsuited to dealing with all the problems and the needs ofthe situation to which it is deployed.Therefore  we welcome the report of the expertPanel on United Nations Peace Operations  which weconsider to be an important step toward a meaningfulreform of United Nations peacekeeping activities. TheBrahimi report (A/55/305) presents a serious challengeto various actors involved in meeting the requirementsof today's peacekeeping operations.One should agree  and recent experience hasconfirmed  that good intentions in deployingpeacekeeping operations must be supported by clearlydefined and achievable mandates. Only an adequatemandate and appropriate resources  both human andfinancial  can bring success to and strengthen thecredibility of the United Nations in its peacekeepingefforts  and not cause more problems. It requires anappropriate and responsible approach by key players including the Security Council  Member States and theUnited Nations Secretariat  in acting promptly on theirown  as well as effective cooperation to give a rapidand decisive response to conflict situations.Apart from the reform of the Security Council qualitative improvements must be achieved inmodernizing and streamlining the responsibledepartmental units in the Secretariat to enhance theirefficiency and the effectiveness of their output as muchas possible. At the same time  Member States mustsupport the ability of the Secretariat to carry out thetasks we ask it to do  since its ability to act depends onthe will of Member States to contribute troops andother assistance to potential peacekeeping operations.Member States should provide adequatelyprepared troops who are able to fulfil the tasksassigned. Simultaneously  peacekeeping operationsshould  from the very beginning  be provided withadequate financial resources to support the wide arrayof mandates. It is therefore equally important to ensurethat the financial system providing the funding forUnited Nations peacekeeping is stable  equitable andtransparent and that there is a flexible mechanism inplace with the ability to stabilize finances for currentand future peacekeeping operations. The revision of theUnited Nations peacekeeping scale of assessment overthe next few months will provide a genuine opportunityfor the General Assembly to take a critical look at thecurrent method of assessment and  with the emerging3consensus of Member States  to take important steps tofind a viable solution to this pressing issue.I am pleased to announce today our strongsupport for revising the financial structure ofpeacekeeping and our readiness to meet our financialcommitment under a reformed peacekeeping scale.We would like to express our appreciation to theSecretary-General for his significant role in the processof United Nations reforms. We welcome hiscommitment to implement the changes recommendedin the Brahimi report for which he is responsible. Weshould do our part and continue our personnel  materialand financial support to United Nations peacekeepingmissions. Slovakia has traditionally been participatingin peacekeeping operations and  as part of its latestactivities  is ready to send an engineering unit to theUnited Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritreaauthorized by the Security Council last Friday.Due to the geopolitical position of Slovakia  weclosely follow the situation in the Balkans. We areaware that problems can only be effectively addressed and crises and tension in the region eliminated  whenall the countries concerned are maximally involved;when they are willing to collaborate to search forcompromises  and are prepared to overlook historicalfeuds with a view to developing relations in acomplicated region  from both an ethnic andnationalistic perspective. We hope that the elections inthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will be held in apeaceful atmosphere  and that neither of the parties willresort to violence. It is necessary that the electionsabide by the rule of law  and that they be democratic free and fair. Otherwise  it will be difficult to achievethe basic objective: the stabilization of the situation inthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and in the region asa whole.In the area of disarmament  we welcome theconsensus achieved at the sixth Review Conference ofthe Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons  which confirmed commitments tothe provisions of the Treaty and its strengthened reviewprocess. This positive impulse needs to be efficientlyutilized in the process of further implementation of theTreaty.We also welcome the ongoing preparatoryprocess for the United Nations Conference on the IllicitTrade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All ItsAspects in 2001. The outcome of the Conferenceshould provide us with clear strategies on how to copewith the issue in its complexity.Slovakia fully supports respect for the norms ofinternational law and the execution of internationaltreaties in good faith  in compliance with the principleof pacta sunt servanda. The harmonization oftraditional theories based on the principle of Statesovereignty as the basic element of international lawwith newly developing principles based on globalrespect and guarantees of fundamental human rightsand freedoms will be necessary for the futuredevelopment of international law. New ideas andconcepts should be the subject of extensive discussionand negotiations between States  resulting in aconsensus in the international community  as was thecase 55 years ago  when the United Nations Charterwas adopted.Slovakia supports the early establishment of theInternational Criminal Court. The results of thenegotiations of the Preparatory Commission for theInternational Criminal Court  especially the adoption ofthe draft Rules of Procedures and Evidence and theElements of Crimes by consensus last June  are veryencouraging.Slovakia equally supports the work of the UnitedNations in the field of combating internationalterrorism. The adoption of the international Conventionfor the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism is thelatest fruit of the work in this field. Slovakia will signthe Convention by the end of the year 2000.In facing all the challenges of our era the UnitedNations must prove its relevance. Slovakia isconvinced of the irreplaceable role of the UnitedNations in a whole range of global issues  the solutionof which is practically impossible by Member Statesalone  on an individual or group basis  or at a regionallevel. If we want the term globalization to have onlypositive connotations  the endeavour to tackle theaccumulated problems must become a matter of thehighest interest to all of us. I believe that thisAssembly will contribute to this endeavour."

I would also like tothank His Excellency Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab ofNamibia for his work as President of the General16Assembly at its fifty-fourth session  and to commendhim for the guidance he provided throughout the year.I would also like to commend the Secretary-General  Kofi Annan  for his inspiring contribution tothe noble goals of peace  justice  development and thestrengthening of our Organization.Last week  world leaders gathered here to directthe Organization for the next century. The goldenthread of the Millennium Summit was concern for thewell-being of all human beings and the commondetermination to free each and every nation and eachand every human being from want and fear  to sustainthe future of humanity and to renew the United Nationsaccordingly. The common goal of all the discussionswas to provide for human security in all its complexityand to uphold the principles of human dignity  equality equity  solidarity and tolerance at a global level.The United Nations has the obligation to protectthe civilian population  particularly the mostvulnerable  children  women  the elderly and thedisabled  against gross and systematic violations ofhuman rights and humanitarian law  whether in inter-State or intra-State conflicts. The strengthening ofinternational law is an important element in achievingthis goal. Special attention should be given toexploring new methods of conflict prevention  as wellas to making better use of those that have proved tohave had good results. We should all be engaged moredecisively in building a culture of prevention andmodernizing and equipping the United Nations for thetask.It is also imperative for the United Nations toelaborate a doctrine for humanitarian interventionbased on a modern interpretation of the Charter and inline with new international relations and norms. Welistened with interest to the statements made by thePrime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs ofCanada in this Hall on the establishment of anindependent international commission on interventionand State sovereignty.There is nothing in the Charter that couldpossibly justify crimes against the civilian population.Neither is there anything in the Charter that couldpossibly justify the fact that large parts of the world arestill living in poverty or that some States are stagnatingdue to the debt burden  while the rest of the world isenjoying a state of well-being. Technological andeconomic development does bring the world together but globalization also brings problems closer andincreases the mutual responsibility for findingsolutions to them.At the Millennium Summit  we adopted acomprehensive and far-reaching Declaration. Leadersput before us difficult but achievable goals. MemberStates should now look carefully into how they cancontribute nationally to the implementation of the goalsat the global level. As a responsible Member of theOrganization  Slovenia intends to prepare its plan ofaction for the implementation of the goals set out in theMillennium Declaration. I want to take this opportunitytoday to mention some of the efforts that we intend tomake.As a country that has just joined the donorcommunity  Slovenia will look closely at how it canorganize better in order to extend more assistance tothe developing countries and the countries in theregion  thus contributing to the goals regardingdevelopment and poverty eradication.We have just signed the Optional Protocols to theConvention on the Rights of the Child  while theNational Assembly is supposed to ratify the Statute ofthe International Criminal Court by the end of the year.Both documents are among the most important buildingblocks for ensuring greater protection for civilians inconflict situations. We are looking forward to the earlyfunctioning of the International Criminal Court in orderto ensure the more effective  equitable and efficientdelivery of international justice.Slovenia is determined to help in the process ofstrengthening the Organization as an indispensablefoundation for a peaceful  prosperous and just world.Once again  we want to stress the need for theenlargement of the Security Council in its permanentand elected membership  as well as with regard to thereform of its working methods. The credibility of theUnited Nations depends on its ability to carry out itsresponsibilities in full  especially with regard tomaintaining peace and security. We therefore welcomeand commend the report of the Panel on UnitedNations Peace Operations and we are looking forwardto the early implementation of its recommendations.In this context  we believe that the reform of thefinancing of United Nations peacekeeping operations isa necessary condition for a renewed role for the UnitedNations in this field. A new scale of assessments thatmore accurately reflects the capacity to pay should be17adopted during this session. I have the honour toannounce that the Government of Slovenia has decidedto voluntarily relinquish the discount it is no longerentitled to with regard to its financial contribution  andthat  starting from next year  it is ready to pay its sharefor peacekeeping operations in full.Slovenia is also gradually increasing itsparticipation in peacekeeping operations  those ofthe United Nations  as well as regional ones. We arecommitted to further increasing our support to theseoperations  not only with military personnel  but alsowith civilian police and humanitarian personnel.The basic aim of United Nations actions shouldbe to ensure human security  with security beingphysical  economic and social  rather than legal. Wenote with satisfaction that the interests of individualsare  indeed  rightly at the very centre of the MillenniumDeclaration. Slovenia will continue to participate in thegroup of like-minded countries  which is determined togive full meaning and specific  practical expression tothe concept of human security.The problem of the illicit arms flow of small armsand light weapons is such that it requires additionalefforts. We hope that the forthcoming internationalconference on small arms and light weapons will pavethe way for regulating and controlling the proliferationof unimpeded access to small arms and lightweapons  the weapons most used in today's armedconflicts.Member States should also continue to improvethe efficiency and effectiveness of mine actionprogrammes  as well as to strengthen all steps andactivities in mine action and mine victim assistance.For its part  Slovenia will continue to support theefforts of its International Trust Fund for Demining andMine Victim Assistance to extend its activities to thewhole region of South-East Europe. The resultsachieved in recent years are promising for the activitiesof the Trust Fund in the future.I would also like to briefly address the situationin the region of South-East Europe. We are all awarethat there will be no self-sustaining peace and stabilityin the region without the full cooperation andintegration of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Forobvious reasons  this cannot be expected of the currentregime in Belgrade. The international community mustcooperate with  support and encourage the forceswithin the country that are striving for democracy peace  reconciliation  economic recovery and a returnto simple normalcy. We share the hopes of seeing thenew democratic Federal Republic of Yugoslavia soonas a part of a stable and prosperous South-East Europe.We also share the hopes that this country will soon joinus in the United Nations  as well as in the otherinternational and regional organizations  in accordancewith the usual procedures and practices for admissionof new members to these organizations."
"156",6546,"SWE",55,2000,"The individual humanbeing must always be at the centre of our work.Burmese students fighting for democracy  victims ofethnic violence in Kosovo  women in Afghanistandenied their right to education and equality  childrendying of curable diseases  people simply trying tosurvive in the utmost poverty  have given us ourtask. Meeting the needs of the peoples and realizingtheir aspirations remain the starting point  the purposeand the vision of our Organization.But the United Nations will only be what we  itsMembers  allow it to be. This year's General Assemblysession provides an occasion to revitalize our muchneeded  but often criticized  global Organization. TheSecretary-General's excellent report on the role of theUnited Nations in the twenty-first century provides afirm basis for the creation of a truly modern UnitedNations  a United Nations with maintainedlegitimacy and increased credibility  greater efficiencyand continued global relevance.Globalization opens the market for those whohave the resources and instruments to benefit from it.Globalization makes knowledge and informationavailable to those who have the tools and skills to makeuse of the new technology. Globalization bringsopportunities to improve life for all people  but it hasalso led to an increasing gap between those who cantake advantage and those left behind.Safeguarding the universal and indivisible rightsand values of humanity is a key responsibility for theUnited Nations in the age of globalized economy technology and communications.The world community has to do its utmost tointegrate the least developed countries into the globaleconomy. Solidarity and responsibility from allcountries are necessary for reaching internationaldevelopment targets and for contributing to animproved standard of living for all people. Solidarityand responsibility are essential in fighting two of thegreatest threats to development and human security inour time: poverty and HIV/AIDS. We need to workwith a wide range of measures to overcome thesethreats.Sustained and increased official developmentassistance remains of vital importance. Today only fourcountries  Sweden among them  meet the UnitedNations target of 0.7 per cent of gross national incomein development aid.But we must also look at financing fordevelopment in a broader perspective. Domesticresources  trade  international finance and officialdevelopment assistance must all be taken into account.Sweden wants an integrated approach to development.We welcome the fact that the United Nations  theWorld Bank  the International Monetary Fund  theWorld Trade Organization (WTO) and others areworking together in preparing next year's high-levelevents on these issues.The start of new negotiations under the WTO canbe an important contribution to growth anddevelopment. Let us together make sure that suchnegotiations truly turn into a development round. Themajor trading nations have already committedthemselves to giving free market access to productsfrom the least developed countries. It is time to putthese commitments into effect.There is no contradiction between developmentand respect for human rights. On the contrary development benefits from respect for the human rightsand participation of all citizens  and discrimination andoppression are threats to development. For women inmany parts of the world  discrimination means being25excluded from participation in the economic andpolitical fields; their potential contribution is lost. Twothirds of all illiterates are women. For millions ofwomen  domestic violence is a daily reality. This is notin accordance with the basic values of our internationalcommunity and it is a major obstacle to sustainabledevelopment. The legal basis for ending discriminationexists with the Convention on the Elimination of AllForms of Discrimination against Women and the newagreement of the special session in June.For the children  next year's special session of theGeneral Assembly provides an excellent opportunity toset a global and concrete agenda. The Convention onthe Rights of the Child is the basis for this agenda toreduce forcefully maternal mortality  to give morechildren access to primary school and to promote theparticipation of young people in shaping our societies.Girls must be given the same rights and opportunitiesas boys. I thus welcome the Secretary-General's newsystem-wide girls' education initiative.A growing problem in many countries andregions is the traffic in human beings  especiallyexposing women and children to sexual exploitationand to forced labour. These criminal acts call for ourimmediate attention and a forceful reaction from theinternational community. We need and actively seekcloser cooperation between Europe  Asia and others inorder to develop strong and efficient measures to fightthis appalling violation of human rights.Respect for human dignity requires an end to theuse of the death penalty. This brutal and irrevocableform of punishment has no place in a modern  civilizedsociety. It is time for the international community tofully recognize the most fundamental human right andabolish the death penalty.Disrespect for democracy and human rights pavesthe way for crisis and conflict. National sovereignty isfirmly coupled with a Government's responsibility toprotect and promote human rights. It is the duty of theinternational community and our duty as politicalleaders to act and react when human rights andfundamental freedoms are violated. We cannot idlystand by when people are being brutalized behindnational borders.In many armed conflicts  deliberate terrordirected against civilians is used to create fear. Womensuffer from violence and rape. Children are denied theirdignity and childhood when forced to become soldiers.Men are imprisoned in concentration camps  forced totake sides or killed. Lives and families are ruined andthe perpetrators often go unpunished. Sierra Leone isone example  Kosovo another.Strengthening international law and humanitarianlaw does increase the protection of the individual. Italso creates confidence amongst people  since itdemonstrates that a culture of impunity will not betolerated. A good example was the decision by theSecurity Council to set up a special court to try thoseresponsible for war crimes during the conflict in SierraLeone.The establishment of an International CriminalCourt will give us a safer and more just world.Suspected perpetrators of crimes against humanity canand will be tried in accordance with international lawwhenever national courts are unable or unwilling to doso. There is a strong need for joint and early action tomake the International Criminal Court operational.The past year saw a new honesty in drawingconclusions from previous mistakes and I want tocongratulate the Secretary-General for having initiatedthe studies of our failures in Bosnia and Rwanda. Thelessons learned from the chilling reports on themassacre in Srebrenica and on the genocide in Rwanda as well as from the senseless terror in East Timor  mustbe put to constructive use for the future.National sovereignty must not be used as anexcuse to prevent the United Nations from takingnecessary measures when fundamental humanitarianvalues are at stake. It is our common responsibility tomake sure that commitments are made and that theresources for peace operations are available whenneeded. My Government warmly welcomes therecommendations in the Brahimi report  for exampleconcerning core funding for United NationsHeadquarters support for peacekeeping operations. Byimplementing the many recommendations in the report the United Nations capacity to act will be significantlystrengthened.If the Security Council cannot act in an urgentsituation  due to a veto or the threat of a veto  itscredibility and its legitimacy suffer. Necessary actionought not to be hindered or blocked by a veto. Now isthe time for the permanent members to agree on amoratorium on the use of the veto.26The credibility of the Security Council is of vitalinterest not only to its members  but to the UnitedNations membership at large. All efforts should bemade to use the Security Council as a forum fornegotiations and decisions in order to avoid not onlythe unnecessary threat of or use of the veto  but alsounilateral action whereby the Council is circumvented.A modern United Nations requires a Security Councilthat reflects the realities of today's internationalrelations. The Council should therefore be enlarged tomake room for an increased representation ofcountries  not least from the developing world. Weshould also be prepared to periodically review thecomposition of the Security Council. At stake is theglobal relevance of the Security Council in a worldvastly different from that of 1945.The recent developments on the Korean peninsulashow that long-lasting tension can also be challengedthrough enlightened statesmanship. But the absence ofarmed conflict does not equal lasting peace. It isessential to address the root causes of violent conflictby building democracy and safeguarding human rights by promoting economic and social development and byremoving trade barriers and debt burdens.There is no alternative to the United Nations inpreventing and  if needed  managing conflicts. TheUnited Nations provides legitimacy for global action but the United Nations alone cannot meet the needs anddemands in this area. Cooperation between the UnitedNations and regional entities could be furtherdeveloped. Sweden believes that the civilian andmilitary capacity for crisis management and conflictprevention now being developed by the EuropeanUnion (EU) could be put to use in the future by theUnited Nations. We will continue to work for closecooperation between the EU and the United Nations onthese matters during the Swedish presidency of the EUin the spring of 2001.During the past year  the Security Council hasplaced emphasis on early action and on the need tofocus on the prevention of violent conflicts. Swedenstrongly supports this shift towards identifying andtaking early measures. We are prepared to work withother countries to support the Secretary-General in thedevelopment of a comprehensive conflict preventionstrategy.Improved interaction between the SecurityCouncil and the Economic and Social Council  otherUnited Nations bodies and the Bretton Woodsinstitutions  including the use of joint fact-findingmissions  will facilitate early action. Sweden wouldlike to see the establishment of a standing fact-findingmechanism at the disposal of the Secretary-General  asa complement to Security Council missions. Such amechanism could be utilized at an early stage in anemerging crisis situation  without undue delays.Another part of a United Nations strategy shouldbe to explore and develop the link between democracyand prevention of violent conflict. Democracy offerspeaceful ways of handling conflicts and differentinterests. Democratization is a process in which theholding of elections should only be the first step in along-term international commitment. Establishingpeace and democracy takes a lot more than free andfair elections  even if that is the beginning. Thesanctions instrument needs to be refined to becometruly effective. By now  we have ample evidence thatsweeping economic sanctions frequently do more harmthan good. The guiding principle should be to exert thestrongest possible pressure on the decision-makers while no effort should be spared to avoid negativeeffects on civilians. Every future sanctions regimeought to consist of sharp and enforceable measures directed against the factors that cause and fuel crisis orconflict. Sweden stands ready to contribute actively tothe debate on how this instrument of the UnitedNations Charter can be made more efficient.To promote disarmament and prevent theproliferation of weapons of mass-destruction remains amajor challenge for the United Nations and its MemberStates. The result of this year's Review Conference ofthe Parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty(NPT) gives certain hope in this regard. For the firsttime in many years  a consensus document on theagenda for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmamentwas adopted. For the first time ever  the nuclear-weapon States unconditionally pledged to totallyeliminate their nuclear arsenals. For the first time  anumber of practical steps were identified for how towork towards this goal.A world free from nuclear weapons will not beachieved overnight. Nor are these steps to be taken in adistant future or held hostage to States' perception ofthe appropriate strategic balance. The momentumachieved at the NPT Conference has to be sustained.The countries of the New Agenda Coalition will workfor the implementation of the NPT results. All States27ought to immediately cease production of nuclearweapons and fissile material for weapons purposes.The Conference on Disarmament should now start itswork on a ban on such material. The worldcommunity's efforts to prevent the further productionof nuclear weapons must not be blocked by China India  Pakistan or any other State. It is high time tobring the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty into force.We expect all States to live up to their commitments.The United States' plans for a national missiledefence system causes concern. In today's globalizedworld  we must always take account of the globaleffects of our decisions. It is hard to see how a possiblethreat  from a few States  would best be countered by amissile shield that may or may not work  and whichrisks setting off a renewed arms race  with immensecosts in terms of wasted resources and loss of humansecurity. The recent announcement by the United Statesadministration to postpone the decision on the nationalmissile defence system was therefore welcome. A moresecure world ought to be built on cooperation ratherthan on isolation and confrontation. The Anti-BallisticMissile Treaty is crucial to global security and must notbe jeopardized.A major cause of concern is also the uncontrolledand destabilizing spread of small arms and lightweapons. The international conference on illicit trafficin small arms and light weapons next year will be animportant opportunity to address the issue in acomprehensive way. It should result in a concreteaction-plan in the global  regional and national context.The United Nations today is stronger and leanerthan three years ago when the Secretary-Generallaunched his reform programme. But there is still workto be done  for example regarding the interplaybetween the main bodies of the United Nations. Weshould give the Secretary-General the full authority toact in his leadership role. We support the Secretary-General's proposal for a shorter  more focused agendafor the General Assembly and restructuring of its work.Another main issue for the Millennium Assembly is toreach an agreement on the scales of assessment for theregular United Nations budget and for peacekeepingoperations. While it is imperative that all members paytheir dues on time  in full and without conditions Sweden believes that a review of United Nationscontributions should be done. The aim however mustalways be a fairer distribution of the financial burdenamong Member States  adapted to today's realities  andwith capacity to pay as the guiding principle.The United Nations must not be used as ascapegoat when the real problem is lack of politicalwill or hesitance from us Member States to providenecessary resources. Accordingly  any call for actionmust be followed by a pledge to provide the personnelor financial means.The United Nations  with its global character andlegitimacy  can make a difference for mankind as wellas for the individual. Behind the much used termglobalization there are billions of people. They want usto provide hope. They expect us to act responsibly.They need to see concrete results. We are here representing them  on a mission to make the UnitedNations a true guardian of human dignity."
"157",6584,"SWZ",55,2000,"Mr. President  onbehalf of the delegation of His Majesty King MswatiIII  Her Majesty the Indlovukazi and the Governmentand the people of the Kingdom of Swaziland  may Iextend hearty congratulations to Mr. Harri Holkeri ofthe Republic of Finland on his election as President ofthis fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly. I alsowish to pay my country's rich tribute to Mr. Holkeri'spredecessor  Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  Minister forForeign Affairs of the Republic of Namibia  for hisexemplary stewardship of the last session of theGeneral Assembly.The Kingdom of Swaziland continues to developquietly and peacefully  according to the wishes of ourpeople. Against a backdrop of difficult economiccircumstances  we have declared the year 2000 ourYear of Delivery in a number of key economic  socialand political areas. In the coming weeks  theCommission that is reviewing the national Constitutionwill complete its work  and we look forward toreceiving its report. Those recommendations will bethe result of an extensive and all-inclusive process ofconsultations and will reflect precisely the wishes ofthe entire Swazi nation. We believe this nationalexercise will further enhance the unity of the Swazipeople and provide the best possible foundation for ourcontinuing peace and stability.On the economic front  we continue to makeevery effort to achieve sustainable growth and toreduce the level of poverty among our people. Inaddition to encouraging both local and foreigninvestment  the Government this year launched anambitious programme of initiatives called theMillennium Project  targeting the tourism andmanufacturing industry subsectors. This project isdesigned to maximize the potential of the Kingdom inthese areas and to reduce the current unacceptably highlevel of unemployment  which is threatening toundermine all our best efforts at development.Among the many challenges we face as adeveloping nation  there is no question that theHIV/AIDS crisis presents the most serious threat to ourhopes of improving the lives of our people. In the lastyears of the twentieth century  much of the progress wehave achieved in 32 years of independence in socialwelfare is being reversed by the rapid spread of thismost terrible disease. HIV/AIDS represents the singlemost important issue facing our nation today  and wedesperately need the support of the internationalcommunity in our efforts to contain the threat to ourvery existence as a nation. We look to the UnitedNations to take a much stronger leadership role in thisglobal crisis  and to help us to mobilize resources toreverse the catastrophic spread of the pandemic.During the Millennium Summit  the Kingdom ofSwaziland joined other developing countries inexpressing concern at the negative effects ofglobalization on our economies  especially in thecontext of the widening gap between the rich and thepoor countries. We are  however  reassured bySummit's agreement to take measures to ensure thatglobal trends such as globalization should have at theirheart the principle of equitable benefit for all nations regardless of size  level of development or economicstrength.Thus  in recent years  we have waited with greatexpectation to benefit from initiatives  particularly inthe area of preferential trade access  that have beenbroadcast by our international friends and partners asmeasures that are designed to help the developingworld to overcome the negative effects ofglobalization.My delegation is optimistic  therefore  that therecently concluded Millennium Summit will indeedserve as an historic occasion of strengtheninginternational peace and security  as well as theprosperity of our people  in order to establish a fairinternational order. Beginning with this session  whatremains for all of us now is to see to it that the wishesof the founding fathers of the United Nations arefulfilled. Those wishes  ambitious as they may be  arenot unreachable and can be achieved. This session therefore  has the task of setting the pace for thedialogue that lies ahead. Both the Millennium Summitand this session of the General Assembly will have a34direct impact on the success of the United Nations inachieving the goals set by those great visionary leaders.Since the last session of the General Assembly the Organization has held several global conferences.However  the implementation of commitments in somecases is regrettably slow. One of the priorities for theUnited Nations should be an effective  integrated andcoordinated implementation and follow-up of all theseconferences. The implementation should be furtherenhanced within the existing machinery of the UnitedNations through improving its functions.Peace-building is a prevention task of growingimportance. With the disaster that befell the UnitedNations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL)  theUnited Nations is facing one of the mostcomprehensive tasks in its history  which perhaps hasmade the need to review peacekeeping operations moreimperative. We remain concerned about the seriousnegative impact of the proliferation of conflicts in theworld  particularly in Africa  on development capacityand on progress towards economic  social and politicaltransformation. The situation in those countriesaffected by conflicts is appalling and deserves theOrganization's urgent attention.In Africa  the Democratic Republic of the Congo Rwanda  Burundi  Sierra Leone and Angola  amongothers  have been the scene of terrible turmoil  massmurders  destruction of property and much suffering onthe part of refugees over the years. The Organization ofAfrican Unity (OAU)  the Economic Community ofWest African States (ECOWAS) and the SouthernAfrican Development Community (SADC) have donemuch to contain and resolve some of these conflicts;and the United Nations has also rendered its support.While some progress has been made in resolving someof these conflicts  much still needs to be done especially by the parties involved. The latter have aresponsibility to observe agreements concluded andmust work closely together with the United Nationsand the regional organizations involved so that peaceprocesses can be brought to a successful conclusion.With regard to the Middle East  we areencouraged by the continued efforts by PresidentClinton and other leaders to bring both Israel andPalestine to the negotiating table. We are hopeful that along-lasting solution  which has eluded the region forso long  will be found soon.There is now more than ever a pressing need tofinally carry out the long overdue substantial reform ofthe Security Council. The Council must fully recognizethe new realities of the global landscape. It must have amore representative composition  and above all  it mustbe equipped to react to the crises and conflicts of today.Reform must involve enlargement to include both morepermanent and non-permanent members  as well asstrengthening its decision-making powers.The Kingdom of Swaziland unreservedly supportsboth the Non-Aligned Movement and the AfricanGroup positions in as far as the review of thecomposition and working methods of the SecurityCouncil is concerned. We do trust that the ongoingdebate in the working group set up for this purpose willcontinue and that it will yield the much-expectedresults. The stage which the negotiations have nowreached is such that it requires the commitment of allMember States if indeed the Security Council is to beequipped with all the tools it needs to be equitablyrepresentative. Participation of the United Nationsmembership at large in the decision-making process transparency in its work and imposition of Charterrestraints on the veto  with the aim of its eventualabolition  are indispensable imperatives.The enhancement of the relevance of the UnitedNations requires  first and foremost  strengthening therole and increasing the efficiency of the GeneralAssembly through focusing its deliberations oncontemporary challenges and problems facing theworld  engaging it in timely and effective decision-making to address global economic and political issuesand enabling it to seriously examine and effectivelyreact to the work of the other organs of the UnitedNations  particularly the Security Council. In thiscontext  we believe that the General Assembly  as thesole democratic universal and transparent organ  is theproper forum to carry out an in-depth analysis of theimplications of the emerging debates on collectiveaction.The Kingdom of Swaziland joins others inwelcoming the Republic of Tuvalu as a new member ofthe Organization. The addition of Tuvalu brings closerto fruition the hope of the founding fathers to see aUnited Nations comprised of all the countries of theworld. The United Nations is the only body that dealswith all fields of human activity. It has been a catalystof many initiatives that have improved the lives ofpeoples across the world.35In the same spirit of universality in which wewelcome Tuvalu  the Kingdom of Swaziland wishes toreiterate its appeal to the United Nations regarding thequestion of the Republic of China on Taiwan. TheKingdom of Swaziland has in the past been in theforefront arguing in favour of the readmission of theRepublic of China on Taiwan  and our position remainsunchanged. The case for including the Republic ofChina on Taiwan in the activities of the United Nationsand its associated agencies takes on even greaterrelevance in the light of the peaceful transition ofGovernment following the successful expression of thewishes of the people of Taiwan in the elections earlierthis year.Those 23 million people rightly consider itunacceptable that they are not represented in the oneOrganization that should be truly global  and that theydeserve a review of the special circumstancessurrounding their bid. The Republic of China onTaiwan has shown time and again its willingness toparticipate in efforts to bring about true global peace development and stability  and we believe that the restof the world is poorer for being denied theirinvolvement. The Kingdom of Swaziland believes thatthis new millennium provides the perfect opportunityto raise this issue and to restore the right of the peopleof the Republic of China on Taiwan to participate fullyin the activities of our Organization.There is no alternative to the United Nations. Itsobjectives and values are universal. We must spare noeffort in seeing to it that the United Nations continuesto meet the current and evolving needs of its entiremembership. It must become the core instrument ofeffective and fair global governance  if it is to becompletely transformed to be what its founding fathershad envisaged."
"158",6659,"SYR",55,2000,"Itgives me great pleasure to congratulate you  Sir  onyour election to the presidency of this GeneralAssembly session. We are confident that the posts youhave assumed in your country and the internationalrespect that you enjoy will facilitate the task entrustedto you in leading the deliberations of this session of theGeneral Assembly to their desired objectives.I would also like to express our appreciation tothe Minister for Foreign Affairs of Namibia for hisefforts in leading the work of the previous session to asuccessful conclusion. I would be remiss if I failed tothank the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for hisefforts to maintain the principles and purposes of theCharter and for the distinguished role he has played incrystallizing the idea of convening the MillenniumSummit last week. It was indeed an unusual event inUnited Nations history.The historic Millennium Summit Declarationconfirmed unequivocally and clearly the commitmentof all the Heads of State and Government of the worldto the principles and purposes of the Charter of theUnited Nations. We believe that the absence of anysubstantial difference between the Charter and theDeclaration is an important achievement in itself. Thehistoric Declaration issued by the Millennium Summitmay be considered  in one way or another  as arenewed vote of confidence in the Charter  particularly as the world has recently witnessed major changes anddangerous challenges. One may therefore conclude thatthe principles and purposes adopted by peoples andnations do not undergo major changes with the passageof time.It would be wrong to underestimate thesignificance of this conclusion for the history of theUnited Nations. The end of the cold war did notprevent the peoples and nations of the world fromdenouncing and condemning crimes of aggression ethnic-cleansing  foreign occupation  oppression extremism  injustice  corruption  racism and doublestandards. Nor did this make us hesitate to glorifymany noble objectives  such as freedom  peace equality  solidarity  tolerance  human rights and socialjustice.It is fortunate that third world countries and poorcountries host large populations with bountifulresources and great heritage. This constitutes a safetynet for those countries that were able to contribute tomaintaining the principles and purposes of the UnitedNations when drafting the Millennium Declaration.This explains the lack of any reference to the newworld order  either in the Millennium SummitDeclaration or in any other official text. Regrettably however  this becomes evident in reality  wherebyhegemony seems to have the upper hand in theinternational arena.Strengthening the role of the United Nations wasthe main topic on the Summit's agenda. This rolewould also become clear in reforming the Security18Council and expanding its membership. The UnitedNations membership considers the Council theOrganization's primary organ. This reform processshould be accomplished by expanding the SecurityCouncil membership  the granting of equitable and fairgeographical representation and the gradual phasingout of the use of the right of veto  which contradicts theconcept of democracy  particularly when its aim isnothing short of undermining the democratic process.United Nations peacekeeping operations havecontributed to creating conditions conducive to endingthe deterioration of security conditions in manycountries of the world. Throughout the past years  theSyrian Arab Republic has done everything it could topreserve the security and safety of United Nationspeacekeeping personnel and to ensure that theysuccessfully carry out their missions and mandates. Butpeacekeeping operations must be confined to enforcingUnited Nations resolutions and those of internationallegitimacy. The Security Council has therefore toenforce its resolutions so that peacekeeping operationswill not simply become operations to impose the statusquo  which makes the achievement of true peace a veryelusive objective.The peace process launched in Madrid has beenlosing its momentum  incentive and compass  day afterday and year after year. The Security Council  whichhas the authority and international legitimacy toenforce its own resolutions  has been kept out of theMiddle East peace process. It has become a silentwitness to the fact that the peace process in the MiddleEast has reached a dead end.It has become quite obvious to all those involvedin the peace process  both inside and outside ourregion  that continued Israeli occupation of Arabterritories  which is sometimes explained by Israel'spsychological need for security and at other times bysuperstitious myths  is the major obstacle on the roadto peace. Those futile claims  which have nofoundation in reality whatsoever  have caused the peaceprocess to become an endless negotiating process withneither end nor resolution in sight.At any rate  the serious and carefully considerednegotiations that Syria has conducted have proven tothe international community at large  and to Arabs inparticular  two main things: first  that Israel is neitherdesirous of  nor serious about  pursuing a just andcomprehensive peace in accordance with UnitedNations resolutions; and  secondly  that Syria has theright to a full return of the entire Golan  to the 4 June1967 line  without concessions or compromises.We would like to mention another fact known toour foes and friends alike. That fact is that Syria hasunreservedly supported every Arab and Palestinianright during every stage of the peace talks. It did nottake those positions to embarrass anyone or tonegotiate on their behalf. As a matter of principle Syria has been  and continues to be  committed to theinalienable rights of the Palestinian people to return totheir lands  to self-determination  and to establish theirindependent State on their national soil. On that basis Syria presented its position clearly and firmly at themeeting of the Jerusalem Committee that was convenedin Morocco at the end of last month in support of therights of Muslims and Arabs to full anduncompromised Palestinian sovereignty over Al-QudsAl-Sharif.The Arabs are an ancient and time-honourednation known for its religious tolerance. But toleranceis one thing and conceding one's rights is somethingelse. Territory and sovereignty are matters of nationaldignity that can never be forfeited or compromised.At the Millennium Summit  the countries of theworld expressed their belief that we live today in anage of international law and under the United NationsCharter  international legitimacy and human rights  andnot in an age of the law of the jungle and futilereligious claims to justify the usurpation of otherpeoples' land by force. This requires from theinternational community and the United Nations amore firm and non-selective stand in defending theCharter and international law and in prompting Israelto respect international legitimacy and internationalconventions and to implement the resolutions of theUnited Nations.The brotherly Lebanese people have achieved ahistoric milestone  thanks to their solidarity and that oftheir State  in strongly resisting Israeli occupation.Syria stood by Lebanon firmly in order to ensure thefull implementation of resolution 425 (1978). Syriawill always stand by Lebanon and support all itsnational issues  especially the ones concerning thereturn of all its territory and the return of its hostagesheld in Israeli jails. In this regard  we urge the donorcountries to fulfil their commitments to help Lebanonrebuild what Israel has destroyed  particularly the19damage it caused during its occupation of southernLebanon.From this international forum  Syria would likeonce again to stress the great importance it attaches tomaintaining the territorial integrity of Iraq. We call forrelieving the suffering of the Iraqi people by lifting theeconomic sanctions that only affect the people. We alsostand against any measures taken against Iraq outsidethe context of United Nations resolutions so that thoseresolutions will retain the necessary credibility to bringabout their implementation.We also deem it necessary to find a just andhumane solution to the question of Kuwaiti and otherprisoners of war  within a practical framework agreedupon between the Kuwaiti and Iraqi sides. We do notwant the issue of prisoners of war and missing personsto remain outside the human and political frameworkthat will allow us to arrive at a solution.Syria also calls upon the Security Council toquickly and permanently lift the sanctions it imposedagainst Libya. Libya has delivered on all itscommitments under Security Council resolutions. Wefully support Libya's demands.In view of the strong  brotherly relations betweenSyria  the United Arab Emirates and the IslamicRepublic of Iran  we call upon the two neighbouringcountries to pursue negotiations to resolve peacefullythe dispute over the three islands on the basis of theprinciples of good neighbourliness and mutual respect.Syria believes that the establishment of a trilateralcommittee to pave the way for direct negotiationsbetween Iran and the United Arab Emirates through thecreation of favourable conditions is a practicalinitiative. We hope that it will allow the two parties toarrive at a satisfactory conclusion.We would like to welcome the achievements ofthe representatives of Somalia in forming a temporarySomali parliament and electing Mr. AbdiKassim SaladHassan as President of democratic Somalia. Weconsider these achievements as major pillars for therestoration of Somali State institutions. We call uponthe international community to redouble its efforts tohelp Somalis carry out the tasks of reconstruction andrehabilitation.The continued tragic situation in Afghanistan is asource of great concern to us. We are convinced thatthe problem of Afghanistan can only be solved bystopping the fighting and beginning negotiations aimedat achieving national reconciliation. It must also besolved by finding an acceptable and permanentpolitical settlement that brings about security andstability for the Afghan people. Many Arab and Islamiccountries fear that continued and senseless fighting inAfghanistan may lead to undermining the concept ofthe State in that country and to destroying its heritageand whatever is left of its historic traditions.Syria welcomes the discussions convened at thehighest level in Pyongyang in June 2000. We expressthe hope that this rapprochement between the twoKoreas will contribute to achieving the aspirations ofthe Korean people in reunifying the peninsula throughpeaceful means.There was a consensus in the statements deliveredat the Millennium Summit and in the SummitDeclaration about the need to exert all possible effortsto rid humanity of the humiliating and inhumaneconditions of extreme poverty  in which more than abillion people live. The Summit stressed thecommitment of Member States to basic human rights as well as to the right of every country to development.We think this will require developing a new economicinternational order that is just  fair and democratic. Itwill also require finding a multilateral commercial andfinancial system characterized by transparency equality and non-discrimination. We must also find thebest mechanism possible to solve developmentalproblems  especially on the African continent. Such asystem should also give preferential treatment todeveloping countries in order to facilitate investmentand the transfer of technology and know-how. Thatwould allow for full  effective and equal participationby the South in the process of decision-making at theinternational level. Although these requests seem far-fetched now  they will in the final analysis serve allparties and States  whether they be rich or poor  in theNorth or in the South.We had fervently hoped that a just andcomprehensive peace in the Middle East would havebeen achieved by the beginning of the twenty-firstcentury and with the ushering in of this newmillennium. Nonetheless  we remain optimistic. Peacewill remain our strategic choice and that of all peopleswho aspire to a bright future in which peace  securityand prosperity prevail for human beings everywhere."
"159",6704,"TCD",55,2000,"It was byunanimous vote that our Assembly elected ourPresident to be in charge of our work. Whereas we arealready aware of his professional skills and his humanqualities  may I take the liberty of congratulating himand assuring him of the support and the cooperation ofthe delegation of Chad to assist him in performing thisdifficult but very inspiring task.His predecessor  the Minister for Foreign Affairsof fraternal Namibia  very tactfully and effectivelyguided the work which was entrusted to him during thefifty-fourth session. He is now deserving of ourcongratulations.Our words of congratulations and ourencouragement are likewise addressed to our brother Mr. Kofi Annan  whose devotion to the cause of peaceand development in the world undoubtedly represents aguarantee for the success of our Organization.Last year during a visit to the headquarters of theUnited Nations Development Programme in New York the President of the Republic of Chad  His ExcellencyMr. Idriss Deby  declared:“A new world is being built before our veryeyes. New standards are being set which aregiving lasting shape to the behaviours ofindividuals and relations among States. Newtechnologies are pressing us forward to evengreater progress in those societies which possessthem. Those which are closed to change are beingmarginalized  since they are incapable of makingtheir ambitions come to life in the context of thenew world. This frightening prospect  since it issynonymous with being left behind  is very realfor many developing countries. But  I reject thisprospect for my country.”The President of the Republic is here referringspecifically to a world which is in constant changebecause of rampant globalization  which has become afact of life that is sometimes highly praised for itsbenefits and sometimes shunned because of the harm itdoes. Meanwhile in Chad  men and women are doingeverything they can to derive benefit fromglobalization and to avoid the downside in order not tomiss the train of political  economic  social andtechnological progress.In other words  faced with the threat thatglobalization represents to stability  security anddevelopment of the weaker  Chad is waging an out andout struggle to occupy its proper place in the concert ofnations.Yes  the men and women of Chad are strugglingcourageously and with resolve to emerge fromobscurantism  from poverty and from domination. Theresults of their daily struggle speak for themselveswhen you look at what has been achieved in the various36areas of national life. Politically  the democraticexperiment which began on 1 December 1990 is beingfurther developed and consolidated. Thus  politicalpluralism is functioning while respecting diversity onthe basis of consensual and participatory democracy.The various fundamental freedoms whichunderlie and which breathe life into any democraticpolitical system are being fully exercised. The freedomof expression of the private press  which gives noquarter in its criticism of the action of the Government as well as the burgeoning of associations of civilsociety  particularly those dealing with human rights young people and women  bears witness to the politicaldetermination of the Government of Chad to promote aculture of democracy.In this connection  particular attention should bepaid to strengthening the role of women in public life as well as the rights of and the protection of children.Likewise  through the establishment of a supremecourt  a constitutional council and a superior council ofjudges  the final touches have been put on the judicialinstitutions that underpin our democratic system.Furthermore  I am pleased to recall that the first multi-party elections took place in Chad in 1996 in a climateof calm and transparency  as the international observersnoted. The next elections will take place in six months.In general  the political authorities in Chad are doingall they can to ensure their success.I would therefore like to emphasize from thisrostrum that Chad's attachment to pluralisticdemocracy cannot be unseated  because the people ofChad as a whole are profoundly convinced that this isthe only way — indeed their unique opportunity — toimprove their living conditions. The most recentmeetings in Syrte  Libya  and the various declarationsmade by Chadian political actors are all encouragingsigns that  as we would like  this attachment is firm. Inall events  the Government of Chad welcomes thesenew arrangements  which are to be seen as part andparcel of the policy of outreach that has beenadvocated by His Excellency Mr. Idriss Deby  thePresident of the Republic of Chad.After gaining this hard-won peace and this firmattachment to democracy  the Government of Chadquite naturally then proceeded — with the support ofinternational institutions and Chad's bilateralpartners — to tackle the question of economic andsocial development. A genuine plan to fight povertyhas been created. This plan includes the elaboration ofa national strategy for the reduction of poverty. Thisstrategy has been further strengthened by the fact thatthe objectives of poverty reduction and economicgrowth during the 2000-2002 period have been madepart of the major  high-priority social and sectoralprogrammes that were adopted at the Geneva IV roundtable on the development of Chad.Part of this struggle against poverty is thestruggle that the people of Chad have waged tocomplete the project for the extraction and export of itsoil. This success was achieved thanks to thedetermination of the President of the Republic  HisExcellency Mr. Idriss Deby — but also thanks tounflagging support of the Bretton Woods institutionsand of friends and other partners of Chad. Here wewould like these supporters to know that theGovernment and people of the Republic of Chadrecognize and are grateful for their assistance.Chad nevertheless does not see itsdevelopment — and even less its security andstability — in an isolated fashion. Therefore Chad isdoing everything possible to make its contribution tocreating a climate of peace and prosperity in Africa —particularly in Central Africa. The subregion of CentralAfrica — despite its immense potential  and perhapsbecause of this immense potential  I might add — nowappears to be the region of upheaval par excellence  aregion characterized by armed conflicts and crises ofall sorts. Undoubtedly some hotbeds of tension havebeen slaked. This is true of the Central AfricanRepublic and of the Republic of the Congo  which aregradually regaining their stability. But this stabilityremains fragile. The international community thereforemust help these countries to consolidate this peace byactions in support of reconstruction and assistance.Two other conflicts  unfortunately  persist andalso dangerously threaten the subregion. One of theseis the conflict occurring in the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo  where the belligerents' failure to respect theLusaka Agreement has unfortunately resulted inexacerbating the rivalries among the foreign forces inthe Congolese territory  further complicating thesituation and holding up the effective implementationof that Agreement.As far as the Angolan conflict is concerned  it hascertainly become even more complex because of itsduration  the resources that nurture it and all the37international complicity that Mr. Jonas Savimbi hastaken advantage of. But we must support the efforts ofthe legitimate and legal Government of Angola  as wellas the efforts of the international community  so thatthis long-suffering people can recover the peace andtranquillity that they have not known since theyacceded to independence.In the framework of the United Nations StandingAdvisory Committee on Security Questions in CentralAfrica  the States of this subregion have not remainedinactive. They are devoting themselves to exploringways and means of establishing peace and tranquillitythrough measures designed first and foremost to createtrust among themselves.The first of these steps is the possibility offeredby the periodic meetings of the Committee. Theseprovide an opportunity for political dialogue in theinterest of preventive diplomacy. For having createdthis Committee  the Security Council is deserving ofour gratitude.Furthermore  structures and mechanisms topromote peace and stability are gradually beingestablished. Among others  we might note theestablishment of an early-warning mechanism inLibreville and of the subregional centre for humanrights and democracy in Yaoundé. The creation of theCouncil for Peace and Security in Central Africa isunder way with the signing  by the heads of State orGovernment  on 24 February at Malabo  EquatorialGuinea  of the protocol regarding this Council and themutual assistance pact.In the area of security there is a plan to organize ajoint military exercise for the peacekeeping operationsof the armed forces of the States of the subregion. Asfor the other contributor to instability — theproliferation of small arms and light weapons — themember States held a subregional conference on thistopic in N'Djamena in October 1999. A number ofmeasures were advocated; among them  we mightmention the project of “arms for development”  whichwas initiated by Canada and certain donor countries —a project that is intended to set up micro-projects tohelp those who turn in their arms. For the time beingthis project involves the areas along the borders ofCameroon  the Central African Republic and Chad. Inthis connection  a mission of evaluation visited thecountries concerned in July 2000. The initiative is onlyat the conceptual stage  but it is to be hoped that it willtake concrete form as soon as possible. I wouldtherefore like to make an appeal to the other partners tojoin with Canada in order to broaden the scope of theseprojects to include the entire subregion.Instability and insecurity in Central Africa arealso among the major causes of refugee flows  aphenomenon that has spared no State. Aware as we areof the negative effects of this phenomenon  memberStates took this matter up during a conference that washeld last August in Bujumbura. The relevantconclusions of this conference deserve to be supported.The political situations in other subregions of theAfrican continent also concern us. Certainly there hasbeen a definite improvement with the consolidation ofdemocratic institutions  good governance and respectfor the fundamental rights of the African people.Nevertheless  several crises are persisting and must bea subject of concern for the entire internationalcommunity. Thus in West Africa  Sierra Leone has notyet achieved peace  despite the commitments enteredinto by the parties to the conflict. Chad  for its part gives its total support to the efforts of the EconomicCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) and theUnited Nations to seek peace in this embattled country.Likewise  we have every confidence in ECOWAS tosmooth out the difficulties between Liberia and Guinea.With regard to the conflict between Ethiopia andEritrea  His Excellency President Idriss Deby haspersonally dealt with this matter as current President ofthe Community of the Sahel and Saharan States bysetting up a good offices mission to the leaders of thetwo fraternal countries  in support of the mediation bythe Organization of African Unity (OAU).The Government of Chad is very pleased to seethat the two parties have finally reached a peaceagreement. We encourage them to respect theirindividual commitments in order to bring lasting peaceto this part of the African continent.Regarding the Somali crisis  Chad welcomes thefact that the people of Somalia have awakened to theirdestiny through the recent conference of nationalreconciliation which was held in Alta  Djibouti  thusdemonstrating courage and imagination in theirdetermination to endow their countries with republicaninstitutions. The international community must helpthem and encourage them to build further on thisinitiative in order to reach total and just peace.38The presence here of a delegation bearing thename of the Republic of Somalia  whose seat has beenvacant for almost 10 years now  is a matter of pride andsatisfaction for the friends and the partners of thisfraternal people.It is an example that should edify our brothers ofthe Comoros and Burundi.We should also congratulate the Government ofDjibouti for their contribution and devotion to thecause of peace in the subregion.We believe it is time to lift completely theembargo against the Great Socialist People's LibyanArab Jamahiriya  because it is no longer justified andarbitrarily penalizes the fraternal Libyan people and indeed  beyond them the entire subregion.Chad has not lost sight of the crisis situationsprevailing in other parts of the world.In the Middle East  it is following with interestthe negotiations underway between the Palestinian andIsraeli authorities and believes that the time for thepeace of the worthy has now come. The parties to theconflict should seize this historic opportunity and  asPresident Clinton said: the world should help them totake the risk of embarking on peace.In Iraq  Chad believes it is urgent to put an end tothe embargo whose consequences have been sodisastrous for the civilian population  which issuffering the atrocious evils resulting from this unjustdecision. Quite clearly any solution should also coverthe very pertinent matter of the prisoners from Kuwaitand other countries.The Korean peninsula is showing encouragingsigns of the two fraternal countries drawing closer toeach other. The historic inter-Korean Summit  whichtook place between the leaders of these countries lastJune  has laid the foundation for trusting relationshipsthat are so central for any dialogue.The international community should encourageboth of these countries to press on in order toeventually sign a peace agreement which would pavethe way to peaceful coexistence.The inter-Korean dialogue might also arousesome interest on the part of the Taiwan Strait wheretension unfortunately continues to be abnormally high.Whereas economic and trade relations between the twocountries are being developed on a regular basis political relations are non-existent  despite the fact thaton both sides of the Strait semi-official structures havebeen set up which serve as channels of communicationbetween the People's Republic of China and theRepublic of China  Taiwan.Both parties should show political determinationand imagination in exploring ways and means ofreducing tension and opening a genuine dialogue. In allevents  the international community is duty bound toreconsider the whole question of admitting theRepublic of China  Taiwan to membership of ourOrganization  particularly in light of the weight and theimportance of the economic role it plays internationallyand the fact that it is so closely involved in actions fordevelopment and the reduction of poverty.For its part  the Government of Chad supports therequest by the Republic of China  Taiwan  to seekmembership in the United Nations and its specializedagencies.I could not conclude my remarks withoutreferring to other ills which undermine and sap all thedevelopment efforts of countries like mine. These illsinclude indebtedness  protectionist measures in themarkets of the northern countries  deterioration in theterms of trade and various kinds of trafficking.Those countries which hold the key to thesolutions to all these ills  particularly the northerncountries  must go beyond simple declarations ofintention and take concrete steps to relieve countriesfrom the burden of indebtedness  to throw open theirmarkets and to pay a fair price for our exports.As if this were not enough  another evil which iseven more insidious and devastating  has made our taskeven more difficult. The prospects for solution areremote indeed and it is to be feared that this will reduceto nothing our hopes to relieve our peoples of poverty.I refer to the HIV/AIDS pandemic which brings deathand bereavement to families on a daily basis.Not only is it a burden for our meagre financialresources  but also on our human resources particularly young people who are the spearhead of ournation.We have the collective responsibility toeffectively mobilize ways and means to conquer thisscourge which defies the entire internationalcommunity as a time when there is so muchtechnological and scientific progress being made.39In the light of all these challenges  Chad believesthat its development should also benefit from thepolitical and economic integration of Africa  which isan important and determinant dimension of this globalvillage. Therefore we would welcome and salute themajor political acts which have been taken by theConference of Heads of State and Government of theOrganization of African Unity (OAU) on 12 July inLomé: I refer to the adoption of the Constituent Act ofthe African Union.This major historic event  which is the result of acollective commitment on the part of the Africanpeoples  is a responsible reply on the part of today'sAfrica to meet the number of challenges of the twenty-first century by means of political  economic and socialintegration.The African Union will create the necessaryconditions for genuine partnership in irreversibleglobalization  but a globalization that would not besynonymous with exclusion and the dictatorship of themarketplace. This globalization  we believe  should besynonymous with sharing and openness. It should havea human face or it will not exist at all.But none of this can be achieved without furtherdemocratization of the United Nations starting with anenlargement of the Security Council so that it can bemore effective and  particularly  more legitimate.In other words  it is in our interest — in theinterest of us all — that the Security Council be morerepresentative of the international community in whosename it claims to act. What we are referring to here isthe credibility of its decisions which  unfortunately have long been used against the weaker with its policyof double standards."
"160",6750,"TGO",55,2000,"Beforediscussing some of the concerns of the Africancontinent and our views on some of the problemsfacing the United Nations  I should like at the outset tocongratulate you  Mr. President  on having been chosento guide the work of our world body at this importantsession. The high office to which you have risen inyour country  Finland  and the major role that Finlandplays in the world constitute a guarantee that theGeneral Assembly is truly in good hands.I wish also to pay tribute to our brother theSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  whose ability anddedication we highly appreciate.The General Assembly session that took place 40years ago was seen as the session of Africa. It was atthat session that many newly independent Africancountries participated in the work of United Nationsbodies for the first time as States Members of theOrganization.Yet despite the progress our continent has madeover the past 40 years  Africa continues to beweakened by the ills of underdevelopment. Today  33of the world's 48 least developed countries are Africancountries. In other words  three fifths of the States ofour continent belong to that group of countries that arelagging behind in the pursuit of development.As the world's least developed region  Africasuffers from a number of specific ills which hamper itsgrowth and for which it is important that theinternational community help provide a substantial effective remedy. Here I would first mention twopandemics that ravage the continent and whose humanand economic consequences are particularly severe andalarming: AIDS and malaria. We are most grateful forthe initiative taken last January by the Security Councilto consider the question of AIDS in Africa. Morerecently  the Thirteenth International AIDSConference  held at Durban  South Africa  took stockof the situation regarding the advance of the epidemicand of possible ways to control it. Members areundoubtedly aware that 70 per cent of the 34 million to35 million AIDS sufferers worldwide live in sub-Saharan Africa  and that in some African countriesschools have been closed because of the ravages ofAIDS among the teachers.In a number of countries the skilled workforcehas been considerably reduced by AIDS. The numberof orphans in many countries affected by this epidemicis relatively high  thus exacerbating the economic andsocial situation of those countries. Therefore  it isessential that the international community rapidly andgenuinely mobilize in order to help the Africancontinent control AIDS and eliminate its ravagingeffects.With respect to malaria  a special summit ofheads of State and Government of the countriesconcerned was held on 24-25 April in Abuja  Nigeria where a plan of action was adopted to combat thedisease. Malaria kills one person somewhere in theworld every 30 seconds. The Assembly of Heads ofState and Government of the Organization of AfricanUnity (OAU)  meeting in LomÈ from 10-12 July thisyear  appealed to the United Nations to proclaim theperiod 2001-2010 the decade to combat malaria. Wefirmly hope that this Assembly will respond positivelyto our appeal  at this session  taking the necessarymeasures to ensure the decade's success.The African debt problem was also of concern tothe OAU Heads of State and Government at the LomÈsummit. At a session more than 12 years ago  theAfrican countries adopted a common position on theAfrican foreign debt crisis. Unfortunately  ourcontinent continues to be the region of the world wherethe debt burden is heaviest. As the General Assemblynoted last year in resolution 54/202 `the continuing debt and debt-servicing problemsof heavily indebted developing countries'5are one of the factors that hinder their development andeconomic growth. This finding should motivate theinternational community  especially the developedcountries and international financial institutions  totake more courageous measures  such as the outrightcancellation of the African countries' debt. Such adecision would greatly contribute to the success of theefforts of our countries  which have committedthemselves to implementing sustained programmes toeradicate poverty.That is why we strongly support the proposals ofSecretary-General Kofi Annan  who believes that theindustrialized countries should take a number ofmeasures for the benefit of the African countries andother developing regions to ensure the possibility oftheir making significant progress in the new worldeconomy.The African continent is grateful to the UnitedNations Development Programme (UNDP) for itsinvaluable assistance over many years  resulting in thecarrying out of numerous projects. However  thecontinuous decline in UNDP resources worries us because it affects our development prospects.At a more global level  we note that majortransnational companies  which play a crucial role inthe world economy  are remarkably absent from UnitedNations economic forums. As in the InternationalLabour Organization (ILO)  where representatives ofGovernments  employers and employees work together it is desirable that in the Economic and Social Councilrepresentatives of Governments should sit side by sidewith those of multinational companies. That wouldenhance the effectiveness and impact of this importantUnited Nations body. The international community  forits part  should prove  by decisive action  that it trulywishes to put an end to the suffering of the poorestpeoples  the largest proportion of whom  unfortunately are in Africa.I take this opportunity to thank President BillClinton for having the United States Congress approvea law making possible the establishment of a closerpartnership between the United States of America andthe African States.I also welcome the convening in Cairo in Aprilthis year of the first Africa-Europe summit. We place agreat deal of hope in such meetings  which can onlystrengthen the existing cooperation between theEuropean Union and the African countries.It is well known that our continent is not afflictedsolely by the economic underdevelopment that puts itin last place in terms of the quality of life. It is also aregion of the world where numerous lethal conflictscontinue to sow death and desolation. Consequently Africa accounts for the largest number of refugees andinternally displaced persons. We are grateful to theUnited Nations and its specialized agencies particularly the Office of the United Nations HighCommissioner for Refugees  for their assistance inhelping our continent to control various conflicts andmitigate their disastrous consequences.We must recognize very sadly  however  that  bycomparison to other regions of the world that have alsoexperienced bloody conflicts  the attention that ourcontinent receives from the international community issomewhat meagre. We strongly urge the SecurityCouncil to demonstrate the same concern for us that itbestows on other regions of the world that have beenaffected by conflicts  inter alia  Europe and Asia.We subscribe to the relevant recommendationsmade by the Panel of experts which the Secretary-General has mandated to consider all problems relatedto the improved use of peace operations. We are of theview that the mandates of United Nations peacekeepingmissions should be clear  credible and achievable.These missions must be adequately financed andrapidly deployed where they are expected. They mustbe capable of fulfilling their mandates successfully andable to defend themselves and control all those whowould seek to hinder their action on the ground.In the area of peacekeeping in Africa  theOrganization of African Unity (OAU) has endoweditself over the years with valuable instruments formanaging conflicts  such as the Mechanism forConflict Prevention  the Conflict Management Centreand the Early Warning System. More than five yearsafter the creation of these mechanisms  we believe thatthey should be complemented by the establishment ofan operational and effective African peacekeepingforce. If such a force were created  it would discourageall subversive actions that underpin conflicts.That is why I have proposed  with a view tostrengthening that force  the establishment of anAfrican institute for peace and conflict prevention  withthe assistance of the United Nations and the OAU. Thisinstitution would train African cadres in the art of6negotiation  conflict management and the culture ofpeace.The persistence of conflicts in Africa seriouslyaffects the continent's opportunities for developmentand hampers its efforts to achieve unity. It was with aview to remedying this situation that the heads of Stateand Government of the OAU decided in Syrte  Libya on 9 September 1999  to transform the OAU into a neworganization to be known as the African Union. ItsCharter was unanimously adopted at the 36th Assemblyof Heads of State and Government of the OAU  held atLomÈ last July. We are convinced that  with the birth ofthe African Union  the continent will hasten its processof economic and political integration and strengthenthe peace and solidarity that are indispensable todevelopment.The General Assembly was right to convene theMillennium Summit that was held here last week from6 to 8 September. That historic conference was held toconsider the role of the United Nations in the world atthe dawn of the twenty-first century. In my message tothe Millennium Summit  I stressed two basic problems.One related to the activities of the United Nations inthe maintenance of international peace and security.The other concerned the stakes of development particularly in relation to Africa.When the Organization was established 55 yearsago  two thirds of its current Members did not exist assovereign States and their peoples still lived under thecolonial yoke. The planet had a scant 2.5 billioninhabitants  as compared to 6 billion today. Despite theexpansion of the Security Council over the years  itscomposition has in truth remained virtually unchangedsince the establishment of the United Nations. To usethe words of Secretary-General Kofi Annan  thiscomposition`does not fully represent either the character orthe needs of our globalized world'. (A/52/2000 para. 44)We therefore think that it is high time toreconsider the composition of the Security Council with a view to admitting new permanent membersselected from the new economic Powers that haveemerged since the Second World War  to which wouldbe added regional Powers from the developingcountries.These are a few ideas that I wanted to contributeto this general debate.Despite its imperfections and shortcomings  Ithink that the United Nations is irreplaceable  but wemust do everything possible to enhance its impact andinfluence.In conclusion  I would like to underscore that theAfrican continent  despite its difficulties  continues tobe a region of great potential wealth; however  itsresources have inadequately been inventoried developed and exploited.We must not despair and think that Africa will notovercome these difficulties. We are resolved to doeverything within our power to improve the political economic and social situation of our continent.We simply need the benevolent assistance of allthose who are today richer and are prepared to join usto bolster our efforts."
"161",6795,"THA",55,2000,"On behalf of thepeople and the Government of Thailand  I would like toextend my warm congratulations to you  Sir  upon yourelection to the presidency of the fifty-fifth session ofthe General Assembly. I am confident that under yourable guidance  we shall be able to build upon themomentum generated by the Millennium Summit andenjoy a successful and result-oriented GeneralAssembly session.I should also like to take this opportunity to paytribute to Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  Foreign Minister ofNamibia  the President of the fifty-fourth session  forhis leadership and tireless efforts throughout the pastyear. His wisdom and dedication to the tasks of ourAssembly enabled him to serve as an effective bridgebetween the last session and the Millennium Summit thus laying a firm foundation for our work this year.On this occasion  may I  on behalf of the peopleand the Government of Thailand  extend a warmwelcome to Tuvalu on its admission as the newestMember of the United Nations family.The dawn of the new millennium is a time forboth justified celebration of and sombre reflection onthe achievements and shortcomings of the UnitedNations during the past 55 years. As we review theUnited Nations track record  I cannot but recall thevery first words written in the United Nations Charter:“We the peoples of the United Nations”. These fewsimple words convey an idea of overwhelmingsignificance — that it is the peoples of our respectivenations who represent the core raison d'être of thisforemost assembly of humankind. It is the peoples whoshould be the primary beneficiaries of every resolutionthat we adopt and every programme that we launch.As we proceed with the first General Assemblysession of this millennium  we should ask ourselves thequestions  “Have we indeed put the peoples at thecentre of all our deliberations and activities? Have wedone enough to ensure that ordinary people  both menand women  young and old  benefit from all ourinitiatives and actions  collective as well asindividual?”We are encouraged that the Secretary-General  inhis report to the Millennium Assembly  has highlightedthe “peoples' concerns” as one of the primary agendaitems for the international community to take up. Andwe are gratified that many countries have highlightedissues of direct interest to peoples at the MillenniumSummit  from reversing the spread of HIV/AIDS malaria and other diseases to combating the scourge ofdrugs  from rolling back poverty to closing theeducational gaps within and between countries. Theseare all important steps in the right direction.But we need to do more. We need to adopt a freshmindset that places the interests and welfare of thepeoples — the peoples of our own countries and thoseof other nations — at the centre of our policies insocio-economic development and in maintaininginternational peace and security. We need to keep inmind that promoting the interests and welfare ofpeoples requires that we also promote human rights andfundamental freedoms. We need to work collectively totranslate commitments made at the Millennium Summitand in other forums into concrete results that reachpeople directly.Although the recent economic and financial crisishas brought devastating consequences to millions ofpeople across the Asia-Pacific region  it has helpedrefocus the attention of Governments on the need toprotect the most important of any economy's assets namely  its people. The crisis  by exposing theinadequacies of national social safety nets in protectingthe welfare of vulnerable peoples  has raised manydifficult questions. In essence  how can one pursue4sustainable development and even attempt to attaineconomic prosperity when the basic needs of peoplecannot be fulfilled and the potentials of people notfully developed?The idea of putting people at the centre ofdevelopment efforts is not new. But its application hasbeen far from widespread. As various countries slowlyrecover from the economic and financial crisis in Asia the value of pursuing people-centred development hasbecome ever greater. This development paradigmconsiders development as a means to promote people'swelfare and interests rather than as an end in itself. Itlooks beyond quantitative indicators of growth andfocuses more on how to nurture the capabilities ofpeople in society so that they are empowered and areable to make positive contributions to a country'sdevelopment efforts. And it needs to be forward-looking  taking into account the interests and welfareof future  unborn generations.As part and parcel of the efforts to pursue people-centre development  we must put a premium ontackling those issues  national and transnational  thathave a direct impact on people's welfare. I shouldtherefore like to highlight three issues in particular thataffect the very essence of the welfare of our peoples:drugs and narcotics-trafficking  HIV/AIDS and povertyalleviation through sustainable development.One of the most unfortunate consequences ofglobalization is the globalization of the drugs andnarcotics problem. Illicit trafficking in and productionof narcotics erode an economy's resources  generate ahost of social problems and undermine our humanpotential. These effects are widespread  from the mostrural and remote of villages to the most modern ofmetropolises. It is a global social problem that affectspeople directly  both users and non-users. While alltypes of drugs and narcotics are a threat to society  wehope that the international community will give asmuch attention to the growing threat ofmethamphethamines as it did to heroin and other drugsin the past. The small size and low cost of producingmethamphethamines make them readily accessible toall sectors of society and therefore difficult to suppress.Thailand has spared no effort in tackling the drugand narcotics problem at the national level  and is atthe forefront of regional and international cooperationto meet this challenge  with the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the United NationsInternational Drug Control Programme (UNDCP). I ampleased to announce that Thailand and UNDCP will behosting an International Congress  “In pursuit of a drugfree ASEAN 2015: Sharing the vision  leading thechange”  in Bangkok from 11 to 13 October this year.We hope to establish an effective coordinatingmechanism to tackle the drugs and narcotics problemalong all fronts and at all levels  and we hope that theinternational community will support us in theseendeavours.We are gratified that the global problem ofHIV/AIDS  which is affecting an increasing number ofpeople in our societies  was given due attention at theMillennium Summit. But international efforts will haveto be strengthened and sustained if the internationalcommunity is to make a dent in a problem that hasalready affected more than 36 million peopleworldwide and is reaching epidemic proportions. Weare honoured that Thailand has been cited as one of thesuccess stories in tackling the HIV/AIDS problem inthe developing world. Nevertheless  the sustainabilityof successful national efforts requires strong supportand cooperation at the regional and multilateral levelsand effective partnerships with non-governmentalorganizations  including the private sector.In this connection  we hope that regional andinternational cooperation in preventing and alleviatingthe HIV/AIDS problem will emphasize the exchange ofAIDS-related technologies and state-of-the-arttechniques for the prevention and alleviation of thisdisease  as well as the sharing of knowledge onaffordable HIV/AIDS-related drugs. We call on theSecretary-General to enhance his efforts incoordinating international action against HIV/AIDS.We also support the proposal for a special session ofthe General Assembly in 2001 to address this problem.Uplifting peoples from abject poverty andendowing them with appropriate means to leadproductive lives are the best guarantees of long-termsocial stability  and provide a secure foundation forfuture prosperity and international peace. Povertyreduction is thus at the core of people-centreddevelopment and the first step in promoting a more justand equitable global order. The tenth session of theUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development(UNCTAD X)  which Thailand had the honour ofhosting from 12 to 19 February this year  drewparticular attention to the risks of marginalization ofthe poorest countries in the global economy and of the5most vulnerable groups within both developing anddeveloped countries.UNCTAD is endeavouring to build a newconsensus on how to have greater equity andparticipation by all in the international economy in thisera of globalization. In line with the “Spirit ofBangkok” emerging from UNCTAD X  Thailand  ascurrent President of UNCTAD  greatly appreciates theinitiative by Japan during the Group of Eight (G-8)Summit in Okinawa and the G-8 Foreign Ministers'Meeting in Miyazaki in July this year to inviterepresentatives from developing countries as well asregional and international organizations to meet withthe G-8 leaders as a means to strengthen North-Southcooperation. We are also very appreciative of China'sinitiative to hold a Sino-African dialogue ondevelopment cooperation soon. We are convinced thatthese initiatives are a step in the right direction.I was astounded to learn that fewer than 2 percent of the world's population is connected to theInternet  despite all the hype  and that a large portion ofmankind have never heard a dial tone. If suchdiscrepancies in information (IT) and/or digital dividesare not reversed soon  the developing world will be leftfar behind the rest of the world. Thailand believes thatwe should act in concert to maximize the benefits of ITand to ensure that the greatest possible percentage ofthe world's population is guaranteed IT access.To this end  Thailand fully supports andappreciates the G-8 Okinawa Charter on the GlobalInformation Society to bridge the so-called digitaldivide. We also welcome the contributions of theprivate sector  such as those of the Global DigitalDivide Initiative of the World Economic Forum and theGlobal Business Dialogue on Electronic Commerce.We hope that more  similar initiatives will beforthcoming so that we  especially the developing partof the world  can overcome the digital divide.Debt problems are also recognized as a seriousobstacle to the pursuit of economic and socialdevelopment  and all countries should be assisted inmanaging their debt obligations  including through adebt standstill. Thailand therefore also supports theconvening of an international intergovernmental eventon financing for development next year at the highestpossible level and hopes that feasible and effectivemeasures can be agreed upon to generate greaterinternational financial assistance to support sustainabledevelopment and to address poverty. In this connection we see great value in securing the active participationof the international financial and trade institutions andthe private sector  as well as all the NGOs concerned.The most effective way to ensure povertyreduction and promote sustainable development is toempower peoples with the capacity to help themselves.And there is no better way to achieve this than througheducation and training. Thailand thus attaches greatimportance to human resources development (HRD).Our efforts are not confined to the national level butextend to a wider  regional scale. We have been at theforefront in promoting HRD in the Mekong subregion for we sincerely believe that the upgrading of humanpotential is the best way to fight poverty and ensurecloser regional cooperation and sustainabledevelopment.International peace and security begin at home. Ifwe are able to pursue an all-encompassing notion ofsecurity that places the security of peoples at the apexof our considerations  if we can secure for peoplefreedom from want as well as freedom from fear  thenthe likelihood of threats to international peace andsecurity will be drastically reduced. Human securityand people-centred development are two sides of thesame coin: they each promote the welfare of peoples indifferent ways and reinforce one another at the sametime.It is gratifying to note that the concept of humansecurity is gaining ground  even though the debates onwhat constitutes human security are by no means over.Thailand believes that human security can only takefirm root if the basic needs of peoples are fulfilled andpeoples are free from social and economic threats totheir well-being. How can we begin to talk abouthuman security  let alone international peace andinternational security  when 1.2 billion people in theworld live on less than 1 US dollar a day  about 90million children are out of school at the primary leveland about 1.2 million women and children under 18 aretrafficked for prostitution each year?We therefore advocate freeing people from wantby effectively and collectively meeting the challengesposed by poverty  illiteracy  infectious disease  famine natural disaster  social unrest and disintegration. Theseare in fact the very same goals that we need to achievein promoting people-centred development.6The achievement of human security also requiresthe promotion and protection of human rights andfundamental freedoms. We cannot support humansecurity and effectively pursue people-centreddevelopment if we are unable to ensure that people areprotected from the worst forms of abuse  suffering anddeprivation. We cannot claim to put people at thecentre of development efforts if we are unwilling tocreate political conditions whereby people are able topursue their lives free from threats to their dignity andpersonal safety. We cannot expect to develop humanpotential to the fullest or make people effectivecontributors to economic development if they cannothave the intellectual freedom to pursue their hopes anddreams for their own future.Thailand therefore calls upon the internationalcommunity to renew its commitment to promoting andprotecting human rights and fundamental freedoms  inorder to ensure that people's interests and welfare areindeed at the centre of our policies and programmes. Itis with this conviction that Thailand commits itself toplaying an active and responsible role within theUnited Nations Commission on Human Rights.Drawing strength and inspiration from one of the mostdemocratic constitutions anywhere  we will continue togive our full support to the efforts of the UnitedNations aimed at the protection and promotion of basichuman rights  freedoms and dignity.In this connection  Thailand also calls upon theinternational community to redouble its efforts to assistdisplaced persons wherever they may be. As host toover 100 000 displaced persons and over a millionillegal economic migrants  Thailand attaches greatimportance to this issue and hopes that it will beresolved comprehensively and as soon as possible.While we seek to promote international peace andsecurity from within by building support for theadoption of the human security paradigm amongnations  we should also redouble our effortsinternationally. We should engage in prompt andeffective collective action at the regional andmultilateral levels to create conditions of peace andstability. At the Millennium Summit  many leadersspoke of the need and urgency of Security Councilreform. In line with the increased membership of andmounting challenges to this world Organization Thailand  for one  supports the expansion of both thepermanent and non-permanent membership of theSecurity Council  based on the principle of equitablegeographical representation  efficiency and readiness toshare responsibilities.Furthermore  Thailand fully supports the reformof United Nations peace operations to ensure theireffective conduct and thus the credibility of the UnitedNations itself. As I mentioned during the MillenniumSummit  we strongly support the Brahimi report onUnited Nations peace operations  for we believe that itsrecommendations are right on target and constituteachievable and practical steps towards thestrengthening of United Nations peace operationsworldwide. I should also add that peace operationsshould be prompt and non-selective as well as beingcomprehensive in nature.Thailand is therefore honoured to play animportant part in United Nations peacekeeping effortsunder the United Nations International Force  EastTimor (INTERFET) and now under the United NationsTransitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) through the contribution of over 1 500 Thaipeacekeepers and the role of Lieutenant-GeneralBoonsrang Niumpradit  Force Commander ofUNTAET. At the same time  Thailand has always beenconscious of the value of regional cooperation infostering peace and stability and strongly supportsregional efforts aimed at confidence-building andpromoting preventive diplomacy.In this connection  we are proud of the seventhmeeting of the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF)recently concluded in Bangkok in July  which saw theadmission of the People's Democratic Republic ofKorea (DPRK) into our forum. We warmly welcomethe Democratic Republic of Korea's participation in theARF  the only regional forum that brings together allthe key countries in the Asia-Pacific region. We areconfident that this will strengthen the momentum forregional peace and security in the Asia and Pacificregion.It is our fervent hope that at this first GeneralAssembly of the twenty-first century  55 years after theUnited Nations held its first meeting  we  theGovernment representatives of Member States  canmove forward in fulfilling our promise made in theUnited Nations Charter to serve the interests of “Wethe peoples of the United Nations”. More than everbefore  we need to remind ourselves that it is thepeoples of our nations who are at the core of all ourefforts  whether these be to pursue social and economic7development  maintain international peace and securityor promote human rights and fundamental freedoms.For if we do not fulfil our task in advancing the causeof protecting the welfare of our peoples  who will? Ifwe cannot adequately promote and protect the interestsof the peoples of the United Nations  then it is time toconsider other ways in which the peoples of the UnitedNations — indeed  our own peoples — can interactdirectly with the United Nations.Now is the time. Let us rededicate ourselves tothe task that we set out to accomplish 55 years ago. Letus strive to become what we were always meant tobe — a truly representative body of “We the Peoples ofthe United Nations”  acting in defence of their welfareand the advancement of their interests above all else.Let us resolve and pledge to each other that we shall beeven more united  better prepared and more resilient tomeet the challenges of the new millennium together."
"162",6820,"TJK",55,2000,"Letme join in the congratulations addressed to Mr. HarriHolkeri and to his country  Finland  on his election tothe lofty and responsible post of President of the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly. I wish him everysuccess in guiding the work of the MillenniumAssembly. I should like to take this opportunity also toexpress our genuine gratitude and to pay due tribute toMr. Gurirab for his outstanding diplomatic abilities andfor the evident skill with which he guided the work ofthe fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly.The further the passage of time separates us fromthe Millennium Summit  the more profoundly will weappreciate its historic outcome. Tajikistan welcomesthe recommitment by world leaders to the role of theUnited Nations as the key mechanism for the collectiveregulation of international relations.We remain convinced that there is no alternativeto the United Nations. No one actor is capable ofdealing single-handedly with the new multifacetedchallenges  risks and threats to international securityand stability. Only through concerted and collectiveaction on the part of the entire international communitycan we combat phenomena such as severe financial andeconomic crises  regional conflicts  internationalterrorism  organized crime and the illicit drug trade.The positive results achieved by my country inthe implementation of the peace process in our nationare further proof of the key role of the United Nationsin coordinating the efforts of States in the process ofresolving armed conflict.Today  after seven years of confrontation  peaceprevails in Tajikistan. Following the first multiparty pluralistic elections in the country's history  held inFebruary 2000  Tajik society is living in a new kind ofenvironment and is laying down a sound foundation forthe sustainable democratic development of the country.The considerable support of the internationalcommunity  which  under the auspices of the UnitedNations  effectively promoted the advancement of thepeace process in Tajikistan  played a significant part inthe establishment of peace and stability in the country.The Tajik people will always remember the UnitedNations with gratitude and will always associate thisOrganization with the return of peace  democracy andconditions for sustainable development to our ancientland.On behalf of President Emomali Rakhmonov  Itake this opportunity to express our great appreciationto the Security Council  the Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  his special envoys andrepresentatives  and the leaders of the United Nationsteams and missions in Tajikistan for their enormouscontribution to the successful completion of the peaceprocess in my country. Our special appreciation goes toall those States — about 30 — that sent their citizens toTajikistan as part of the United Nations Mission ofObservers in Tajikistan (UNMOT). The Tajik peoplewill for ever keep in their memories the names of thosewho gave their lives so that peace could return to ourcountry.We extend our sincere gratitude to the Office ofthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees(UNHCR)  the United Nations Children's Fund(UNICEF)  the United Nations Development21Programme (UNDP)  the World Bank  the InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF) and the International FinancialCorporation. They have rendered  and continue torender  every possible support to the people andGovernment of Tajikistan in their efforts to overcomethe effects of the civil conflict and to rehabilitate thecountry's economy.At all stages of the peace process the RussianFederation made a decisive contribution to itsprogressive development. The Russian peacekeepersand frontier guards who lost their lives serving securityand stability in Tajikistan and Russia will never beforgotten by our peoples.The guarantor States for the implementation ofthe peace agreement — the Russian Federation  theIslamic Republic of Iran  the Republic of Uzbekistan the Kyrgyz Republic  the Republic of Kazakhstan Turkmenistan  Pakistan and the Islamic State ofAfghanistan — rendered considerable support to theUnited Nations in achieving the successful settlementof the conflict. The joint efforts of the United Nations its specialized agencies  the Bretton Woods institutions neighbouring States  the United States  the EuropeanUnion  the Organization for Security and Cooperationin Europe (OSCE) and the Organization of the IslamicConference (OIC)  and of all those others whosincerely desired to see a peaceful and stableTajikistan  contributed to the successfulimplementation of the General Agreement on theEstablishment of Peace and National Accord inTajikistan  signed in Moscow on 27 June 1997.We are fully aware that a huge job of post-conflict peace-building awaits us. We hope that theUnited Nations office in Dushanbe will continue tooperate effectively  rendering rehabilitation assistance first and foremost  in the social and economic spheres.Much remains to be done  but what has already beenaccomplished at this stage is of great significance forthe steady  peaceful development of Tajik society andfor the entire Central and Southern Asia region.This is undoubtedly of paramount importance forthe United Nations  since it constitutes one of thepositive examples of successful activities by ourOrganization in the maintenance of peace and conflictresolution. We hope that the support for and assistanceto Tajikistan needed to reinforce the gains of the peaceprocess will be intensified. We count on the GeneralAssembly's adopting during its current session thetraditional resolution  normally adopted by consensus on humanitarian assistance to Tajikistan.Large-scale humanitarian assistance is ofparticular importance this year  because in the springand summer the whole of Tajikistan was affected by adrought on a scale without precedent in the twentiethcentury. The loss of grain crops on irrigated landproved to be from 30 per cent to 50 per cent.According to the World Food Programme (WFP)  about3 million people — in other words  every secondcitizen of Tajikistan — is inadequately fed. We greatlyappreciate the Secretary-General's appeal for foodassistance to the population of Tajikistan most affectedby the drought  and we are deeply grateful to the WFPand all donor States that responded so promptly andgenerously to this appeal.Clearly  in the new century United Nationsactivities in the humanitarian sphere  in which it hasalready demonstrated its capabilities  will continue toplay an important role. We believe that it is necessaryto intensify the cooperation of Member States in thisarea in order to increase the international capacity torespond to natural and technological disasters. In ourview  this is one of the realistic directions for thedevelopment of the Organization  which will allow allto take advantage of the opportunities provided byglobalization. This is entirely achievable  once theefforts and capacities of the United Nations and otherinternational economic and financial organizations areunited. It would provide a demonstration of the globalsolidarity called for by the Secretary-General.Achieving sustainable development and ensuringthe equitable consideration of the interests of bothpresent and future generations on a global scale is oneof the most serious challenges of the new century.Today we are not far from that boundary beyond whichthe processes of destruction of the natural mechanismsregulating the environment and global changes becomeirreversible. Our common objective is to meet the everincreasing needs of human development in theeconomic and social spheres  while not simplypreserving  but gradually restoring natural ecosystemsto conditions that will guarantee environmentalsustainability.Much has been accomplished in this area over thelast decade. Agenda 21  adopted at the Rio de JaneiroConference  has become a fundamental documentdefining the main area of activities of the international22community on this topic. However  the dimensions ofthe task faced by humanity require extra coordinatedefforts. Alongside the long-term problems  such asclimate change  the preservation of biodiversity  anddesertification  new ones are emerging  demandingcareful consideration and concerted action. One is theproblem of fresh water  a resource which is beinggradually depleted. Depletion of ground waters hasbecome a serious problem. According to someforecasts  by 2050 the population of the planet will nothave an adequate water supply. The problem ofdrinking water is multifaceted and is not confined topurely economic issues.In “We the peoples: the role of the United Nationsin the twenty-first century” the Secretary-General drewattention to the fact that  in order to have a sustainablefuture  it is absolutely essential that the internationalcommunity tackle the current fresh water problems.Major concern about this question has been expressedby many non-governmental organizations  as well as bythe private sector. It has already been discussed atinternational conferences  including  at the ministeriallevel  the Second World Water Forum held in TheHague  the Netherlands last spring  and it will bediscussed at the forthcoming International Conferenceon water problems to be held in Bonn  Germany. Allthese steps  aimed at giving profound consideration tothe matter and elaborating proper coordinated action bythe international community  are precisely the purposesserved by the initiative put forward by our President ayear ago to proclaim 2003 the international year offreshwater. We hope that the relevant resolution will beadopted by consensus at this session. We would be welladvised to recall our relationship with the two atoms ofhydrogen and one of oxygen that  bound together innature  support our lives on earth.While the twenty-first century may present newtrials for humanity  that which recently endedchallenged the international community with the urgentnecessity jointly to combat international terrorism  thedrug trade and organized crime. The situation in manyregions of the planet demands that the United Nationsmobilize even greater international efforts to counteractthese horrible phenomena more actively.The situation in Afghanistan in particularendangers regional and international security. Theinter-Afghan crisis has transformed that country into astronghold of international terrorism and made it theworld leader in drug production. The situation inAfghanistan was recently the subject of a thoroughdiscussion at a meeting of the Group of 6+2  held at thelevel of Foreign Ministers. Tajikistan is firmlyconvinced that there can be no military solution to theAfghan crisis; any victory by any party to the conflictwill be temporary and will not lead to theestablishment of peace and stability in that country.Only the United Nations  in cooperation with theOrganization of the Islamic Conference  is capable ofuntying the tight knot of the Afghan crisis. Tajikistanfully approves of the activities of the United NationsSpecial Mission to Afghanistan and its Head  Mr.Vendrell. We express our hope that additional resolutemeasures to be undertaken by the Security Council andthe entire international community will eventuallyallow the fire of war that has raged in that country for20 years to be extinguished. Otherwise  as we havealready seen  the terrorist and narcotic threats toregional and global security emanating fromAfghanistan will continue to grow.Our duty is to help the Afghan people to return toa dignified and peaceful life and to erect a reliablebarrier to the heroin-fuelled aggression and thecultivation of international terrorism encouraged by theTaliban  which threaten not only the countriesbordering Afghanistan  but also those located farbeyond the region. We are convinced that it willbecome possible to find a formula for peace and a wayout of the Afghan deadlock only through our jointefforts and the leadership of the United Nations.In order to continue playing a key role in worldaffairs  the United Nations must continuously renewitself. Much has already been done to that end thanksto the important initiatives and effective actions of theSecretary-General. However  a number of issues thatcould have a real impact on the efficiency of the UnitedNations in the twenty-first century — inter alia expanding the Security Council's membership — haveyet to be addressed. Tajikistan is in favour ofincreasing the efficiency  balance and representation ofthe Security Council by incorporating highlyindustrialized countries  such as Japan and Germany and influential developing States into its membership.We hope that this issue will be resolved with thebroadest possible support.Each session of the General Assembly providesus with a unique opportunity to develop a unifiedapproach and to coordinate our actions at the global23level for the sake of a truly democratic  secure andsustainable development of humanity. The Summit ofworld leaders  unprecedented in the history ofmankind  has given our Organization a powerfulpolitical impetus with which to enter the twenty-firstcentury. The Millennium Assembly should preservethis momentum and use it rationally for the sake ofstrengthening the community of nations and ourcommon future."
"163",6843,"TKM",55,2000,"Allow me  Sir  to welcome you to your post and towish you every success in your important and difficultactivities in guiding the activities of this Assembly. Ishould like to say how grateful we are to Mr. Theo-BenGurirab for his wise guidance of the last session of theGeneral Assembly.The twentieth century was in every aspect acentury of sharp contradictions in relations amongpeoples and nationalities  as well as a century ofeconomic disaster. The most stark examples were twoworld wars  scores of civil wars and the catastrophe atthe Chernobyl nuclear power station  as well as othertragedies.The flames of war also raged in the AfricanStates  which had gained independence in the 1960s. InCentral Asia  the Afghan wound is still bleeding  butthe most important event of the twentieth century wasthe collapse of the enormous empire called theUSSR — an empire which wore the outer shell ofinternational friendship but within which everythingwas worm-eaten. New  independent sovereign statesarose from its ruins. Out of that rubble  ourindependent neutral State arose — Turkmenistan which from the very first days of its coming into beingchose the path of goodness and justice  peace andcooperation.The twentieth century did not resolve many of theproblems that needed resolution. Quite the contrary —the knots of these problems have become even moretangled and their lines even more taut. They haveaccompanied us into the twenty-first century and nowwe must unravel this tangled web and relax these tautlines. This should be the task and concern of allpeoples and nationalities.Our planet is the house we share and therefore itis the duty of everyone living on this planet to keep itclean and peaceful and to achieve economic stability.In his report submitted to the Millennium Assembly the Secretary-General of the United Nations drew ourattention to problems which require immediatesolution  relating to all aspects of our lives.Globalization is the priority problem. It is aninevitable objective process  part of the general courseof world development  which includes many aspects both positive and negative. This is a decisive trend inworld development  which affects the whole complexand multifaceted field of international political andeconomic relations. In this respect  questions ofinternational law and the moral and juridical aspects ofrelations between countries and regions cause concernand require constant monitoring.We must not allow some to hold sway over othersor allow mankind to be programmed according to oneyardstick alone  and no sovereign state should bedictated to by insistence on one development model.This is a very serious question  because this approachcalls into question the entire system of internationalrelations  the legitimacy of international legal normsand the principles and purposes — indeed  the viabilityof — the United Nations itself as the expression ofvoluntary cooperation among equal nations.The model of political globalization based on thesupremacy of a neo-liberal philosophy is graduallystrengthening the logic of confrontational thought ininternational affairs  leading to the arm-twisting ofthose who don't recognize the new international powerstructure based on humanitarian intervention andprotecting human rights  but not on the rights ofpeoples.Turkmenistan  like the overwhelming majority ofStates  is against this approach. We are convinced thatthe common progress of mankind lies not in dictatingone model or in a single set of laws and principles  buta combination of ideas and philosophies. In this8context  I should like to stress the importance andtimeliness of the idea put forward by the President ofIran  President Khatami  of a dialogue betweencivilizations. We started this century and thismillennium under such a profound symbol  and thisobliges us to have respect and tolerance for a wholerange of centuries-old cultures and State systems. Thatis how we see the possibility for a friendly dialogueamong States  peoples and individuals.We must move away from looking for differencesamong us and start looking for what brings us together without forgetting our specific features. That is ourapproach in our relations to the world and with all ourpartners  and this has made it possible for my countryin the short period of time since our independence tobuild friendly relations with all our neighbours in theregion and to find many friends far beyond the confinesof our neighbourhood.The main achievement of independentTurkmenistan was to ensure stability within our State and this stability has been guaranteed because of theuniversal support of the programmes and tasks facingthe State  in which our people take a direct part. It isthanks to this stability that we are today successfullyimplementing economic and social programmes thatseek to provide well-being for our citizens.The development of a socially oriented policy hasbeen reflected in a strategy for socio-economic reformsin Turkmenistan for the period up to 2010. Thatprogramme envisages a continuation of the policy thatgives priority to social programmes  bearing in mindthe economic realities that have emerged in the years ofour independence. Today  Turkmenistan is a countrythat is self-sufficient in grain and basic food productsand that has implemented the main parts of its overallprogramme for economic security.In our economic programme  we stress inparticular developing the real sector of the economy institutional transformations and attractinginvestment — including foreign investment.Agriculture is our priority  as well as the fuel andenergy sectors  the chemicals industry and consumercomplexes  transport and communicationsinfrastructure and a network of transnational pipelinesthat export Turkmenistan's fuel to world markets.One of the main tasks in this coming period willbe to develop our productive potential. Here  a leadingrole will be played by the fuel industry. We intend toconcentrate our efforts on labour-intensive sectors;these are promising from the point of view of theirpotential and competitiveness. The economic growth ofour State should guarantee the well-being of ourcitizens.From the standpoint of ensuring sustainablesocial development and the progress and well-being ofour people  regional cooperation is becomingparticularly important. In our region  we have a stablesystem for active economic interaction  provided by theEconomic Cooperation Organization (ECO)  whichconsists of 10 States with major resource and economicpotential. Over the past few years within ECO we havestarted to implement some important interregionaltransportation and communications projects which willbring the European and Asian countries' economiescloser together  bridge the technological gap betweenthem and establish an equitable system of trade andeconomic relations between the North and the South.That same goal is currently being served byTurkmenistan's efforts to export energy raw materialsto world markets. Building pipelines is not just aquestion of profitable commercial projects; these arealso projects for the social development of our countryon an enormous scale  going well beyond our nationalconfines. Because of this  Turkmenistan is taking aninitiative to draft an international legal instrument toguarantee the safe  unimpeded transit of energy rawmaterials through major inter-State pipelines. Thisinstrument is necessary to make sure that the interestsof the producers are taken into account  as well asthose of the transit countries and consumers  and thatwe totally rule out the possibility of the use of thesepipelines as an instrument for political and economicpressure.Another problem that could severely damageregional stability is the question of the legal status ofthe Caspian Sea. The lack of clarity on this questionand the one-sided scenarios being offered impede theuse of the enormous potential of this sea. ForTurkmenistan  the main point is to take into accountthe interests of all riparian states in order to ensure thatcooperation on the Caspian is based on mutual respect equality and mutual benefit. Turkmenistan believes thatseeking a new legal status for the Caspian Sea requiresall riparian States to make some sensible compromises9and show a willingness squarely to face the newrealities. This process should be monitored by theUnited Nations.Touching on regional security  allow me to dwellon the grave Afghanistan problem  which we takeparticularly seriously. The history of the long-sufferingAfghan people has shown that any outside interferencein this domestic conflict  particularly the use of force is futile and will only make matters worse. We arefacing a fair accompli  and in this situation we mustrecognize that dialogue and cooperation with theTaliban will give more results from the point of view oftheir natural modernization than any attempts to isolatethem or to impose any kind of sanctions on them.Sanctions basically work against the Afghan people.They are therefore counterproductive.Turkmenistan favours a peaceful solution of itsconflicts  and as a neutral  friendly neighbouring Stateis prepared actively to promote the Afghan settlementunder the aegis of the United Nations. In particular recently  upon the initiative of the President ofTurkmenistan  another initiative was taken to work outsome mutually acceptable solution to resolve thisAfghanistan conflict. That was the point of theTurkmenistan mission which went to Iran  Afghanistanand Pakistan and held talks and consultations with topleaders of these countries and with the leaders of theTaliban movement and the Northern Alliance  afterwhich proposals to settle the conflict were made at therecent meeting between the Secretary-General of theUnited Nations and the Afghanistan six plus two group.Together with the United Nations  Turkmenistan ismaking every effort to convince the belligerents tocease fire and to sit down at the negotiating table.In conclusion  I again assure the Assembly that inTurkmenistan the United Nations has an activeMember prepared to make every effort to discharge thelofty tasks decided at the United Nations MillenniumSummit. As we enter the new millennium we begin towonder what it will be like. What awaits us in thefuture? Every person  every people  living in this worldis striving for a better  more radiant future  which hasto be built consistently  insistently  on the basis ofpeace  respect and progress. I hope that all the peoplesof the world will devote themselves to that goal."
"164",6911,"TTO",55,2000,"I wish tocongratulate you  Sir  on your election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-fifthsession. At the same time  I record my thanks andappreciation to your predecessor  the Minister forForeign Affairs of Namibia.We are meeting just after the historic MillenniumSummit  which brought together more than 150 leadersof the world. Clearly  there is not much left to say. Onthe other hand  there is much to be done. Urgent actionis needed; the time for implementation is now.National action is needed more than ever in allcountries. The fact is that each nation has the primaryresponsibility for dealing with its own problems. It isnot sufficient to make visionary statements and well-intentioned commitments. The will to bring aboutchange in our societies must be demonstrated in allnations. We should remember that we are the solutionto our problems  and that if we are to be effective thepartners of others  we must demonstrate a willingnessto help ourselves.We must eliminate poverty. It is an indictmentagainst humanity that in the twenty-first century morethan a billion of the world's people are mired in thedehumanizing conditions of extreme poverty. Eachcountry must adopt those policies necessary toengender growth in their economies and to ensure thatall their citizens have access to the opportunities thatare being created. It now behooves the internationalcommunity to take concrete and positive action tobring to fruition the commitment made by heads ofState or Government in the Millennium Declaration: toreduce poverty levels by the year 2015.Trinidad and Tobago has already taken actionthrough an appropriate policy framework and othermeasures of reform. As a result  our economycontinues to grow  and we are generating employmentwhile keeping inflation low. We are making efforts toensure that all our citizens benefit from the country'ssuccesses  and we are making strides towards theelimination of poverty and are today ranked veryfavourably in the United Nations Human DevelopmentIndex.Education is the key. It is a powerful force forsocial change. It is a human right. It goes far beyondschooling. It assists in combating poverty  empoweringwomen  promoting human rights and democracy andpromoting international peace and security. Accordingto the United Nations Children's Fund report  “TheState of the World's Children 1999”  130 millionchildren in the developing world are denied the right tobasic education. Regrettably  almost two thirds of themare girls. This cannot continue. All children must haveaccess to all levels of education. This must be anational objective in every country. United Nationsdeclarations by themselves will not help.Since independence  Trinidad and Tobago hasplaced considerable emphasis on education  whichcontinues to rank among the largest items ofGovernment expenditure. The laws of Trinidad andTobago provide that education is mandatory for allchildren between the ages of five to 12 years. Tuition isfree at public and Government-assisted schools. Wecontinue to improve our system. Pre-school educationhas developed rapidly in Trinidad and Tobago  and17special education is also being given greater attention.In further recognition of the importance of education the Government of Trinidad and Tobago recentlyembarked on a programme which will ensure freesecondary education for every child of secondaryschool age  and this took effect with the opening of thenew academic year 2000-2001.If people are not healthy  they can neither findfulfilment nor contribute to their country'sdevelopment. The poor of the world need easier accessto essential drugs and vaccines to reduce mortality anddisability. It has to be a travesty that only one per centof the budget of global health research is directed todiseases like pneumonia  diarrhoea  tuberculosis andmalaria  all of which are concerns of developingcountries. In Trinidad and Tobago  health care is givenhigh priority. The health budget continues to be one ofthe major areas of Government expenditure and through a decentralized system of regional healthauthorities  health care is made accessible andaffordable to all. The Government is constantlyinvesting in human resources and physicalinfrastructure to meet the demands of the population.The Government of Trinidad and Tobago has reducedthe cost of medication for some chronic diseases  suchas glaucoma  diabetes  asthma and arthritis. We are alsoensuring that equipment for our physically challengedcitizens is affordable. Every effort is being made toreduce the backlog of certain common surgicalprocedures. Next year  a National Health InsurancePilot Project is expected to be instituted to cover everycitizen. Under the proposed system  the Governmentwill pay the contribution on behalf of those personswho cannot afford to do so.The ravages of the HIV/AIDS pandemic and itsdevastating socio-economic consequences constituteanother of the major health-related challenges for theinternational community in the twenty-first century.The spread of the HIV/AIDS virus is of particularconcern to the Caribbean  the second most seriouslyaffected region. The Government of Trinidad andTobago views this matter very seriously  and we havelong embarked on a programme of action designed tocombat this scourge. It is based on research andeducation and building partnerships with the public andprivate sectors  as well as actors in civil society. We arealso convinced of the need for greater globalpartnership to develop an effective and more affordablevaccine against HIV/AIDS. The present HIV-relateddrugs should be made less expensive. We support theconvening as well of a special session of the GeneralAssembly to consider all aspects of this problem.Our planet continues to experience environmentaldegradation. The problem will never be solved unlessthere is international cooperation  especially on the partof industrialized countries  which are mainlyresponsible for the emission of greenhouse gases. Wein the smaller countries  especially small islandnations  are the most severely threatened. But even in asituation where we are victims  we do not absolveourselves from responsibility. Trinidad and Tobago isalready doing its part. We have established a Ministryof the Environment and an Environmental ManagementAuthority. We have recently enacted legislation toempower this Authority. We have operationalized anenvironmental policing system  and we are now in theprocess of establishing a Green Fund  through whichthe industrialists in our country will contribute tofinancing programmes for protecting the environment.The Government is working in close collaboration withthe international community on environmental issuesand  in this regard  we are a State Party to all of themajor Conventions concerning the environment.Trinidad and Tobago is actively involved in thedevelopment of national legislation to give effect tothese international treaties.I must join my Caribbean Community(CARICOM) colleagues in lamenting the blatant andpersistent misuse of the Caribbean Sea as a trans-shipment route for hazardous wastes. This continues tobe a cause for major concern to the Governments of theregion. We are not comforted by the assurances ofcompliance by those who use this route for economicgain. A single accident can threaten the very viabilityof our societies. Can the commercial benefit from usingthis route override its potentially horrendousconsequences? Accidents can occur  and we again callfor a halt to these shipments.No country can progress without democracy andgood governance  which create the environment forprogress and development  peace and security. Allcitizens must be included in the mainstream of nationalactivity. All must be allowed to contribute. Every voicemust be heard; every view considered; and everycitizen must have access to the opportunities that theirsocieties create. This should be the primaryresponsibility of every Government in every country.Government must also be based on the rule of law.18Each nation  therefore  has the responsibility todevelop effective judicial and legal systems to bothprotect the rights of the individual and guard the nationagainst any usurpation of its democratic systems. We inTrinidad and Tobago are proud of our strongdemocratic traditions. Free and fair elections are heldpeacefully  regularly and on time. There is freedom ofspeech and of political association and freedom of thepress. Our democratic tradition is buttressed by a veryactive civil society  involving strong trade unions dynamic social and cultural groups and other non-governmental actors. We have an independentjudiciary  and we have recently embarked on themodernization of our laws and legal system to keep ourcountry in step with modern trends.Each Government has the duty to ensure thesecurity of both its State and citizens. One of theserious threats to security is the escalation of the worstkinds of crimes within national borders in manycountries. This battle against the criminal element isfaced by all societies  on differing levels  but it is abattle to which Governments must  of necessity allocate adequate resources if they are to maintainpeace and foster development. In many developingcountries  the rise in the level of violent crime isdirectly related to poverty and the deprivation sufferedby individuals. This link between poverty anddevelopment on the one hand  and peace and securityon the other  should not be minimized. Like mostcountries  Trinidad and Tobago is battling thephenomenon of crime. In addition to allocatingincreased resources to our protective services  toprovide them with manpower  infrastructure andequipment to deal with crime  we are implementingsocial programmes to combat deviant behaviour through the Ministries of Education  Culture  SocialDevelopment  Youth and Sport.Trinidad and Tobago continues to face thechallenges of the illicit traffic in drugs. Due to ourgeographic location  we are used as a convenienttranshipment point in the drug trade. We have taken allmeasures available to us on the national  regional andinternational fronts to combat this menace to oursociety. The Government has  in this regard established an agency to coordinate the overall effortsagainst drug trafficking and has entered into regionaland bilateral arrangements for cooperation incombating this serious crime. Our strengthened legalframework has led to successes in the investigation andprosecution of crimes associated with drug trafficking.Legislative measures include the Dangerous Drugs Act the Drug Court Bill  the Drug Abuse RehabilitationTribunal Bill and the Proceeds of Crime Bill.At the international and regional levels cooperative efforts include a number of bilateralextradition and mutual legal assistance agreements. InJuly  2000  Trinidad and Tobago  along with six otherGovernments  signed an agreement establishing aregional justice protection programme  which providesa framework for regional cooperation in the protectionof witnesses  jurors and legal and law enforcementpersonnel. While we will continue to strengthenexisting measures and to expand the spheres ofcooperation  we wish to reiterate that this is a problemwhich the international community cannot successfullytackle without the necessary commitment of all Statesconcerned.Another growing threat  which is closely relatedto the menace of the drug trade  is the illicit trade insmall arms. We therefore attach great significance tothe convening of the 2001 United Nations Conferenceon the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weaponsin All Its Aspects  and we fully support the veryimportant preparatory work which will precede theConference.The disease of racism  racial discrimination andreligious intolerance continues to plague the world aswe enter twenty-first century. This is an intractablecultural problem that can be ameliorated only througheducation and enlightenment. It is the expectation ofmy delegation that the World Conference againstRacism  Racial Discrimination  Xenophobia andRelated Intolerance  to be held in South Africa at theend of August 2001  will produce action-orientedrecommendations to eliminate this scourge. No effortshould be spared to rid human civilization of this uglyaffliction.As a pluralistic society  Trinidad and Tobago isproud of its record of harmony. In our country  asimmortalized in our national anthem  every creed andrace find an equal place. We have become well knownas a rainbow society and at present we are seeking tocreate the institutions and the legal framework to evenfurther deepen our world-renowned harmony.Whilst I have thus far emphasized the need fornational action  we are fully aware that cooperation atan international level is absolutely necessary if we are19to deal effectively with the problems of our planet. Inthis global village  no country can survive on its own.Today's reality is globalization  borderlessness andintegration at the international  regional andsubregional levels. The United Nations  therefore  likeall other international actors  has a pivotal role to play.For example  the international financial institutionsmust become more sensitive to the development needsof countries and the world trading system must takeinto account the special concerns of the disadvantagedand the vulnerable.As we have already demonstrated  Trinidad andTobago is willing to be an active participant in theconcerted effort of the international community toachieve the goals we have set for ourselves. We havealways proven this since becoming a member of thisbody. We have participated  we have cooperated andsometimes  as with the International Criminal Court we have led the way.We wish to achieve a humane global civilization.We wish to bequeath to the future a planet of prosperityand peace for all"
"165",6958,"TUN",55,2000,"I amparticularly pleased to express my congratulations toyou  Sir  on your election as President of the fifty-fifthsession of the General Assembly. Your great diplomaticexperience and your thorough knowledge ofinternational affairs are the best guarantees for thesuccess of this session. While assuring you of thereadiness of our delegation to fully cooperate with you we would like to wish you the utmost success as youcarry out your responsibilities.Allow me also to express my thanks to yourpredecessor  Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  for the remarkablerole he played during the previous General Assemblysession. His efforts made it possible to achieve positiveresults in the review and resolution of many issues.The Millennium Assembly takes place at a timewhen the world is at the crossroads of two differenteras. This makes it particularly important that thisfifty-fifth session provide us with the opportunity totake stock of what we have achieved together and tobegin developing a forward-looking strategy that willallow us to face the current challenges. We can identifyand face these challenges only within the framework ofa multidimensional  international partnership in thepolitical  economic  social and development spheres.President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and his peerswho met at the Millennium Summit have underlinedthe main challenges that the international communitymust face. These challenges should set priorities forour joint efforts in the next stage  so that we can makethe next millennium a millennium of internationalpartnership  of the development of joint strategies  ofthe promotion of societies and satisfying their multipleneeds  of the struggle against poverty and epidemics  ofconflict prevention and of the establishment of a lasting13basis for peace and international security. In otherwords we should make this millennium truly amillennium of the common future of mankind.The Declaration adopted by the MillenniumSummit is a document of historical importance. Itpaves the way for the future work of the internationalcommunity within the framework of the principles andpurposes of the Charter of the United Nations. In theDeclaration world leaders reaffirmed these purposesand principles and renewed their commitment to them.They also reaffirmed their adherence to the UnitedNations as the only forum for the expression of theinternational community's choices for the future and asthe ideal instrument for achieving our collectiveaspirations.At the end of the last millennium there wereseveral major summits — including the MillenniumSummit  the South Summit  the Non-alignedMovement summit and the two special sessions of theGeneral Assembly  devoted to social development andwomen. The results of these summits and meetings  thevisions expressed and the decisions taken regarding thefuture of international relations provide an importantpoint of reference that makes it possible to develop aglobal and consensual strategy in order to build a truepartnership between peoples and nations. The goal ofthis partnership should be to take up the futurechallenges together.Among the lessons we have learned from thesehistoric meetings was the consensus reached by allcountries on the need for a renewed vision of theworking methods that we have followed every year inrecent decades in order to adapt to the requirements ofour time  when different aspects of international life inthe political  economic and social spheres are allinterlinked.The challenges of our modern world require aglobal vision and common action that would take intoaccount the link between peace  security andsustainable development based on a political approachthat combines democracy  human rights and goodgovernance  as well as overall strategies for the fightagainst poverty on an international scale. Indeed poverty has been identified by major internationalauthorities and also in the statements that emergedfrom the Millennium Summit and the Security Councilas well as by the Secretary-General in his reports to theMillennium Summit and to the General Assembly at itsfifty-fifth session as one of the main causes ofinternational economic imbalance and as a source ofinstability  conflict and tension in many regions of theworld.In our opinion  the international community iscalled upon today to objectively develop a concept ofinternational peace and security as well as the means topreserve them. It is called upon to adopt a broaderconcept that takes into account not only the directcauses of wars  conflicts and tensions  but also theirentrenched roots and the means to resolve them inorder to ensure their prevention and to guarantee peaceand security. The last decade has shown the magnitudeof the means that are required to resolve conflicts andtensions throughout the world. This has generated aweakening of international will when true and directparticipation in the quest for solutions to the manyconflicts was needed.The United Nations  despite its limited resources remains the main actor that can resolve these conflicts.Previous experiences have taught us  among otherthings  that the principle of conflict prevention remainsthe best way to avoid conflicts and the resultant humantragedy and economic and social damage  which aredifficult to remedy.Indeed  within this international forum  we mustwork with regional organizations and internationalfinancial institutions to implement a strategic plan ofaction with new dimensions that would enshrine theprinciple of prevention as the main way to avoidconflicts and to deal with their deep and structuralcauses  through a global vision that would take intoaccount the pressing needs of economic and socialdevelopment. Experience has proved that stability andinternal harmony within and between countries will notbe achieved without national development andinterdependent interests.It is difficult indeed to imagine how a society canengage in internal violence or get involved in anexternal conflict if its interests are protected and if itenjoys well-being and prosperity — both fundamentalconditions for peace and stability.This vision conforms to the reform process underway at the United Nations  in the Security Council andat international financial institutions that have realizedthat the cost of prevention is far lower than the cost ofpost-conflict reconstruction  especially since certain14consequences  those that affect human beings  aredifficult to remedy.It is therefore high time that industrializedcountries and international financial institutionshonoured their commitments towards disadvantagedregions and countries in the form of officialdevelopment assistance  by encouraging foreigninvestment and by settling the debt problem  includingthe servicing of the debt  in order to meet therequirements of development and to contributeeffectively to formalizing the idea of prevention basedon multifaceted international aid.Before concluding my comments on the matter ofpeacekeeping and international security in this newinternational environment  I would like to underline thefollowing. First  there is a need to introduce necessaryreforms into United Nations procedures when it comesto peacekeeping operations  especially since theactivities of our Organization are no longer limited totraditional missions  but also encompass disarming andreintegrating combatants  removing landmines establishing State institutions and monitoring elections.These new missions require greater material andhuman resources  as well as collective efforts. Ofcourse  this requires a substantial strengthening ofUnited Nations preventive capabilities.Experience has shown that the success ofpeacekeeping operations depends on the prior consentof the parties concerned  on a clear mandate and on theavailability of necessary resources.We have also observed through our experience inpeacekeeping operations that serious problems do exist especially when it comes to delays in reimbursingcontributing countries.The report of the group of experts  developedunder the chairmanship of Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi contains important recommendations that command ourattention and deserve in-depth study  especially sincethey deal with all aspects of peacekeeping operations.Secondly  the role of the Security Council inpeacekeeping and international security is crucial andindispensable. It draws its strength from the fact that itis a universal tool and that it embodies internationallegality.As always since the 1960s  Tunisia remains readyto meet the United Nations calls  as well as those of theinternational community  to take part in peacekeepingoperations throughout the world. Given the priority ofthe security of personnel serving in peacekeepingoperations  in July Tunisia ratified the United NationsConvention on the Safety of United Nations andAssociated Personnel.The need to introduce reforms to the SecurityCouncil is dictated today by internationaldevelopments that have taken place since the adoptionof the Charter. In this context  increasing the number ofpermanent and non-permanent members of that bodyon the basis of equitable geographic distribution is anurgent demand. We would like to stress the need toreach a consensus that would make it possible toincrease the number of permanent members.In this regard  I would like to recall that Tunisiasupports the candidacy of Japan  Germany and othercountries. An eventual solution should preserve theinterests of all international parties and make itpossible to satisfy the demands of developing countriesand  above all  African countries  which are entitled totwo permanent seats on the Security Council  to bedistributed according to the rule of rotation. It is alsonecessary to improve the working methods of theCouncil in order to ensure that its work is marked bytransparency and effectiveness. Since acceding to theSecurity Council as a non-permanent member  Tunisiahas tried to ensure that its contribution to the work ofthat body is based on dialogue with the other membersin order to bring viewpoints closer together and toreach results that would guarantee the success of allendeavours to safeguard peace and internationalsecurity.Along the same lines  with respect to the role ofthe Security Council  we cannot overlook the questionof humanitarian intervention  which has been thesubject of widening debate in recent years and whosereview calls for particular and sustained attention.We stress the need for an in-depth examination ofall aspects of this matter. Indeed  if a particularhumanitarian situation requires urgent intervention sothat it does not deteriorate  such intervention cannottake place outside the framework of international law the basic principles and norms of international relationsand the provisions of the United Nations Charter. Statesovereignty remains a fundamental tenet that can neverbe overlooked or ignored  because any violation of this15principle would alter the balance of internationalrelations and risk the spread of anarchy.The question of sanctions is one of the mostimportant issues that United Nations bodies  includingthe Security Council  have to face. The experience ofthe past decade has shown that the use of sanctionsmust be modified so as to alleviate their impact onpeoples  while certain criteria  such as their use as alast resort after all other peaceful means have beenexhausted  must be applied.In cases in which the imposition of sanctions isnecessary  their duration should be limited. We shouldalso define clear conditions for the lifting orsuspension of sanctions and undertake an ongoingassessment of their humanitarian effects on thepopulation of the target countries  as well as theirdirect impact on the interests of third countries.In this connection  with regard to Iraq  Tunisiahas always reaffirmed the need to unite all our effortsin order to reach a peaceful settlement of the disputethat would make it possible to end the embargo reintegrate Iraq into the community of nations  put anend to the tragic suffering of the Iraqi people resultingfrom the sanctions imposed over the past 10 years andhelp to direct the efforts of the countries of the regionand their peoples towards the achievement ofdevelopment and stability. All parties must cooperatein order to resolve the other humanitarian aspects ofthe problem  in particular the issue and fate of missingKuwaiti nationals.With regard to the Lockerbie affair  the recentdevelopments following the implementation of theagreement concluded on the matter and the suspensionof the embargo imposed on Libya  it is time forsanctions to be lifted completely and definitively inorder to allow the Jamahiriya to continue its overalldevelopment process and to support the Arab MaghrebUnion (AMU) as it strives to achieve the integrationand complementarity on which all of its member Statesplace great importance. Tunisia has made the AMU astrategic choice. It is constantly working to promotethe Union and to strengthen its foundations andstructures. With the help of its partners in the Union  ithas tried to give this regional organization new impetusso that it can respond to the historic aspirations of itspeoples.With regard to the Middle East  we would like toexpress our regret that the negotiations at the CampDavid summit meeting held in July stalled without anagreement that would guarantee a fair settlement of thePalestinian cause. Tunisia  which from the outset hassupported the peace process on all tracks  is convincedthat it is time to give concrete form to the legitimateaspirations of the Palestinian people to build anindependent State  with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as itscapital  in accordance with international law and theterms of reference of the peace process based on theprinciple of land for peace. Tunisia hopes that theAmerican Administration will continue its goodoffices  and that other influential parties  such as theEuropean Union  Russia and Japan  will step up theirefforts to help the Palestinian Authority and the IsraeliGovernment reach an agreement that would make itpossible to establish a just and lasting peace andguarantee the national rights of the Palestinian peoplein accordance with General Assembly and SecurityCouncil resolutions  in particular Security Councilresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).Achieving a just and lasting peace in the MiddleEast will also depend on progress on the Syrian track.Israel is called upon to withdraw from the Golan and tocomply fully with Security Council resolutions 242(1967) and 338 (1973). Israel is also called upon torespect the international borders of Lebanon and torefrain from violating the borders drawn by the UnitedNations.Our States are encouraged to try to identify waysand means to face the phenomenon of globalization with its consequences and economic and socialrepercussions  and to adapt to it in order to ensure thatits dividends are shared and to spare our peoples especially peoples of the South  the negative falloutfrom it.The African continent is a region suffering mostfrom development problems  despite major reformsundertaken by the countries of the continent indifferent areas. Despite the efforts made by certainAfrican countries  Africa is still suffering from a severelack of resources and assistance which prevents it fromjoining the global development process. In this context one of the greatest challenges is to prevent themarginalization of the economies of developingcountries and to ensure an international environmentconducive to access to international markets and to anincreased share of international trade. This will requirethe international community to provide the necessaryimpetus in the area of investment and financing if these16States are to develop  and to increase officialdevelopment assistance  which has not only remainedbelow 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of thecountries of the North  but is actually decreasing  whilethe external debt crisis and debt servicing continue toburden developing countries.In this context  we recall the initiative ofPresident Zine El Abidine Ben Ali  calling for therecycling of debts in development projects  whichwould make it possible to reduce the debt burden andhelp the countries concerned.I also take this opportunity to recall the appealmade by President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in 1995 forthe creation of a partnership and development contractbetween the countries of the south and north shores ofthe Mediterranean. This appeal is an extension ofPresident Ben Ali's initiative  launched in 1989 fromthis lofty rostrum  for a global contract of peace andprogress between the countries of the North and Southaimed at strengthening cooperation and creating newprospects for stability and progress in the world.Given the major progress achieved in thescientific and technological spheres in recent decades the millennium on which we are embarking willundoubtedly be one of science  technology andcommunications  necessitating the sharing of thebenefits of progress  including in the field ofcomputers  which will create great prospects for theharmonious and balanced development of countries.In this context  I recall Tunisia's initiative to holda world summit on the information society  and itsproposal  in the framework of the InternationalTelecommunication Union  to host such a summit in2003. I renew my appeal to all Member States and tothe parties and institutions interested in this field tosupport this initiative and contribute as much aspossible to organizing the summit in Tunisia.Peace and security are part of a concept withcomplementary dimensions; it is no longer limited tothe outbreak  management and resolution of conflicts but  rather  encompasses everything that contributes tostrengthening stability and offers opportunities fordevelopment and prosperity. Furthermore  exclusionand marginalization  in all their aspects  undoubtedlylead to extremism and open the way to tension andviolence. We know today that the struggle againstpoverty has assumed considerable importance. Indeed while many societies enjoy well-being and prosperity large fringes of the world's population experiencepoverty and destitution  which are alien to moral valuesand human rights. Furthermore  abject poverty is oneof the most dangerous sources of conflict andinstability. The fight against this planetary scourge andthe violence and internal and inter-State conflicts that itengenders is a universal duty and a moral obligationthat all international parties must assume.In this context  I wish to reiterate the appeallaunched by His Excellency President Zine El AbidineBen Ali for the creation of a world solidarity fund  asan instrument to complement existing internationalmechanisms  without replacing them. This fund couldbe financed by donations and voluntary assistance fromthe international community  and its objective would beto finance field programmes to fight poverty directlyand urgently.President Ben Ali has made this proposal basedon the success of the experience of the NationalSolidarity Fund  26.26  set up in Tunisia in 1992 which helped lower the rate of poverty in our countryfrom 22 per cent to 6 per cent. This proposal has beenfavourably received by member countries of the regionand France  as well as by 12 international and regionalorganizations  such as the Group of 77  the Non-Aligned Movement  the Organization of the IslamicConference  the South Summit and the GeneralAssembly special session on social development. Withthe international community's awareness of the need tofight poverty  and given the wide support that theproposal to create a world solidarity fund enjoys Tunisia would like to present  during the currentsession  a draft resolution in this regard  which it hopeswill obtain all the support necessary from MemberStates.Tunisia has always attached great importance todemocracy and good governance  because it isconvinced that these values are an integral part of anyrebirth and development. Since the change of 7November 1987  we have introduced fundamentalreforms to promote these values. Indeed  the principlesof human rights  the culture of tolerance and respect forthe right to difference are the bases of change inTunisia  which has enriched the values of internationalsolidarity and collective responsibility at all levels:political  economic and social.The existence of a national solidarity fund is thebest reflection of the importance of this aspect in17national life. An individual's awareness of hisresponsibility towards the future of his homelandimplies solidarity and cooperation with all componentsof society  making it possible to remedy the problemsof exclusion and marginalization in society.Democracy  human rights  good governance andnational solidarity are interlinked values that must takeinto account the characteristics and specific features ofeach society  since there is no standard model that canbe applied to everyone everywhere. This vision  whichhas been enshrined at various international forumswould  thanks to the positive results seen in differentcountries  including Tunisia  be likely to constitute oneof the main concepts we have been called upon toadopt consensually and to implement in the newmillennium.Indeed  the right of peoples to freedom anddemocracy is a concept that has become a dailypractice in many countries and must be consolidated taking into account the requirements of growth andprogress that themselves constitute a fundamentalcondition for peace and stability. In this context international partnership is a common denominator thatmust guide our action in the next millennium.Finally  allow me to express the hope that thissession will mark the rebirth of solidarity among allcomponents of the international community  withinwhich the United Nations will play a leading rolethrough its outreach and its ongoing harmoniousactions. Our objective would be that our action shouldcontain a human global dimension to establish acommon strategy and conditions for security  stability development and prosperity on the basis of thecommon interests of all peoples everywhere."
"166",7005,"TUR",55,2000,"Our deliberations come in thewake of the historic Declaration just adopted at theMillennium Summit. Today  we look into the futurewith greater confidence. Our commitment to theprinciples enshrined in the Charter is undiminished.Our enthusiasm to turn our Organization's goals intosolid realities remains high. In our quest for a betterworld  we are to derive our inspiration from ourdemocratic values; our energy from the dynamism ofour societies; and our strength from global solidarityand shared responsibility.Today  there is no greater challenge for us thanthe prevention of conflicts and the achievement ofpeace. The horrors we witnessed in Europe  the FarEast and Africa in the course of the past decade compelus with a sense of urgency to devise effective conflictprevention mechanisms and strategies. In hisMillennium Report  the Secretary-General articulatesthe means for conflict prevention. Theserecommendations  when adopted and implemented will provide the required capacity and credibility.As an increasingly active member of theinternational community  providing civilian andmilitary contingents to peace efforts in different spots as far apart as South-Eastern Europe and East Timor Turkey will give substance to United Nations efforts toprevent conflicts. As peace operations become a corefunction of the United Nations  we feel the urge to havea sounder financial basis. Turkey therefore supportedthe review of assessments for the apportionment ofexpenses for peacekeeping operations. We hope thatthese discussions will lead to a fairer redrawing of thescale.The rapidly globalizing world provides anappropriate environment for Turkey  at the heart ofEurasia  to serve as a bridge between many nations andcivilizations.A priority task is securing peace and stability inthe Balkans. The Stability Pact for South-EasternEurope  in which Turkey plays an active part  providesa good framework for cooperation and development inthe region. In Bosnia and Herzegovina  however  thefull implementation of the Dayton/Paris accords is stillour objective. We should preserve Bosnia andHerzegovina as a multi-ethnic  multicultural independent and sovereign State. Turkey will continueto contribute bilaterally and through multilateralendeavours to Bosnia and Herzegovina's state-buildingand reconstruction efforts.In Kosovo  the United Nations has been able toput in place arrangements enabling the population tosustain their daily lives  but the current state of ethnicviolence does not inspire hopes for a promising future.The United Nations Interim Administration in Kosovohas set new rules for the administration of Kosovo. Welook forward in particular to the full recognition of thevested rights of the Turkish community of Kosovo. Wehope the shortcomings in this respect will soon becorrected  allowing the multi-ethnic and multiculturalstructure of Kosovo to be duly reflected in its publicinstitutions and organs.To turn to a positive development  I shouldunderline that the constructive trend in our relationswith Greece I mentioned in my address last year to theGeneral Assembly continues. During the year  we havesigned nine agreements for cooperation in a variety ofareas  ranging from economy to culture. In this context the rapprochement between Turkey and Greece that weinitiated has already brought about positive results.The mutual rediscovery by the peoples of Turkeyand Greece of one another and their reconciliationprovided the main dynamics of the rapprochement.Almost on a daily basis  politicians  mayors businessmen  trade-unionists  artists  writers sportsmen and student groups visit each other acrossthe Aegean or Thrace. Trade between the two countriesis flourishing. An unprecedented flurry of activity isbeing observed along the Aegean coasts and in Thrace.Bilateral tourism is on the rise; joint investments arebeing carried out. A memorandum of understanding fora joint Turkey-Greece-European Union pipeline projectto transport Central Asian and Caucasian energy toWestern Europe has been signed.All these positive developments have revealedonce again that the Turkish and the Greek people are infavour not of confrontation  but of cooperation andfriendship. The peoples of our two countries have notonly superseded their politicians  but have raised amost significant barrier to any inclination to movebackwards. The rapprochement between our twopeoples constitutes the best guarantee against theinclinations of some politicians who  once in a while yearn for the confrontational past.Turkey's attention is also focused ondevelopments in the southern Caucasus and CentralAsia. Our historical  cultural and linguistic affinitieswith the countries of those regions serve as a majorasset in our joint efforts to see the peoples of the regionmove towards higher levels of security and prosperity.Recent terrorist activities  however  pose a new threatto the peace and security of the Central Asian Statesand are of major concern. We are now seeking ways asto how we can best assist those countries in theirstruggle against terrorism.Recent events demonstrate once again that wehave to fight international terrorism collectively. Wecommend the efforts of the United Nations tostrengthen the legal framework in the fight againstterrorism and urge the General Assembly to keep thematter high on its agendas.The developments in Afghanistan are cause forgrave concern  as they have a direct impact on thestability of a huge region  including Central Asia. Inthe southern Caucasus  peace has yet to be achievedbetween Azerbaijan and Armenia. The internationalcommunity has the obligation to contribute to endingthe Armenian occupation of parts of Azerbaijan.Stability in Georgia  on the other hand  remains a goal.We have put forward the idea of a stability pact for theCaucasus and are following up our initiative. Theregional countries must develop a growing awarenessof the wide-ranging benefits of regional cooperation.Here  I should also underline that attempts todefame other nations or to extract enmity from historywill serve no useful purpose. No nation in the worldhas the right to use or distort history in order to achievesome kind of identity. Historical research should be leftto scholars. In this day and age  we expect all nationsto concentrate their efforts on cooperating with eachother for the good of their peoples.The Middle East peace process has reached acrucial phase. Turkey has always underlined theimportance of a comprehensive  just and lastingsettlement on the basis of international legitimacy andwithin the framework of Security Council resolutions242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and of the principle of landfor peace.The Palestinian issue lies at the core of the Arab-Israeli conflict. On the other hand  it has again beenproven during the course of negotiations that Al-Qudsis the decisive element for peace between Palestiniansand Israelis. Progress was made at the Camp Davidsummit  as it was the first occasion at which there wasfrank discussion of all issues  including the mostsensitive. We are heartened to witness the willingnessof both sides to continue negotiations and to explore allpossibilities. We encourage the parties to remainengaged in order not to waste this historic opportunity.Turkey is endowed with centuries of experienceregarding the area  the wider region and its problems.We also have deep historical  moral and cultural tieswith the peoples of the region. Turkey has goodrelations with the Israeli and the Palestinian partiesalike and enjoys their trust. This prompted the partiesto solicit our contributions in recent weeks tofacilitating a better understanding and greaterconfidence between them. Turkey will continue theseefforts as long as we all think them useful.I would also like to underline that Israel'swithdrawal from southern Lebanon  within theframework of Security Council resolution 425 (1978) was a step in the right direction. We also hope thatnegotiations on the Israeli-Syrian and the Israeli-12Lebanese tracks will resume soon and reach a mutuallyacceptable solution.As we are recommitting ourselves to uphold theprinciples enshrined in the Charter with increaseddetermination and vigour  we should likewise avoidbeing captive of approaches not based on reality. In thesame vein  efforts to impose solutions that do not takeinto account the realities on the ground are doomed tofailure.In line with this very basic logic  the settlementof the Cyprus issue must be compatible with theexisting realities on the island. To refresh memories onthis particular subject which is sometimes distorted inpublic opinions by some powerful centres  I would liketo summarize the historical background. Cyprusbecame an international problem as of December 1963when the joint Turkish-Greek Republic was forciblydestroyed by the Greek Cypriots and anunconstitutional rule was set up at the expense of theTurkish Cypriots. The present situation in Cyprus cameinto being after the coup in 1974 engineered by NikosSampson  the coup leader  who was acting incoordination with the colonels' junta in Greece. Thiscoup murdered many Greek Cypriots as well. The couptoppled Archbishop Makarios and forced him to fleethe country. They staged widespread terror and movedto make the Turkish Cypriots subjects of a GreekCyprus which was designed to be an integral part ofmainland Greece.Turkey  as one of the guarantor powers by virtueof the London and Zurich Agreements  intervened toterminate the ongoing massacres and to prevent theperpetration of similar atrocities in the future.Accordingly  Turkey averted an ethnic cleansing on theisland and spared the Turkish Cypriots from sharing thetragic fate of the Muslim Kosovars and MuslimBosnians of the future. Therefore  it would be a grossdistortion of history to consider Turkish intervention asan occupation. On the contrary  it symbolizes liberationfor nearly 200 000 Turkish Cypriots. Due to Turkishintervention  not only did the coup in Cyprus fail  butalso the junta collapsed  and democracy returned toGreece.Since 1974  peace and security has prevailed onthe island. Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots live onthe island as two independent states  two functioningdemocracies  representing two distinct peoples. In spiteof a ruthless economic embargo imposed upon them bythe Greek Cypriots  the Turkish Cypriots have madeconsiderable economic progress.It is stipulated by the United Nations that bothparties through separate referenda should approve acomprehensive settlement mutually acceptable to thetwo parties. In case the settlement is rejected by one ofthe parties in its referendum  the proposed solutionbecomes null and void. It is out of the question therefore  for an international organization or any othergrouping to impose its own solution on the parties. Inthis framework  the membership of Cyprus in theEuropean Union  of which Turkey is not a full member would be an indirect enosis and contrary to theLondon and Zurich Agreements.If a mutually acceptable settlement is sincerelysought  then the model is quite clear  based on therealities of Cyprus: a confederation consisting of twostates. As to this model  the two independent entities by virtue of reaching an agreement betweenthemselves  will transfer some of their functions to theconfederal bodies. Thus  both the integrity anddiversity that emanate from the realities of the islandwould be preserved. A mutually acceptable settlementin Cyprus cannot be reached through romanticdescriptions but through realistic assessments.Therefore  to define the division of Cyprus as the lastwall of Europe might sound fashionable but theconnotations it brings and the parallelism it draws aretotally erroneous. First of all  the line defined as awall was not drawn by Turkey. This line was drawnby the United Nations peacekeeping forces in 1963 inorder to protect the Turkish Cypriots from the assaultof the Greek Cypriots. This is the year when the GreekCypriots illegally got hold of the state apparatus andconducted violent assaults against Turkish Cypriots.To refer to some recent arrangements by theTurkish Republic of Northern Cyprus on its sovereignsoil as an act strengthening the existing barriers isirrelevant. For the walls to tumble down in Cyprus the Greek Cypriot side must first free itself of itspresent frame of mind. Turkey favours a viablesettlement of the Cyprus issue. It supports PresidentDenktaş' confederal proposal and the proximity talksinitiated by the Secretary-General.I would like to take this opportunity to expressthe appreciation of my Government for the efforts ofthe Secretary-General as well as his Special Adviser onCyprus  Mr. de Soto.13As a new century is being initiated  it isregrettable that the richly endowed continent of Africais yet to receive its share from globalization. Especiallythe prosperous nations have to make a sustained effortto counter poverty and disease in Africa and give thepeoples of Africa the hope and the means for a morepromising future.We have to vigorously pursue our efforts to makethe world a safer place for all. Turkey has alwaysencouraged efforts aimed at achieving meaningful andverifiable arms control and disarmament arrangements.In this context  we are also supportive of nucleardisarmament. It is with this understanding that we aresignatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty(NPT) and to the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty(CTBT). We urge all countries that have not yet doneso to do likewise.One of the tools at the disposal of the UnitedNations to respond to countries that violateinternational peace and stability is sanctions. In recentyears sanctions have become a prominent tool inUnited Nations collective efforts. There is now an on-going debate on the subject and an assessment is beingmade on the utility of sanctions.The effectiveness of sanctions  as we see it  hastwo important aspects. The first has to do with whetherthe sanctions applied to a given country or area servetheir intended purpose. This  in turn  raises the questionof whether the sanctions are properly targeted andwhether there is universal compliance. The secondaspect concerns the proper implementation ofsanctions. They are invoked on the premise that thedecisions taken by the United Nations will be respectedand that all will share the ensuing burden. Therefore the collateral effects of the sanctions on third States and especially the uneven burden they place oncountries neighbouring the targeted State  are issuesthat must be addressed. Moreover  we also should seeto it that the adverse effects of sanctions on innocentpeople  especially on children  women and the elderly are minimized.After the widespread economic setbacks of thepast few years  the healing process of the globaleconomy gathered momentum. Global integration hasbeen further fuelled by bold leaps in science andtechnology. However  there is no room forcomplacency. To ensure that the benefits of revitalizedgrowth are felt evenly on a global scale  continued andintensified efforts are needed at national andinternational levels.It is not only the countries that have been exposedto the negative effects of globalization that stand tolose as a result. Global inequality threatens to become asource of political and social instability. Theelimination of poverty should therefore remain ourparamount goal. To reach this goal  we must achievegood governance  transparency and participation. Wemust also build strong social safety nets. But these willnot yield the results being sought if we do not makeadequate provision for the education our people. Asphysical borders begin to fade  the minds trappedwithin national domains must also change and betransformed.We applaud the growing role of the UnitedNations in the economic and social sphere. With itsrole in breeding a culture of international cooperationand solidarity  a genuine culture of internationalcooperation and solidarity  the United Nations hasindeed been a source of inspiration for us all.In one respect we feel we possess most of theelements for a promising future  ranging fromincreased universal awareness of human dignity tostrides in science and technology. Yet  at the same time we are distressed to find ourselves plagued by war weapons of mass destruction  terrorism  racism xenophobia  poverty and many other evils  both old andnew. As the new millennium is ushered in  we mustembrace rationalism  empathy and human solidarity intackling our common problems. Only then can werelax  having fulfilled our responsibilities to the nextgeneration."
"167",7067,"TZA",55,2000,"Atthe outset  I should like to congratulate the Presidenton his well-deserved election to the presidency of thisMillennium Assembly. I also want to congratulate hispredecessor for his invaluable contribution and hisoutstanding leadership during the fifty-fourth GeneralAssembly. In the same vein  I should like to registermy delegation's appreciation to the Secretary-Generalfor the excellent manner in which he is conducting theaffairs of the Organization. Let me also take thisopportunity to express our delight in welcoming theRepublic of Tuvalu as the newest member of theUnited Nations family.Tanzania is gratified that the recently endedMillennium Summit addressed some of the mostpertinent issues and challenges facing the UnitedNations and its Members in the new millennium. Thoseissues include development and poverty eradication;the effects of globalization  including technologicaldisparities; conflict prevention  management andresolution; disarmament; and the HIV/AIDS pandemic malaria and tuberculosis. It was recognized that Africaand  particularly  the least developed countries suffermost and hence demand urgent remedial action by theinternational community.Poverty remains one of the areas of great concernin Africa. The number of poor people in our regionliving on less than one dollar a day is estimated to be300 million. That number represents more than40 per cent of Africa's total population. Indications arethat the number of poor people in the continent is8likely to increase as Africa's output continues to drop.There is therefore an urgent need for a comprehensivestrategy for Africa to address poverty eradication withall its ramifications. The strategy should include acompendium of measures aimed at capacity-building inthe development process  including social services. Theimplementation of such a far-reaching strategy forpoverty eradication would very much depend on theavailability of resources. Bearing in mind that in 2001the United Nations will convene a High-levelIntergovernmental Event on Financing forDevelopment  it is our hope that the issue of mobilizingresources for the development of Africa will bethoroughly addressed.Official development assistance continues to beparticularly critical in supporting development effortsin Africa and the least developed countries. It is sad tonote that flows of official development assistance havefallen to an all-time low of 0.2 per cent  far from theagreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross nationalproduct of developed countries. My delegationtherefore wishes to appeal to our development partnersto reverse the trend of declining resources and increasethe level of official development assistancecontributions.Many African countries are undertaking painfulreforms aimed at attracting foreign direct investment.However  foreign direct investment flows have beenminimal. Investors should feel encouraged to invest inAfrica because the competitive rate of return on foreigndirect investment stands at between 24 per cent and30 per cent. That rate is higher than those of alldeveloped countries  which stand at between16 per cent and 18 per cent. We therefore call onGovernments and relevant international organizationsto assist in sensitizing potential international investorsto the possibility of directing their investments toAfrica.The various debt relief initiatives pursued by theinternational community have been helpful  but notsufficient  in providing a meaningful solution to thedebt problem of the developing countries. In some ofthose countries  external debt service constitutes amajor drain on scarce resources  taking at least30 per cent of the national income. In that regard  wewelcome the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)Debt Initiative to support some of the poor countries intheir efforts to resolve the external debt problem. MyGovernment appreciates being one of the countrieswhich have attained eligibility under this scheme. Wecall upon the institutions concerned to speed up theprocess towards our reaching the completion point sothat we can fully benefit from HIPC relief.Commenting on the HIPC Initiative  myPresident  Mr. Benjamin William Mkapa  has had thisto say:“Tanzania welcomes the revisions made tothe HIPC Initiative. If implemented in full theywill provide additional debt relief  which in turnwill facilitate the war on poverty and willcontribute to sustainable growth and developmentif managed well. However  if growth is to besustained  adequate levels of external fundingmust complement our economic reform efforts.Debt relief under the HIPC Initiative should alsonot be a substitute for increased bilateral non-debt-creating aid  and neither should it befinanced through reallocation of committed aid.”Even acknowledging the importance of the HIPCinitiative  the burden of meeting debt service paymentswould remain heavy even after debt relief for most ofthe least developed countries. We therefore call uponthe donor community to increase HIPC debt relief andto consider additional relief measures  including debtcancellation  so that scarce resources will be releasedto cater for economic development and povertyeradication programmes.The development of the least developed countriesdepends on improvement of their capacity to producegoods and services. Improvement of terms of trade andmarket access for the goods of least developedcountries in the developed countries' markets wouldfurther contribute towards poverty eradication efforts.In that regard  we call upon developed countries toprovide unhindered market access for goods fromdeveloping countries  particularly from least developedcountries. In the same context  my delegation calls forspeedy implementation of the World TradeOrganization's Integrated Framework for Trade-relatedTechnical Assistance which will facilitate theintegration of least developed countries into the worldtrading system.The development process of developing countriesvery much depends on access to technology and on theendogenous capacity to develop it. We are encouragedthat the Millennium Summit reiterated the need toassist developing countries to leapfrog into new9technologies in order to close the existing technologygap between developed and developing countries especially least developed countries. It is our sincerehope that the Millennium Declaration will be translatedinto a concrete programme of action to assistdeveloping countries to develop the criticaltechnologies  including information technologies needed for their development. We therefore call uponour development partners and all relevant internationalinstitutions to facilitate the transfer of technology including environmentally sound technologies  onfavourable terms.My delegation believes that South-Southcooperation is an important means of realizing some ofthe objectives of economic development. Tanzaniafully supports the programme of action adopted lastApril in Havana  Cuba  at the South Summit.Tanzania recognizes and fully supports the role ofwomen in the development process. Here  theGovernment has adopted a number of specificmeasures aimed at enhancing the participation ofwomen in decision-making processes  and at bringingabout equal access to education and health  and accessto credit on a preferential basis. In the area ofrepresentation  for example  the Government hasincreased the minimum quota of womenparliamentarians from 15 per cent to 20 per cent. TheGovernment has also passed legislation thatcriminalizes discriminatory activities against women.Furthermore  the Land Act was revised in 1999 toenable women to own land  the major means ofproduction in Tanzania. Tanzania is firmly committed therefore  to implementing the Beijing Platform forAction. We therefore call on the internationalcommunity to support our efforts in this regard.Serious pandemics such as HIV/AIDS  malariaand tuberculosis are threatening the economic andsocial development of developing countries  especiallyAfrican and least developed countries. For example the scale of the HIV/AIDS pandemic has grown toalarming proportions in Africa. The Security Councilhas recognized this menace as constituting a securitythreat. Moreover  the Millennium Summit hasunderscored the urgency of adopting effective action tocombat the scourge. Tanzania urges the internationalcommunity to assist developing countries in thisendeavour  particularly in education and access toaffordable treatment.Disarmament  peace and security continue to becrucial to the aspirations of all humanity  and thereforethey constitute a critical challenge of the newmillennium. The existence of huge arsenals of nuclearweapons poses a major potential threat to world peaceand security. These weapons continue to represent athreat to the survival of mankind. Tanzania calls for thecomplete destruction and elimination of all nuclearweapons. The United Nations also needs to urgentlyaddress the problem of small arms and light weapons which fuel most of the ongoing conflicts in variousregions of the world. In this context  we stronglysupport the convening of the 2001 United NationsConference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms andLight Weapons in All Its Aspects.The Millennium Summit addressed extensivelythe conflict situations existing in some countries including those of Africa. The Summit reaffirmed theexistence of the intrinsic link between peace anddevelopment  which requires an integrated approach toconflict prevention  management and resolution. Whilesupporting United Nations peace efforts  we note withconcern that there has been a slow and an inadequateresponse to African conflicts from the United Nations.In Angola  it is with apprehension that we bearwitness to the continuing hostilities and the gravehumanitarian situation brought about by Jonas Savimbiand his organization  UNITA; they have blatantlyviolated the decisions of the Security Councilregarding the implementation of the Lusaka Protocol. Itis disturbing that Mr. Savimbi has been able to sustainhis insurgency by violating the sanctions imposedagainst UNITA by the Security Council. We call uponthe international community to continue its support tothe Government of Angola.On Burundi  my delegation is pleased to note thatafter protracted negotiations between the partiesinvolved in the Burundi conflict  the Burundi peace andreconciliation agreement was concluded in Arusha Tanzania on 28 August 2000. We welcome theagreement and commend the Facilitator  PresidentNelson Mandela  for his role in reconciling the parties.We also commend the regional leaders for their effortsin support of the Burundi peace process. Although asmall number of parties to the conflict did not sign theagreement  efforts were made to ensure that all of themwould sign it. As I speak here  most of the parties havenow signed. It is our hope that the parties will abide bythe terms of the agreement and afford the people of10Burundi the opportunity to realize their aspirations forpeace and development. We call upon the UnitedNations and the international community to extendsupport to the agreement.As for the Democratic Republic of the Congo  theLusaka Agreement remains the basis for the resolutionof the conflict in that country. It is unfortunate  though that there is an impasse in the implementation of theAgreement. One of the reasons for the existingsituation is the mistrust among the parties. The delay inthe deployment of the United Nations Mission in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo has created avacuum that has further contributed to the impasse.Tanzania supports Security Council resolution 1234(1999). We also urge the Security Council to deploy thepeacekeeping force in the Democratic Republic of theCongo as soon as possible.On Somalia  we welcome the agreement reachedin Djibouti on the formation of the Government of thatcountry. In this regard  we congratulate theGovernment of Djibouti for its constructive role in thereconciliation process.Concerning Western Sahara  Tanzania reiteratesits support for the right to self-determination of theSahrawi people and the effort of the United Nations toorganize and supervise an impartial  free and fairreferendum  in accordance with the Settlement Plan forWestern Sahara and the relevant Security Council andother United Nations resolutions. We urge the UnitedNations to conduct  as soon as possible  the referendumon the basis of the preparations that have so far beenmade. The lessons of East Timor should not be ignored.On the Middle East  Tanzania continues tosupport the cause of the Palestinian people. In thisregard  we welcome the ongoing peace process aimedat achieving a comprehensive  just and lasting peace inthat volatile region.There is a direct linkage between conflicts andthe incidence of refugees and internally displacedpersons. In this respect  Tanzania finds itself in thevery difficult situation of hosting more than 800 000refugees  most of whom are products of the crisis in theGreat Lakes region. This is a huge burden for a poorcountry like Tanzania. Besides  refugees pose manyproblems relating to security and environmentaldegradation. There is an urgent need for theinternational community to increase its support to therefugees  as well as to the refugee-hosting countries. Inthe same vein  we reiterate our call for internationalburden-sharing and responsibility in refugee situations.A definitive solution to the refugee situation evidentlylies in resolving conflicts so as to enable therepatriation of refugees to their countries of origin.One of the pressing reform issues in the UnitedNations is the reform of the Security Council. Amongthe significant changes of our time is the liberalizationand democratization of economic and politicalprocesses. The Security Council cannot persist in beingan exception. Its composition and powers must bear arelationship to the democratic ideals necessary for itscontinued relevance and legitimacy. It is our hope thatthe Council membership will be expanded in bothcategories and that such expansion should include bothdeveloped and developing countries.Furthermore  Tanzania believes that the capacityof the United Nations to effectively carry out itsmandate is contingent upon the willingness of allMember States to support it politically as well asfinancially. In this regard  we call upon the MemberStates to provide it with adequate resources on a timelyand predictable basis.Tanzania also welcomes the many reformproposals and measures that have been introduced toimprove working methods  both at the Secretariat andat intergovernmental levels. For that effort to succeed there has to be consensus among Member States on thebest method to manage change in the United Nations.In conclusion  allow me to observe that theMillennium Assembly  like the preceding Summit  is anact of partnership. We can only hope  therefore  that therenewed enthusiasm and the recommitment to theCharter of the United Nations will galvanize ourenergies and enable us to rise to and fulfil  the hopesand aspirations of the Organization and its peoples  asespoused in the Millennium Declaration."
"168",7110,"UGA",55,2000,"I should like to offer theapologies of my Minister  who was to have made thisstatement today. He has had to travel to Winnipeg where the future of some of our abducted children willbe discussed tomorrow.I bring to you  Mr. President  and all MemberStates of the United Nations fraternal greetings andbest wishes for the new millennium from theGovernment and people of Uganda. I also bring to you Sir  and through you to the fifty-fifth session thepersonal best wishes of the President of the Republic ofUganda  His Excellency Mr. Yoweri Kaguta Museveni.I should like  at the outset  Sir  to congratulateyou on your well-deserved and unanimous election topreside over this session of the General Assembly which follows in the footsteps of the historic andhighly successful Millennium Summit. Yourpredecessor  the Minister for Foreign Affairs ofNamibia  deserves our heartfelt thanks for successfullypresiding over so many special and regular sessionsduring his tenure as President of the General Assembly.May I also take this opportunity to pay a veryspecial tribute to our illustrious Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  for the exemplary work he hascontinued to perform on behalf of the Organization andthe peoples of the world. The Secretary-Generaldeserves special recognition by the United Nationsfamily for his tireless efforts to address the numerouschallenges that face the United Nations at the dawn ofthe new era.Uganda warmly welcomes the admission ofTuvalu as the 189th Member of the United Nations.For Uganda  events in Africa  and in particularinstability in the Great Lakes region  continue to be ofthe utmost concern. For this reason  I crave theAssembly's indulgence if I devote a portion of mystatement to those problems and challenges whichconfront us in the Great Lakes region.As the international community is fully aware the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congoposes a major threat to the stability of the Great Lakesregion and ultimately the entire African continent. Thatconflict has its origins in the massive violation ofhuman and democratic rights of the people of theregion during the long reign of dictators in a number ofcountries in the region. Evidence shows that whenpeople are oppressed  sooner or later they will rise and4take up arms against their oppressors. This is preciselywhat we are witnessing in the Great Lakes region.During the 1980s and 1990s a number ofdictatorships were overthrown  in spite of theirdetermined attempts to save their regimes by resortingto the most inhuman methods of clinging to power —namely  resort to genocide. This despicable weaponwas not only used in Rwanda in 1994  but has alsobeen used to a lesser extent in Uganda  Burundi and theformer Zaire. The instability we are witnessing today isthus caused by the continuing struggle of the peoplesof the region to proclaim their human and democraticrights.In Uganda the people's struggle for fundamentalchange ended in 1986  resulting in the establishment ofdemocracy  stability and economic progress which thepeople of Uganda have enjoyed over the past 14 years.Unfortunately  the instability and civil wars inneighbouring countries have continued to impactnegatively on our attempt to consolidate the results ofour victory. This has especially been the case whenremnants of followers of our former dictators haveattempted to form alliances with dictatorial regimes insome neighbouring countries to take advantage of thepower vacuum there and establish bases from which tolaunch desperate  but ultimately futile  attacks onUganda.As the Government of Uganda has stated before at various times it cooperated with a number ofprogressive forces in the region to help the people ofthe Democratic Republic of the Congo free themselvesfrom one of the longest and most oppressivedictatorships in the African continent — I refer to theMobutu dictatorship. In helping the people of theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  we were alsohoping to free ourselves from the menace ofdestabilization  which had become the official policy ofthe Mobutu regime. That is why in 1997 Uganda foundits troops in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.When a new regime came to power in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  we signed aprotocol of cooperation under which Uganda andCongolese security forces would cooperate to containthe menace caused by the armed groups organized bythe remnants of forces of Uganda's former dictatorsthat were operating from Congolese territory.Unfortunately  within a very short period  the newregime in the Democratic Republic of the Congo choseto turn its back on its former allies and form an alliancewith the very people who posed a threat to our security.Not only did this regime turn its back against itsexternal allies  it also turned its back on its internalallies  thus provoking a fresh round of civil war in thecountry within a year. The result was that a number ofAfrican countries that had been allies in the struggleagainst Mobutu now found themselves sucked into theconflict.Fortunately  these countries soon saw the folly ofarmed confrontation and chose to end the conflictthrough negotiations. The result was the LusakaCeasefire Agreement. This Agreement was a majorbreakthrough in the attempt to establish genuine peacein the region because it addressed the problems ofestablishing a democratic and accountable governmentin the Democratic Republic of the Congo and cateringfor the legitimate security concerns of neighbouringcountries. The Agreement still offers the best hope ofestablishing and maintaining peace in the region. Forthis reason  Uganda has worked hard to have thisAgreement implemented. On 8 April this year  Ugandahosted an important meeting of the Political Committeeestablished under the Agreement. At that meeting  adisengagement plan was adopted under which all thefighting forces in the Democratic Republic of theCongo would disengage under the supervision of theUnited Nations Organization Mission (MONUC).Unfortunately  it has not been possible to effectthe disengagement of forces in accordance with thestipulated calendar because one of the signatories namely  the Government of the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo  has done everything possible to block theimplementation of this disengagement plan  as well asseveral other aspects of the Lusaka Agreement. On 14August this year  an important summit of ninecountries in the region plus the leaders of all the rebelgroups fighting against the Government of theDemocratic Republic of the Congo took place inLusaka to identify the obstacles to implementation ofthe Ceasefire Agreement. Their conclusion was that theGovernment of the Democratic Republic of the Congowas largely to blame for the current impasse. Theprincipal ways in which the Congolese Government hasprevented the implementation of the ceasefire arerefusal to participate in the national dialogue  rejectionof a distinguished and eminent facilitator who wasagreed upon as a result of wide consultations and byconsensus  restriction of the freedom of movement of5MONUC peace observers  refusal to cooperate with theJoint Military Commission and continued violations ofthe ceasefire.The leaders of the region have expressed theirstrong concern at the obstructions created by theDemocratic Republic of the Congo to theimplementation of the Ceasefire Agreement. If theDemocratic Republic of the Congo does not heed thecalls of regional leaders  there is a serious risk that theregion could become embroiled in another large-scalewar. We therefore appeal to the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo Government to reconsider its position andchoose the path of dialogue  with both its internal andexternal opponents  and to abandon the path of militaryconfrontation.Uganda wishes to reaffirm its full commitment tothe Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement  which offers the bestopportunity for bringing this conflict to an end. Ugandapledges its full support for all efforts aimed at endingthe conflict and appeals to the international communityto give moral and material backing to the Lusaka peaceprocess.Uganda believes that the problems of Burundi areessentially political and internal. As Chairman of theregional peace initiative on Burundi  PresidentMuseveni of Uganda has worked tirelessly in seeking asolution to the problem. In this capacity  he hasconvened and chaired many regional summits. Webelieve that a formula that creates democracy withsecurity for all the people of Burundi is possible.We wish to place on record our appreciation tothe facilitator of the Burundi peace process  formerPresident Nelson Mandela  and his predecessor  the lateMwalimu Julius Nyerere  for their untiring efforts inworking towards a peaceful solution to the Burundiproblem.Uganda welcomes the agreement signed on 28August in Arusha by the parties to the Burundi peaceprocess. We regret  however  that a few of the partiesdid not sign the agreement. Uganda would like toappeal to them to sign the agreement as soon aspossible for the sake of the future of the people ofBurundi and the Great Lakes region. We call upon theUnited Nations and the international community toprovide the necessary support and resources to enablethe agreement to be successfully implemented.Uganda is committed to the goal of general andcomplete disarmament endorsed by the United Nationsat the first special session on disarmament  way back in1978. It is against this background that we note withconcern the failure of the Disarmament Commission toreach an agreement on the convening of the fourthspecial session devoted to disarmament. The holding ofthat conference is critical for addressing importantissues related to disarmament. It is a matter of deepregret that the Conference on Disarmament has failedto agree on an agenda for two years in a row.Uganda also attaches great importance to theOttawa Convention on anti-personnel land mines. Wesupported the resolution on illicit trafficking in smallarms last year because the proliferation and use ofsmall arms and light weapons remains a major problemin our region. Uganda actively participated in regionalinitiatives on this matter  which resulted in theadoption of the Nairobi Declaration. We look forwardto the international conference on the problem of smallarms in all its aspects  scheduled to take place in July2001.The world has entered the twenty-first centurywith globalization as the most pervasive economicforce to reckon with. Regrettably  the expected benefitsaccruing from the process are not guaranteed for allcountries. For some  it has opened opportunities forrapid growth and development through increased tradeand advances in technology. For others  the process hasled to increasing income disparity and marginalizationin the global economy. The biggest challenge facing usat the dawn of this century  therefore  is to muster thenecessary political will to act together and create anenabling environment for the successful integration ofthe poorer countries into the global economy. Ugandais of the view that the issue of globalization can andshould be seriously addressed multilaterally by theUnited Nations and by other internationalorganizations. We are confident that with thecommitment and goodwill of the major trading nations the establishment of a rule-based multilateral tradingsystem that has been institutionalized in the WorldTrade Organization will facilitate the integration ofdeveloping countries into the global trading system.The challenge of ridding the world of the scourgeof abject poverty deserves more attention now thanever before because  as more of the world's populationis now enjoying better living standards  the situation ofmany others in the developing countries  especially the6least developed countries  is deteriorating rapidly anddangerously. A larger percentage of the world'spopulation lives on less than a dollar a day today thandid a decade ago. The Secretary-General's reportreveals that people living in sub-Saharan Africa arealmost as poor today as they were 20 years ago. This isan extremely sad commentary on the state ofdevelopment cooperation. Urgent measures should beundertaken to arrest this deterioration of the livingconditions of the people in the developing countries.In Uganda we believe that significant reductionsin poverty can be achieved through sustained andbroad-based income growth. We further believe thatthis can be effectively done through modernization ofthe agricultural sector  which dominates the economyand employs the majority of our population. That iswhy in the past two years we have been working todevelop a comprehensive set of policies for themodernization of agriculture  as part of theGovernment's broader strategy for poverty eradication.Uganda welcomes and fully endorses the Secretary-General's recommendations on specific actions thatneed to be taken both nationally and at the internationallevel to reduce the number of people living in extremepoverty.The past decade has witnessed an unabateddeterioration in the socio-economic conditions of theleast developed countries. A quick review of progressin the implementation of the Programme of Action forthe Least Developed Countries for the 1990s will showthat there have been more setbacks than progress.While the least developed countries have undertakenfar-reaching and sometimes painful measures ofadjustment and reform  the actions by the internationalcommunity have fallen short of their commitments toprovide adequate external support to complement theirefforts. As a result  the least developed countriescontinue to suffer from the lack of supportive externalresources for development  owing to a steady decline inthe flow of official development assistance.While it is true that foreign direct investmentflows have increased significantly in the past decade the least developed countries are not yet equipped toattract such investment to a significant extent. Highlevels of external debt have negatively affected theireconomies  and despite decades of liberalization mostindustrialized countries still maintain protectionistmeasures in their markets  especially for agriculturalproducts and textiles — the two sectors in whichdeveloping countries have a recognized comparativeadvantage. All these factors have had the combinedeffect of stunting further the economic and socialprospects of the least developed countries.In this regard  Uganda strongly supports theSecretary-General in urging the industrialized countriesto consider granting duty-free and quota-free access toexports from the least developed countries  as ademonstration of their commitment to the integrationof the least developed countries into the global tradingsystem. My delegation also urges the GeneralAssembly to adopt the recommendations of the tenthsession of the United Nations Conference on Trade andDevelopment contained in the Bangkok Consensus andPlan of Action for least developed countries. We callupon the leading industrialized countries to live up totheir commitments in the context of the agreement theyreached in 1999 at the Cologne G-8 Summit. We alsocall for stronger support for relevant United Nationsbodies such as the United Nations Conference on Tradeand Development (UNCTAD) to enable effectiveimplementation of their mandates to assist the leastdeveloped countries.With specific reference to the African continent where 33 of the 48 least developed countries are found the socio-economic situation is much more precariousdespite many efforts by many African countriesindividually and collectively to lay solid foundationsfor development. The difficulty in achieving positiveresults in Africa's development has been furthercomplicated by the severity of Africa's AIDS crisis.We call upon the international community to lendsupport to Africa's own efforts to realize the objectiveof the African renaissance  which aims to place thecontinent at the forefront of human development andprogress. The international community should supportthe efforts of African countries by fulfillingcommitments made in the context of the UnitedNations New Agenda for Development of Africa in the1990s. These commitments include the reduction ofAfrican debt  adequate resource flows  provision ofgreater market access and assistance in diversificationand capacity-building. In this connection  Ugandasupports the proposals made by the Secretary-Generalin his report to this session.I reiterate Uganda's commitment to uphold thevalues and principles enshrined in the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights. I pledge our7Government's continued adherence to internationalhuman rights Conventions and norms.In pursuit of an international human rightsregime  it is imperative that we establish effectiveinstitutions and mechanisms for this purpose. Ugandawill continue to support and work towards theestablishment of a strong International Criminal Court.Of particular concern to us is the deterrence andpunishment of the crime of genocide  which remains acontinuing threat in our region.At the national level  in a bid to implement thefundamental rights guaranteed by our Constitution Ugandans voted on 29 June 2000 in a referendum for apolitical system of their choice. I take this opportunityto thank the international community for its support forthe success of the referendum exercise. I am happy toreport that the referendum was declared free and fairby both local and international observers. Thisexperience convinces us that the referendum proposedfor Western Sahara should be conducted as soon aspossible. It offers the best alternative to the possibilityof continued armed conflict.In our struggle to end internal conflict Parliament enacted the Amnesty Act 2000. Under thatAct  an Amnesty Commission has now beenestablished and is operational. The mandate of theCommission is to monitor programmes ofdemobilization  reintegration and resettlement ofreturnees  coordinate a programme of sensitization ofthe general public on the amnesty law  consider andpromote appropriate reconciliation mechanisms in theaffected areas and promote dialogue and reconciliationin the spirit of the Amnesty Act. There is a programmeof reintegration into society  which involves acquisitionof skills and a fund to promote self-employment. It isour hope that this process will bring to an end internalconflict and all human rights violations associated withconflict situations.In closing  Uganda believes that as we enter thenew century the United Nations should be reformed equipped and provided with the necessary resources toimplement effectively and efficiently the mandates theGeneral Assembly and other principal organs of theOrganization have entrusted to it. In this connection Uganda hopes that the long-drawn-out negotiations onthe reform of the Security Council will be finalized atthe current session of the General Assembly. We arecommitted to the position of the Non-AlignedMovement and the Organization of African Unity(OAU) on this matter  and would support Japan andGermany as permanent members of an expandedSecurity Council  as well as one permanent membereach from Africa  Asia and Latin America."
"169",7157,"UKR",55,2000,"At the outset  allow meto congratulate you  Sir  on your assumption of thepresidency of the General Assembly at the currentsession and to wish you every success in dischargingyour duties.I would also like to pay full tribute to yourpredecessor  Minister Gurirab  whose vast diplomaticexperience and able guidance throughout the fifty-fourth session greatly contributed to its success and tothe ultimate triumph of the Millennium Summit.It has been only 10 days since the historic eventof the Millennium Summit secured an unprecedentedquorum of the world's leaders to discuss at the highestlevel the role and place of the United Nations in thesystem of international relations in the new era. Byadopting the Millennium Declaration  the internationalcommunity clearly demonstrated its support for thefundamental purposes and principles of the UnitedNations Charter  which continue to be the basis ofinternational law and the main instrument that governsinternational relations.Ukraine's active participation in the work of theMillennium Summit and in the Security CouncilSummit  which was held on the initiative of the6President of Ukraine  testifies to the special importancethat my country attaches to the activities of thisuniversal Organization.Like most other States — and the MillenniumSummit unequivocally reconfirmed this — Ukrainedenounces the threat or use of force as a means ofsolving inter-State problems. We strongly believe thatonly the United Nations possesses both the relevantpowers and the wide range of tools and mechanisms toaddress today's major global problems. These problemsare the same today as they were several decades ago:war  poverty  inequality in distribution of resources repression and discrimination.Having gathered on 7 September at the level ofheads of State and Government for the second time inUnited Nations history  the Security Council reaffirmedits readiness to bear an essential share of responsibilityfor building a world free of fear  poverty and injustice.We consider the most important achievement ofthe Security Council Summit to have been thecommitment  reaffirmed at the highest level  toensuring the effective functioning of the system ofcollective security and to enhancing the efficiency ofavailable mechanisms for preserving peace and  inparticular  for conducting peacekeeping operations. Webelieve that the United Nations will not be ableadequately to respond to the challenges to peace andsecurity in the twenty-first century unless itspeacekeeping potential is enhanced. Ukraine welcomesthe report of the Panel on United Nations PeaceOperations  chaired by Ambassador Brahimi. Mycountry finds most of its recommendations substantialand far-reaching and calls for their speedyimplementation.Ukraine has always considered United Nationspeacekeeping to be one of the most important raisonsd'etre of this Organization  which is called upon “tosave succeeding generations from the scourge of war”.That is precisely why since 1992 more than 12 000representatives of Ukraine have participated in 20United Nations peacekeeping operations and missions.Since the beginning of this year  Ukraine  fullyrecognizing its additional responsibility formaintaining international peace as a member of theSecurity Council  has increased twentyfold itscontribution to peacekeeping operations.In the course of the past eight months alone Ukraine has deployed a contingent of 650 troops withthe United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon(UNIFIL). We have also sent a group of militaryobservers to the United Nations Organization Missionin the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) to Ethiopia and Eritrea  and have sent a group ofcivilian police to the United Nations TransitionalAdministration in East Timor (UNTAET). Thedeployment of a special Ukrainian police unit of 115servicemen with the United Nations police force inKosovo is being completed this week. Our militarycontingent earmarked for the United Nations operationin the Democratic Republic of the Congo stands in fulloperational readiness.Regrettably  it is common knowledge that humanhistory can be called a chronicle of continuous warsand conflicts. I hope that at the end of the secondmillennium  having learned from its tragic past humankind has finally grasped the simple truth — thatit is necessary to fight the fires of wars long beforethey have erupted  because even the costliest peace ismuch better than the cheapest war. This leads me toemphasize the importance of the most expeditious andeffective implementation of the proposal put forwardby the President of Ukraine at the Millennium Summitand at the Security Council Summit. He spoke infavour of developing a comprehensive United Nationsconflict prevention strategy  based on the large-scaleuse of preventive diplomacy and peace-building.Ukrainian experts stand ready for this work. I am gladto note that almost all the leaders who addressed theMillennium Summit recognized preventive action as apriority for the United Nations in maintaining peace.In our view  the concept of regional centres onconflict prevention can become a practical step towardsdeveloping a relevant United Nations strategy. In thiscontext  Ukraine's recent proposal to establish aregional centre for ethnic studies in Kyiv  under theauspices of the Organization for Security andCooperation in Europe (OSCE)  deserves properattention. We think that the activities of such a centre authorized to monitor current developments in thesphere of inter-ethnic relations in the OSCE region anddirected at the timely detection of dangerous separatisttendencies  will be conducive to a further elaborationof the United Nations preventive strategy incooperation with the OSCE.My country is keenly following the process ofconflict settlement in the neighbouring Balkans  thetroublesome region of Europe. While developments in7Bosnia give us sufficient grounds for optimism aboutthe future of its peoples  the situation in Kosovo stillcauses us serious concern. We are confident that apeaceful settlement in Kosovo has to be pursued instrict compliance with Security Council resolution1244 (1999)  with full respect for the sovereignty andterritorial integrity of the Federal Republic ofYugoslavia. In our view  it is impossible to resolve thisproblem without determining the future status ofKosovo following negotiations between the FederalRepublic of Yugoslavia and the authorizedrepresentatives of the province.Ukraine is determined to intensify efforts aimedat promoting the final peaceful settlement of the so-called “frozen” conflicts in the post-Soviet territories particularly in Abkhazia  Georgia; Nagorny Karabakh Azerbaijan; and Transdniestria  Moldova. As a memberof the group of Friends of the Secretary-General  whichis promoting a peaceful settlement of the almostdecade-long Georgian-Abkhaz conflict  Ukraine cannotbut be concerned about the lack of real progresstowards peace in the region. I once again confirm theinvitation by President Kuchma to host in Yalta thenext round of negotiations between the Georgian andAbkhaz sides aimed at confidence-building.President Kuchma has also presented a feasibleplan for the settlement of the Transdniestria conflict based on the principle of “acquired status” acceptableto all conflicting parties. Ukraine  together with theOSCE  is currently examining the possibility ofreorganizing the peacekeeping mission in the region which will be made up of peacekeeping contingentsfrom Ukraine  Russia and other OSCE members. Wevery much hope that in the long run these initiativeswill reinvigorate the process of resolving the conflict.The credibility of the United Nations will alwaysbe measured by its ability to provide an adequateresponse to threats to peace and security in everyregion of the world. Today this principle should beupheld by giving special attention to the problems ofthe African continent. The untold sufferings of thepeoples of Africa  resulting from both intra-State andinter-State conflicts  are unlike those in any other partof the globe.Ukraine is determined to make a practicalcontribution to United Nations peace efforts aimed atresolving conflicts in Africa. This determination isreinforced by our aspiration to expand trade andeconomic cooperation with our African partners. Letme repeat the words of the President of Ukraine at theSecurity Council Summit:“Ukraine looks forward to a century of Africanrenaissance and stands ready to hasten itsarrival.” (S/PV.4194  p. 13)I would like to underline that  in resolvingconflicts in Africa the international community has noalternative but to promote the need for strict adherenceto the principles of sovereignty  political independenceand territorial integrity of the countries of the region.This has to be particularly emphasized in relation to theconflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  themost dangerous challenge to peace at the turn of thecentury. Ukraine calls on all parties to the LusakaAgreement to comply fully with the relevant SecurityCouncil resolutions and to implement their owncommitments.The recent events in Sierra Leone have become aserious test for our Organization. They prove the urgentneed to consolidate international efforts  with a view tostrengthening the effectiveness of United Nationspeacekeeping.I reiterate our position on the need to continueenhancing the sanctions regime against Angola's rebelgroup  UNITA. We are convinced that reducingUNITA's ability to wage war is an essentialprerequisite for restoring peace in Angola. It shouldalso be borne in mind that the sanctions have to beaccompanied by greater international efforts to resolvethis long-lasting conflict.We note with optimism the latest developments inthe process of settlement in Somalia. This long-suffering nation is painfully but steadily overcomingthe obstacles in its path to peace and stability.Over the past year an important step forward wastaken in advancing one of the integral parts of theMiddle East peace process — its Israeli-Lebanesecomponent. The withdrawal of Israeli troops fromsouthern Lebanon in compliance with Security Councilresolution 425 (1978) has created new conditions forfurther progress in the whole process. Ukrainesincerely hopes that Israel and Syria will also be ableto achieve a breakthrough in their stalled negotiationprocess in the near future  and calls upon the parties toresume the dialogue as soon as possible.8We are following closely the process of solvingthe core issue of the Middle East problem — thequestion of Palestine. It is our firm belief that thepolitical wisdom and farsightedness of the Israelis andPalestinians will eventually help them to reach amutually acceptable compromise. We welcome the10 September decision by the Palestinian CentralCouncil to postpone the date of proclamation of theState of Palestine. Ukraine hopes that  followingstrenuous efforts on both sides  the Palestinian peoplewill finally exercise their right to self-determinationand to their own statehood.The promotion of disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation are among the crucial issues before theUnited Nations and the whole international communityat the turn of the century. We are convinced that thoseprocesses should go along with the overallimprovement of the international situation in otherspheres  the creation and practical implementation ofuniversal security guarantees  unconditional adherenceby States and international organizations to the normsand basic principles of international law and theconsolidation of an atmosphere of mutual trust.As a country which has made outstandingcontributions to the process of practical nucleardisarmament  Ukraine fully shares the concern that theattention of the international community to this issuehas substantially decreased. We believe that nucleardisarmament and non-proliferation are the cornerstonesof international security and a means of averting aglobal conflict. In our view  achieving the universalityof the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and theComprehensive Test-Ban Treaty is the best way toprevent nuclear proliferation and to ensure theelimination of nuclear weapons. It is the nuclear Statesthat should be in the vanguard of this process.The problem of illegal arms trafficking  whichhas acquired a global dimension  also requires auniversal approach to its solution. The key role of theUnited Nations is indispensable in consolidating theinternational efforts to fight this evil.Turning now to the problem of the SecurityCouncil-imposed sanctions  I would like to reaffirm theposition of my country on this issue. Sanctions weredesigned as a powerful tool to ensure theimplementation of the Council's decisions. However they were eventually turned into ineffective andsometimes even harmful instruments. It is thereforeabsolutely necessary to develop a clear and coherentmethodology for the imposition and lifting of sanctionsthat takes into consideration the concerns of innocentcivilian populations and the interests of third countries.Ukraine supports the recent Security Councilpractice of defining time limits of sanctions at the stageof their imposition. We believe that it is of primaryimportance to develop objective criteria andmechanisms for assessing the effectiveness of sanctionsand their impact — including on the target State. Wealso support the immediate lifting of sanctions whenthere are sufficient grounds to believe that they haveserved their purpose. This is indeed the case as far asthe sanctions against Libya are concerned  where theSecurity Council should move  as soon as possible  tothe next stage and take a long-overdue action.Among the major challenges of the new century the problem of HIV/AIDS occupies a special place.AIDS has become an epidemic of global proportionswith enormous human and social ramifications that gofar beyond the province of health alone. The time hascome for the United Nations to elaborate acomprehensive agenda for action against thispandemic. Aware of the magnitude of this problem  thedelegation of Ukraine  together with other sponsors haspromoted the convening  as a matter of urgency  of aspecial session of the General Assembly on thatquestion. We are encouraged by the wide support forthis idea and look forward to further work towards itsrealization.We are convinced that the multilateral forms ofinternational cooperation have played and will continueto play a decisive role in the attainment of the goals ofsustainable development. We support the reform effortsof the Administrator of the United NationsDevelopment Programme (UNDP) for improving thesituation in the field of mobilization of resources andenhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of its work.During the difficult period of economictransition  the assistance to Ukraine by UNDP plays animportant role by streamlining the efforts of variousinternational partners. It also helps to alleviate thecomplex problems related to the elimination of theChernobyl disaster's consequences and thedecommissioning of the Chernobyl nuclear powerplant.I would like to take this opportunity to expressour gratitude to the countries participating in the July9donors' conference in Berlin  which pledged more than$320 million of additional funding for thetransformation of the shelter facility into anenvironmentally safe system. Almost $50 million stillneeds to be raised to reach the amount required  and wecount on continuing international assistance in thisregard. I believe this could be effectuated within theframework of the United Nations Chernobylprogramme. Let me underline that these funds will beaimed mainly at the implementation of realisticobjectives  specifically the decommissioning andeventual closing down of the Chernobyl nuclear powerplant by 15 December 2000  a decision that wasreconfirmed by the President of Ukraine at theMillennium Summit.We also hope that consideration at the currentsession of the General Assembly of the item relating tothe integration of the countries with economies intransition into the world economic system will make itpossible to elaborate a common strategy to solvespecific problems of these countries.In this context  we attach great importance to theaccession of Ukraine to the World Trade Organization.International economic cooperation at the regionallevel is also of significance for Ukraine. I mean  inparticular  the development of our relations with theEuropean Union and interaction within the frameworkof the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Organizationand the Georgia  Ukraine  Uzbekistan  Azerbaijan andRepublic of Moldova (GUUAM) group.Fulfilling the concept of “human rights for all” inthe next century is a task of global dimension. That iswhy strengthening and improving the internationalmonitoring of human rights violations becomesparticularly acute today. At the same time  we remainconvinced that the use of force cannot be considered anadequate means of ensuring respect for human rights.I wish to emphasize that adherence to andprotection of human rights became the key policyprinciple of my country. Ukraine has signed andratified all basic international documents in the field ofhuman rights and put in place at the national leveleffective mechanisms for their implementation. Thisyear Ukraine adopted a decision to abolish capitalpunishment.The time that has passed since the historic RomeConference clearly reaffirmed the epoch-makingsignificance of the document it adopted. We considerthe International Criminal Court the only viabledemocratic mechanism of a universal character toenforce compliance with and respect for internationalhumanitarian law.I would like to join previous speakers inexpressing our great hopes for the continuing role ofthe United Nations in bringing solutions to globalproblems. Given the complexity and themultidimensional nature of this task  our Organizationneeds to stand on a solid financial footing. We hopethat this session will enable us to speed up the processof reforming and improving the mechanisms of theapportionment of the United Nations expenses on thebasis of objective economic criteria. Therefore  theprocess of United Nations reform  initiated three yearsago  should get additional impetus.There is also a need to reactivate the effortsaimed at Security Council reform  which is the keyelement within the process of renewing the UnitedNations. This was rightly emphasized in the statementsof many world leaders at the Millennium Summit.The absence of substantive progress on this issuelimits the capacities of the Council as the majorinstrument of collective security. I would like toreiterate the position of Ukraine that the SecurityCouncil's comprehensive reform should be based onthe norms and principles of the United Nations Charter.In our view  increased representation in the SecurityCouncil for all regional groups should remain anessential principle. The interests of both developed anddeveloping countries have to be taken into account.Ukraine believes that the necessary balance within anexpanded Security Council can be achieved through anincrease in both categories of its members.By pursuing the path of strengthening the UnitedNations and building up its institutions on democraticfoundations  the international community reinforces itsown capacity to meet the challenges of the time and tocreate a climate of justice in international relations andan atmosphere of mutual respect between States peoples and civilizations.In the course of the historic Millennium Summit the international community  enriched by thisOrganization's half-century of experience  outlined theroad map to be followed by mankind in the twenty-firstcentury. Only by intensifying concerted and resoluteefforts to attain our determined goals will we realize10the ideals of the Charter of the United Nations. Afterall  this is the only raison d'être for our Organization."
"170",7204,"URY",55,2000,"Allowme to begin by thanking the Minister for ForeignAffairs of Namibia  Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  for hiswork as President of the fifty-fourth session of theGeneral Assembly  during which he continued andconcluded the preparation process of the recentMillennium Summit  initiated during the precedingsession.Likewise  I extend to the President of theAssembly at the fifty-fifth session  Mr. Harri Holkeri former Prime Minister of Finland  our congratulationsand best wishes for the success of his tenure.We also extend a fraternal welcome to Tuvalu asa new Member of the United Nations.30A little over a week ago the United Nations heldits Millennium Summit. To be more precise  we heldour Millennium Summit. The work of the Secretary-General and of the Member States deserves our praise for the result of their efforts was wholly positive. Weshould all congratulate ourselves on that verysuccessful work  but the task assigned to us by theSummit is now in our hands. It should begin with anassessment and careful evaluation of agreements disagreements and priorities.Above all  we should pay special attention to thestatements made by our heads of State andGovernment  as well as to the oral summary reports byeach of the Presidents of the four round tables. Takenas a whole  this constitutes rich background material onwhich we could  and should  work. One could say thatthe General Assembly  as a universal and independentbody  has been entrusted with a mandate by the highestpolitical leaders of the Member States. Interpreting andcarrying out that mandate is now the main objective ofour work in the General Assembly.Of course  the Secretary-General's report(A/54/2000)  known by the opening words of its title “We the peoples”  is an essential contribution  widelyappreciated at this time of putting the Organization inperspective. For that reason  the Secretary-Generaldeserves our sincere acknowledgement.We can therefore say that never before have wehad more authoritative or exact guidelines. As theSecretary-General said in his opening statement  theresponsibility for putting those directives into practiceis in our hands; in other words  in the non-exclusiveframework of the General Assembly.From the very start of our renewed task we musttry to identify some central ideas that reflect a generalconsensus on our point of departure  whileacknowledging that neither the Summit nor any similarUnited Nations meetings will be able to make anyarbitrary changes to the items on the world's agenda oralone bring about the alterations that practically all ofus view as necessary and inevitable.It is therefore a matter of using the MillenniumSummit as a launching platform for the achievement ofthe common objectives of the international community whose main quality should be to reflect the basic rightsand interests of all its members. We should  then  be ascareful in identifying those goals as we are in selectingthe procedures and determining the time required toachieve them. In any case  there are some realities thatwe cannot  and should not  evade.The first is the acknowledgement that the so-called globalization or universalization phenomenonconstitutes the inescapable environment to which thehuman family should adapt  not from a stance ofconfrontation or resigned acceptance  but in order to bean active part of it. By living within the framework ofglobalization we will be in a position to direct andchannel it  accepting its intrinsic values in its scientificand technological dimension  while conferring upon itthe necessary inspiration and political will to control itsnegative effects on societies that lack the necessaryresources to be part of globalization and to benefitfrom it.It has been said here at the Assembly that weshould attempt to make it possible for all States toclimb aboard the globalization train. That goal shouldmotivate our individual actions and our cooperationefforts in the immediate future.As was repeatedly emphasized during theSummit  United Nations action of the kind I havedescribed would have an encouraging and positiveeffect  especially since no other international institutionhas undertaken that task. Given the universal and all-inclusive nature of globalization  it is appropriate toconsider what action the United Nations could takefrom the perspective of evolution and change of theinternational system in its three principal areas: first the institutional political system — the Organizationitself and its powers; secondly  the global financialsystem established by the Bretton Woods Agreements;and  finally  the organization of international tradewithin the framework of the World Trade Organization(WTO).With regard to the first  it must be admitted thatin the process of reform of the Security Council  towhich we have devoted so much effort  no significantprogress has been registered recently. It would appearthat the international community has not yetsufficiently assimilated its will to change at theinstitutional level. That admission does not take awayfrom the fact that the reform of the Council is apending matter and one which  as the round tablereports indicated  received particular attention from theheads of State and Government at the MillenniumSummit.31It seems to us that on this matter we have reacheda paradoxical situation. On the one hand  there ispractically a consensus on the need to reform theCouncil so that it can — on the basis of certainprinciples held very dear by the internationalcommunity — more adequately reflect current reality being made more democratic in its spirit  morerepresentative in its structure and more transparent inits functioning. On the other hand  however  somebelieve that the formula proposed to achieve the goalof expanding the Council — an increase in bothpermanent and non-permanent members — disregardsthe very principles that we seek to implement. We havethus responded to the need felt by all for reform of theCouncil  in order to make it more representative anddemocratic  with formulas that do not yet appear toreflect the requisite universal spirit of reform.That is why we believe that  while we continueour efforts to reorganize the Security Council  we mustalso explore alternative solutions avoiding theapproaches — perhaps too simplistic — adopted so far which have not made progress possible  even aftereight years of intensive negotiations. New approachesand ideas are needed in the reform of the Council morethan in any other problem.Peacekeeping and international security continuesto be a core issue giving the United Nations its specificcharacter and  to a certain degree  its reason for being.The Organization's peacekeeping and internationalsecurity mechanisms  the limits within which they canoperate and their modalities have been on our agendasince the founding of the United Nations. Theycontinue to require our attention  because problems ofpeace and international security manifest themselves invarying and sometimes unexpected ways as the worldpolitical situation evolves.The United Nations is now confronted with theworrisome problem of how to achieve its peacekeepinggoals with limited resources and inadequatemechanisms. The report on peace operations preparedby a group of experts  known as the Brahimi report anddrafted at the request of the Secretary-General  willundoubtedly help us find a way to overcome thedifficulties now facing the Organization in this area.Uruguay  since 1952 a traditional contributor topeacekeeping operations  is carefully considering therecommendations contained in the Brahimi report many of which we deem worthy of our support.In any event  we warmly welcome the initiativesaimed at a more in-depth consideration of what hasbeen termed “humanitarian intervention”. We hope thata detailed and objective examination of this concept bythe Organization will enable us to grasp its true scopeand implications and to find ways of integrating itharmoniously into the international legal order  withoutany kind of distortion.The financing of peacekeeping operationsrequires the prudent management of existing resourcesand  as with the regular budget  that all Member Statesfulfil their financial obligations to the Organization without conditions. Likewise  the institutionalization ofthe current scale of assessments is vital  perhaps with afew small changes that would not create problems fordeveloping or least developed countries and that wouldensure that States shoulder their responsibilityaccording to their real capacity to pay.This is also our position on the regular budget.We cannot accept that  in determining the scale ofassessments  simplistic formulas should be used thatare based only on isolated economic indicators such asper capita income  which do not reflect the realeconomic situation of the country and of its population.We cannot overemphasize the link between thequestion of disarmament and that of developmentfinancing. The fact that the majority of violent conflictsoccur in the developing sector of the world  in whichthere are often too many weapons and too few schools remains a shameful paradox. We must continue to worktowards disarmament. That is why my country Uruguay  supports the convening of the United NationsConference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms andLight Weapons in All Its Aspects  set to take place nextyear.Uruguay also supports the efforts of the “NewAgenda” countries towards the elimination of nuclearweapons and encourages the ratification of theComprehensive Nuclear- Test-Ban Treaty.As concerns the international financial system —the International Monetary Fund and the WorldBank — and its handling of the recent  recurrent crisissituations in the world  shortcomings were noted in itsmethods of operation. In particular  its failure toanticipate those crises has made clear the need toupdate and reform the system directly responsible forensuring global economic governance. In this effort toreorganize the financial institutions and to coordinate32their activities with those of the United Nations and itsagencies  we should also consider the commonaspiration of the majority of the members of theinternational community to democratize the decision-making processes in those organizations. The closeconnection between the decisions by the World Bankand the International Monetary Fund  and the socialand economic realities of countries  more than justifiesthis aspiration.Inequality  poverty and debt in the developingworld are problems that have been  and continue to be emphasized in the debates of the MillenniumAssembly. These problems require not only ongoingprogrammes and actions but  above all  a basic sense ofsolidarity  which does not always characterize ourcooperation efforts.In the same vein  two noteworthy ideas were putforward during the Summit that we believe should beconsidered  because they could offer some guidance inefficiently addressing economic issues. The first is theidea of creating a development council that is neitherdependent nor subordinate and that has the authority totake the decisions necessary to adjust and directcomplex international financial flows  since the trendsand developments in that respect affect the economiesof all States.The second is related to international trade. Inthis regard  the international community is firmlyconvinced that international trade must be madeincreasingly open and free. The President of Uruguay Mr. Jorge Batlle Ibáñez  in his address to the Summitand in the relevant round table  emphasized theindivisible nature of freedom  as a whole that cannot beseparated from free trade.As trade is a natural and traditional method ofcommunication among peoples  Member States mustnot impose protectionist barriers to its free flow  whichwould delay development and therefore affect the well-being of peoples. This could also lead to serious socialproblems  which in many cases could spiral out ofcontrol. In this way  obstacles to trade  discriminatorytrade policies and protectionism could become factorsof political instability at the domestic and internationallevels. This is the position of Uruguay within theSouthern Common Market (MERCOSUR)  in therelationship between MERCOSUR and the AndeanCommunity  in the Free Trade Area of the Americasand in the World Trade Organization (WTO).The strong argument to that effect put forward atthe Summit must not be disregarded by those MemberStates that singly or together selectively raiseprotectionist barriers in order selfishly to defend theirown production and participation in the market denying others what President Batlle has called“our right to create and produce and our right tooffer and sell what is produced”.In this regard  I cannot but welcome the initiativeof the Government of Italy  announced by its PrimeMinister during the Summit  to insist  withininternational organisms — including within the Groupof 8 — on the need for the developed countries to opentheir markets to the least developed countries byabolishing quotas and tariffs.Nor can the WTO cannot turn a deaf ear to thiscall. Although it does not play a major role in globalfinancial governance  its regulations affect trade in itsbroadest sense  and it still counts among itsresponsibilities  set out at the Uruguay Round and inthe Marrakesh agreements  the regulation of trade inagricultural products  which affects many of ourcountries  particularly those of Latin America andAfrica.Today no one could doubt the role of the UnitedNations in the gradual process of achieving equality inthe world. But the United Nations does not bear soleresponsibility in this respect; the Member States andGovernments do as well.A solid and hopeful future for the internationalcommunity will depend on our good judgement andintegrity. Also at stake is the trust of our peoples and ofpublic opinion. Fortunately  for those of us whopractise the democratic creed  that trust is always time-bound and subject to public opinion.Our ability to work within the Organization willdetermine whether the Millennium Summit that justtook place will breathe new life into the UnitedNations. The world needs to see itself reflected in theinstitutions it established  with hope and participation with responsibility and a will to build a fairer  morepredictable  more peaceful and more humane society.I therefore believe — and this is merely asuggestion — that it is essential for all of us to ensurethat the Assembly is accorded the important roleassigned to it in the Charter  even though realitysometimes does not allow for this. We must ensure that33the Assembly and the Secretariat establish as soon aspossible a working group or a similar mechanism thatwould follow up on the Millennium Summit and wouldexamine the wealth of ideas put forward by our headsof State to ensure that they can be implemented and putinto practice. Only in that way will the MillenniumSummit be remembered."
"171",7251,"USA",55,2000,"I amhonoured to address the Assembly on behalf of theUnited States and to reinforce the eloquent messagePresident C1inton conveyed during last week'sMillennium Summit. Because my father worked herewhen I was young  I have always considered myself achild of the United Nations. And because I had theprivilege to serve here as America's PermanentRepresentative  I feel at home and so will speakplainly.The members of this body reflect virtually everyculture  ethnicity and geographical region. We are cityand country  inland and island  tropical and temperate developing and industrialized. We are as diverse ashumanity.And yet  in responding to the daunting demandsof this new era  we are bound together by the interestswe share and the ideals to which we aspire.We all have a stake in building peace andrelieving poverty  championing development andcurbing disease. We all want to see the dangers posedby weapons of mass destruction reduced  refugeescared for  children nourished  the environmentprotected  and the status of women advanced.We all believe the benefits of globalization mustbe allocated more broadly within and among societies.Because if the new technologies are to ease the oldproblems  they must help the many who today lackaccess and skills  so that every village becomes a hometo opportunity and every school a midwife to hope.As the Millennium Summit reflected  we have noshortage of worthy goals. We are right to aim high andtake on the mightiest tasks.But as the Secretary-General has said  progressdepends on working together. We need all hands ondeck  pulling in the same direction. For each of us  thatresponsibility begins at home because the internationalcommunity cannot help any nation that is not strivingto help itself.Each Government has an obligation to observeinternational norms on human rights  uphold the rule oflaw  fight corruption and raise awareness aboutHIV/AIDS. But in the twenty-first century  no nationcan protect and serve its people simply by going italone and that is why we  all benefit fromstrengthening regional bodies such as the Organizationof American States (OAS)  the Organization of AfricanUnity (OAU)  the Association of South-East AsianNations (ASEAN) and the Organization for Securityand Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).Because of their unique expertise and regionallegitimacy  they can be instruments for solving some ofthe hardest challenges we face. But they will succeedonly if we raise our expectations of theseorganizations  call upon them to act boldly and backthem when they do.Regional bodies can contribute much to thepurposes outlined in the Charter  and the goalsestablished during the Millennium Summit. But hereagain  they cannot do it all.8The role of the United Nations is also vital because no other institution combines a comprehensivemandate with near universal representation and globalreach.We all have an interest in the success of theUnited Nations. That is its greatest strength  and alsoits burden  because 189 nations have to work very hardif they are to agree.I remember when I came to New York in 1993  Iwas told by cynics that the United Nations was toobureaucratic to change  and too big ever to achieveconsensus on measures to improve its governance.Those cynics were wrong. With support frommany countries  we have made impressive progress.Compared to seven years ago  the United Nationsaccomplishes more and wastes less. Accountability hasincreased and duplication diminished.The Internal Oversight Office  which did not existin 1993  has grown steadily more rigorous and isresponsible for tens of millions of dollars of savings. Aculture of transparency and results is slowly but surelytaking hold. Moreover  both United NationsHeadquarters and the entire United Nations system arebetter led than they have ever been.United Nations leaders and Members can takepride in the gains made  but we all know there is muchmore work to be done.That is why we must back the Secretary General'sefforts to further improve United Nations management recognizing that every dollar wasted is a dollar lost tothe fight against poverty and to the achievement ofother urgent goals.We must also move ahead rapidly to strengthenpeacekeeping  because it is the most visible and vitalyardstick of United Nations success and  for people instrife-torn regions  often means the difference betweena normal life and no life at all.There is no magic formula for curing the ills thathave plagued United Nations peace operations in thepast. But the report  just prepared by AmbassadorBrahimi's team  is a solid place to start.As President Clinton said last week  we need toensure that United Nations peacekeepers can bedeployed with the right training and equipment and theright rules of engagement so they can achieve  notmerely attempt  their missions.This will require a larger peacekeeping staff  onpermanent assignment  comprised of the best talent andexperience we can find.It will require military planners the world over torecognize that training for peace operations is alegitimate part of every nation's security strategy. Itwill require the ability to deploy rapidly not onlyUnited Nations military forces  but also civilian policeand experts in law enforcement and judicial reform. Itwill demand improved coordination between militarypeacekeepers and civilian builders of peace  so thatmissions begun are completed and recovery bred byreconciliation can take hold.And it will require additional resources from myGovernment and from each of yours. And by“additional”  I mean resources that should not come atthe expense of other core United Nations goals.The United States will heed the Secretary-General's request that we work together to considerand implement the best recommendations of theBrahimi report.Whether for peacekeeping or programmes  theUnited Nations also needs a sustainable and equitablesystem of financing. We do not have that today.Member States  including my own  must do a better jobof making payments on time. But we must also lookafresh at the method used to allocate responsibility forUnited Nations costs.Last week  the Security Council called foradjustments in the scale of assessments. This plea hasbeen echoed by dozens of other countries and shouldbe acted upon by the General Assembly this fall.A more equitable system should provide a muchstronger foundation for United Nations programmesand missions. It should preserve the specialresponsibility for peacekeeping of the SecurityCouncil's permanent members. It should retain aheavily discounted rate for the poorest countries. Andit should reduce the United Nations overall reliance onpayments from the United States  while at the sametime enabling my Government to write a check to theUnited Nations for nearly $600 million in priorobligations.9Clearly  adjustments are long overdue. TheUnited Nations needs a firm and reliable financial base.In the weeks ahead  the United States will be pleased towork with members to accomplish this landmark goal.Further improvements in management andpeacekeeping and a sounder financial base are a vitalstep towards a stronger and more effective UnitedNations. But we must also stand up to the campaignlaunched by Baghdad against the United Nationsauthority and international law.Security Council resolution 1284 (1999) providesan effective plan for protecting world security throughresumed weapons inspections and monitoring insideIraq. It has expanded the oil-for-food programme thathas delivered $8 billion in humanitarian supplies toIraqi civilians  with $6 billion more on the way. And itwould enable Iraq  through compliance with theresolution's terms  to achieve an early suspension ofsanctions. Thus far  Baghdad has flatly refused toaccept the resolution. The regime's strategy is to ignoreits United Nations Charter obligations and to seek topreserve at all costs its capacity to produce thedeadliest weapons humanity has ever known.We must continue to do all we can to ease thehardships faced by Iraq's people. But we must alsodefend the integrity of this institution  our security andinternational law.The Millennium Summit illustrated the UnitedNations long-standing role as a forum for articulatingconsensus goals. But achieving these objectives willrequire action at all levels  from local to global. It willalso require a willingness to move well beyond thelimits and habits of the past.Today  the United Nations is taking on a widearray of new issues  what I call “people issues” because they so directly affect the lives of our citizens.They include the challenge of protecting our planet bylimiting greenhouse gas emissions; securing safe watersupplies; halting desertification; and putting a stop totrafficking in human beings. They especially includethe fight against HIV/AIDS  which was highlighted ina letter to the Secretary-General signed by the womenForeign Ministers last night. These and similarchallenges are sure to be important components oftwenty-first century diplomacy  and because they areglobal in scope  require a global response.The United Nations is also playing an increasedrole in areas where cold war divisions once held itback. Over the past decade  United Nations entitieshave contributed much by prosecuting war criminals promoting democracy  supporting human rights andaiding the fight against illegal drugs.These issues require a willingness to take a stand as the United Nations has done in holding accountablethe perpetrators of ethnic cleansing in Rwanda and theBalkans; striving to end rebel outrages in Sierra Leone;and expressing opposition to the long-standing andongoing violation of basic human rights in Burma.Let me say this morning that when the BurmeseGovernment tries to blame the victims for the crime and say that Aung San Suu Kyi and her party areresponsible for their own repression  I can only replythat much the same was once said about Gandhi andMartin Luther King  Nelson Mandela and VáclavHavel. The world is not fooled  and we must not besilent.Some argue that speaking out in defence ofhuman rights constitutes interference in internal affairs.I believe it helps to fulfil the purposes of the UnitedNations Charter  because when international norms areassaulted  the United Nations must do more thansimply observe injustice  or report upon it  orsympathize with the victims. We must do all we can where we can  to stop the perpetrators.This requires the active backing and participationof United Nations Members  so that respect forinternational law becomes steadily more universal andthe incentives for observing global standardsprogressively more clear.The result  if we are united and determinedenough  will be a world of greater security  justice andpeace. Realistically  this is essential  if we are toachieve the ambitious social goals we have set.But there is one other essential element as well and that is democracy. This past summer in Poland  forthe first time  more than 100 nations came together toreaffirm democratic principles and ensure that thedemocratic tide remains a rising one around the world.We did this not because democracy alwaysproduces good Governments  for it does not. But weare convinced by the evidence of the old century thatthe hopes we share for the new will more readily be10accomplished if people are able to live and work infreedom.Democracy is the one road we can all walk downtogether and the best system yet devised for sowingand growing the seeds of economic opportunity.In promoting democracy  we are not attempting toimpose our values on anyone else. In fact  this is notpossible  because democracy  by definition  enablescitizens within a country to shape their own destinies inaccordance with their own convictions and ideals.Make no mistake. In any country  at any time dictatorship is an imposition. Democracy is a choice.As we have learned during the last 55 years  theUnited Nations provides no guarantees of global peaceor prosperity. But it can play a vital role as catalyst andcoordinator  and as a bridge connecting thecontributions of one to another.To those who would judge it harshly  I wouldrespond not by pointing first to the deliberations ofdiplomats such as myself  in surroundings such asthese. Instead  I would point to the day-to-day effortsof United Nations workers caring for refugees  feedingchildren  providing shelter and preventing disease.I would point to the men and women on the frontlines  from Port-au-Prince to Freetown  and fromKosovo to Kisangani  doing some of the world'shardest work  and  as we have been reminded by therecent slayings of employees of the Office of theUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees inEast Timor  also the most dangerous. It is their effortsand sacrifice  in partnership with so many indigenousand other non-governmental organizations  that trulyremind us of the United Nations purpose and of ourkinship with one another.This is  I expect  my last official speech to aUnited Nations audience. As I stand before you  I amdeeply conscious not only of our manyaccomplishments  but also of the tasks not yetcompleted.I am grieved by the conflicts that still rage  andthe basic rights and freedoms still denied. I amfrustrated by the gaps that still exist between our idealsand actions  and alarmed by the deepening materialdivide that ultimately threatens every nation  rich andpoor alike.There are those who say it is naïve to think thatthe future can be made better than the past. I amreminded that this institution was founded by men andwomen who were as realistic as any human beingscould be  for they were the survivors of the worstconflict our world has known and determined thatsucceeding generations should be saved from holocaustand war. They had faith. Surely we  as well  must havefaith that by working together within and outside thisOrganization  we can move together  step by steptowards the lofty goals we have set  and thereby bringabout a world more peaceful  prosperous and free thanit has ever been. Since 1993  it has been my privilegeto work with so many of you  from every part of theglobe  in support of the interests we have in commonand the dreams our people share.This morning  I want to thank you for yourfriendship; pledge my cooperation in the monthsimmediately ahead; and ask respectfully  in turn  foryours. I promise  as well  to serve the cause ofinternational progress and individual liberty not onlyfor as long as I am in office  but for as long as I amalive."
"172",7321,"VCT",55,2000,"I take this opportunity to congratulate thePresident of the General Assembly on his election. Iam confident that his vision and energy will guide thissession to a successful conclusion.I also thank Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  who led thefifty-fourth session of the General Assembly withdistinction and efficiency.I commend Mr. Kofi Annan  the esteemedSecretary-General of this Organization  for thethoughtful recommendations which he has put forwardin his report to the Millennium Summit entitled “Wethe peoples: the role of the United Nations in thetwenty-first century”. His vision and stewardship haveproved to be vital factors in advancing the work andmission of the United Nations at this critical time in thehistory of the Organization and the world.I join the previous speakers in welcoming thenation of Tuvalu as the 189th and newest Member ofthe United Nations family. Our newest entrant is alsothe smallest Member country of the Organization  witha population of 10 000 and a land area of nine squaremiles. It was very pleasing to my delegation to see theleader of that nation proudly take his place among theother leaders of the world in what was the largestgathering of heads of State or Government everassembled in one place  the Millennium Summit. Thereis a special affinity between the countries of theCaribbean Community (CARICOM) and Tuvalu. Weare among the smallest constituents of theOrganization. We share similar historical andconstitutional experiences. We face the sameenvironmental threats. We look forward  withconfidence  to a future involving the creative29utilization of the phenomenal developments in the areaof information technology.My country's Prime Minister  The RightHonourable Sir James F. Mitchell  joined other leadersfrom the Caribbean Community  of which he is thecurrent Chairman  in denouncing the growinginsensitivity towards and disregard for the interests ofsmall developing countries on the part of the powerfulin today's world. In his address to the MillenniumSummit the Prime Minister noted that while ourreligious heritage has taught us how to reach across theboundaries of nations through the very inspirationalguideline  “love your neighbour as yourself”  small andvulnerable island States such as our own are beingvictimized by the application of international rulescrafted by the mighty to serve their own purposes oblivious to the concerns  and consequences for thewell-being  of others. We are all affected by themodalities of the global village which we inhabit through revolutionary developments in communicationtechnology. Indeed  we have all become neighbours and yet the competition among the world's peoples hasbecome fiercer  with the rich countries surging aheadand widening the gap with poor countries. This gap isnow related not only to material wealth  but also frighteningly  to the ability of less developed countriesto compete in the accepted medium of communication because of the existence of an ever-widening digitaldivide.The Millennium Summit concluded with theadoption by world leaders of a Declaration affirmingthe importance of the United Nations and the need tostrengthen its peacekeeping operations  as well asmaking commitments to targeted reductions in poverty the levels of inhuman living conditions experienced byimpoverished nations around the world  the incidenceand spread of HIV/AIDS and the provision of basiceducation for all children. On the other hand  we areaware that the current world order is rapidly falling outof step with today's realities and that there is a pressingneed for the international community to come togetherand address the numerous challenges before us.We must acknowledge that efforts to address oldissues  like world poverty and its distribution  as wellas new ones arising from globalization  the rapidgrowth of information technology and the resultingdigital divide  the consequences of the environmentaldegradation of our planet  HIV/AIDS and genderissues  among others  have largely been inadequate.Our common and daunting task is therefore to ensurethat this globalized world will be beneficial for all andnot just for some. More than ever before  there is anurgent need to foster a consciousness of universalmoral values in order to deal with present-dayproblems  all of which are assuming an increasinglyglobal dimension. The promotion of peace and humanrights  the settling of armed conflicts  both within andamong States  the protection of immigrants  thesafeguarding of the environment  the battle againstterrible diseases  the fight against drug and armstrafficking  money laundering and economic andpolitical corruption are issues which no nation regardless of how wealthy or powerful  cansuccessfully address alone. They concern the entirehuman community and must be addressed and resolvedthrough common universal efforts.My country  a small State in the Caribbean  hasalways been aware of its interdependence with othercountries for its prosperity and security. We havemoved to advance our interests through multilateralcooperation in the Organization of Eastern CaribbeanStates (OECS)  CARICOM  the Organization ofAmerican States (OAS)  the Association of CaribbeanStates (ACS)  the Commonwealth and the institutionsof the United Nations system. For a small developingcountry like Saint Vincent and the Grenadines multilateralism is not an option; it is an integral part ofour policies and programmes to enhance our standardof living and create a better life for all of our people. Itherefore reiterate my country's commitment to andsupport for the work of the United Nations and itsagencies in this regard.The Millennium Summit provided an appropriateopportunity for the assembled leaders to rededicatethemselves to the attempt to have an impact on andchange for the better the quality of life of the world'spoorest people  who are trapped in a vicious cycle ofdeprivation and suffering. The Summit will haveproved worthwhile if it is remembered not as a highprofile event to make the transition to a newmillennium  but as an event that made the transitionfrom words to deeds. The times demand nothing less.The security  welfare and development of peoplemust  in the context of any new world order  dominatethe attention of the world's multilateral financialinstitutions  as well as of the United Nations. We mustundertake sustained and concerted efforts to free ourpeople from poverty  hunger  illiteracy and disease.30While micro-credit and other poverty-alleviationprogrammes have been successful  much needs to bedone to eradicate poverty. In this era of plenty  millionsstill suffer from hunger.We had curbed old diseases like malaria  choleraand tuberculosis  but they have reappeared in new anddrug-resistant forms. Deadly diseases like HIV/AIDSare spreading at an alarming pace. The leaders of theCaribbean Community have placed combating thispandemic at the top of the regional agenda. Thisscourge has already claimed the lives of over 10million people. It is projected to claim the lives of over200 million by the year 2010  the majority of them insub-Saharan Africa.The developed world is not spared  either.Worldwide figures indicate that 34 million people areliving with the disease  over 18 million have died sincethe beginning of the epidemic and over 13 millionchildren have become orphaned. In the Caribbeanregion  the disease now threatens the human resourcedevelopment efforts of CARICOM and could reversethe social and economic gains of the countries in thatsubregion. The prevalence rate in the wider Caribbeanis estimated at 172 cases per 100 000 people  thehighest rate of prevalence in the Americas  and second in terms of the growth rate  to sub-Saharan Africa. AUnited Nations AIDS survey in 1999 showed that over360 000 adults and children in our region were livingwith the disease. There is no immunity. Internationalcooperation in the medical  ethical and legal fieldsmust be intensified if the disease is to be contained.We cannot preach about human rights and theuniversality of the United Nations while at the sametime ignoring the aspirations of over 23 million peoplein the Republic of China on Taiwan. It is the view ofthe Saint Vincent and the Grenadines delegation thatthe time has come when serious consideration shouldbe given to the eligibility of the Republic of China onTaiwan to become a Member of the United Nations. Inthis regard  my Government is urging that the subjectbe placed on the agenda of the fifty-sixth session of theGeneral Assembly. We urge every Member State of thisnoble Organization to give its full support to thisworthy initiative for a country whose democraticcredentials cannot be challenged.Saint Vincent and the Grenadines welcomes theprogress made in the Middle East peace process thusfar  and expresses the hope that through dialogue compromise and goodwill  the dream of lasting peacemay become a reality.If countries like Saint Vincent and the Grenadinesare to survive globalization  the internationalcommunity must give careful and urgent considerationto the following measures: the revitalization of growthin developed countries; the lowering of interest rates;access to the world's markets for the products ofdeveloping countries; the reduction of debt and thedebt-service burden; the reversal of the deterioratingsituation in the marketing arrangements for primaryproducts produced in the developing countries;economic diversification; increasing the levels ofofficial development assistance and humanitarian aid;reductions in net capital flows from bilateral andmultilateral sources; and combating the negativeconsequences of the graduation of some countries likeours  by international financial institutions  fromconcessionary funding arrangements.Saint Vincent and the Grenadines shares theconcerns of other developing countries with regard tothe general decline in official development assistanceand the flow of foreign direct investment to developingcountries. We look forward to the consultation onfinancing for development planned for 2001.The changing world environment dictates theneed for the revitalization and restructuring of thevarious organs of the United Nations organizations  butmy Government attaches very high priority to therevitalization and strengthening of the role of theUnited Nations in promoting international cooperationfor sound development  including economicdevelopment. We share the view that the UnitedNations should be encouraged to develop its fullpotential in the area of international economiccooperation and should be endowed with the requisiteresources to contribute to solving the serious economicand social problems facing developing countries intheir efforts to achieve sustained economic growth anddevelopment.We commend those donor countries that havemade financial contributions to the South PacificApplied Geoscience Commission to assist thedevelopment of an environmental vulnerability index and call for the early adoption by the internationalcommunity of a vulnerability index that would serve asa guide for multilateral financial institutions and the31United Nations on the specific vulnerabilities ofdeveloping countries.Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  like othersmall island developing States in the strategicallylocated Caribbean  continues to be plagued by theendemic problems of the production  trafficking andconsumption of illicit drugs and psychotropicsubstances. This modern day scourge continues to poseserious problems which threaten to destroy the socialand moral fabric of our communities. My Governmentis fully committed to the ongoing process ofcooperation with other countries to counter theseillegal activities. In this regard  I wish to reiterate inthis forum our complete support for the MultilateralEvaluation Mechanism (MEM)  developed by themember countries of the Organization of AmericanStates (OAS) to monitor countries' cooperation in theinternational fight against the drug trade. I also takethis opportunity to urge that more resources beallocated through collaborative efforts by theinternational community to encourage farmers to keepaway from the production of illicit crops.In his address to the Millennium Summit  theChairman of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)spoke of the outstanding and invaluable record of goodgovernance and respect for human rights anddemocracy in the entire Caribbean region. These areaspects of our society of which we are eternally proud.Recently in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  ourconstitutional democracy was put to the test throughopen expressions of dissent  but withstood the ordealthrough dialogue and compromise. My Government ispleased to put on record its appreciation to theVincentian people for upholding democratic values andrespecting the supremacy of the constitution and therule of law as fundamental principles by which ourbeloved country exists and governs itself. I also wish toexpress gratitude to CARICOM  to the Organization ofEastern Caribbean States (OECS)  to the churches  tothe National Youth Council  to the Chamber of Industryand Commerce  to the Employers' Federation and tomany individuals and other institutions for theirinvaluable contributions in bringing about a swiftresolution of the matter. My Government has longrecognized the urgent need for constitutional reformand will continue to work with other interested partiesto bring about meaningful change that would seek among other things  to strengthen the foundations ofour democracy. As full members of this body  we haveseen  at close quarters  the importance of constitutionalreform in the promotion of democracy  stability andeconomic development.We also recognize that constitutional reform iscrucial to strengthening our own integration processeswithin the Caribbean Community  including theestablishment of a Caribbean court of justice  to be inter alia  the authoritative body adjudicating onmatters pertaining to the interpretation andimplementation of the provisions of the Treaty ofChaguaramas  which established CARICOM.Many matters of profound importance to SaintVincent and the Grenadines and the CaribbeanCommunity as a whole are included in the agenda ofthis fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly. Theseinclude: sustainable development  the future of UnitedNations reform  the International Criminal Court andhuman rights  the death penalty and financing fordevelopment.I wish  once again  to focus the attention of thisnoble gathering to the issue of the Caribbean bananatrade with the European Union (EU). The facts are welldocumented. Banana exports to the European Unionfrom my country and similarly from Dominica  SaintLucia and other African  Caribbean and Pacific (ACP)countries are crucial to the economies of thesecountries and represent over half of all export earningsin some cases. The industry provides substantialemployment for many families in Dominica  SaintLucia and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  my owncountry.Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is appreciativeof the efforts of the European Commission and otherparties which seek to bring about an amicable andequitable solution to the dispute. However we aredeeply concerned that  should the tariff quota regimebe eliminated as a means of ensuring conformity withthe 1999 World Trade Organization (WTO) ruling  thiswould have immeasurable harmful consequences forour economy. It will lead to the destruction of theCaribbean banana industry and negatively affect otherACP supplying States where exports are also crucial tothe economy.The two alternative solutions being proposed bythe European Commission  that is a first come  firstserved system  along with a tariff rate quota and  if thatproves impracticable  moving directly to a tariff onlysystem  would prove to be disadvantageous and32disastrous for the Caribbean industry. Neither systemensures access.We therefore urge the interested parties to thedispute to use their substantial influence to bring aboutthe much-needed breakthrough which will facilitate aresolution that is acceptable to all parties. Anefficacious settlement of this long-standing issue willsupport our efforts  as a small economically vulnerableisland State  in eradicating poverty and maintainingpeace and economic security  which are vital for theachievement of economic diversification within areasonable period of transition.While we recognize that there are structural andinherent disadvantages that inhibit our ability tocompete with highly integrated operations on themarket  we ask that an equitable solution be sought inorder to allow our people to engage meaningfully intrade and development  rather than be forever subjectedto the aid and dependency syndrome. Our expresseddesire to hold on to our banana industry  which servedus well  in no way reflects any misunderstanding of therealities of the present day trade and economicenvironment.My delegation also wishes to express its concernover the procedural obstacles raised in Geneva withinthe WTO that would prevent consideration of thewaiver requested in respect of the new ACP-EUPartnership Agreement if it includes bananas withoutadvice on how the regime will be formed. My countryand other members of the Caribbean Community havebeen actively engaged in diversifying our economiesthroughout the last quarter of the last century. This hasinvolved activities in the agricultural  manufacturing tourism and service sectors. In Saint Vincent and theGrenadines  as a direct corollary of this thrust  we haveimproved air access to our country and my Governmentcontinues to prioritize the education of our people toprepare them for the opportunities that will accrue.My Government will continue to honour itscommitments to all international agreements to whichit is signatory. In furtherance to our internationalobligation we have signed the following: the UnitedNations Convention on Contracts for the InternationalSale of Goods  the Convention on the Recognition andEnforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards  the UnitedNations Convention on the Carriage of Goods by Sea the International Convention Against the Taking ofHostages and the Convention on the Prevention andPunishment of Crimes against Internationally ProtectedPersons  including Diplomatic Agents. All of theseinstruments were deposited with the Secretary Generalduring the Millennium Summit.During his speech at the Millennium Summit Prime Minister Mitchell stated that:“Small island States such as our own  withan enviable record of good governance andhuman rights  have seen the mighty in the bananatrade using the international rules — crafted bythem — impede our economic growth.”Similarly  the verdicts that have been imposed bythe Organization for Economic Cooperation andDevelopment (OECD) on our financial services without any deference to our rights to be heard demonstrate total disregard for the well-being of smallvulnerable States attempting to diversify theireconomies. I echo Prime Minister Mitchell's sentiment “Where is the fairness in free trade?”Offshore financial services is one of our chosenavenues of economic diversification. We believe thatwe are capable of offering a useful  professional andmutually beneficial service to our clients. Accordingly in 1995 we embarked on a comprehensive legislativeexercise to ensure that we would put in place aregulatory and supervisory framework to adequatelyadminister the conduct of international financialbusinesses operating in Saint Vincent and theGrenadines. In our efforts to further strengthen ourregulatory regime against money laundering activities we enacted six additional pieces of offshore legislation.Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is committed to beinga responsible member of the international community including by playing its part in the war against moneylaundering. We believe that those who toil to build abetter life for themselves  their children  theirgrandchildren and any other beneficiaries  should beafforded the right of privacy in their affairs. Suchpeople should have access to facilities that willpreserve that privacy  and the opportunity should becreated for them to optimize and maximize theirwealth. It is  however  important to note that whilst webelieve in the preservation of privacy  we are alsoresolute in efforts to ensure that persons of undesirablecharacter and conduct are not allowed to takeadvantage of the opportunities that are available in ourinternational finance sector.33My country and others in the CaribbeanCommunity are deeply concerned that the so-calledharmful tax initiative of the Organisation for EconomicCooperation and Development (OECD) is designed tofrustrate tax competition  and that it threatens thesovereignty of small island States desperately seekingcreative avenues for survival. Such action on the partof the OECD could encourage the creation of a taxcartel  thereby removing the possibility of lower taxesfrom those who wish to legitimately escape themthrough the exercise of free choice. It would also closeoff an area of diversification and economic activity inwhich poor developing countries can be competitiveand which they have actively promoted for a long time.The unilateral practices of the OECD  the FinancialStability Forum and the Financial Action Task Forcealso impact negatively on the burden of taxation inwealthy countries  impair the competitive capacity ofCaribbean jurisprudence in the provision of a globalfinancial service and stifle economic growth in the 47blacklisted countries  with all the concomitant evils.The small island States of the Caribbean areamong those countries most at risk from the adverseeffects of climate change. Already  many of our islandsare experiencing those effects in areas that impactdirectly on the important tourism sector of oureconomies. We are also prone to extremely damagingnatural disasters  especially hurricanes and stormsurges  which visit us annually with increasingfrequency and ferocity. Our diverse region alsoexperiences droughts and floods  volcanic eruptionsand earthquakes  with equally devastating effects  ifless regularly than the pleasantly named perennials.The continued committed support of the internationalcommunity is crucial in complementing the work ofthose States in addressing these serious problems.Our survival as a region is intimately interwovenwith our environment. Our physical and economiclimitations should not be further burdened by the transshipment of hazardous waste through our waterways.Such actions are a flagrant violation of our humanrights and an affront to our sovereign dignity. Wetherefore reiterate the call for the Caribbean Sea to be anuclear-free zone in the context of sustainabledevelopment.In closing  I take this opportunity to pay tribute inthis forum to one who has upheld the highest ideals ofthe Charter of the United Nations  through service toour country  to the Caribbean and to the internationalcommunity. I speak of the Prime Minister of SaintVincent and the Grenadines and current Chairman ofthe Caribbean Community  The Right HonourableSir James F. Mitchell. For 34 years he has served as anelected member of our legislature. He has seen ourcountry through the stages of constitutionaldevelopment from crown colony to internal selfgovernment  and finally  as our longest serving PrimeMinister  to a fully independent State. For us in SaintVincent and the Grenadines  it is difficult tocontemplate public life without him. His address at theMillennium Summit was his last to this body  for hehas decided to demit office as Prime Minister beforethe twenty-first anniversary of our politicalindependence  on 27 October 2000. Sir James Mitchellhas made us all proud by his long  dedicated andvisionary service. The initiatives taken by him in thearea of land reform  which empowered people throughland ownership  are exemplary. I think it is appropriatethat  on behalf of Vincentians everywhere  I extendsincere gratitude to him from this rostrum.The challenge is ours: to turn our words intoaction and to agree on a common vision of our future."
"173",7368,"VEN",55,2000,"Iagain extend our congratulations to the President on hiselection.The Millennium Summit has charted for us a planof action for the immediate future. We mustconsistently bear that plan of action in mind as ourmain priority  and direct all our work towards its11effective implementation. We cannot view the finaldocument adopted by the most important gathering ofworld leaders ever held as a mere expression of goodintentions and act as though it were a matter of routineand as if nothing had happened.First  we must take action to ensure that the vastmajority of the human race living in developingcountries make significant progress towards theattainment of sustainable development. We must makespecial efforts with respect to the millions of men women and children who live in poverty. They must begiven means of subsistence  education and medicalcare.Our most important shared instrument  the UnitedNations  is currently ill-equipped for that enormoustask. We must therefore focus on giving it the powerand means to play an effective role in that importanteffort. We believe that the United Nations must play acentral role in the struggle for development. To thatend  we must consider without delay ways tostrengthen the General Assembly  our most democraticand open institution. It is equally necessary tostrengthen the Organization's primary instrument inthis field  the Economic and Social Council  whichshould become a real council for human development with authority and ability to act comparable to theSecurity Council's.The message of the Millennium Summit is veryclear: peace and development are equally important and each depends on the other. The most urgent tasksin the struggle against poverty are also clear: toalleviate the debt burden of highly indebted poorcountries; to tackle the scourges of AIDS and malaria;and to provide education for all. In all of those tasksthe United Nations must play a leadership role.In order to meet the established goals of reducingworld poverty by half by 2015  we must ensure thatnational Government's measures adopted in accordancewith the social platform of United Nations conferences to benefit their populations in the areas of health  foodand education  are accompanied by internationalcooperation based on solidarity  in order that thosetasks are carried out efficiently and promptly.It is therefore particularly important  in order tosupport the objectives of  and strategies for  povertyeradication  that developed countries meet theircommitment to dedicate 0.7 per cent of gross domesticproduct to official development assistance.It is equally urgent to ensure that the rulesregulating international trade and finance are just andequitable  not only in theory but also in practice  sothat they lead to development for all  and not merely tothe further enrichment of a privileged minority.In that regard  the high-level intergovernmentalmeeting on financing for development  to be held nextyear  should result in effective coordination andharmonization of all the efforts Governments andinternational organizations  so that those efforts maybear tangible fruits meeting the needs of all countries.The United Nations must be the coordinating centre forthe World Trade Organization and the Bretton Woodsinstitutions.With regard to foreign debt  it is vital that theinternational community promote  on the basis ofNorth-South dialogue  the adoption of concertedmeasures for the effective resolution of this problem which is seriously weakening the sustained economicgrowth of developing countries affected by theexcessive burden of debt servicing. We believe that itwill be necessary to consider the timely reschedulingon favourable terms of the international financialcommitments of developing countries  including highlyindebted poor countries and medium-income countries.The freeing of resources currently allocated todebt payment will make it possible for those countriesmore efficiently to meet the real needs of theirpopulations in the areas of food  health and education.It will also promote their peoples' participation and fullintegration within their respective societies. It is alsonecessary to recognize the economic and social costsincurred by developing countries in meeting foreigndebt payments.Shared responsibility in dealing with economicand social issues  as well as with regard to questions ofpeace  requires more intensive and effectiveparticipation by developing countries in the worldeconomy  particularly in decision-making and theformulation of international and economic norms.The efforts of the developing countries towardspoverty eradication  economic and social progress sustained economic growth and sustainabledevelopment are dependent on a favourableinternational economic environment and oninternational cooperation for renewed and strengtheneddevelopment. The magnitude and urgency of thechallenges facing us in the economic and social sphere12require the support of all Member States in order torealize the aspirations of those who cry out for a moreequitable and just world  in which poverty eradicationand the promotion of development are a genuineexpression of international peace and stability.As for our other main priority  the maintenance ofpeace  we must learn from our experience — both fromour mistakes and from our achievements.The United Nations must be provided with themeans to anticipate and prevent conflicts  not just putan end to them once they have erupted.In this respect  disarmament  including nucleardisarmament  is vital  as is the elimination of the illicitarms trade. Also key is the struggle againsttransnational criminal activities such as terrorism andthe illicit drug trade.In this context  we welcome the proposal of theSecretary-General to convene an internationalconference on the reduction of the nuclear threat. Webelieve that this could help strengthen the commitmentto eliminate nuclear weapons  as recently agreed at thesixth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty onthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).Venezuela supports the convening of the UnitedNations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Armsand Light Weapons in All Its Aspects  to be held nextyear. That Conference will be a perfect opportunity forus to combine our efforts to adopt measures ofcooperation to eliminate this illicit activity  which haslinks to organized transnational crime and isencouraged by unscrupulous groups or individuals whoact unlawfully.The role of the United Nations as the only forumempowered to authorize the use of force must bereaffirmed  without distinctions or exceptions  apartfrom self-defence  which in turn must be in strictcompliance with the provisions of the Charter.It is urgent to this end to make effective progresstowards reform of the Security Council. This does notmean mere cosmetic change  but rather real reform with a view to ensuring its credibility as a democratic transparent and impartial organ in which no countryhas the right to block  through the use of the veto action agreed by the majority.If we wish the Millennium Summit to have realsignificance  if we want it to be remembered not onlybecause of the milestone represented by theparticipation of an unprecedented number of worldleaders  we must take concrete action at this session ofthe General Assembly. Towards that end  Venezuelafully supports the proposal made recently by theMinister for Foreign Affairs of Uruguay to create aworking group to ensure implementation of theMillennium Summit Declaration. We believe that thisgroup should be open to participation by all MemberStates. We believe also that the representatives of thecountries that co-chaired the Summit and those thatpresided over the four round tables  as well as theChairmen of the regional groups  should participateactively in this process."
"174",7407,"VNM",55,2000,"I would like toconvey our warm congratulations to Mr. Harri Holkerion his election to the presidency of this fifty-fifthsession of the General Assembly. I wish also to extendour greetings to Tuvalu as a new Member of the UnitedNations.This year's session of the General Assembly is ofspecial significance  as it is taking place right after theMillennium Summit. The Summit marked an importantmilestone for the United Nations in the discharge of thelofty responsibilities of the Organization and itsMember States towards the future of humankind. TheMillennium Declaration adopted by the Summit pointsout humanity's most pressing issues and theOrganization's primary priorities and directions at thebeginning of this new era. Thus the MillenniumDeclaration can be considered a new charter andplatform of action of the United Nations.The question now confronting the internationalcommunity is how to translate the MillenniumDeclaration into reality. This session of the GeneralAssembly must mark the beginning of a new awarenessand determination  to be demonstrated by concreteresults. Only by so doing can we further consolidatethe confidence of the world's people in the work of theUnited Nations  the largest Organization on our planet.The realization of the Millennium Declarationwill be a long process  but not a simple one. It willrequire the strong determination and efforts of eachcountry  the international community and the UnitedNations  especially since globalization is havingnegative effects  leading to the uneven distribution ofopportunities and benefits at the expense of developingcountries.Poverty eradication and development must beaccorded primary priority and supported so that we canachieve the targets set by the Millennium Summit including the target to halve  by the year 2015  thecurrent proportion of the world's poor people endeavouring to make the right to development areality for everyone. Among human rights  the right todevelopment is of paramount importance. With povertyand without development  there can be no peace andstability  let alone human rights. On the other hand  theconsolidation of international peace and security willhelp to create a stable  enabling environment fordevelopment and poverty eradication  in each countryand each region  as well as throughout the world.To achieve development and poverty eradication the first decisive requirement is for countries toenhance their efforts and adopt suitable policies andprogrammes aimed at making the fullest use of theirresources and potential  while at the same time fullymobilizing and effectively utilizing resources fromoutside. The United Nations  for its part  shouldstrengthen its capacity and direct the necessaryresources necessary to support the poverty-eradicationefforts of the Member States.Another extremely important point is that thedeveloped and industrialized countries  as well aseconomic centres  must further enhance their assistanceto developing countries in their endeavour to achievedevelopment and poverty eradication. That shouldinclude debt-relief and write-off measures and anincrease in official development assistance to 0.7 percent of gross domestic product  to which they havecommitted themselves.The objectives set out in the MillenniumDeclaration have long been considered by Viet Nam asits primary policy priorities. For example  through ourown determined efforts and with the assistance of theUnited Nations and other countries  we have reducedthe poverty rate  according to Viet Nam's criteria  to 11per cent in 2000 from 30 per cent in 1992. We hopethat this support and assistance will be furtherenhanced to facilitate Viet Nam's consolidation of theachievements recorded.In the final analysis  all of these issues are aimedat serving the human being. Human resources andcultural development are two closely related aspectswithin the overall programme of development andpoverty eradication. They are therefore both the goaland the driving force of development. This is the lessonthat we can draw from the experience of many decades.It needs to be given appropriate and close attention inthe policies of all countries.Those objectives have been reflected also inVision 2020 of the Association of South-East AsianNations (ASEAN) and in the Hanoi Programme ofAction. They include the expansion of cooperation inSouth-East Asia and in East Asia and the building ofdevelopment triangles and quadrangles crossing poorregions. Concrete examples include the promisinginitiatives of the East-West corridor for developmentand the proclamation of the first decade of the twenty-first century as the Decade of Greater MekongSubregion Development Cooperation  a proclamationwhich is supported by the Economic and SocialCommission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP). Thoseprogrammes are fully compatible with the directivescontained in the Millennium Declaration  and theyshould therefore be properly supported by the UnitedNations and by the international community. Viet Namand ASEAN will also contribute to further advancesalong this path.In many regions of the world  protracted conflictscontinue  causing instability and hindering the effortsof those regions and the countries in them to eradicatepoverty eradication and attain development. Viet Namand ASEAN support the resolution of disputes bypeaceful means  without interference or imposition  soas to improve and consolidate regional peace  and notto further complicate the situation and adversely affectthe confidence of the peoples of the countriesconcerned in the endeavours of the internationalcommunity. Our common responsibility is therefore toguarantee that there will no repetition of interference ofthe kind that occurred recently in violation of theUnited Nations Charter and to put an end to theembargoes that have imposed untold sufferings on thepeoples of Cuba and Iraq.Greater efforts should be made to further enhancedisarmament  especially disarmament relating tonuclear weapons and other weapons of massdestruction  and to curb the growing danger of a newarms race  including attempts to deploy new missilesystems.In South-East Asia and in East Asia  the ASEANcountries have been leading the effort to build a regionof amity  cooperation and prosperity  free from nuclearweapons; to resolve outstanding issues in the region; toimplement the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation inSouth-East Asia and the Treaty on the South-East AsiaNuclear-Weapon-Free Zone; and to promote theASEAN Regional Forum for dialogue and cooperationwith other countries and organizations. In this field confidence-building measures should be enhanced onthe basis of strict respect for the principles of non-interference in the internal affairs of other States  andof the preservation of the national and cultural identityof each country and of each region as a whole. VietNam and ASEAN  bilaterally or through the RegionalForum  will further promote efforts to develop aregional code of conduct on the South China Seabetween ASEAN and China. We fully support the 1992ASEAN Declaration on principles for resolving24disputes in the South China Sea  and we welcomerecent positive developments on the Korean peninsula.In order to implement the new major directives ofthe Millennium Summit and to follow up themomentum created by it  the General Assembly should at this session  further enhance the process ofreforming  revitalizing and democratizing the UnitedNations. Viet Nam supports the restoration andstrengthening of the central position of the GeneralAssembly  an organ that represents all Member Stateson the basis of sovereign equality. The reform of theUnited Nations  and most important  the reform ofthe structure  composition and decision-making processof the Security Council ó is the responsibility of allMember States.Reform of the Security Council should be basedon the principles of the United Nations Charter. Itshould ensure increased representativeness  democracyand equitable geographical distribution  through whichdeveloping countries will be represented appropriatelyand will participate fully in the Council's decisions onimportant matters of world peace and security. VietNam supports expansion in both categories of Councilmembership  permanent and non-permanent. Regardingthe increase in the permanent membership  the generalpackage to be agreed upon should ensure thatdeveloping countries from the three continents of Asia Africa and Latin America are represented; and it mayalso take into account the inclusion of some developingcountries that can play a significant role and of certaindeveloped countries that have made major financialand material contributions to the United Nations. Suchcountries would include India  Japan and Germany.Now more than ever before  the United Nationsmust ensure that it can demonstrate the ability toreform itself and move forward with tangible steps. Weneed to act  and to ensure that the reform reflects theabundant vitality of the United Nations.As it participates in this session  Viet Nam sharesthe common resolve to implement the historicMillennium Declaration to build a just and better worldand a worthier and more effective United Nations.Fully aware of its responsibility as a Member Statetowards the United Nations and towards theinternational community  Viet Nam has for many yearsbeen making an effort to attain the common goals ofmankind and of the United Nations  and it willcontinue to do so in the future. A very recent vividexample was the proposal put forward by the Presidentof the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam at theMillennium Summit  recommending that the firstdecade of the twenty-first century be proclaimed adecade of the greatest efforts towards development andpoverty eradication.In its capacity as a Member of the United Nationsand as Chairman of ASEAN  Viet Nam will do itsutmost to contribute actively to the development of theUnited Nations in general and of ASEAN in particular and to promote cooperation between Viet Nam and theUnited Nations as well as between ASEAN and theUnited Nations. We wish at the same time to developclose and effective cooperation with other MemberStates and with organizations of the United Nations."
"175",7438,"VUT",55,2000,"Allow me first of all toconvey the apologies of the Minister of Foreign Affairsof Vanuatu  The Honourable Serge Vohor  who isunable to be here on this historic occasion due to mostpressing commitments at home. I am therefore verydeeply honoured to address the Assembly on behalf ofthe delegation of the Republic of Vanuatu.At the outset I wish to congratulate Mr. HarriHolkeri on his election to this historic session of theGeneral Assembly. My delegation is confident thatwith his vast experience and diplomatic skills  he willguide this Assembly to a successful conclusion. Iwould also like to take this opportunity to pay tributeto his predecessor  who so ably guided the fifty-fourthsession of the General Assembly.Allow me also to congratulate Tuvalu as thenewest Member of our family of nations. As a smallisland State  and  more significantly  a member of theSouth Pacific region  Vanuatu is very pleased towelcome Tuvalu. Vanuatu certainly hopes a furtherincrease in the Pacific island membership would be apositive step in the region's economic and politicaldevelopment as we embark on the twenty-first century.Small island States  including Vanuatu  arecontinuously confronted by difficult and challengingissues  which must be addressed at this summit. For thePacific region  its key features are its immensegeographic spread  its small land and population baseand limited natural resources  and its vulnerability toeconomic and natural shocks  which inevitably have animpact on its physical infrastructure and economicdevelopment. Dependence has been on a few fragilecommodity markets and fickle tourist income.One of our greatest challenges is education forall. The Human Poverty Index of the Pacific Island26Countries shows Vanuatu as the third last of the leastdeveloped countries. Vanuatu shares the view that thekey to development and success is education. As asignatory to the Convention on the Rights of the Childand the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms ofDiscrimination against Women  Vanuatu is committedto this cause. However  limited financial and humanresources continue to hinder development in this area.Vanuatu welcomes the initiative taken by theSecretary-General  in his address to the Dakar WorldEducation Forum  held in April 2000  to build a globalpartnership for girls' education. Vanuatu will bepleased to be part of this global initiative. At the sametime  Vanuatu fully supports the view that involvingwomen as central players in development providesbenefits in the areas of nutrition  health  and savingsand reinvestment at the family  community  and ultimately  national level. Nevertheless  the challengeof ensuring education for all at all levels is anambitious objective that will require externalassistance. The education and training of thepopulation  including women  must therefore be animportant goal of the Assembly.One of the great obstacles to our economicdevelopment  including our foreign investmentportfolio  has always been the relatively high cost ofpublic utilities  in particular the energy sector  which islargely dependent on traditional oil-based systems. Thecost of importing oil products and petroleum-derivedgas is currently about 90 per cent of our combineddomestic exports. Our economy cannot afford thistrend in the long run.We believe that with access to the new andrelevant technology available in the developedcountries today  the Republic of Vanuatu and othersmall island nations can develop integrated renewableenergy systems and hydrogen fuels if our potentialwind- and sun-related and geothermal andhydroelectricity resources can be fully utilized.Access to financial and technical resources fromthe developed countries can assist countries like theRepublic of Vanuatu in moving in the right directionand thereby positively contribute to our commonobjective of creating a healthier and more environment-friendly economic development.The emergence of new information technologytoday underlines the strong linkage between theconcepts of knowledge and power. Whilecommunications and business transactions through theInternet and other modern electronic means have nowbecome routine within the circles of the rich and thepowerful  the large majority of the world's population which lives in the poor developing countries  has verylittle or no knowledge about — let alone any accessto — this new and revolutionary way of doing day-to-day business.In this new millennium  the new informationtechnology must be made accessible and affordable tothe people living in the most remote areas of thedeveloping nations in order to facilitate their access tobetter education  better health services and give themgreater access to world markets and businessopportunities. This is a great challenge  but one that wemust face together  and proudly. That is why we havethe United Nations.Last month the national Parliament of Vanuatupassed two laws in this area — the ElectronicTransactions Act and the E-Business Act. We hopethat  through the support of relevant United Nationsagencies and bilateral development partners  we will beable to fully implement these new laws for the benefitof our small island nation and its people  in particularin the rural and remote areas.In his statement to the Millennium Summit  myPrime Minister highlighted the need for theindustrialized countries immediately to ratifyinternational treaties on the protection and sustainablemanagement of our natural environment and resources which are vital to the very survival of millions ofcitizens of small island States. Environmentaldegradation poses a serious threat to the small islandStates  which are threatened by the rising sea level. Wecontinue to urge countries to adopt and ratify the KyotoProtocol as soon as possible. As a signatory to theFramework Convention on Climate Change  Vanuatu isin the process of adding its signature to the Protocol.We cannot let this opportunity pass withoutexpressing our serious concern about the greatdifficulties a least developed country such as theRepublic of Vanuatu is facing with regard to itsapplication to join the World Trade Organization(WTO)  because some powerful countries  in particularthe United States of America  refuse to recognize ourconstant call for special consideration. Vanuatu hasbeen in the complex process of accession for five and ahalf years. The negotiations we were engaged in until27last October with a number of major bilateral andmultilateral players  such as the European Union Japan  Australia  New Zealand  Canada andSwitzerland  have been completed in a spirit ofunderstanding and appreciation of Vanuatu'scircumstances.The United States continues to place heavy andunreasonable demands on us  which we cannot accept.We consider those demands absurd  because the UnitedStates is among our least significant trading partners.We believe that Vanuatu has become the innocentvictim of global trade disputes between the big players.While we have always supported the principle offree international trade  we expect the new regime to bemore realistic and more flexible  to allow ample timefor the small and least developed countries to adjust tothe new rules. After all  the WTO cannot be consideredas a truly global trade regime without the adhesion ofall independent countries  including small islandStates.It is no secret  as the Vanuatu Prime Ministerclearly stated at the recent G-77 Summit in Havana that the conditions being imposed on us for joining theWTO are simply beyond our capacity to consider in theshort to medium term. Unless the powerful countriesreview their positions and conditions with regard to ourapplication  then the Republic of Vanuatu will have noother choice but to reconsider its original application tojoin the WTO.On a related issue  we would also like to take thisopportunity to register our most sincere recognition toall the Governments in the Pacific and other regions fortheir consistent support for Vanuatu's status as a leastdeveloped country. We continue to maintain our strongbelief that the United Nations criteria for assessingleast developed country status must be fully reviewedand must take into account new indices  such as theEnvironmental Vulnerability Index  and the long-termimpacts of such natural disasters as cyclones  tsunamisand others on countries' social and economicadvancement.Enhancing the role of the peacekeeping forces ofthe United Nations must also be a priority for thisAssembly. It is in this spirit that Vanuatu commendsthe Brahimi report on peacekeeping  believing that once implemented  it will allow the United Nations tocarry out its peacekeeping operations effectively. Atthis juncture  I am proud to say that  in spite of ourmeagre resources  Vanuatu is participating  for the firsttime in its 20-year history as an independent nation  inUnited Nations peacekeeping missions in East Timorand Bosnia. Prior to this attainment  Vanuatu alsoserved in some regional peace-monitoring missions.In his statement to the Millennium Summit  thePrime Minister of Vanuatu touched on an importantissue: the principle of self-determination and therelated question of West Papua. The case of WestPapua has always been high on Vanuatu's agenda. In1984  the late Prime Minister and father of ourindependence  Walter Hadye Lini  said:“We may not have the resources to supporttheir struggle  but we can remember them in oureveryday prayers. For when we talk about theirstruggle  we must always use the name that wasvery dear to them: West Papua.”The United Nations must be consistent in itsdecisions concerning the recognition and respect of thefundamental right to self-determination of the peopleof West Papua. The truth surrounding the so-called actof free choice must be exposed to the Melanesiansisters and brothers of West Papua and to the rest of theinternational community. Saddest of all was GeneralAssembly resolution 2504 (XXIV) of 1969 on WestPapua. How can the United Nations continue to ignorethe cries of over 3 million people demanding justice?This year marks the end of the InternationalDecade for the Eradication of Colonialism. It is onlyappropriate that the United Nations should reconsiderand revisit the decisions taken at that time. Followingthe tragedy in East Timor  Vanuatu believes that it isnot too late for the international community to act tohalt a similar tragedy in West Papua. In this context Vanuatu would like to strongly request that the issue ofWest Papua be placed for discussion on the agenda ofthe Committee of 24. Any move to oppose this willmost certainly undermine the credibility of the UnitedNations and its decisions on this special case. Over thepast few decades  the United Nations has positivelycontributed to the process of decolonization. We mustnot allow this opportunity to pass.On the question of reform  we agree that anyreforms should include the Security Council in order tomake it more democratic and transparent. Themembership of the Security Council should be enlargednot only to enhance geographic representation  but alsoin response to the aspirations felt at all levels of the28world community and to the voice of the leastdeveloped countries and small island States.Vanuatu would like to congratulate all thosecountries that recognize the need for a properevaluation and assessment of the crisis situations in Fijiand the Solomon Islands prior to taking punitivemeasures  if any. We in the Republic of Vanuatubelieve that traditional economic and other forms ofsanctions against individual countries in times of crisisshould be fully reviewed in this new millennium. Inthis respect  the delegation of Vanuatu would like toexpress its sincere appreciation to Sir John Kaputin Minister for Foreign Affairs of Papua New Guinea who so ably led the Pacific ministerial mission of theAfrican-Caribbean-Pacific Group of States to Fiji andthe Solomon Islands in order to carefully assess thesituation in the two countries. The mission was alsocomprised of the Foreign Minister of the Cook Islands Mr. Robert Woonton; the Minister for Foreign Affairsof Vanuatu; and the Minister of Education of Samoa Ms. Fiame Naomi Mata'afa.I would also like to take this opportunity tocommend Mr. Laisenia Qarase  Prime Minister andMinister for National Reconciliation and Unity in theInterim Administration of the Republic of the FijiIslands  for his eloquent statement on the situation inFiji. We would also like to extend our appreciation toMr. Danny Philip  Minister for Foreign Affairs of theSolomon Islands  for his comprehensive statement.We have made visionary statements. Now is thetime for us to translate these into action. We havecalled for a more efficient  responsive and effectiveUnited Nations. We must muster the good will toresolutely implement the Millennium Declaration andto rededicate ourselves to upholding the fundamentalprinciples of the United Nations. Let us not lose sightof these goals."
"176",7516,"YEM",55,2000,"Permitme  at the outset  to extend to you  Mr. President  mycongratulations on your election to the presidency ofthe fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly. Let mealso pay a tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Theo-BenGurirab  who guided the work of the previous sessionof the General Assembly most successfully.This session acquires special importance  notonly because it is the first of the new millennium  butalso because it coincides with the convening of theMillennium Summit  which gathered together  for thefirst time  a majority of the world's leaders. Therefore the historic instruments that emerged from the Summitwere a culmination of that momentous occasion.The Republic of Yemen  as President AliAbdullah Saleh emphasized in his statement at theMillennium Summit  is committed to achieving thoseideals and objectives  supporting the leadership role ofthe United Nations and promoting the purposes of itsCharter  with a view to upholding the principles offreedom  equality and justice  so that every society canassume its national responsibilities for comprehensiveand sustainable development  including povertyeradication  the provision of food  shelter  health careand education  ensuring fundamental freedoms  humanrights and democracy and enabling women to play theirrole in society.Accordingly  the Republic of Yemen supportsefforts by the Secretary-General to develop the role mechanisms and organs of the internationalOrganization to meet the challenges of twenty-firstcentury. It also supports moves towards the renewaland development of inter-State relations and towardsbringing them into line with new global phenomenathat call for democracy  respect for human rights andthe transformation of globalization into a positive forcethat will benefit all inhabitants of the world. In thisconnection  the Republic of Yemen reaffirms itsinvitation to host the Fifth International Conference ofNew or Restored Democracies  to be held in 2003.Our world has become a single village whereevents interact globally with no room for isolationism.The merging of States' economies is the mostprominent feature of mutual dependency and consequently  of shared responsibility aimed at creatingan environment at the national and global levelsconducive to development and poverty eradication.Good governance  as stated in the United NationsMillennium Declaration  must exist not only withineach country but at the international level and be basedon laws and transparency in financial  monetary andtrading systems.2In our view  this requires that the developedindustrialized countries fulfil their commitments toprovide official development assistance to developingcountries  address the special needs of the leastdeveloped countries  provide debt relief to poorcountries and agree to cancel all official bilateral debts.Within this context we would also include the removalof all barriers against the exports of developingcountries seeking access to world markets.This year our people celebrated the tenthanniversary of the restoration of blessed Yemeni unity.The Republic of Yemen has been able to achievesuccesses in the democratic process  freedom  justice respect for human rights and the enablement of womento play their role in society. While our people proceedto incorporate new concepts  with the aim of adaptingto new world developments  they suffer from thefinancial burdens and the assumption of tasks inherentin comprehensive economic and social reform. Inaddition  the processes relating to economicliberalization — lifting subsidies on various foods andfuel and reducing public services  as prescribed byinternational financing institutions — have createdsocial tensions. We therefore call upon the advancedindustrialized countries to understand this underlyingreality of shared responsibility in the context ofcomprehensive and sustainable development in thedeveloping countries as a guarantee for internationaldevelopment  security and stability.The Republic of Yemen has persevered inadvocating attainment of peace and stability at theregional and the international levels by the surest ways namely by resolving all disputes peacefully andthrough the use of mechanisms for the resolution ofdisputes  which embodies faith in the purposes andprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations. We inthe Republic of Yemen are proud to have placedpractical reliance on those principles in resolvingborder issues with three neighbouring States: theSultanate of Oman  Eritrea and  recently  the Kingdomof Saudi Arabia.A new era of brotherhood  cooperation andmutual interests between the Republic of Yemen andthe fraternal Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was inauguratedon 12 June 2000  following the signature of a treatybetween the two countries on international territorialand maritime boundaries. We deem it an historicachievement by all criteria  since it ends a long periodof tension and instability. The frontiers between thecountries have become bridges of love  brotherhoodand cooperation. This will  unquestionably  contributeto general stability in the region.Within this framework one may understandYemen's strong desire and long-term efforts tocontribute to a resolution of the problems that haveplagued Somalia. Now that the Arta conference hasbeen held  the Transitional National Assembly has beenconstituted and the country's President has beenelected  we support the implementation of theresolutions that emerged from the conference. We hopethat the consensus between the representatives of thevarious Somali factions present at the conference willlead to stability and prepare the way for thecommencement of a process of comprehensive andsustainable development in an atmosphere of nationalreconciliation. In this regard  we must commend thegreat efforts made by President Ismail Omar Guelleh ofthe Republic of Djibouti to ensure the success of theArta conference.The return to normalcy in Somalia willunquestionably promote security and stability in theHorn of Africa  which has suffered the scourge of warand its effects. That suffering can be seen in the cross-border flows of refugees. In the case of Yemen hundreds of thousands of refugees from Somalia andother States of the region have infiltrated the countryvia our coasts. We appeal to the internationalcommunity to extend assistance to resolve the problemof refugees and ensure their return to their homelandsfor the sake of stability and reconstruction in theregion.The Republic of Yemen believes that the peacethat people seek is a peace based on justice  equalityand respect for human rights. Accordingly  peace in theMiddle East should be based primarily on therestoration of all the legitimate rights of the Palestinianpeople. Foremost among those rights is theestablishment of an independent Palestinian State onPalestinian soil with Jerusalem as its capital. Israelmust also withdraw from all occupied Arab territoriesin the Syrian Golan.We would also like to convey our esteem andcongratulations to fraternal Lebanon and its people onthe unconditional liberation of its southern part.The world is still amassing large quantities ofweapons of mass destruction. Those weapons endangerinternational security and stability and hinder any steps3towards finding solutions to development problems. Inaccordance with relevant resolutions of the GeneralAssembly  we in the Republic of Yemen stress theimportance of making the Middle East region an areafree from nuclear weapons and all weapons of massdestruction. We also endorse the internationalcommunity's call to exert pressure on Israel to adhereto the Non-Proliferation Treaty and to place all itsnuclear installations under international supervision.Iraq is experiencing a human tragedy as a resultof the embargo that has been imposed on it for 10years. While calling for the implementation of UnitedNations resolutions concerning Iraq  we stress fromthis rostrum the need to end that tragic situation bylifting the embargo. It has lasted too long and hascaused very extensive damage to the entire Iraqipopulation  especially women  children and elderlypersons. In the same vein  we call for a complete liftingof the embargoes imposed on the Sudan and Libya.With regard to the dispute over the three ArabianGulf islands belonging to the United Arab Emirates Yemen hopes that an amicable and peaceful solution tothat issue will be decided along the lines followed bythe Republic of Yemen in the resolution of its borderdisputes with its neighbours.Lastly  we welcome all the resolutions calling forthe reform of the United Nations and its structure so asto make it more transparent and democratic  includingresolutions concerning the expansion of themembership of the Security Council and enhancing andstrengthening the role of the General Assembly in themaintenance of international peace and security.It is our hope that resolutions will be adopted atthis important session to contribute to the reform andrestructuring of the United Nations and its organs inorder that it may meet the requirements of the newcentury  with its increasing problems and ever morecomplex inter-State relations.It is our responsibility to make this session anoccasion to review our work and to examine theresolutions adopted by our leaders at the MillenniumSummit so that we can transform them into tangiblereality. Doing so will further our progress towardsachieving security  stability  development andprosperity for our countries and peoples. I amconfident that our united stance and sincere endeavourswill guarantee the success of this session and theachievement of the desired results."
"177",7582,"ZAF",55,2000,"﻿Allow me tocongratulate you  Mr. President  on your assumption ofthe stewardship of this historic Assembly and also tocongratulate your predecessor  Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab on his sterling guidance of the Assembly's work duringthe previous session.The dawn of the new millennium offers us aunique opportunity to reflect on the successes andfailures of the United Nations since its inception. Italso provides us with an opportunity to dream about thefuture of humanity in the third millennium. Thefounders of the United Nations based the Charter onthe assertion of human dignity  human rights and theequality of women and men and the aim of promotingbetter social standards. Indeed  billions of people todayenjoy human rights and live in dignity  free fromdisease  ignorance and fear  enjoying the benefits oftechnology and scientific advances and able to take fulladvantage of the process of globalization. Equally there are billions who are humiliated  degraded andstripped of their innate human dignity and worth bypoverty  disease  ignorance  homelessness  hunger andwars.This Assembly  following the very inspiringMillennium Summit  provides us with an opportunityto reflect on the wise words of the leaders of the worldand on the Declaration they adopted. Global consensushas at last emerged and confirms that we live in oneworld and belong to the same human race; therefore while each Government has the responsibility to takecare of its citizens  we all have to work together for thegood of humanity as a whole. This means that we haveto create a people-centred world that is more caring with a strong sense of solidarity  where we are all ourbrothers' and sisters' keepers  if I may borrow thosewords from the Bible.There is also universal consensus now that whilebillions of people are being degraded and dehumanizedby poverty  disease and hunger  there are indeedenough resources in the world to feed  educate andrestore the dignity of all human beings and make thisworld a better place for all. It is therefore clear that theeradication of hunger and poverty should be thepriority of all priorities and should be our collectiveresponsibility.There is also agreement that we have a collectiveresponsibility in dealing with infectious diseases  suchas malaria  tuberculosis and sexually transmitteddiseases  especially HIV/AIDS. There is a need tomobilize material and human resources  provide betterinfrastructure  provide health education and ensureaccess to affordable medicine.There is also consensus that Africa poses thebiggest development challenge. The success or failureof the United Nations and of humankind as a whole inthis century will be determined by their success indealing with the African development challenge.We would like to urge the United Nations  inpartnership with the Organization of African Unity andregional organizations  to accelerate the work towardspeace and stability in many of the countries of ourcontinent  such as Sierra Leone  Ethiopia  Eritrea Somalia  Angola  the Democratic Republic of theCongo  Sudan and Burundi  so that these countries maytake their rightful place in the continent  be seized withthe needs of their people  promote development produce and export goods and not be areas of perpetualsuffering and war that result in their being the netexporters of refugees. We welcome the Brahimi reportand are studying it  as it contains very serioussuggestions about the future operations of the UnitedNations.The United Nations  particularly the SecurityCouncil  is humanity's principal agent for collectivesecurity and it needs urgent reform so as to be able tolive up to this solemn responsibility. The world haschanged dramatically and continues to do so. It isimperative that the composition and role of theSecurity Council reflect that change and not remainobsolete. The Bretton Woods institutions are equally inneed of urgent reform in order to discharge theirmandate and respond to the new development12challenge. The World Trade Organization has to adaptits international trade rules so that they are equitableand fair and take account of global developmentchallenges.It is a source of great concern to the developingcountries that  increasingly  decisions are taken outsidethe United Nations and other global structures bydeveloped and rich countries when these decisionshave a great impact on the poorer countries anddirectly affect the lives of billions of poor people. Thatis why a partnership between poor and rich countriesand dialogue between North and South are so critical.Nuclear weapons still constitute a threat to ourplanet. We have to pursue the path of universaldisarmament and the destruction of all weapons ofmass destruction.The need to protect the environment has assumedgreater importance and we can succeed only if we worktogether.The self-determination of the people of EastTimor  Western Sahara and Palestine must be a concernto all of us. To this end  we urge the United Nations todo all it can to expedite the processes in East Timorand Western Sahara. We commend the peace efforts inthe Middle East and the role of the United States. Wewould like to pledge our support to the Palestinian andIsraeli leaderships as they try to find creative solutionsto their problems. They must be urged to takeadvantage of this unique historic moment  as it seemsthat a real possibility exists for a solution.The equality of women and men still remains asubject of great concern. All we need to do is lookaround this Hall to realize how far we are fromrealizing the vision of the founding Members of theUnited Nations. Secondly  the feminization of povertyis a big problem. The marginalization of women  bothin their countries and in the multilateral forums  meansthat our countries and organizations  including theUnited Nations  are functioning at half-capacity and aredeprived of the unique qualities  energies and creativitythat women would bring. In this context  I cannotforget the plight of Aung San Suu Kyi in Burma. Shedeserves active support from this gathering and theworld.The United Nations was founded in part to makesure that the monsters of fascism and racism should notrear their ugly heads again. Unfortunately  all over theworld racism and xenophobia are on the increase.Some countries and regions are responding bydeveloping a new fortress mentality  which does nothelp the situation. This should flash red warning lightsto all of us and activate our utmost vigilance againstthe scourges of racism and xenophobia.It is only when we turn our backs on racism xenophobia and other forms of discrimination that wecan succeed in building a caring world where we feeldiminished by the suffering and hunger of other humanbeings. It was for this reason that we felt a sense ofobligation and agreed to host the world racismConference next year. Of course  our country andpeople experienced the most systematic  most brutaland most inhumane form of racism  which the UnitedNations declared a crime against humanity. We arehappy to take our place in the fight against racism inour country and in the world. It is our fervent hope thatthe Conference will come up with a programme ofaction against racism  xenophobia and other forms ofdiscrimination.In conclusion  let us all put our collective will courage and intellectual creativity together in shapingthe dream of a better world; a world of solidarity; aworld where no child should starve or die ofpreventable and curable diseases; a world where nochild will be deprived of schooling; a world wherechildren will not be sent to war; a world where no childcan be a slave or be used as an object for trafficking; aworld where children grow up as children and playwith toys and do not have to be breadwinners or worryabout where their next meal is going to come from; aworld where women will enjoy all rights and where theeradication of poverty and war is our collectiveresponsibility.The dream for the new millennium is indeedrealisable. If we act with courage and determination we can turn the hopes of billions across the world intoreality."
"178",7660,"ZWE",55,2000,"I wish tocongratulate Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland on hiselection to the presidency of this historic session of theGeneral Assembly. I also take this opportunity tocongratulate his predecessor  my dear brother andcolleague  Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  the Foreign Ministerof Namibia  on a job well done.Zimbabwe joins other Members of the Assemblyin welcoming the admission of Tuvalu as the onehundred and eighty-ninth Member State of the UnitedNations.Since a Millennium Assembly can only comeonce in a lifetime  it is my singular honour andpleasure to address this Assembly. The twentiethcentury was probably the most eventful in the historyand the experience of Zimbabwe. As we enter thetwenty-first century and the new millennium  thepeople of Zimbabwe  in a very symbolic and yethistoric way  find themselves concluding painfulchapters of their experience  whose closure is critical tothe laying of a foundation for a better future.Structural inequalities are a fundamental realityof Africa's colonial past  which many countries like myown are grappling with to this day. In my country 70per cent of Zimbabwe's best arable land is stillcontrolled by less than 1 per cent of the population —roughly 4 500 settlers or their descendants. This is in acountry of nearly 13 million people. It is a historicalfact that the colonial regime forcefully robbed us ofthis land without paying us any compensation. As Ispeak  the Government of Zimbabwe is in the processof taking back 5 million of the 12 million hectares ofour prime land to settle landless peasants.Zimbabwe's land reform programme is meant notonly to correct the wrongs wrought on our society bycolonialism  but also to restore our people's heritageand basic means of subsistence and economicparticipation. In this endeavour  we have receivedneither the cooperation of those sectors of our societyto which colonialism bequeathed special privileges  northe acknowledgement or support of former colonizerswho willed those privileges. In pursuit of their policies those powerful interests have employed their financialmight  as well as their control of the media to not onlychoke our economy but also to demonize us before theworld.We cannot  in one breath  pay lip service tohuman rights  equality and poverty eradication and  inthe next  defend inequality  which condemns themajority to a life in squalor. We invite all our partnersto see through the veil of the negative and racist media19blitz  acquaint themselves with our people's real needfor justice  restoration and agrarian reform and help usremove the barriers that constrain poor people's abilityto benefit from their economy and to contribute to itsgrowth.Our determination to undertake land reform inZimbabwe is one of the “crimes” cited in the so-calledZimbabwe Democracy Act 2000  which was passed bythe United States Senate in June this year and is beforeCongress as I speak. It proposes to prescribe theoutcome of our land reform exercise and seeks tovirtually usurp the authority of the Parliament ofZimbabwe. Most ironically  the so-called DemocracyAct proposes to authorize the investment of UnitedStates funds of around Z$ 300 million in the breedingof opposition parties in Zimbabwe. That amount  whichis exclusively for opposition parties  is more than fourtimes the Z$70 million distributed by the Zimbabweanfiscus among all political parties that have a stipulatedthreshold representation in Parliament. Are weexpected to just stand idly by and watch helplessly asour destiny is determined from outside our country?Where  I ask  is our self-determination and oursovereignty  for which so much blood and so manylives were sacrificed by our people?The measure seeks to hurt Zimbabwe's fortuneseven further by issuing United States directors at theInternational Monetary Fund and the World Bank withstanding directives to vote against Zimbabwe at everyopportunity. This means that even if Zimbabwe met allmacroeconomic requirements and exercised therequisite fiscal discipline it would still be disqualifiedin its quest for assistance from the Bretton Woodsinstitutions  on the basis of political considerations thatare totally extraneous to the stipulated technicalcriteria.Just what are the rules of the game  and to whomare these international financial institutionsaccountable? Do we need any further justification forthe resounding call for a new international financialarchitecture? For while the current internationalfinancial architecture is subservient to the interests ofthe rich and the strong  even to the satisfaction of theirlast extraterritorial exploit  it remains for everinsensitive to the survival needs of the small  the weakand the poor.Zimbabwe's involvement in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo to help prevent mayhem bloodshed and the overthrow of a legitimateGovernment there is another “crime” cited in theZimbabwe Democracy Act 2000. At the invitation ofthe Government of the Democratic Republic of theCongo  Zimbabwe  together with other allies of theSouthern African Development Community (SADC) sent troops to the Democratic Republic of the Congo tohelp fend off an invasion by two of that country'sneighbours. The responsive intervention of the SADCallies effectively contained the situation andestablished the relative calm and stability prevailing inthe Democratic Republic of the Congo today. It alsopaved the way for the peace process that culminated inthe signing last year of the Lusaka CeasefireAgreement  which  all involved agree  offers the besthope for establishing and maintaining peace in theregion.What does Zimbabwe get in return for itssacrifices in upholding the principles of the UnitedNations Charter? Sanctions and threats of moresanctions are the response. For helping to create thevery conditions that enabled the United Nations to setfoot in the Democratic Republic of the Congo Zimbabwe is today questioned  tried and sentenced topariah status. Some of the proponents of the ZimbabweDemocracy Act 2000 have demanded that Zimbabwewithdraw its troops from the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo before they can even consider withdrawingthat measure.Are we being punished for creating conditionsthat enabled the United Nations and other humanitarianagencies to deliver assistance to Congolesecommunities? Are we being vilified for enablingthousands of Congolese children to get poliovaccinations and other types of life-savingimmunization? After offering our partnership in thequest for peace and human well-being  we expect theinternational community to respond accordingly andcooperate with us.Instead of punishing those who invaded theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  instead ofcensuring those who are violating the nationalsovereignty and territorial integrity of the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo  in blatant desecration ofcardinal principles of the Charter  instead ofquestioning those who are already in contempt ofSecurity Council orders to withdraw immediately fromthe Democratic Republic of the Congo  some membersof the international community have chosen  rather  to20victimize Zimbabwe  whose troops are in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo at the invitation ofthe Government of that country. Exactly what outcomedoes the international community wish to see in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo?I reiterate  and categorically so  that Zimbabwe iscommitted to the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement and toSecurity Council resolutions adopted on this question.In this regard  Zimbabwe is ready to immediatelywithdraw its troops from the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo  under the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement  assoon as the United Nations deploys peacekeepers inthat country. We therefore urge the Secretary-Generalto deploy the observer mission already authorized bythe Security Council as part of phase two deployment so that we can move to phase three and the deploymentof actual peacekeepers in order to enable us to leavethe Democratic Republic of the Congo.Like their neighbours in the Democratic Republicof the Congo  the peace-loving people of Angola arevictims of an imposed war that has been fomented bygreed rather than grievance. While the crisis is far fromresolved  we are mollified by the position taken by theSecurity Council  through the Angola sanctionsCommittee  to ensure the effective application of theembargo against UNITA. We support the SecretaryGeneral's stance of naming and shaming the violatorsof sanctions as a way of preventing the opportunismand greed that fan conflicts. This was the positionadopted by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) atits last summit  in Lomé  Togo.In both the Democratic Republic of the Congoand Angola  we challenge the United Nations  and theSecurity Council in particular  to come to the aid anddefence of the innocent victims of war  to protect theirnatural heritage and resources from pillage  and tosafeguard their territorial integrity and nationalsovereignty.With regard to the Lockerbie affair  we still awaitthe Security Council's comprehensive and finalresponse to Libya's full compliance with the Council'sresolutions. It was the Council's own commitment thatsuch a conclusive step would be taken 90 days afterLibya's full compliance. We call for transparency andfairness in the trial itself  at The Hague  to avoid anymiscarriage of justice.The international community must never losetrack of the long  drawn-out dialogue on the peaceprocess in the Middle East  particularly in Palestine.We call for good faith and consistency in thenegotiations until the brotherly Palestinian peopleattain statehood with national sovereignty andterritorial integrity.In Western Sahara  the international communityowes it to the Sahrawi people to ensure the earlyholding of a free and fair referendum to allow them thepriceless opportunity to determine their destiny.On the global economic front  the last decade ofthe twentieth century witnessed tremendous progress insome parts of the world  but it also saw stagnation andsetbacks  even in some countries that had previouslyexperienced fast economic growth. Periods ofeconomic and financial crisis lead to retrenchment wherein concern for people gives way to concern forbalancing budgets and payments. Those crises haveunderscored the importance of understanding andstrengthening the social underpinnings of developmentto ensure that peoples  their cultures and their societiesare taken into account in the process of development.Poverty amid plenty is an affront to our commonhumanity. At a time when the world has thewherewithal to attack poverty vigorously  spectacularaffluence and abject poverty are found side by side. Incontrast to its potential as the ultimate provider of newopportunities for growth and development worldwide globalization has been accompanied by wideningincome disparities among  as well as within  countriesand regions. Its ill effects have disproportionatelyvictimized the most vulnerable and marginalizednations and sections of society. Globalization isredefining the nature and role of States and thegovernance of international bodies  therebysubordinating democratic political processes tounaccountable economic and financial actors andinstitutions. Globalization is thus undermining theability of Governments to serve as guarantors of thesocial  economic  political and cultural health of ourcommunities.At the expense of our common goals andobjectives for international economic cooperation  wehave surrendered to blind market forces in the fainthope that somehow things will  as if by magic  turn outright. The consequences of that impoverishing processare clearly visible in a number of alarming trends  suchas the takeover of national assets by transnationalcorporations in the name of public enterprise21privatization and commercialization. As a result  Africaenters the new century hanging on the vagaries ofglobal markets  accounting for only 1 per cent of globalgross domestic product and about 2 per cent of worldtrade.Geographically  Africa is probably the world'smost fragmented region. The continent is demarcatedby about 165 borders dividing it into 53 countries  22of them with less than 5 million people and 11 withless than 1 million. That fragmentation imposes realconstraints on development  and  without economicintegration  Africa will fall farther behind. Wetherefore call upon the international community tosupport our efforts at regional integration as wepromote regional public assets and initiatives including regional infrastructure such as roads railways  ports and power-pooling systems  infectiousdisease control  centres of excellence for training regional markets and trade  and agricultural researchand early warning systems for drought.Despite talk of the global village  it is apparentthat Africa's lonely days are not yet over. For we stillhave cause and occasion to feel marginalized in somany respects. We know what it is like to give passageto emergency aircraft and sea vessels that criss-crossour airspace and waterways to attend to emergingcrises in distant places while our own crises simmer onand explode in our faces. Our ceasefire agreements andtruces are tested beyond limit  while the UnitedNations stands aloof and unimpressed; yet urgentinterventions are deployed to flashpoints in otherregions  even without ceasefire guarantees.Hesitant and half-spirited interventions by theSecurity Council in several African conflicts haveneither done the job nor enhanced the credibility of theUnited Nations. As the United Nations organ uniquelymandated to maintain international peace and security the Security Council should make itself equallyattentive to the needs of the world's family of nations including through cooperation with regionalarrangements everywhere  as provided for in ChapterVIII of the United Nations Charter. Or is it true that solong as the Security Council remains unreformed  itwill always fail to respond adequately to the interestsof all the Members of the United Nations?As we review the progress of nations and designthe role of the United Nations in the twenty-firstcentury  we need to remind ourselves that “we thepeoples” of the world constitute the real wealth of thebrotherhood of nations. The thrust of the UnitedNations agenda — and  indeed  of development — istherefore to create an enabling environment for peopleto enjoy long  healthy  peaceful and creative lives.I wish to put it to this Millennium Assembly thatthe role of the United Nations in the twenty-firstcentury is to champion the agenda of the world's weak those marginalized and impoverished by globalization those currently circumscribed to the margins of policyand decision-making in the international economic andsocio-political system. In brief  it is to protect the weakand manage the strong."
