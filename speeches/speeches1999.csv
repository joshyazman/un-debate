"1",29,"AFG",54,1999,"Allow me to join thespeakers preceding me to congratulate you  Sir  on yourelection as the President of the General Assembly at thissession  the last of the present century. You surely arewell versed in this high office through your experiencewith the United Nations  which will make of thecentennial transition the launching platform for ever-more-fruitful future undertakings.As we embark on the next century  the survival ofthe United Nations as an effective global institutioncomes into question. Can its role develop in the dawn ofa new era? Or will it be more like a brilliant sunset?From the League of Nations to the United Nations  wehave continuously pinned our hopes on the UnitedNations system  looking forward to a promising worldruled by law  governed by justice and blessed with peace.However  the wide-ranging challenges — fromquestions relating to the maintenance of internationalpeace and security  the eradication of poverty  sustainabledevelopment  economic growth and social progress toglobalization in meaningful terms — all yet to be met andrequire firm resolve and certainly not mere rhetoric.As crises continue to unfold throughout the world we must ask  and answer  certain important questions.Why are threats to international peace and securityvariably defined and selectively determined from place toplace? Why are State violators of the United NationsCharter and international law  including the principle ofnon-interference  not brought to justice? Why are theinstigators of “ethnic cleansing” and the perpetrators of9genocide and of crimes against humanity not checked? Whyis the fight against terrorism and narcotics so limited? Andfinally  where and when will gender apartheid come to anend?We are convinced that those challenges and crises canbest be dealt with if the United Nations actively functionswithin a framework similar to that of a state system. In thiscontext  the United Nations Charter serves as an explicitand clear reference outlining the rights and responsibilities in their entirety  of the Member States.The advent of the new millennium marks the closingof the twentieth century. This is a time for the UnitedNations to pause and assess the gains and losses  and thesuccesses and setbacks  it has experienced since itsfounding. The United Nations cannot truly embark on thenext millennium until it has conclusively addressed theunfinished items on its agenda and the many existing globalthreats. One item on — and perhaps at the top of — thatagenda  though it is far from finalized  relates to Pakistanihegemonic actions and that country’s collusion withTalibanism in our region.The Pakistani-Taliban occupation of land inAfghanistan represents a clear breach of a fundamentalprinciple of international law  namely  the inadmissibility ofthe acquisition of territory by force. It is trans-borderaggression. In addition  as the report of the SpecialRapporteur (E/CN.4/1999/40)  states in paragraph 18  theTaliban“continue to pursue policies which are in conflict withinternational human rights standards by whichAfghanistan is bound as a party to the majorinternational human rights instruments.”Furthermore  the Taliban has committed repeated warcrimes and crimes against humanity  including forceddeportation; the forced displacement of hundreds ofthousands of people; the separation of thousands of menfrom their families; the widespread burning and leveling ofhouses and entire villages; the systematic destruction of theagricultural base and the irrigation systems  resulting in theloss of crops due for harvesting; and the execution of ascorched-earth policy. This has been particularly true  on amassive scale  in the Shamali Plains  following the July 19Tashkent meeting of the group of “six plus two”  and justthis week in Khoja Ghar  in north-eastern Afghanistan.Their policies of genocide  gender apartheid  trafficking ofwomen and girls  “ethnic cleansing”  religious and sectarianextermination  rigid interpretation of religion  and thepursuit of a military solution spell out the Taliban actionsin Afghanistan. They persist in their extremist agenda andadvocacy of terrorism. The increase in drug productionand trafficking  the Talibanization of the region and theirdenunciation of the international community continueunabated.In sum  over 50 per cent of the Afghan populationhas been placed under virtual house arrest  and the entirepopulation remains terrorized by the Taliban. Theinternational community is greatly disturbed andconcerned by the ominous nature of the Taliban agenda.The responsibility of the much-discussed yetunresolved turmoil in Afghanistan continues to lie withthe Pakistani leadership. Pakistan remains a proponent ofarm-twisting  both nuclear and conventional  in SouthAsia. Afghanistan’s Pakistani-dictated position ofsubordination  through the Taliban  has long underminedthe peace process. Pakistan remains implacably opposedto the formation of a fully representative  multi-ethnicgovernment in Afghanistan  insisting that the Taliban notrelinquish power but gain further control. To this end inter alia  thousands of Pakistani military personnel members of the paramilitary  former commissionedofficers and thousands of recruits and “volunteers” fromPakistani religious schools have been trained anddispatched into Afghanistan for what has been called a“jihad”.The remarks made on 30 July 1999 by AmbassadorLakhdar Brahimi  head of the United Nations SpecialMission to Afghanistan (UNSMA)  regarding the presenceof thousands of armed Pakistani nationals fightingalongside the Taliban  provide credible testimony.In this context  perhaps the article by retiredBrigadier Usman Khalid  published in the Pakistani dailyThe Frontier Post of 29 September 1999  just three daysago  best spells out the Pakistani security dilemma in theform of a bold confession. It states that“the armed forces of Pakistan have been steadfast inplaying their role in safeguarding the security of thecountry [Pakistan]. They have sought to safeguardthe nuclear deterrent of Pakistan  resisted pressuresto withdraw support from the mujahidin in Kashmir and have been steadfast in their support to theTaliban in Afghanistan. All of these are of vitalimportance to Pakistan’s security and survival.”10In fact  it is the intervention of Pakistan inAfghanistan  its support for the Taliban and its attempts tojustify the Taliban’s defiance of the aspirations of theinternational community  including reprehensible attemptsat Taliban recognition  which has eroded Pakistan’sreputation  causing its political isolation throughout theworld. Those who are aware of the Afghan situation andthe Afghan resolve to resist any foreign rule continue to beperplexed and puzzled in the face of the Pakistani position.However  despite Talibanism and Pakistan’s massivemilitary intervention in Afghanistan — both of whichrepresent obvious breaches of the United Nations Charter international law and international humanitarian law — weare delighted to note that the United Nations  followingyears of skepticism or illusory thinking  appears  perhapsfor the first time and only since the open escalation offoreign military involvement in Afghanistan  to havedeveloped an in-depth perception of the longstanding bitterreality of the Pakistani role  its intervention  and the Talibanagenda in Afghanistan.Yet to our dismay  while this in-depth perception hasbeen so long in developing  the plight of the Afghan nationhas remained unresolved. It is doomed to the terriblepredicament prevailing in many parts of Afghanistan: theinadmissible acquisition of territory by force andinterference in its internal affairs. It is because of thosefundamental questions that at the outset of my statement Iraised the question of the survival of the United Nations asan effective global institution. Given its approach toAfghanistan  can we still put our hope in the UnitedNations system for the resolution of the Afghan crisis orother similar or dissimilar crises? It is our earnestconviction that the litmus test for United Nations survivalwill be its engagement  without any selectivity and in theframework of the State system  in the rigorousimplementation and enforcement of its Charter.Pakistan is blatantly breaching the United NationsCharter  which explicitly requires all Member States torefrain from the threat or use of force against the territorialintegrity or political independence of any State  as well asnumerous General Assembly and Security Councilresolutions and other resolutions on terrorism and the useof mercenaries. The reports of the Secretary-General  hisSpecial Envoy for Afghanistan and the United NationsSpecial Rapporteur on the situation of human rights inAfghanistan clearly bring to light the bellicose  obstinateand intransigent attitude of the Taliban mercenaries.In this context  the United Nations  acting throughthe Security Council  has a duty to maintain internationalpeace and security  in accordance with the Charter. ThePakistani aggression  State-sponsored terrorism and otheractivities  which threaten the peace and security of theregion and hamper regional development and cooperation should be identified  condemned and dealt with by takingappropriate measures.Furthermore  the Islamic State of Afghanistanearnestly expects the Security Council to consider theimposition of immediate sanctions against both theTaliban and their Pakistani mentors  in accordance withparagraph 15 of Security Council resolution 1214 (1998)of 8 December 1998 and in conformity with itsresponsibility under the Charter of the United Nations.The United Nations is also expected to use its goodoffices to convince the Pakistani leadership  including itsmilitary intelligence wing  the Inter-Services Intelligence(ISI)  to steer its policy away from intervention inAfghanistan and towards non-intervention  so that we canmove from a Pakistani-dictated position of subordinationto a mutually dictated position of cooperation. ThePakistani ISI should no longer thwart peace initiatives. Afirst step in this regard would be the withdrawal fromAfghanistan of all armed Pakistanis  whether militarypersonnel or so-called religious volunteers. Pakistanshould also put a halt to its direct assistance to theTaliban  ranging from military hardware and oil toexpertise and tactical advice. Only under such pressurewill the Taliban resume peace negotiations.On the verge of the next millennium  the IslamicState of Afghanistan genuinely hopes that  with theresolution of the Afghan crisis  it will be able to serve asa factor for peace and stability in the region  promotinggood-neighbourliness  mutual respect and cooperation andacting as a transit country for trade between all itsneighbours  without any distinction or preference.The United Nations is earnestly expected to step upits efforts in the Afghan peace process. In this respect  wegreatly appreciate the untiring efforts of the Secretary-General and Ambassador Lakhdar Brahimi  his SpecialEnvoy for Afghanistan. The Islamic State of Afghanistanwelcomes and fully supports the 19 July TashkentDeclaration of the Member States that make up the “sixplus two” group  which it hopes will be fully observed.Regrettably  the Taliban continue to voice theiradamant opposition not only to the Tashkent Declarationbut to all other peace initiatives. We sincerely welcomeparagraph 2 of the report of the Secretary-General(A/54/378) of 21 September 1999  which states “it is noteworthy that only one week after theTashkent meeting  the Taliban began a major offensiveagainst the United Front in the Shomali plains  locatedto the north of Kabul.”Paragraph 3 further states “The Taliban insist that the UF [United Front] mustembrace the Emirate system while the UF question theTaliban's popular mandate to make this demand.”Mindful of the principle that there should be apeaceful resolution of the conflict  the Islamic State ofAfghanistan earnestly desires a broad-based  fullyrepresentative and multi-ethnic government in Afghanistan.The Islamic State of Afghanistan  which is struggling forsovereignty and the return of peace and normalcy throughthe institution of such a government  earnestly aspires to theresolution of fundamental issues such as the restoration ofand full respect for human rights in Afghanistan particularly the rights of women. Under the Taliban  womenhave now been reduced to a voiceless and invisible state ofnon-being  condemned to stay in their houses and strippedof their basic rights  even the rights to work and education all of which is against the genuine tenets of Islam.The Islamic State of Afghanistan welcomes the factthat the first year of the new millennium will be observedas the Year of Dialogue among Civilizations  as called forby the Islamic Republic of Iran  and we believe that it willprepare suitable ground for further understanding among theglobal family  thereby contributing to collective humancivilization.This century introduced a new paradigm based oncollective security and international organizations  concertedapproaches and international order  all based on the equalsovereignty of States. From the United Nations Charter tothe Universal Declaration of Human Rights  the newparadigm has affected all corners of the world. As atroubled member of this global family  Afghanistan awaitsa collective endeavour by the international community todeal with its problems  thereby helping the world  or atleast a part of the world  to become a better place forhumankind."
"2",68,"AGO",54,1999,"Allow me  to begin  Sir by congratulating you on behalf of the Government of theRepublic of Angola  and on my own behalf  on yourelection as president of the General Assembly at this fifty-fourth session. Your election to such an important post isrecognition of your experience  ability and diplomaticcapacity  as well as of Namibia’s role internationally.Angola and Namibia not only share a long common border but also have close political  economic  cultural andhistorical links. We sincerely hope that your mandate willbe crowned with success.Our congratulations also go to the outgoing President Mr. Didier Opertti  for the excellent work carried outduring his mandate.To the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr.Kofi Annan  we would like also to express our thanks forthe wise and transparent manner in which he has led ourOrganization.It is also a pleasure for us to welcome the newmembers of the United Nations  the Republic of Kiribati the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga. Theiraccession reflects the universal nature of the principlesand rules of the United Nations Charter. Angola isconvinced that these States will be able to successfullytake up their responsibilities  thereby contributing to thestrengthening of our Organization and the stability anddevelopment of the South Pacific region and the world asa whole.For half a century  the Organization has carried outactivities to promote the ideals contained in its Charter.With the end of the cold war we thought that large-scalefratricidal wars would be things of the past; that the worldwould no longer experience tension and insecurity; thatby now we would be in a position to welcome anarrowing of the gap between the rich and poor countries;that a significant part of humanity would be free from thedanger of dying of poverty and misery. However  thesethings have not happened. The world is hostage to itself.There is a plethora of new armed conflicts as a result ofhatred and racial  ethnic and religious intolerance; of thedenial of people’s right to self-determination; and even ofthe unfathomable ambition of certain politicians to takepower by force or to attempt to thwart peoples’ sovereignwill to choose their own destinies.The proliferation of armed conflicts is  to someextent  a reflection of the absence of an internationalsecurity system under the aegis of the United Nations thatwould be able to respond immediately and correctly topotential conflicts. Despite instability in various areas ofthe world  there has been a weak commitment toestablishing such a security system because of a lack ofpolitical will on the part of certain members of theinternational community. This indicates that the world isstill very far from achieving the long-desired peace anddevelopment. Worse yet is the fact that certain entities ofinternational law approach the need for peace in the worldfrom a perspective of material and global strategicinterests — and at the expense of the universal humanvalues.It weighs on our conscience to see that we still havea long way to go to find solutions to situations of thisnature  and that the international community’s reactionsto similar situations of human suffering are not consistent.These facts might lead us to believe that we aredealing with a double standard and with measuredpolicies that are at variance with the spirit and letter of32the Charter of the United Nations. The United Nations andthe international community as a whole have the political legal and moral duty to work a little harder  so that peoplesfacing the scourge of the war will be able to achieve lastingpeace. The main objective of the United Nations can beachieved worldwide  provided that there is coherence anddetermination in the application of principles and decisions.The global tolerance of impunity has been encouragingthe leaders of the rebel groups proliferating throughout theworld to carry out their terrorist and destructive campaigns the main victim of which is civil society. The differentialtreatment accorded to identical situations of systematic andmassive violations of human rights and the war crimes thatare occurring in some areas of the world makes itimpossible for the international justice system to act withthe required effectiveness in dealing with some of the mostbarbaric and bloodthirsty criminals that Africa has seen thiscentury. We are convinced that if the political and moralpower of the United Nations were exerted against all theperpetrators of serious crimes  it would dishearten all thosewho might be willing to resort to subversion and terrorism.Thus the international community would be preventing theemergence of new conflicts.We are fully aware that States have the primaryresponsibility for paving the way for the prevention ofconflicts. The implementation of democracy  which maypromote respect for human rights and the establishment ofneighbourly relations  may be able to contribute topreventing the occurrence of conflicts. Indeed  many of thecurrent crises would not have lasted long if the Statesinvolved in them had  in good faith  fully complied withtheir international obligations as set forth in the Charter ofthe United Nations and as established by regionalorganizations. I refer in particular to the principle ofnon-interference in the internal affairs of other States. Forthis reason  the mechanisms for the fulfilment of suchinternational obligations by States should be furtherreinforced.The Government of the Republic of Angola commendsthe work undertaken by the Secretary-General regarding thereinforcement of the preventive diplomacy mechanisms.However  the increase in the number of wars  particularlysince 1998  leads us to conclude that the efforts in thisregard still fall short of reaching the objectives. It is thusnecessary for us to strive to create the institutional capacityfor conflict prevention  including regional early-warningmechanisms.Regarding conflict resolution  Angola’s experiencesforce us to stress that there is an urgent need to re-definemethods and strategies  mainly in the field ofpeacekeeping operations. Other factors underlying thelimited success of some peacekeeping missions carriedout under the aegis of the United Nations are: the obviousfrailty of the verification systems of peace agreements;the tendency to treat similarly the violator and the fulfillerof these agreements; the overlooking of early signs thatsuggest a lack of political will and ill-faith by one of thesides; and the subsequent delayed application of coercivemeasures.As a member State of the international communitywe need to rely on and have recourse to the UnitedNations in its important role regarding the issues ofpeacekeeping and security in the world. Angola willcontinue to believe that  in order to establish peace in theworld  the United Nations role is of paramountimportance. We simply want to suggest that  given thecurrent international situation  this role should be playedin a more realistic and effective way  with a view toliving up to the expectations of people eager for peaceand to ensuring the credibility of our Organization.I would like now to refer to the situation in Angola where five years have passed since the Lusaka Protocolwas signed between the Government and UNITA.However  the main tasks involved in attaining a lastingpeace have not yet been achieved. In particular  UNITAhas not been completely disarmed and State authority hasnot been restored in the illegally occupied areas. Rather the persistent refusal of the rebels to fully honour theirobligations and their preference for taking power by forcehave plunged the country into a new era of violence.Following this rejection of the people’s will  asexpressed at the polls during the 1992 general elections and the non-fulfilment of the provisions of the three peaceaccords entered into with the Government — in 1989 inGbadolite  in the former Zaire; in 1991 in Portugal and in1994 in Lusaka — Mr. Savimbi is still interested incontinuing his destabilization campaign. This includespreventing the smooth running of the democraticinstitutions; destroying cities  towns  villages infrastructure and public and private assets; andmercilessly killing civilians. In this way he has beencondemning to misery  disease and famine all of thepeople in Angola.As a result of these actions  in addition to thethousands of civilians who have already been killed 33almost 3 million others have left their homes in search ofrefuge in the Government-controlled areas. Thosecommunities require humanitarian assistance from theinternational community. In the framework of theimplementation of the Lusaka Protocol  the Governmenthas  in good faith  undertaken all the tasks provided for itin the peace accords  in spite of the fact that Savimbi andhis military wing have resumed the war. The Governmentcontinues to ensure the functioning of the democraticinstitutions resulting from the general elections  and UNITAmembers are represented in the Government and theparliament.In the national armed forces  military troops  officialsand soldiers appointed by UNITA remain faithful to theideals of democracy and national accord. Only Mr. Savimbiand a fairly reduced number of qualified personnel whoremain faithful to him are still interested in making warwith a view to taking power. All of Savimbi’s propagandaof recent years has merely been playing for time andanticipating that developments on the international scenemight come out in his favour. His false messages onnegotiations  allowing him time to prepare the ground fornew military adventures  are elements of that strategy.Indeed  what remains to be done in the Angolan peaceprocess is to enforce what was negotiated in-depth atLusaka over an entire year  particularly the disarming of allof Mr. Jonas Savimbi’s military forces and the restorationof state administration throughout the national territory. TheAngolan Government has long waited for Savimbi to decideto opt for peace. Angola is currently facing other politicaland economic challenges that cannot be indefinitelypostponed as a result of the actions of a single power-hungry individual who considers war to be the only way tofulfil his personal plans. Furthermore  in rejectingSavimbi’s posture  many UNITA militants and leaders havedistanced him from the party. These women and men areworking in good faith to consolidate the Angolandemocratic process.Given Savimbi’s obstructionist behaviour  the SecurityCouncil decided to impose global mandatory sanctionsagainst UNITA  including the prohibition of internationaltravel for top UNITA officials directly involved in theAngola war project. In the same vein  and as a result of thecrimes that Savimbi has been committing against thecivilian population  the Organization of African Unity(OAU) and the Southern African Development Community(SADC) declared him a war criminal and thus an unreliablestakeholder in the implementation of peace in Angola. TheNon-Aligned Movement  in its ministerial meeting of 23September 1999 held here in New York  expressed itsstrong support for the resolution adopted at the recentOAU Summit  which deems Mr. Savimbi a war criminaland requires that he be treated as such by the entireinternational community. We trust that there is no furtherdoubt about the criminal nature of Mr. Savimbi or theneed for him to be held responsible internationally for hiscrimes and actions.The Angolan Government reiterates its ongoingcommitment to paving the way for a lasting peace and  tothat end  to making use of all the means at its disposal and undertakes to proceed with the process of nationalreconciliation and social democratization. A cleardemonstration of its commitment is the fact that  despitethe war climate pervading the country  at no timewhatsoever has the Government denied the rights andindividual liberties of citizens or of national legal politicalforces.In the framework of the political reforms initiated in1991  a new constitution is being prepared in a process inwhich all political parties are participating. The newconstitutional text will reinforce the rule of law andconsolidate the type of society that we intend to establishin Angola: an economically prosperous one underdemocratic rule of law and a State of social justice. In theeconomic context  the reforms will follow their coursewith a view to reinforcing the creation of other conditionsfor an effective market economy and of a morefavourable environment for foreign investment.In order to meet these challenges  we call for thesupport and solidarity of the international community particularly regarding the implementation of sanctionsimposed by the Security Council against UNITA  so thatAngola can more rapidly achieve peace and consolidateand accelerate the economic reform process.It is our sincere hope that the new initiatives of theSecurity Council  proposed by Ambassador RobertFowler  Chairman of the Committee on Sanctions  as wellas the support already expressed by some Governmentsand international institutions  may contribute significantlyto reinforcing sanctions  dismantling the illegal diamond-trafficking network  which is subsidizing the war carriedout by Savimbi  and bringing its perpetrators before thecourt.In tandem with its efforts to implement peace  theAngolan Government is also committed to implementingsocial-impact economic programmes and to relaunching34the basis for the resettlement of communities with a viewto economically rehabilitating the country. In this regard we wish to call upon all United Nations Member States tosupport the draft resolution that Angola will submit to theGeneral Assembly on economic rehabilitation. In additionto lending their support to the draft resolution  we call onour partners particularly to participate in the economicrehabilitation of Angola.The disarming of anti-personal landmines is anothertask that requires the ongoing involvement and support ofthe international community. The Angolan Government willremain engaged at the national  regional and internationallevels in order to overcome that scourge. A cleardemonstration of this determination is the fact that we wereone of the first State parties to the Ottawa Convention onthe Prohibition of the Use  Stockpiling  Production andTransfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their Destruction.The security  stability and territorial integrity ofAngola and its neighbours depend on the stability of theregion. We are currently facing a dangerous increase ofdestabilization which  if not controlled  may seriously affectthe development of that part of the continent. Angola willcontinue to lend its support  under SADC  to theimplementation of peace in the Democratic Republic of theCongo. The Ceasefire Agreement signed in Lusaka and itscomplete fulfilment will pave the way for the return ofrefugees and the initiation of dialogue between theCongolese political forces  to which falls the responsibilityof deciding the destiny of their country. The United Nationsand the OAU are also called upon to play a crucial role inthe establishment of a lasting peace. It would be reasonablefor the invading countries to make a gesture bywithdrawing from Congolese territory and ceasing toexpand their occupation.In the African Horn  Angola welcomes the acceptanceby the Governments of Ethiopia and Eritrea of theFramework Agreement prepared by the OAU with a viewto settling the dispute between the two countries. We wishto call upon both countries to demonstrate flexibility inorder to ensure that a peace agreement  taking into accountthe interests of their peoples  can be celebrated.With respect to Somalia  we call upon the internationalcommunity to support the efforts of the OAU to reconcilethe political and military factions and to establish an electedGovernment so that the country can resume its place in thecommunity of nations.In Western Sahara  the fulfilment of the CeasefireAgreement enabled the further development of the jointefforts of the United Nations and the OAU leading to theholding of a referendum. Angola expects the process tobe transparent and fair and that both parties shall acceptthe verdict of the Sahraoui people.Concerning East Timor  whose people is connectedto Angola by a shared language and a historical past ofstruggle against Portuguese colonization  we weredisturbed by the acts of violence that followed theannouncement of the results of the popular consultation.The decision of East Timor’s people in favour of self-determination and independence should be respected. It isnow the United Nations responsibility to prepare anenabling environment. In this regard  we strongly supportthe dispatch of a United Nations international peace force.As to the Middle East  Angola welcomes thecelebration of the Sharm el-Sheikh agreements betweenIsrael and the Palestinian Authority that have enabled thepeace process to be relaunched. It is our view that thenew agreements conform to the aspirations of therespective peoples to living in peace and security.The Government of the Republic of Angola and itspeople are concerned about the difficult political economic and social situation of the Cuban people  whichhas worsened under the ongoing economic embargoimposed on their country. We hope that the matter will beresolved through a constructive bilateral dialogue.The latest international developments and thechallenges of the next millennium require that the UnitedNations and its main bodies  particularly those dealingwith peace and security  economic development and theadministration of international justice  be adjusted to thenew situation.Reform and an increase in the membership of theSecurity Council will be crucial to making thedecision-making process more transparent. In this respect it is essential that all the regions of the world berepresented equally. Angola reaffirms the position of thenon-aligned countries on the reform of the SecurityCouncil  as well as the common African position adoptedby the OAU.Despite the progress achieved in some economiesand the disappearance of the signs of a new worlddepression  the international economic situation continuesto be characterized by serious imbalances. The root35causes of the difficult situation faced by some developingcountries include the unfair system governing internationaleconomic  monetary and financial relations; the adoption ofprotectionist measures; the unilateral nature of world trade;and the worsening of the external debt  which has becomea heavy burden for the developing countries.It is necessary to take concrete measures which maylead to structural changes in international economicrelations and may contribute to the balance of the worldeconomy. To this end  there should be a serious andtransparent will in the North-South dialogue."
"3",115,"ALB",54,1999,"Let me begin Sir  by congratulating you on your election to thepresidency of the General Assembly  and to voice my fullconfidence that the work of this session  under yourleadership  will be crowned with success. I wish also toexpress my great appreciation of the way in which yourpredecessor  Mr. Didier Opertti  guided the work of thefifty-third session.I take this opportunity also to welcome the Republicof Kiribati  the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom ofTonga to the great United Nations family  and to convey tothem our best wishes for the future.I am pleased to say that this year has been markedby genuinely positive developments for Albania in thepolitical  social and economic spheres. Albania has madeprogress in strengthening its democratic institutions andits civil society  in achieving respect for human rights andfreedoms  and in enhancing public order and the rule oflaw.As a new democracy  Albania is tireless in its effortsto strengthen and consolidate its institutional structures.There has been tangible progress in bringing about theindependence of the legislative  executive and judicialbranches. At the same time  efforts to coordinate them aremoving forward without in any way affecting theirseparate identities.The Albanian State and Government have givenpriority to economic development by promoting freeinitiative in the privatization process  principally instrategically important sectors. We have also made acontinuous effort to formulate and implement modernlegislation that can encourage and support domesticinvestment and can channel foreign investment intoespecially profitable vital sectors of our economy.We have every reason to appreciate the beneficialcooperation between Albania and the World Bank  whichhas resulted in the implementation of projects of greatimportance to the Albanian economy  and also in theireffective management. We are grateful too for the supportof the International Monetary Fund  whose activities havemade a great contribution to revitalizing my country's finances.We are well aware that no State can have a healthyeconomy or a solid democracy without secure public order the rule of law and a strong civil society. Among thethorniest problems now facing Albanian society andespecially the Albanian State are neutralizing both commonand organized crime and putting an end to corruption incertain sectors. Great efforts and substantial resources havebeen deployed in this area to increase the effectiveness ofthe police and other administrative structures engaged incrime-fighting. I take this opportunity to express my greatappreciation for the assistance provided by theMultinational Advisory Police Element of the WesternEuropean Union and by a number of individual States  inparticular for the restructuring and training of the Albanianpolice and for the provision of logistical equipment.At the same time  I would like to say that theGovernment of Albania  and I myself  attach greatimportance to the direct commitment of the United Nationsto the process of disarming the civilian population. I wouldlike to take this occasion to congratulate Mr. Dhanapala onhis last visit to Albania.Considering corruption to be an extreme evil and aserious obstacle to the development of a healthy democracy the Albanian Parliament and Government have adoptedtough legislative and administrative measures to deal withit  establishing specific structures to better uncover andpunish abuse of power in certain corrupt sectors of theadministration and the judiciary.During previous sessions  Albania has stated — andwe still hold — that the main objective of our strategy isintegration into the Euro-Atlantic structures and into otherglobal and regional organizations. Our clear objective is tojoin the European Union  which we do not doubt for amoment can be achieved  so the Albanian Governmentconsiders as a fundamental priority raising the level of itsrelations with the European Union. I am glad to say thatthere has been a qualitative improvement in those relations.Cooperation has been intensified in various fields  whichbodes well for the signing of an association agreementfairly soon.There have also been positive developments in ourrapprochement with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization(NATO)  following the modernization of the Albanianarmy  and above all thanks to the unreserved help providedto the NATO forces during the Kosovo conflict.I am also happy to note that my country's efforts overmany years to become a member of the World TradeOrganization seem to be about to be crowned withsuccess.The work of the current session is taking place whileKosovo and the entire region are making efforts to healthe wounds inflicted by the Milosevic regime. Theconcerns expressed by the Albanian delegation at thefifty-third session with regard to the policy of “ethniccleansing”  which went as far as genocide  perpetrated bythe Belgrade regime against the Albanian population ofKosovo  proved well-founded. In the framework of thischauvinistic policy  the most barbarous crimes werecommitted: tens of thousands of Albanians weremassacred  thousands of houses were destroyed or set onfire  and more than half the population were expelledfrom their land and had to go to neighbouring countries particularly Albania  Macedonia and Montenegro.Thousands of other people went into the mountains andlived in unimaginable conditions in order to escapecertain death. The massacres at Raçak  Peja  Rahovec andMalishevo  the daily discovery of mass graves containingchildren  women  young people and old men and women killed by the Serb army  militias and policemen  willcontinue to testify to a genocide without precedent on thethreshold of the new millennium.It is with horror that I condemn the execution ofdozens of eminent Kosovar intellectuals and theimprisonment of hundreds of others.The Milosevic regime ignored the warnings of theinternational community and its call for an acceptableresolution of the Kosovo crisis. It arrogantly rejected theproposals formulated in the Rambouillet agreement by theContact Group and increased the repression of theAlbanians in Kosovo  thus endangering peace and securityin the Balkans. In these circumstances  the NATOcountries  legitimately defending the sacred principles ofthe United Nations Charter  had to intervene militarily inorder to force Belgrade to withdraw its armed forces fromKosovo.We congratulate the international community onhaving shown on this occasion unlike the similar situationin Bosnia  a firm will to condemn the crimes perpetuatedagainst a defenceless population  take effective measuresto put an end to those crimes and establish peace in thetroubled region of the Balkans.The whole Albanian nation has expressed itsprofound gratitude to NATO  the United States ofAmerica  the United Nations  the Organization for2Security and Cooperation in Europe  and all theinternational forces which contributed to ending thehumanitarian disaster in Kosovo and re-establishing peacethere. In particular  I pay tribute to the action and thepersonal commitment of Mr. Kofi Annan  the Secretary-General of the United Nations  in the settlement of thisconflict and the ending of the humanitarian crisis.I also pay special tribute to the International CriminalTribunal for the former Yugoslavia for its commitment topublic exposure of the crimes against the Albanian peopleof Kosovo and for becoming an interpreter for the wholeAlbanian nation in their just request that all thoseresponsible for crimes against the innocent population beput in the dock. I call on all countries  especially those inour region  to cooperate with the Tribunal  as recommendedin Security Council resolutions.The Albanian State has done everything to ensure thatthe conflict in Kosovo is resolved as soon as possible andpeace is re-established in the Balkans. Engaging in intensepolitical activity  we have striven to ensure that the politicalforces in Kosovo adopt a common attitude and accept theRambouillet peace plan. The Albanian State  whilecommitting itself firmly to defending its territorial integrityand sovereignty  has refused to respond to provocations bySerb forces at the border. Albania has not fallen forMilosevic's manoeuvres designed to extend the conflict inthe region.Despite our great economic and financial difficulties Albania has borne the burden of the humanitarian crisis ofthe refugees from Kosovo. Half a million Kosovarsdeported from their homes have found shelter among theirbrothers in Albania. Albanian families opened their doorsto their blood brothers  thereby earning widespread respectfor their generosity. As I recall this period  I would like toexpress our deep gratitude for he invaluable assistancegiven us by States and international organizations  bothgovernmental and non-governmental  especially thoseworking within the United Nations framework. The UnitedNations  implementing Security Council resolution 1244(1999)  is today  in the aftermath of the Kosovo crisis playing a decisive role. The new civil administration composed of representatives of the entire population ofKosovo  is almost in place  with the help in particular ofthe United Nations  the European Union and the OSCE; itis working feverishly in the edification  democratization andstrengthening of a multi-ethnic civil society  with respectfor human rights and a framework of institutions imbued bythat respect.KFOR is carrying out the difficult task of preservingstability and the fragile peace in the Kosovo region. I takethis opportunity to thank the Special Representative of theSecretary-General  Mr. Bernard Kouchner  for his effortsto attain the established objectives. I am confident that theUnited Nations and the organizations supporting it willcontinue their action so as to eliminate all negative factorsthat might compromise a secure and complete peace andthe future of the Kosovo region. We support the efforts ofall the international and Kosovar political forces to ensurepeaceful coexistence between Albanians and the ethnicminorities in Kosovo. We express our wish andconviction that these efforts  based on Security Councilresolution 1244 (1999)  will be crowned with success.The end of the conflict in the Kosovo region and theconcern of the international community to transform theBalkans from the powder keg it has been into a region ofpeace and stability have given the countries in our regiona historic opportunity to achieve development  prosperityand democratization. We have resolved not to miss thatopportunity. First and foremost  our societies mustabandon their archaic chauvinistic mindset  which hasbeen the sources of division and hatred and which shouldno longer outweigh the desire for unity  friendship andcooperation among peoples.We must struggle towards and succeed inquarantining all policies that encourage hatred and ethnicdivisions  because such anachronistic policies have beenthe source of human catastrophes and remain one of themain causes of the destabilization of our region and thedelay in our economic development.Our countries share common interests in thestrategic  economic and security spheres. In this regard we want to become integrated into powerful structuressuch as the European Union and the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization (NATO). But it would not be realistic tothink we will easily attain this objective. We fully realizethat we are at the initial stage of this process. Thus webelieve that all the countries of the region shouldcoordinate their efforts in order to become — all together not separately — integrated into those structures.The Stability Pact on South-Eastern Europe is thefundamental document for the consolidation of democraticvalues  for economic growth and for the strengthening ofsecurity in our region. I take this opportunity to salute thefull support provided to this initiative by the countries ofour region at the Cologne and Sarajevo meetings. TheState and the Government of Albania support all efforts3that have been undertaken within the political boundaries ofthe former Yugoslavia to promote democracy and theprocess of integration in the region. We welcome alldemocratic developments in Serbia  the consequence ofwhich should be to remove from power the political groupresponsible for the crimes committed in the formerYugoslavia and to eliminate the chauvinistic mindset thatencourages war. Such a mindset is no longer acceptable incivilized Europe.The Albanian Government is adopting measures witha view to attaining the objectives of the Stability Pact. Theimmediate objectives include various ideas and concreteproposals aimed at the development of economic relationswith the countries in the region  the creation of inter-Balkaninstitutions to monitor respect for human rights and thestrengthening of security measures. The Albanian Stateexpects that in the near future the Balkans will become ademocratic region with an economy intended to reach thelevel of those of the developed countries  a region thatrespects human rights  in accordance with advancedEuropean and global standards. We believe that because ofthe damage suffered during the conflicts in the formerYugoslavia  and particularly in Kosovo  Albania deservespreferential treatment within the framework of the StabilityPact.As far as we are concerned  the free circulation ofpeople  ideas  capital and goods — a Balkan mini-Schengen — is the precondition for a rapid development ofthe economy  social life and democracy of our region. Ademocratic Balkans is unimaginable if our countries buildwalls in order to prevent the free circulation of people.Reciprocal free movement would contribute greatly tobringing people together and to cultural exchanges and thereby  to the elimination of the hatred and inter-ethnicconflicts that up till now have so cruelly shaken this part ofEurope.Albania appreciates the role currently being played bythe European Union  the United States of America andother countries in the framework of these positivedevelopments. It hopes that this interest in the developmentand democratization of the region will persist with the samelevel of commitment and the same intensity.While attaching priority to the problems of our region the State and the Government of Albania have beenand continue to remain attentive to developments in otherparts of the world. We welcome the progress in the peaceprocess in the Middle East and Northern Ireland. For mypart  I would like to express the fervent hope that theseprocesses prove irreversible.We appreciate the role played by the United Nationsin organizing the referendum on the future of East Timor.We hope the most recent agreements and resolutions  withthe international presence  in particular that of the UnitedNations  will lead to the stabilization of the situation inthat country as soon as possible.Given the ever-growing importance of multilateralinternational cooperation  Albania intends to become anever more active Member of the United Nations and ofother international organizations  in order to be able tobetter contribute to safeguarding peace throughout theworld. Albania salutes the efforts of the United Nationsto continue to strengthen its role in resolving the acuteproblems facing humanity today in the political  economicand humanitarian spheres. I take this opportunity toexpress my great appreciation for the action of theSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  aimed at reformingand reviving the Organization.In connection with this reform  Albania is in favourof the democratization and strengthening of the SecurityCouncil so that it better reflects new international realitiesand has more transparent procedures and workingmethods and a simplified decision-making process. Wesupport the financial and budgetary reform of the UnitedNations  the objective of which is better management offinancial resources and  thus  the increased effectivenessof United Nations programmes and projects.Allow me to express once again to you Mr. President  and to all the delegations present here myfervent wish that this session of the Assembly will meetwith success in advancing global peace  stability andprosperity."
"4",138,"AND",54,1999,"We are coming tothe end of 1999  a date that many see as the end of anepoch  given the proximity of the new millennium. Theimminence of its arrival invites us to reflect on the historyof men and women.It is with humility that Western nations  such asmine  consider the development of mankind  which wellbefore our year one was recorded by other calendarsduring thousands and thousands of years  as homo sapiensbegan to create tools of wood and metal  began to burytheir dead with dignity or to build empires and culturesever greater  and also ever more ephemeral. Today wemarvel at the mysterious paintings of prehistoric man such as we find in Andorra and throughout the Pyrenees or at the great architectural projects of ancient Egypt. Ourculture  our crafts  our way of life — all these havecertainly changed; but our intellect  though morecultivated and filled with more knowledge  continues tograsp at the problems of our existence in the same way with the same hesitations — caught between superstition cruelty and fear on the one hand and optimism and hopeon the other.In short  at the dawn of the year 2000 we remainessentially human and we can still discern in ourselvesthe traces of our ancestors who were born of naturalevolution. However  the progress of human societies hasso intensively transformed our environment that our erais intrinsically new and different from those that precededit. This new world  so recent and so obvious to us that itappears it could not be otherwise  is the world of the newmillennium. Globalization defines the spirit of the age.This phenomenon is of such importance that the GeneralAssembly should reflect upon it  each of us according tohis unique perspective. The universality of thisinternational forum — where  because of the far-sightedness of its founders  all nations  large and small have the same voice — makes it the ideal place for asober reflection on globalization and its effects.The nineteenth century saw the birth of nationalism which  in giving cohesion to human communities of allsizes  mythologized its unifying elements  often to anextreme. Andorra is a State  the fruit of a juridicalagreement that defined it  long before the coming ofnationalism. Our national essence is not based only on ourlanguage  Catalan  which we share with our neighbours tothe south and to the north  or on other manifestations ofmodern nationalism. Institutions are the pillars of ourcommunity: a democratic parliamentary system that beganin 1419  a culture of peace that has continueduninterrupted since 1278. Perhaps  since the Andorranfatherland is the result of institutional and political ideasworked out in a unique historical experience  born out of23a pact  we can emphasize these ideas today in this speechso that here at the United Nations they can serve asunifying institutional elements  thereby promoting the ideathat globalization should be shared by all in commonprogress.What is important in the new millennium is to knowhow to orient this globalization with international criteria so that a son of the Argentine pampas or a daughter ofGabon can equally laugh and cry at the same cartoon  sothat their freedom and ambitions can be equal and equallyunconstrained. For if their childhoods are no longer soculturally separate  the political and economic opportunitiesthey have when they pass into adulthood should be equallysimilar.Globalization is probably the greatest opportunity forhumanity  but it will not develop its potential if it is notaccompanied by both principles and political action at thehighest levels which allow for the establishment of new“post-national” communities with different cultures but withsimilar characteristics  communities that together can worktowards a world of peace and economic progress. This willnever be realized without the United Nations  theindispensable Organization. There are no indispensablenations  just as there are not men and women who arebetter than others because of the accident of their places ofbirth. What exists today are the indispensable economic andpolitical precepts that our parents  survivors of theHolocaust and other terrors of the Second World War  gaveto the United Nations and to the other internationalorganizations allied to it. This Organization  which manylove to criticize  while it may be distorted or weakened bythe weakness of its Members  is at its core the expressionof one of the greatest moments of the soul of humanity.The political power of the United Nations comes fromthe defence of the rights of man and the peaceful resolutionof conflicts. Its power in the economic sphere is based onan ethical cry for development. I spoke before of thechildren of the pampas or of Gabon  as I might speak ofchildren of the American Midwest or of East Asia or theFrench Pyrenees or the Arab peninsula. Many of these boysand girls will grow up with the same aspirations  instilledin them by a global culture  but once the age of adulthoodis reached the possibilities for the exploitation of theirpotentials is not the same  and in this great injustice lie theseeds of new wars  exploitations and corruptions. For manyof these children globalization has little meaning.We cannot turn our backs on the fact that 20 per centof mankind lives in conditions of extreme poverty  and thatmany millions of others are very close to this state. Whatdoes global culture represent for all of these people?Perhaps simply a mirage of all that they might have hadand taken pleasure in had they been born citizens of aricher country. The world has today more that 1.5 billionpeople who lack access to potable water and basicsanitation facilities and who are largely illiterate. Whatkind of global community will we be creating if thesenumbers do nothing but rise? The United Nationsindicated what needed to take place after the SocialSummit in Copenhagen in 1995. That conference traceda path that we have begun to follow  but that must nowbe followed with a firmer step. Why do we not  in thedecades to come  try to apply the desires expressed inUnited Nations policy to economic organizations  such asthe World Trade Organization  the International MonetaryFund and the World Bank? We must do this. Otherwise globalization cannot be any more than it is now: adictatorship of the financial world over people and theirlegitimate representatives.A discussion of the responsibility of those States thatadminister economic aid returns us to the questions ofpolitical rights  the advancement of democracy  thetransparency of the political and economic process andthe consolidation of the rule of law. Models exist  and ifthey have been developed in specific nations of the earth these models do not carry any copyright. Humancommunities are either free or not; there exists no otherpossibility. True democracy  the freedom to choose thepeople to administer the public good through regularelections  is the only form of democracy that can bedefended. Today  with the information we have at ourfingertips  nobody should dare defend tyranny byresorting to cultural arguments. During the first years ofthe new century  it will be necessary to keep alive theprinciples of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights so that people everywhere are educated in the socialresponsibility of the individual and so that democracy isaccepted as the only natural form of governance for allregimes.The recent conflict in East Timor is a good exampleof the opportunities as well as the dangers that the UnitedNations has before it. On the one hand  we find ourselvesfacing a long but productive process  in which a popularvote accepted by all the parties will lead towards anunequivocal resolution of a long-standing problem. On theother hand  once this democratic process was effectivelycarried out  violence broke out  and now we must reactquickly in order to stop the massacre. The United Nationscapacity for reaction and the mobilization of the forces of24the States that compose it is therefore essential. Here is thethird aspect of the United Nations that must become moreeffective than it is at present. Peacekeeping must beconducted using more powerful and better organizedmechanisms of intervention that allow for rapid action andguarantee the effective conversion of words into deeds.Globalization  a current reality  presents bothopportunities and dangers. In order for it to be a tool ofprogress  it must be accompanied by a system that is bothpolitical — involving democracy  the rule of law andrespect for human rights — and economic — involving thegoal of the eradication of poverty and encouragement ofdevelopment. Support for the system depends on the UnitedNations having a real capacity for intervention so thatpeacekeeping is more effective. This was the point ofdeparture for my series of observations. I can guarantee thatAndorra  a small State that has been a United NationsMember only since 1993  will make every effort so that thedesire to make the United Nations an instrument forpositive globalization is not in vain. We are makingincreasing efforts within the Organization.Andorra's active participation in the Rome Conferenceto establish an international criminal court  where it was thesecond State  after Italy  to sign the Statute  which beginswith words written by Andorra well illustrates the efforts ofmy country to aid and reinforce the rule of law in theworld.I have the pleasure to announce to the Assembly todaythat once the juridical analysis and translation from Catalanhas been completed  my Government will give to theConsell General  our Parliament  a copy of the Statute forratification. We hope  therefore  shortly to be one of theStates that will permit the International Criminal Court(ICC) to become a reality by being one of the firstcountries to ratify the Statute for its entry into force.Another small European State  San Marino  preceded ustowards this goal and we congratulate it on its speed andsupport for the ICC.The work of Andorra in the United Nations concerningthe rights of man continues to occupy a special place in thisfifty-fourth session of the General Assembly. In particular our delegation will follow with interest the work of theCommission on Human Rights during its meetings inGeneva. Andorra's desire to mark its opposition to the deathpenalty as punishment for a crime will again be expressed.We will also insist on the need to teach human rights tochildren  as is emphasized in Article 29 of the Conventionon the Rights of the Child. We will also work this year onother United Nations Conventions concerning humanrights to which Andorra has committed itself to adherepending internal proceedings.The year 2001  as a result of the internal rotation ofthe Western Group  will allow Andorra to be a memberof the Economic and Social Council. This represents animportant goal for us in our international life  and we arepleased to inform the Assembly that Andorra has startedits preparatory work for its presence in this organ  soimportant to the United Nations. The deliberations of thenext session of the Economic and Social Council whichwill take place in New York in the year 2000. For thesession to take place in 200l in Geneva  where we willparticipate as full members  the recent extension of ourPermanent Mission to the Geneva Headquarters willassure our being able to carefully follow the proceedings.To this end  I have asked our Permanent Representativeto establish at this session which of the members of histeam  and in what capacity  will be responsible for theEconomic and Social Council in 2001 for Andorra. Thispreparation will ensure that our contribution will measureup to the noble work of the Council  notably in the waragainst poverty.Still on the economic plane  Andorra's candidaturefor the World Trade Organization represents one of themost important current challenges for my country alongside the relationship we are exploring with ourneighbours in the European Union. As a small Statewhich tries to understand its economic opportunities  wefind the flows of global commerce  and our participationin them  of particular interest.In 1998 each Andorran gave around $6 to our annualbudget for contributions to the United Nations; this is theper capita figure for the Andorran contribution to theOrganization. I am aware that it is not an enormouscontribution  but it is much greater than that which eachinhabitant of the biggest countries with a high incomepays or should pay. A good part of this figure was forvoluntary contributions towards disarmament. Anexhibition on children and small arms opened recently.Prepared by the Department of Under-Secretary-GeneralDhanapala and the United Nations Children's Fund(UNICEF)  and sponsored by Andorra  it will move todifferent sites in the world to raise consciousnessconcerning the tragedy brought about by the presence ofsmall arms in areas of conflict  especially for the young.We have also made contributions towards programmesdesigned to collect small arms in some of those countriesthat suffer from an infestation of this plague. My country25intends to continue to contribute to initiatives such as thesein order to express our solidarity with the actions for peaceof the United Nations. It is right that a small country suchas mine  which has been blessed by 721 years ofuninterrupted peace should participate in the United Nationsin those acts which bring about a culture of peace.The last time I visited the Headquarters of the UnitedNations  during May of last year  I did so to present aprogramme of computerization for the archives of theGroup of Western European and Other States to the high-level working group on informatics. I am happy that thediplomatic mission of a small State such as ours can bringabout the realization of this project  aided by the NationalComputer Science Centre of Andorra. The server computersinstalled at the Mission function at a good rhythm and otherregional groups have asked for information in order toestablish a similar system. I therefore reiterate the offer Imade last year concerning the cooperation of Andorra withany other interested regional groups.The United Nations is certainly imperfect  but it is thebest organization that we have to orient this unpredictableworld of the third millennium towards a culture of peaceand international solidarity and also along the path ofdevelopment.There are many labours left unfinished: the reform ofthe Security Council  the new tasks of the TrusteeshipCouncil  the revitalization of the Economic and SocialCouncil  the increase in possibilities for peacekeepingoperations  among others.We have a great chance to change this world sotransformed by globalization. Do not forget  however  thatat the end of this century marked by the worst excesses ofhumanity  the United Nations represents our charitable spiritand at its centre there is not a machine  but human beings albeit exceptional ones: the first among them  Kofi Annan the Secretary-General; Didi Opertti  the outgoing Presidentof the General Assembly  whom we thank with all ourhearts for work well done; Theo-Ben Gurirab  the newPresident  whom we congratulate on his election; and manyother persons who bring their individual beliefs to thiscommon house for humanity. It comforts us to think notabout systems  but rather about those people who indefatigable  work for a better world. Let us therefore havethe optimism to believe in our species. For I believe that as the Nobel Prize Winner William Falkner said:“man will not merely endure: he will prevail. He isimmortal  not because he alone among creatures hasan inexhaustible voice  but because he has a soul  aspirit capable of compassion and sacrifice andendurance.”"
"5",183,"ARE",54,1999,"Mr. President  it gives me pleasure to extend toyou  on behalf of the delegation of the United ArabEmirates  my congratulations on your election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourthsession. I am confident that your experience  diplomaticskills and political ability will contribute effectively andpositively to the success of the session’s proceedings.I should also like to express my thanks to yourpredecessor  the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Uruguay Mr. Didier Opertti  for the prudent manner in which hedirected the work of the previous session.I avail myself of this opportunity to express ourgratitude to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  forhis efforts in strengthening the role of the United Nationsin the maintenance of international peace and security.We welcome the admission of the Republic ofKiribati  the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom ofTonga to membership in the United Nations  whichstrengthens its universality.As this session convenes on the eve of the thirdmillennium  the international environment remainsplagued by a multitude of problems and challenges  themost salient of which are manifest in the ever-increasinggrowth of the phenomena of poverty  environmentalpollution  armed conflicts  ethnic and religious cleansing the race to acquire proscribed weapons  organized crime 34drugs and international terrorism in its various forms andmanifestations.Dealing with such global problems and phenomenarequires that all States adhere to the Charter of the UnitedNations  respect international law and work onstrengthening the mechanisms for cooperation amongnations  including the completion of the structural reformsin the United Nations  particularly in the Security Counciland the Economic and Social Council.In this connection  we express our appreciation for thepositive role played by the specialized agencies andorganizations of the United Nations in providing emergencyhumanitarian and development assistance to the manypeoples affected by the consequences of conflicts and bynatural and other disasters.The course of political events and the wars that ragedin the Arab Gulf region in the past two decades  as well astheir political  economic and social implications  have morethan ever before reinforced the conviction of the membersof the Gulf Cooperation Council of the importance ofconsolidating the bonds of bilateral and multilateralcooperation between the States of the region and the othermembers of the international community. This must bebased on the principles of good neighbourliness confidence-building measures  peaceful coexistence  non-intervention in the internal affairs of countries  mutualrespect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States renunciation of the threat or use of force and the settlementof existing disputes through dialogue and peaceful means.In addition regional and international cooperation and thestrengthening of national capabilities must be reinforced andencouraged  particularly in the fields of social  economic cultural and human development.It is this conviction that underlies the position of themembers of the Gulf Cooperation Council in providingvarious forms of humanitarian and development assistanceto the many countries of the third world that have beenaffected by wars  conflicts and natural disasters  the mostrecent of which was the allocation of $400 million forfinancing reconstruction and development in the earthquake-stricken areas of Turkey.The continued occupation by the Islamic Republic ofIran of three United Arab Emirates islands  Greater Tunb Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa  for almost 29 years stands outin stark contrast not only to the clearly peaceful attitudesadopted by the States of the Gulf Cooperation Council  butalso reveals the true intentions of Iran  which persists inviolating the territorial integrity of the United ArabEmirates. We had hoped that the Iranian politicaldiscourse on this issue would be translated into practicaland positive steps in response to the peaceful initiativesof our Head of State  His Highness Sheikh Zayed binSultan Al-Nahyan. Those initiatives  which had met withthe support and backing of all friendly and fraternalStates  called for either entering into serious bilateralnegotiations  with transparent intentions  or accepting thesubmission of the dispute to the International Court ofJustice.We had also welcomed the establishment of a three-member ministerial committee by the Gulf CooperationCouncil to be charged with developing a mechanism forthe start of serious negotiations between the United ArabEmirates and the Islamic Republic of Iran. The underlyinghope is that a peaceful  just and lasting settlement bereached  one that would bring to an end the Iranianoccupation of our three islands.It is truly regrettable that the consecutive IranianGovernments  rather than dealing with our peacefulinitiatives in a spirit of responsibility and political will have deliberately resorted to a policy of escalation andprovocation. They have done so by carrying out naval andaerial military manoeuvres  by establishing civilian andmilitary installations on our occupied islands  and byrelentlessly seeking to change their demographic  legaland historical characteristics. The aim is to consolidatethe Iranian occupation of these islands and to establish afait accompli by force.Such actions represent a direct threat to regional andinternational security and stability. We consider theseIranian excesses null and void  with no legal validity orbasis in the rules of international law or in the Charter ofthe United Nations or that of the Organization of theIslamic Conference. They are also inconsistent with thedocumented fact that  historically and legally  these threeislands are an integral part of the territorial sovereignty ofthe United Arab Emirates  regardless of the duration oftheir occupation.The security of the Arab Gulf is the collective andjoint responsibility of the States of the region. Thereforewe stress the importance of promoting a political anddiplomatic dialogue as well as cooperation between thoseStates and of channelling their wealth and human andnatural resources towards achieving the desired economicand social development for their peoples.35In this context  we call upon the Iraqi Government tocomplete its implementation of the relevant resolutions ofthe Security Council  in particular those relating to the fate whereabouts and release of Kuwaiti nationals and citizensof other countries who are detained or held as prisoners ofwar by Iraq. This is in addition to the return of Kuwaitiproperty  documents and archives  an act that wouldcontribute to Iraq's resuming its natural role at the regionaland international levels.The inhumane conditions visited upon the Iraqi peoplemake it incumbent upon all of us to seek an early end totheir suffering. We therefore call upon the Security Council and in particular its permanent members  to reach consensuson the draft projects before it that would lead to the fullimplementation of all its resolutions and to lifting theinternational economic sanctions imposed on Iraq whileemphasizing the importance of respect for its sovereigntyand territorial integrity.Proceeding from its belief in the need to achieve a justand comprehensive peace in the Middle East based on theprinciple of land for peace and on the relevant resolutionsof the Security Council  the United Arab Emirateswelcomes the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum and thepreliminary contacts between the Palestinian and Israelisides regarding the final status negotiations  which are todeal with the issues of Jerusalem  settlements  refugees andborders.We attach great importance to the politicaldevelopments that will lead to the realization of theobjectives and aspirations on which the peace process isbased — namely  the achievement of a peaceful  just andlasting settlement of the question of Palestine and of theMiddle East problem. We call upon the Israeli Governmentto implement fully and scrupulously  and without furtherdelay or obstructions  all of the obligations andcommitments it has assumed within the framework of theseagreements. I refer in particular to those relating to haltingsettlement activities and policies in various parts ofoccupied Palestinian land and other occupied Arabterritories  including Jerusalem  and to the return ofPalestinian refugees in accordance with the relevantresolutions of the international community and the FourthGeneva Convention.In applauding the positive role played by the UnitedStates of America in reviving the peace process  we expressthe hope that further efforts will be made by the co-sponsors of the process and by the members of theEuropean Union and other influential States to persuade theIsraeli Government to fulfil its historical  political andlegal obligations that are based on the principles ofinternational law and the principle of land for peace. Thiswould restore to the Palestinian people their legitimaterights and would enable them to exercise self-determination and establish their own independent state inPalestine  with Jerusalem as its capital.We also reiterate our full and unqualified support forthe position of Lebanon and demand that the Governmentof Israel implement Security Council resolution 425(1978). That resolution calls for the Israeli forces towithdraw  without any preconditions  from southernLebanon and from the West Bekaa Valley  and to resumenegotiations on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks at thepoint where they were cut off. The aim is to ensure acomplete Israeli withdrawal from the Syrian Arab GolanHeights to the line of 4 June 1967  in accordance withSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).The acquisition and possession of weapons of massdestruction  especially nuclear weapons  are contrary tothe objectives and recommendations unanimously adoptedby members of the international community at the 1995Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to theTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons(NPT). This not only contributes to the escalation of theproscribed arms race and the heightening of tensions  butalso disrupts the security balance at the regional andinternational levels.Consonant with its position that favours theestablishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones throughoutthe world  the United Arab Emirates emphasizes theimportance and necessity of establishing a zone free fromweapons of mass destruction  including nuclear weapons in the region of the Middle East and the Arabian Gulf. Itrenews its call to the international community to exertgreater efforts  demanding that Israel accede to the NPTand place all of its nuclear facilities under the safeguardsregime of the International Atomic Energy Agency  inorder to ensure peace and security in the region and theattainment of the desired economic and socialdevelopment.The member States of the Gulf Cooperation Councilfollowed with keen interest the recent developments inEast Timor and the pressures placed on the Republic ofIndonesia despite its acceptance of the results of thereferendum in that territory. In this connection  wewelcome the positive stance of the IndonesianGovernment  especially its readiness to provide necessary36support for the peaceful transfer of authority in thatterritory  in cooperation with the United Nations. Wetherefore stress the importance of respecting the territorialintegrity of the Republic of Indonesia in order to restoresecurity and stability in that region.The continuing state of conflict between our twofriends  India and Pakistan  over the question of Kashmir is a source of profound concern to us because it constitutesa direct threat to regional and global security and stability.We therefore invite both Governments to exercise a policyof self-restraint and to resort to dialogue and peacefulnegotiations in settling their differences  in accordance withthe relevant resolutions of the Security Council  the rulesand regulations of international law and the provisions ofthe recent Lahore accord. We also support all effortsdesigned to bring about peaceful resolutions of the conflictsin South-East Asia and the Korean peninsula.The international community recently followed thedevelopments of the deplorable events to which the peopleof Kosovo  particularly the Muslims  were subjected. Theseevents included ethnic and religious cleansing  populationdisplacements and other heinous crimes by Yugoslav andSerbian forces  in blatant violation of internationalhumanitarian law.The United Arab Emirates  acting on high-levelinstructions from an informed leadership  was one of thefirst countries to participate in the international reliefoperation. Our armed forces  together with the RedCrescent Society and other humanitarian organizations provided humanitarian  medical  food and developmentassistance to the people of Kosovo. In addition  militarytroops from the Emirates participated in the United Nationspeacekeeping operation in Kosovo  helping to ensure thereturn of the refugees to their homes and land  maintaininternal security and initiate and develop vital projects suchas schools  roads and hospitals. It is essential forinternational efforts to continue in order to provide thepeople of Kosovo with security and humanitarianguarantees and enable them to achieve their legitimateaspirations. It is also in the interest of establishing peaceand security in the Balkans.Despite the positive initiatives by the United Nations particularly the Security Council  and by the Organizationof African Unity to contain conflicts  resolve the internaland regional security problems which plague certain Statesin Africa and promote national reconciliation between thevarious political factions  conditions there remain regrettably unstable. We therefore call upon the Statesconcerned to assume their historic and politicalresponsibilities and resolve their problems by peacefulmeans so as to enable the peoples of Africa to achievetheir aspirations for peace and sustainable development.In this context  we should like to reiterate that thesanctions imposed on Libya must be lifted now that it hasimplemented the Security Council resolutions in respectof the Lockerbie issue.Notwithstanding the relatively positive changes ininternational economic relations  the liberalization ofworld trade and multilateral cooperation in the fields ofdevelopment  finance and trade  the economic and socialgap between developed and developing countries is stillwidening. The consequences of the financial crises in thecountries of South-East Asia and elsewhere continue to befelt: they have contributed to the decline in economicgrowth in many States. Dealing with these and othersimilar dysequilibria will require a comprehensive andobjective assessment of financial  investment  customstariff and trade arrangements with a view to initiatingNorth-South and South-South dialogue to promotemutually beneficial cooperation and coordination.In this connection  the relevant international andregional development institutions have an important roleto play in ensuring the stability of the world economicand financial order  a continued flow of developmentassistance from developed to developing countries andcancellation of the poorest countries debts. Cooperation atthe bilateral  regional and subregional levels is also apositive step towards stabilizing international economicrelations and  if carried out on the basis ofcomplementarity  equality and justice  should enable thedeveloping countries to become effective participants andshould ensure regional and international security andstability.In conclusion  we express the hope that thepreparatory meetings for the Millennium Assembly in2000 will have a positive outcome  leading to thefulfilment of our countries’ and peoples’ aspirations forpeace  security and sustainable development."
"6",230,"ARG",54,1999,"Weare pleased that an important figure in Namibia's attainmentof independence has the responsibility of conducting thissession of the General Assembly.I also wish to express my appreciation to the ForeignMinister of Uruguay  Mr. Didier Opertti  for his skill inpresiding over the previous session of the GeneralAssembly.After 10 years as President of Argentina  and with myconstitutional mandate about to end  I should like to sharewith the Assembly the transformations that Argentina hasexperienced during this time  in a world which has alsobeen transformed.In the past 10 years we have experienced a changeof Copernican dimensions. It started with the recovery ofdemocracy. Since that time we have built a stable politicalsystem based on the popular will and respect for the ruleof law. We have made respect for human rights a sacredvalue. We are at peace with all our neighbours  withwhich we have now undertaken a robust integrationprocess. We have put an end to proliferation policies andhave actively committed ourselves to peacekeepingoperations. We have developed an open and freeeconomy  worked to combat poverty and inequality ofopportunity and fought discrimination in all its forms. Inshort  we have recovered and embraced the high values ofour culture  which are the essence of the Charter of theUnited Nations and which we hope to bring with us intothe twenty-first century.At the regional level  which is our natural sphere ofinterest  we have solved all outstanding border anddemarcation issues with the Republic of Chile and thusopened the way for fruitful integration. We haveestablished consultation and coordination mechanismswith Brazil and Chile on security and defence issues. Weare convinced that security depends much more onfriendship and cooperation with our neighbours than onwhat we spend on weapons. As one of the guarantors ofthe Rio de Janeiro Protocol  we contributed to the peaceagreement between Peru and Ecuador. We are workingtirelessly for the consolidation of democracy anddevelopment in our region.In the field of disarmament and the non-proliferationof weapons of mass destruction  we have taken thefollowing steps. On 28 November 1990 we signed the Fozdo Iguaçú Joint Declaration  which consolidated thepolicy of nuclear transparency with Brazil  and since thenwe have developed a common peaceful and non-proliferation nuclear policy. Argentina acceded to theTreaty of Tlatelolco  in 1994; the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  in 1995; and theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  in 1998. We arealso members of the Nuclear Suppliers Group  and in1993 Argentina joined the Missile Technology ControlRegime.In the field of space activities  the NationalCommission for Space Activities has worked with theUnited States National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration (NASA) on the SAC-B satellite mission  theplacement in orbit and operation of the SAC-A satellitetechnology mission and the forthcoming launch of the SAC-C satellite mission  Argentina's first Earth observationsatellite. We have also started some ambitious projects inthis field with Brazil  as well as with Canada  France Germany and the United Kingdom.We have ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention and we are working on a monitoring mechanism for theBiological Weapons Convention. In this context  Argentinajoined the Australian Group on 11 December 1992.Argentina's self-restraint in the development of nuclearweapons is recognized as an example by the internationalcommunity.On 14 September this year Argentina ratified theOttawa Convention on the prohibition of anti-personnellandmines.At the Southern Cone Common Market(MERCOSUR) summit in Ushuaia  Argentina  on 24 July1998  MERCOSUR  Bolivia and Chile were declared azone of peace and a zone free of weapons of massdestruction. A commitment was also made to declare thearea a zone free of anti-personnel landmines.We believe that all States must renounce nuclearweapons and give unequivocal guarantees that their nuclearcapability and most advanced technology are exclusively forpeaceful purposes.Allow me once more to refer to the pendingsovereignty dispute concerning the Malvinas Islands. Oneof the first measures we adopted upon taking office was tore-establish diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom in February 1990. A new stage was thereby begun in whichthe ties between the two countries were taken to theirhighest level in history. This was reaffirmed by my recentvisit  as President  to the United Kingdom and that of HisRoyal Highness Prince Charles to Argentina. Since then while reaffirming our sovereignty rights and motivated bya spirit of reconciliation  we have worked harmoniouslywith the United Kingdom on various matters relating to theSouth Atlantic  such as the rebuilding of a climate ofmutual trust in the area  the preservation of live marineresources  the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons the resumption of flights between the continent and theMalvinas Islands  and the access of persons carryingArgentine identity documents to the Malvinas Islands.Argentina is a country that is proud of its culturaldiversity. Our Constitution establishes as a national goalthe recovery of the Malvinas Islands while guaranteeingthe strictest respect for the way of life of their inhabitants.I am convinced that the conditions exist for Argentina andthe United Kingdom to begin without further delay adialogue towards a definitive solution of the sovereigntydispute  thus fulfilling the numerous resolutions adoptedby the General Assembly and the Special Political andDecolonization Committee.Argentina is the sixth-largest troop contributor to theOrganization. At this time  we are involved in 10 of the17 current operations  including those in Kosovo and EastTimor. We have also incorporated personnel from otherLatin American countries into our troops.In Argentina  the defence and promotion of humanrights is a State policy. That is why we have activelyparticipated in the establishment of the InternationalCriminal Court  as a way to put an end to the culture ofimpunity.The numerous humanitarian missions in which“White Helmets” have been deployed in South America Central America  the Middle East  Africa and theCaucasus are a reflection of the success of this initiative which I put forward in 1993. Argentina agrees with theSecretary-General that the “White Helmets” can provideassistance  in close partnership with the Blue Helmets  inconflict situations.Argentina supports a world economy of openmarkets. However  we see the re-emergence of hiddenforms of protectionism. This is why we call on all States in particular to the most developed ones  to take part inthe “millennium round”  with the goal of attaining anopen  multilateral system that excludes no sector ofeconomic activity.As evidence of our concern regarding environmentalissues  in November 1998 Argentina hosted the fourthmeeting of the Conference of the Parties to the UnitedNations Framework Convention on Climate Change which adopted the Buenos Aires Plan of Action. Duringthe fifth ministerial meeting of the Zone of Peace andCooperation of the South Atlantic  which was held inBuenos Aires in October 1998  a Plan of Action wasadopted for the first time in order to carry out theobjectives of the Zone  which include the protection ofthe environment and of living resources.5The international community must urgently preparecontingency plans to face the year 2000 problem in such away that essential community services are not affected.Since 1 January 1999  Argentina has been an electedmember of the Security Council. I would like briefly toshare some thoughts with the Assembly.The responsibility of the Security Council in themaintenance of peace cannot be irreplaceable  and itsauthority must be strengthened.The Council must work in cooperation with otherbodies of the United Nations system and with regionalorganizations in order to carry out its tasks effectively.We have a responsibility towards the men and womenwho make up the Blue Helmets  as well as towards thosewho perform humanitarian work in conflict situations. It isour obligation to protect them. We call upon countries toratify the Convention on the Safety of United Nations andAssociated Personnel.Concerning the reform of the Security Council Argentina supports the creation of a system of non-discriminatory  open rotation. It would be unfair andunrealistic  at the beginning of a new millennium  tomultiply the privileges and discriminatory practices thatcame about only as a result of war in 1945. Therefore  nonew categories of membership should be introduced inregions where those categories do not exist  especially iftradition and history do not warrant it.Finally  I am convinced that the United Nations iscalled upon to play an even more relevant role in thetwenty-first century. Argentina  which is now to be amongthe 15 main countries of the Organization  will participatewith the same conviction as always in the realization of thenoble objectives of the Charter.Once again  I thank you  Sir  and all the Members ofthe United Nations. After 10 years and six months  I bidyou farewell for the last time."
"7",255,"ARM",54,1999,"May I begin bycongratulating the President on his election. I am confidentthat the skills and vast experience he has acquiredthroughout his distinguished diplomatic career will providethe guidance we need to guarantee the successful outcomeof the session. I must also recall the valuable contributionof his predecessor  Mr. Opertti  to the work of the lastsession of the General Assembly.I would like to take this opportunity to extend mywarm welcome and congratulations to the Republic ofKiribati  the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom ofTonga on their admission to the United Nations.As the twentieth century comes to an end  it isevident that all countries in the world — advanced developing or transitional — will be substantially affectedby globalization. Further specialization and the wideningof markets through trade  the larger division of labour anda more efficient and diversified allocation of financialresources should increase overall productivity and raiseliving standards. However  no country will benefit fromthis trend spontaneously and automatically. The majortasks which Governments face today are development andthe pursuit of sound policies and appropriate structuraladjustments to meet the challenges and take advantage ofthe opportunities that globalization offers. While sounddomestic economic planning and reforms are critical tomeeting the challenges of globalization  regionalcooperation and integration processes are essential tomaximizing the emerging benefits and opportunities.We  as a country and the region as a whole  aretrying to adjust to the multiple stresses of post-Sovieteconomic  cultural and political transformations. Clearlythese problems can stress relations as much within Statesas between them. Armenia does not see either itself or theregion as being permanently condemned tomarginalization; rather  it believes that close cooperationin the region  whether political  economic or securitybased  will help bring lasting stability and prosperitybased on a sense of solid and shared emergent values.Cooperation within the framework of regional economicinitiatives  such as the Interstate Oil and Gas Transport toEurope (INOGATE) programme and the TransportCorridor: Europe-Caucusus-Asia (TRACECA) project  isessential. Armenia is sincerely open to such cooperation although we have to state with regret that the blockadesimposed on Armenia by Turkey and Azerbaijan are aserious obstacle to such cooperation. It is obvious that theregion's high potential cannot be fully utilized if attemptsare made to isolate one of its constituents. Such attemptsare doomed to failure and will adversely affect allconcerned in the region.The Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC) isanother mechanism that could contribute to the region'seconomic development. The activities of the recently19established Black Sea Trade and Development Bank willconsiderably contribute to carrying out the projectselaborated by the member States of the Black SeaEconomic Cooperation. In this regard  Armenia fullysupports the granting of observer status in the GeneralAssembly to the BSEC.A young republic in transition from a long nightmareof totalitarian  single-party State to the emergence of ademocratic  free-market  open society  Armenia mustsimultaneously consolidate its State structures  move itseconomy forward and resolve the Nagorny Karabakhconflict. It must do all three at the same time  for they arein fact interdependent. First and foremost  Armenia mustensure that the Armenian population of Nagorny Karabakhcontinues to enjoy its security within its own lands. Ourrecent memories of vulnerability and insecurity make itimpossible for any Armenian anywhere to accept anythingless than the inalienable right of the people of NagornyKarabakh not to be subjugated  not to be dominated and notto be subordinate. Armenia understands this and is activelyengaged in pursuing in every possible forum a resolution ofthe conflict with Azerbaijan that would achieve peacewithout endangering the hard-won and legitimate rights ofour own people to live in secure dignity and freedom.Since 1992 the Organization for Security andCooperation in Europe (OSCE) has played a key role in theprocess of finding a peaceful solution to the conflict inNagorny Karabakh. It has been actively involved  throughthe various permutations of the Minsk process  to define theelements for a durable peace and stability in the region ofthe Transcaucasus. Armenia is committed to pursuing everypossible and credible attempt to resolve the conflicts thatlinger in the region. It is committed to exploring everyavenue for peaceful relations with all its neighbours relations based on mutual respect and recognition.The OSCE  through the Co-Chairmen of the MinskGroup  is trying to reconcile seemingly incompatibleprinciples. We have always remained opposed to one-sidedorthodoxy and have always advocated a more flexibleapproach. It is therefore with interest that Armenia andNagorny Karabakh received the Minsk GroupCo-Chairmen's draft proposal during their latest visit to theregion. My Government  as well as the authorities ofNagorny Karabakh  considered this formulation by theCo-Chairmen a more realistic effort in trying to address thethorny issue of the status of Nagorny Karabakh withminimal prejudice to either of the competing claims.Indeed  we must distinguish between stability andthe forced maintenance of the status quo. Conflating thetwo is neither wise nor practicable in the long run. Astatus quo in political life is never inherently permanent and a viable policy of stability requires a mechanism topursue an evolutionary  dynamic process of managingchange. We have new and dynamic challenges to thestatus quo; we should not be shy in addressing thesechallenges creatively and objectively to conceive moreadaptive answers rather than falling back into acomfortable  yet dangerously elusive  status quo.As Armenia actively defends and pursues theNagorny Karabakh people's right to self-determinationthrough peaceful means  we also sympathize with andsupport all other just self-determination claims in otherparts of the globe. Armenia applauded the IndonesianGovernment's courage when it announced the conduct ofthe referendum on East Timor's independence. Today weare concerned with the latest developments  but we hopethat the results of the popular consultation will be fullyrespected. We also commend the role that the UnitedNations has played in organizing and supervising thepopular consultation.Armenia also welcomes the most recent positivedevelopments in the Middle East peace process. We hopethat the Palestinian people's right to self-determinationwill be fully realized  thus bringing lasting peace andstability to the Middle East.The last decade of the twentieth century has beenmarked by serious achievements in the sphere ofdisarmament and global and regional arms control  andmore remains to be done. At the global level  that wouldmean reviewing the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons (NPT) in the year 2000; completing thework of the Biological Weapons Convention Ad HocGroup on a compliance and verification protocol;completely eliminating existing stocks of chemicalweapons and ensuring the universality of the ChemicalWeapons Convention regime. Similarly  at the regionallevel  we attach great importance to the successfulconclusion of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forcesin Europe (CFE) adaptation process  which will be signedby heads of States at the OSCE summit this November.We are convinced that the adapted Treaty willsignificantly contribute to the strengthening of Europeansecurity.In pursuing its national policies  Armenia has madeit a priority to support the international efforts in securing20peace and stability throughout the world. We believe thatour full participation in the work of the Conference onDisarmament will allow us to make further contributions tothe issues of arms control and disarmament. We hopemembers will support Armenia in its willingness to becomea full member of the Conference on Disarmament.Armenia welcomes the millennium summit initiative.At the threshold of the new millennium  it is important forheads of State and Government to discuss the tasks that theUnited Nations is going to undertake in providing globalpeace and security. Believing that the United Nationsshould play the leading role in the formation of aninternational anti-criminal strategy  Armenia supports theidea of holding  in Vienna in the year 2000  the TenthUnited Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and theTreatment of Offenders.We call for the accession of the maximum number ofcountries to universal conventions against terrorism andsupport the Russian proposal on a United Nationsconvention for combating acts of nuclear terrorism.Armenia  likewise  supports the initiative of holding aconference or a special session of the General Assemblyagainst terrorism in 2000.On 1 October  Armenia will sign the Statute of theInternational Criminal Court  thus becoming the eighty-seventh State to do so.Maintenance of international peace is one of the mostimportant functions of the United Nations. The challengesthat the international community faces today are diverse andcomplicated. This holds true especially for the reform of theSecurity Council  since ensuring peace and securitythroughout the world depends on a Security Council whichfunctions effectively. Security Council resolutions  includingthose on peacekeeping operations  should be unbiased anduniversal and reflect a common approach to conflicts  basedon internationally accepted principles and criteria. One wayto strengthen the role and function of the Security Councilis to ensure a more equitable representation of themembership of the United Nations in that organ  inaccordance with the sovereign equality of States and otherrelevant provisions of the Charter  and to make its workmore transparent. Representation in the Security Councilthat is more equitable can be achieved by increasing thenumber of its members  taking into account the growth inthe membership of the United Nations.After this brief comment on matters that concernArmenia's current affairs  its membership in the UnitedNations and the outstanding issues of the NagornyKarabakh conflict  allow me a moment of reflection. Weare often so preoccupied by immediate crises thatlingering  chronic and fundamental phenomena do notalways get our full attention.At this end of the century and millennium and onthe threshold of a new era  we would not be candid if wedid not admit to a certain disappointment  a certain sadrecognition that we  as a collectivity  a community ofnations  have not come as far as people everywherewould have wished us to come. I am sure we are notalone in our disappointment as we look around us and seethat the hopes of 1989 have not been fully realized in thelast 10 years: Rwanda  Kosovo and East Timor are all historically speaking  very much in the present.It is not for lack of charters  conventions anduniversal declarations that tragic events and murderousactions are committed  often by States  and even in thename of those same charters  conventions anddeclarations. After the Second World War  after the endof the cold war  we might have been justified in expectingsome respite from the organized display of man'sinhumanity to man  of fratricidal war between citizensand State attempts to exterminate some part of its ownpeople. But of course very recent experience tells us thatthe persecution of innocent civilians on no other groundsthan their ethnicity  religion or national origin continuesunabated.Armenia and Armenians have a unique historythrough which to interpret these events. We notice theever more frequent use of the term “genocide” incontinent after continent and we are reminded of our owntragic experience as genocide victims at the beginning ofthis century. It is sad but true that the genocide ofArmenians  which began in 1915  opened this century ofhorrors. We at least are convinced that nothing contributesas much to the repetition of horrors as the reluctance andunwillingness with which those complicit in them tell thetruth  or even their avoiding doing so at all. Denying thereality of evil  portraying it as merely relative andrendering it banal have done much to have evil seen as apolitical event to manipulate and equivocate andprevaricate about in the name of realpolitik.In Armenia  our democracy and future prosperitydepend on there coming a time when  through peace  theCaucasus will fulfil its promise as a region of neighbourlycooperation and economic growth. Without regionalpolitical stability  the regional economic prospects for all21countries of the Caucasus will remain precarious. Andunless the security needs and the aspirations of the peopleof the region are satisfied  there can be no politicalstability."
"8",288,"ATG",54,1999,"Antigua andBarbuda offers hearty congratulations on the election ofthe president of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourthsession. His efforts towards bringing about theindependence of Namibia are well known  and many ofus remember when he occupied a seat on the right side of33the main section of this Hall  sitting as an observer behindthe name plate of the South-West Africa People'sOrganization (SWAPO).Mr. Gurirab's call for the return to Africa of itsplundered artwork and artifacts struck a chord  as those ofus who studied the African liberation struggles will recallthat some 25 years ago  when he was a younger individual he pleaded with this body for the return of African iconswhich adorned European and North American museums andprivate collections. My country is most supportive of hisplea and would urge that the priceless treasures of artwork icons and relics be returned to the continent from whichthey were taken.My country also wishes to thank his predecessor Didier Opertti  who hails from Latin America and theCaribbean  for the astute and skilful manner in which heconducted the affairs of the fifty-third session. Likewise my nation's sentiments go out to Secretary-General KofiAnnan  and we wish him continued success in the arduoustasks of bringing peace  harmony  development and justiceto a global community not yet united into a true family ofnations.A warm welcome is simultaneously extended to theRepublic of Kiribati  the Republic of Nauru and theKingdom of Tonga on becoming full-fledged members ofthe United Nations.To the people of our sister Caribbean Community(CARICOM) State of the Bahamas  we extend our profoundsympathy in the wake of the devastation wrought byHurricane Floyd upon the islands of Abaco  Eleuthera  SanSalvador and Cat Island  as well as other parts of thecountry. We thank donor countries and internationalinstitutions for the assistance given in the past  and we hopethat there will be a speedy response to the needs of theBahamian community at this time.In this regard  special mention has to be made ofKuwait for the manner in which it follows up on assistingsmall Caribbean countries in times of peril  and we urge theinternational community to work towards the preservationof that country and the maintenance of the dignity of itspeople.It was with delight and glee that I read the Secretary-General's descriptive definition of globalization  as it tookin some of the considerations that my country has broughtbefore this body over the past three years. He stated “Globalization is a summary term for theincreasingly complex interactions betweenindividuals  enterprises  institutions and marketsacross national borders. The manifold challenges itposes  challenges that cannot successfully beaddressed by nation States acting on their own provide the most immediate and obvious reason forstrengthening multilateral cooperation. Globalizationis manifest in the growth in trade  technology andfinancial flows; in the continuing growth andincreasing influence of international civil societyactors; in the global operations of transnationalcorporations; in the vast increase in transboundarycommunication and information exchanges  mostnotably via the Internet; in transboundarytransmission of disease and ecological impact; andin the increased internationalization of certain typesof criminal activity. Its benefits and risks aredistributed unequally  and the growth and prosperityit provides for many is offset by the increasingvulnerability and marginalization of others — and bythe growth of 'uncivil society'.” (A/54/1  para. 220)Clearly  globalization leads to the reduction of thesovereignty of States  with the weakest and the smallestbeing the biggest losers. Sadly lacking in the argumentsfor globalization is the need to give consideration to thepace  direction and content of liberalization due todifferent levels of development and the need to build upnational capabilities. Above all is the insistence on theprinciple of free trade for the developing world and anexemption from the same for the industrialized countries.Protective devices are inbuilt for farmers in the dominanteconomies  which include subsidies  guaranteed markets payments not to produce beyond a certain level in orderto maintain price levels and quite often insistence thatimported farm belt products come in by way of limitedmeans of processing and under the most stringent ofguidelines. On the other hand  when former colonialcountries provide preferences to their previous colonies ofexploitation  challenges are mounted through the WorldTrade Organization by multinational enterprises. There isno more blatant example than Chiquita in regard to theCaribbean banana producers.The sad thing is that there is clear knowledge that inmodern times there has never been free trade. It is not myintention to de-glorify Richard Cobden and John Bright but the repeal of the corn laws in nineteenth-centuryBritain had more to do with the failure of the potato cropsin Britain and Ireland  strikes by workmen against wagereductions and an alliance of industrial and commercial34interests against the landed gentry than it had to do withfree trade. Yet irrespective of the fallacy of this free tradeargument  recipients of benefits under the Lomé Conventionare literally being told that they  but not the dominantPowers  must conform to and operate under the fallacy.Any disaster to banana production in the Caribbeanwill affect not only the banana-producing countries  but allof the Caribbean Community. Our countries are striving toremove themselves from dependence on aid. GlenysKinnock  a member of the European Parliament  put itsuccinctly when she stated that the banana trade provideda ladder out of poverty for the Caribbean region and thatthe call for the regime to be dropped and direct aid to besubstituted was unrealistic. She went on to state that it waswrong to claim that attempts to diversify were not takingplace.In CARICOM  we do not wish to become internationalmendicants; otherwise the current situation  in which somedominant countries exercise undue pressure upon ourmodus vivendi  will increase to the point where we willhave to dance to whichever tune the piper or pipers play.The United Nations should be viewed as the foremostinternational body with a semblance of egalitarianism. Itshould not be viewed as the institution of the dominantcountries in the five regional groups; and  more than that it ought to be the body that stands up to the encroachmentof multinational enterprises that attempt to stifle the lifelineor lifeblood of legitimate and sovereign countries. If indeedthe United Nations is the champion of equality  ofsovereignty  of the maintenance of traditional practiceswhich in reality do not harm others  then the collectivecountries should denounce this imposition by amultinational entity  which will bring ultimate and profoundhardships upon our humanfolk — be they young men orold men  children or maidens  matrons or old women. Wehave said it before  and will reiterate that what is beinginflicted upon the Caribbean banana producers is an act ofwar.The perils of our States are certainly not limited tobananas  and Antigua and Barbuda  as well as the majorityof countries represented on the Executive Board the UnitedNations Development Programme (UNDP)  were mostsurprised to experience a challenge from a member of theSecurity Council relating to our first-country cooperationframework. This was presented  by a country with whichwe have cordial relations  as being a matter of principle  asAntigua and Barbuda's per capita income is $8 000 and in1998 it ranked twenty-ninth in the Human DevelopmentReport. There was absolutely no mention of the fact thatin the vulnerability index  Antigua and Barbuda ranksextremely high  due in part to the frequency with whichhurricanes batter our twin-island State or threaten ourlovely shores. Consequently  Antigua and Barbuda onceagain had to offer a reminder that its graduation from theloan windows of international financial institutions andfrom development assistance of other internationalagencies  based only on the narrow criterion of per capitaincome  which ignores the serious and persistent problemsconfronted by Antigua and Barbuda and most Caribbeansmall island developing States  is both unfair and unjust.We also had to point out that 5 per cent of our country'spopulation consists of Montserratans who have beendisplaced by volcanic eruption. This has meant expandingour infrastructure to accommodate the unfortunate soulsfrom the Emerald Isle.Antigua and Barbuda supports the concept of UNDPand the United Nations Population Fund working withand rendering assistance to countries described as havingtransition economies  as well as countries which havesuffered the ravages of internecine warfare  that haveabsorbed significant numbers of refugees and which aresubject to many vulnerabilities  including natural disasters and are victims of economic practices which work againsttheir advancement. The work of UNDP is valuedworldwide  and countries which are most vulnerableshould certainly be at the forefront for assistance andguidance. We have to ask once again if we must bepenalized because of our successes. I sincerely hope thatin this body  particularly among the major financialcontributors  that it is not the view that small islanddeveloping States cannot advance beyond a certain levelof development  as  otherwise  they would beoverreaching themselves and delving into a domainreserved for members of a certain club. Antigua andBarbuda takes its role in the United Nations veryseriously and will remain dedicated to the principle ofegalitarianism.We annually recite our vulnerabilities  paying mostattention to the furore of natural disasters  and over thelast 10 years my country has experienced four hurricanes.Whereas it is a glorious sight to witness volcaniceruptions in Montserrat from Antigua  the reality of thedangerous consequences is always present. We areadditionally faced with the activities of Kick'em Jenny  anundersea volcano off the spice island of Grenada. TheCaribbean Development Bank is providing a grant to theSeismic Research Unit of the University of the WestIndies for the establishment of a mechanism for35continuous monitoring of the volcano. According to onescholar “Not only will the communities of the Grenadines andnearby islands have to guard against debris ejectedduring a volcanic explosion  but the entire Caribbeanwill be jeopardized by the threat of seismic waves known as tsunami”.This is yet another example of our vulnerability.Irrespective of our trials  tribulations and unfaircastigations  my country  when appraised objectively  hasbeen considered a marvel; hence its continued high rankingon the human development index. We practise theWestminster model of parliamentary democracy and do soeffectively. Our national elections are open and transparent.Our first national hero  Sir Vere Cornwall Bird appropriately dubbed Father of the Nation  died this year and Members of Parliament in both the House and theSenate were lavish in their praise of one who wasinternationally acclaimed — particularly in Africa  where hehad an impact on many of its leaders  both during and afterthe colonial era  and in the African diaspora of the NewWorld.We have remained committed to the empowerment ofthe socially and economically challenged. Women occupysenior positions in the civil service and are represented insignificant numbers in the professions. In one theyoutnumber men. In the area of violence against women legislation has been enacted to give greater protection to thefemale members of our society. In the desire of theGovernment to ensure that its people enjoy a decentstandard of living and an improved quality of life  theGovernment has energetically tackled this responsibility.And  in the absence of truly vibrant private sectors to leadeconomic growth and development as in developedcountries  the tasks performed by the Government haveexpanded and have become more demanding.Antigua and Barbuda has  however  never been shorton ideas as to how to help itself and as to how it can beassisted internationally in overcoming vulnerability andaccelerating sustainable development. Sustainabledevelopment is foremost in our thinking. At the sixthmeeting of the Commonwealth Consultative Group onEnvironment at the United Nations in April  we receivedsupport from the attending States for the ideas posited.In the first place  Antigua and Barbuda hopes that thevulnerability index being developed by the Commonwealthsecretariat and the World Bank task force will beintroduced as soon as possible into internationalorganizations. This must be borne in mind from theperspective that we have repeatedly addressed thelimitations and unfairness of using per capita income inassessing our economic efficacy.Secondly  following the decision of the disputestribunal of the World Trade Organization supporting thecontention of the discrimination directed at the bananaregime operating under the Lomé Treaty  there is anurgent need for the World Trade Organization to applyspecial and differential treatment to small islanddeveloping States as it does to least developed countries.If markets in Europe are eroded for small States  thoseStates will deteriorate economically  socially andpolitically to the point of placing yet another burden onthe international community. This deduction is made froman analysis of the dispute tribunal's ruling  which suggeststhat the entire quota system for imports by the EuropeanUnion from the African-Caribbean-Pacific countries forall products is now under threat.In the third place  we would like to reiterate the callmade for a disaster fund in 1995 by our Prime Minister The Right Honourable Lester Bird. He made that callfollowing the devastation of hurricane Luis  which wipedout one year of Antigua and Barbuda's gross domesticproduct in 36 perilous hours. Whereas the existingmechanisms address the purpose of relieving immediatesuffering and agony  they are woefully insufficient forreconstruction and rehabilitation.As one who represents his country on the Committeeof 24  the so-called Decolonization Committee  I wassomewhat taken aback to hear the Foreign Minister of acountry that had previously supported non-interventionstate that the United Nations has failed to address well-known conflicts of catastrophic proportions in a timelymanner. It would therefore seem that more and morecountries are moving towards the acceptance of jointaction in a given country if there is a clear case ofgenocide and a total violation of human rights.What happened in East Timor goes well beyond thepoint of frustration. Since my country has from quiteearly on advocated the right of the people of WesternSahara to self-determination  we have been saddened eachtime that plans for a referendum among the Sahraouipeople have been delayed. We believe that each and everypostponement interferes with and impedes the will of self-determination. The happenings in East Timor will have a36further impact on the will of the staunch and hardySahraoui people  and this gives us cause for great concern.It is important that everything be done to avoid a repetitionof what has happened in East Timor after people haveexercised their right of self-determination.Like other countries  my country believes thatintervention in affairs within another State should be thelast resort. But there are many questions to be answered inregard to oppression  degradation and dehumanization. TheEast Timor example should set us working to avoid anothercatastrophe of that magnitude. I have long marvelled at theprophetic brilliance of the former Foreign Minister ofUruguay  Eduardo Rodr'guez Larreta  who in 1946 arguedthat non-intervention could not be converted into a right toconvoke one principle in order to violate all other principleswith impunity. Nothing  however  is being advocated hereexcept that we address ourselves meaningfully towardsmeasures to avoid another East Timor.So much have we been looking forward to the newmillennium that we have defied the laws of mathematicsand brought forward the beginning of the twenty-firstcentury by making it come about in the last year of thetwentieth century. Even at the United Nations is the year2000 being proclaimed as the beginning of the newmillennium. Be that as it may  it is not sufficient toproclaim a new millennium and to have the grand  plannedcelebration. The commitment to the eradication of poverty the achievement of peace and security and cooperation fordevelopment should be sincere  meaningful and followedthrough to the level of profound accomplishment.Antigua and Barbuda cherishes the United Nations andis not unmindful of the numerous advances that have comeabout as a result of its impact in conflict resolution  themaintenance of peace  the shelter and sanctuary provided torefugees  the promotion of human rights  the eradication ofcertain diseases and numerous other tangibles. Thus Antigua and Barbuda remains ready to continuecontributing to the advancement of humanity and will  as ithas done in the past  insist on the principle ofmultilateralism. Together  our countries  large and small can make contributions in overcoming the plagues withwhich we are afflicted and move towards peace  cohesion harmony and the alleviation of poverty in the comingcentury."
"9",335,"AUS",54,1999,"May I begin by adding mycongratulations to those of my colleagues on your election Sir  as President of the General Assembly at itsfifty-fourth session. You are no stranger to these halls —you were here first as an observer and later as arepresentative. You bring a wealth of experience to yourposition  and we are pleased to see Namibia takingleadership roles in both the General Assembly and theSecurity Council.Before I move to the main substance of my remarkstoday  I want to take this opportunity to mention twomatters.First  I welcome the three new members of theUnited Nations: Kiribati  Nauru and Tonga. Havingworked closely with these three countries in our ownAsia-Pacific community  it is a particular pleasure for me as the Foreign Minister of Australia  now to have theopportunity to take that cooperation into this larger familyof nations.The second matter is one that seized the attention ofthe entire Australian population earlier this year: the fateof two CARE Australia workers  Steve Pratt and PeterWallace  who were imprisoned by the Federal Republicof Yugoslavia. Thanks in no small measure to the supportof the international community  Steve and Peter werereleased from prison on 1 September. The efforts ofSecretary-General Kofi Annan  the High Commissionerfor Refugees  Mrs. Ogata and the High Commissioner forHuman Rights  Mrs. Robinson  and the continued supportof the United Nations Office for the Coordination ofHumanitarian Affairs  were invaluable in gaining themen’s release.I would also like to thank President Ahtisaari ofFinland  the Greek Government  Nelson Mandela  PopeJohn Paul and the many other individuals who generouslylent their support to this cause. The internationalcommunity’s cooperation in this case demonstrates thestrong commitment we share to protecting ourhumanitarian workers from persecution  and to ensuringtheir capacity to carry out their important work in safety.Australia will continue to support international efforts tosecure the release of Branko Jelen  a Yugoslav nationaland an employee of CARE Australia  who continues toserve time in a Yugoslav prison.You  Mr. President  take up your responsibilities ata most auspicious time  as the nations of the world entera new millennium. As they do so  it is appropriate for usto reflect on the past and the future of the United Nations what it has achieved and what tasks remain unfulfilled.8Of course  the various aspects of this subject are asnumerous and diverse as the operations of the UnitedNations itself  which has evolved from a modest operationin the early days after the end of the Second World War tobecome an Organization that touches on just about everyfacet of human existence.Today I want to concentrate on just two matters. Thefirst is perhaps the most fundamental task before thisOrganization: the maintenance of global peace and securitythrough humanitarian intervention. This is a subject that hasbeen at the centre of my own thinking  especially overrecent weeks because of the role Australia has played in theresolution of the conflict in East Timor. I believe that theactivities of the United Nations in that Territory stand as anexample of the kind of work to which this Organization canreally add value.The other matter — the reform of the UnitedNations — is on the face of it a rather prosaic matter. But in truth  reform is the key to every single function of thisOrganization  for without it we cannot hope to equip theUnited Nations to face the demands of our ever-changinginternational environment. The United Nations must changeand adapt  or become increasingly irrelevant.I turn now to the question of the future of East Timor.It is now just over a week since the first elements of theInternational Force in East Timor (INTERFET) beganarriving in Dili to commence the task set for it underSecurity Council resolution 1264 (1999) of 15 Septemberto restore peace and security in East Timor  to protect andsupport the United Nations Mission in East Timor incarrying out its tasks and  within force capabilities  tofacilitate humanitarian assistance programmes.I am pleased to report that INTERFET’s deploymenthas been smooth and peaceful  and that elements of theforce are now spreading across the territory of East Timor.It has begun the vital work of bringing peace back to thetroubled island  and of assisting in creating the right climatefor the provision of the food  shelter and medical assistancethat the East Timorese desperately require. This is the latestchapter in the long association of the United Nations withEast Timor  an association that has lasted for more than aquarter of a century. The process that has brought us herehas been long and difficult  but at last we may beapproaching a peaceful resolution of the tragedy that hasbeset the East Timorese people for so long.The fact that we have arrived at this point owes muchto President Habibie of Indonesia. It was President Habibiewho led his country down the path of democracy after thedeparture of former President Soeharto. Under PresidentHabibie’s guidance  Indonesia held its first democraticelections in more than four decades  and it now awaits theelection of its next President. It was also PresidentHabibie who decided to allow the people of East Timorto choose between greater autonomy within Indonesia andindependence. Those were momentous decisions —decisions that reflect the massive strides that Indonesiansociety has made in just a few short months. Australiastood by the Indonesian people as they began theirtransition to democracy  and we will continue to do so inthe years ahead.Regardless of the problems that have beset thetransition process in East Timor  President Habibie andhis administration deserve full credit for actually initiatingthat process. I also want to make special mention of therole played by the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  inseeking a peaceful resolution of East Timor's status.The conclusion on 5 May this year of the tripartiteAgreement among Portugal  Indonesia and the UnitedNations owed much to the hard work and perseverance ofthe Secretary-General  who helped guide the partiestowards a settlement that provided for a credible andorderly ballot on East Timor's future. In doing so  hemaintained the honourable tradition of his predecessors asSecretary-General  who since 1983 had been working withPortugal and Indonesia towards a comprehensive and justsolution to the region's difficulties.It would be remiss of me if I did not also mentionthe sterling work done both before and after theconclusion of the Agreement by the Secretary-General'sPersonal Representative  Ambassador Jamsheed Marker and his deputy  Francesc Vendrell. The work of those twomen was crucial to the successful outcome of thenegotiations and to the holding of the ballot in EastTimor.Of course  the conclusion of the tripartite Agreementwas just the beginning of the process to allow the EastTimorese to decide their own fate. With the establishmentby the Security Council on 11 June of the United NationsMission in East Timor (UNAMET)  the practical work ofholding the popular consultation got under way. Under theleadership of Ian Martin  UNAMET began the difficultand often dangerous task of organizing a vote in only 12short weeks. Thanks to the enthusiasm and application ofIan Martin and his team  that task was accomplished withresults that few could have ever dreamed of. The fact that9more than 450 000 people were able to register to vote andthat 98.6 per cent of them actually did so is a remarkabletribute to the courage and the thirst for democracy of theEast Timorese people.But it is also a tribute to the effectiveness ofUNAMET and its staff  and a fine example of howeffective the United Nations can be in situations of conflictand transition. The work done by UNAMET staff in thedays before the ballot and in the tragic days following itdeserves our highest praise. Unarmed  in a tense andemotionally charged atmosphere  they carried out theirduties magnificently. In particular  the military liaison andcivilian police components of UNAMET  led respectivelyby Brigadier General Rezaqul Haider of Bangladesh andCommissioner Alan Mills of Australia  played crucial rolesas the interface between UNAMET and the Indonesianpolice and military authorities.UNAMET carried out its work at great risk to the staffinvolved  and  tragically  several locally engaged employeespaid for their dedication with their lives. That fact is a starkreminder of the great personal cost that is often associatedwith United Nations operations  and a reminder to us all ofthe need to make the security and personal safety of UnitedNations staff one of our most urgent priorities. The UnitedNations must rely on its staff to carry out its variousmandates. A threat to the person of a United Nations staffmember must be treated as a threat against the UnitedNations itself.It is a matter of unfortunate record that the upsurge ofviolence in East Timor after the ballot on 30 August sweptup not just United Nations staff members  but hundreds andmaybe thousands of East Timorese. The world haswitnessed the most horrible cruelty visited on the island'spopulation by people who were unwilling to accept theoutcome of the vote. To the great credit again of PresidentHabibie  he sought military assistance through the SecurityCouncil. In response  the Security Council delivered astrong resolution and a positive mandate for peacekeepingoperations  a mandate that will ensure that the will of theEast Timorese people  as expressed in the 30 August vote will be carried out.We in Australia have been very heartened by thepositive international response to the call for military forcesto make up the international force in East Timor and itssuccessor peacekeeping force. As I have mentioned  theinternational forces under the command of Major-GeneralPeter Cosgrove  have begun to restore order in East Timor.There are currently some 3 200 personnel on the ground drawn from a range of countries  with strongrepresentation from our own Asia-Pacific region. Thelarge number of countries participating in the force  andtheir wide geographical representation  is evidence of thewidespread international determination to see a peacefuland orderly transition in East Timor's status.I am also very pleased to note that UNAMETpersonnel have now returned to the island  and will beable to continue their important work.In discussing the activities of the United Nations inEast Timor  I must also mention the humanitarian workdone by United Nations agencies. Mrs. Sadako Ogata  theUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  hastravelled to West Timor to examine the plight of EastTimorese refugees in that territory  and Australia fullysupports her efforts.Australia is also the staging point for humanitarianassistance operations being carried out by agencies suchas the World Food Programme and the United NationsChildren's Fund. Additional relief efforts are also plannedby the World Health Organization and the Food andAgriculture Organization of the United Nations. Australiahas already pledged $7 million towards the humanitarianefforts of United Nations agencies and otherorganizations.The United Nations is also seeking to address thehuman rights violations that have been widespread in EastTimor. Security Council resolution 1264 (1999) called onthose responsible for violence in East Timor to be broughtto justice. Australia supports efforts by the IndonesianGovernment and the United Nations to bring to accountthose responsible for the grievous acts of criminalviolence visited upon the East Timorese people  and willoffer all appropriate assistance in this regard.More generally  there is now an urgent need to moveas soon as possible to the third phase of the UnitedNations plan for East Timor. This will require all parties most especially Indonesia and Portugal  to work closelywith the Secretariat. Australia will do what it can to assistin this process  which will build the foundation for thetransition in the territory's status.In its activities in East Timor  the United Nationshas demonstrated some of its fundamental strengths as anorganization. It is helping to bring about the resolution ofan international problem that had been festering for aquarter of a century. It provided the infrastructure that10allowed a free and fair expression of the will of the EastTimorese people. And when the security situation could notbe controlled  it facilitated the creation of an internationalforce to put the transition process back on track and endgross violations of human rights.I have been struck by the deep historical resonances ofthis process  for when the United Nations was establishedat the end of the Second World War  part of its rationale asan organization was to have been the impartial andobjective resolution of international problems  free of theold cycles of retribution through resort to aggression. Theancient resort to armed force and the notion that might wasright were to have been overturned  and in their place thecommunity of nations was to cooperate to settleinternational disputes and solve global problems. The world having won a victory over nazism  was determined thatsimilar evils would never again prevail.Well  we have seen plenty of occasions in the past 50years where practice has not measured up to the ideals. Butevery now and then  the process works  and I believe thatmany elements of the work of the United Nations in EastTimor are evidence of that. Of course  that is not to saythat the process cannot be improved; of course it can. Butif we can identify and build upon the positive elements ofour East Timor experience  I believe that we can not onlyimprove the situation of the people of that territory  butmay also be able to provide a speedier and more thoroughresolution of other international crises in the future.We need also to draw lessons from the negativeaspects of events in East Timor. Through our efforts there we have shown what the United Nations can do well. Letus build on that effectiveness  and strive for an organizationthat is even more relevant to global peace and security inthe next millennium.I now turn to another aspect of increasedeffectiveness: the question of United Nations reform. In arecent report on preparations for the Millennium Assemblyand the millennium summit  the Secretary-Generaldescribed the United Nations as a unique institution. Noone could disagree that the contribution of the UnitedNations to the pursuit of peace and security  to theeconomic and social advancement of all peoples and to thepromotion of human rights over the last 50 years or so hasbeen not just of enormous value  but also truly unique inworld history.The twenty-first century  however  will bring with itnew challenges and  I hope  new opportunities.Under the direction of Kofi Annan  this Organizationhas begun the important and necessary steps to equipitself to face these challenges through genuineadministrative and management reform. This has includedpromising changes in financial and personnel practices significant economies  improving coordination betweenUnited Nations bodies  significant rationalization ofSecretariat structures and more efficient use oftechnology. Such reforms make the work of the UnitedNations more efficient and provide real savings for theOrganization. Those savings can then be used for otherprogrammes that benefit all Member States  butparticularly the developing Members of the UnitedNations.The challenge for the United Nations — and  let usall recognize its Member States — is to ensure that thismomentum is sustained and taken forward. A formerAustralian Prime Minister  Sir Robert Menzies  said over40 years ago that “when we talk of the United Nations we should remember what it is in fact  and not be led offby dreams of what we would like it to be in another kindof world.”We need to accept that the United Nations exists ina real world and be realistic about what it can achieve.We need to ensure that the Organization's structures andprocesses better reflect the realities of the twenty-firstcentury. We need an expanded  more representative andmore transparent Security Council  and an electoral groupsystem which reflects the geo-political and economicrealities of today rather than the early nineteen sixties. Toachieve real reforms on these and other subjects  MemberStates must work together in a sustained and cooperativemanner. And they must also demonstrate theircommitment to the Organization by paying theircontributions on time and in full.Reform of the United Nations means building astronger and more effective Organization that can deliveron its commitments to the world's people. It means lesswaste and more practical activities. It means developingan Organization that is equipped to meet whateverchallenges the new century may bring.Ultimately  it means creating a United Nations that canmaintain its relevance when many national andinternational institutions are falling by the wayside  madeobsolete by the rapid pace of change.I want to conclude my remarks with a call for theUnited Nations to concentrate on building on its strengths.I have mentioned the need to stick with a programme ofthorough and fundamental reform  for that is a basicprerequisite for the continued effectiveness of theOrganization. But I have also mentioned the United Nationswork in East Timor as an example of how the Organizationcan  and does  make a real difference in the resolution ofcomplex and challenging foreign policy and humanitarianproblems. Not only was the United Nations able toadminister a ballot in circumstances in which manyobservers thought the task impossible  but it was also ableto provide for the insertion of a peacekeeping force whenlaw and order broke down. Those who wished toexterminate an entire community were foiled.Those are great strengths. But we need to be able toconsolidate them to make the United Nations a moreeffective Organization. We must  for example  be able toensure that the United Nations can intervene quickly whenrapidly deteriorating conditions threaten entire nations. Thatwas the lesson of Rwanda. I was struck by the commentsmade by the Secretary-General on this subject when headdressed the Assembly last week. As the Secretary-General suggests  changing international circumstances —including the spread of notions of individual rights and theidea that the international community has a responsibility torespond effectively to humanitarian crises — arechallenging traditional notions of national sovereignty. TheUnited Nations needs to focus on these challenges andbegin the process of defining when and how theOrganization should act in the face of humanitarian crises.It may be an old cliché to say that the world isgrowing ever smaller  but it is true just the same. In daysgone by  the nations of the world may have been forgivenif they acted too slowly in the face of a humanitarian crisis.Tales of atrocities  famine and natural disaster took weeksor months to filter out from the more inaccessible areas ofthe globe. Today  those same stories are likely to be ontelevision screens within hours  or even minutes.In the face of such indisputable evidence Governments will be forced to act. Those that resist willhave to face a domestic and international audience as wellinformed as they. That is the kind of environment in whichthe United Nations will increasingly have to function where the results of inaction will be seen instantly and theconsequences of failure subject to instant and very tellingscrutiny.Some will be concerned about interference in nationalsovereignty  and obviously that is an important andlegitimate concern. Others will say that the greater principleis that of natural human solidarity. But whatever view iscorrect  this environment is a fact we now have to dealwith  whether we like it or whether we don't. When weall gather here in New York each year  it is easy to getcaught up in the daily business of the United Nations  inthe resolutions  the committee meetings  the briefings andthe caucusing.How often do we stop  and remind ourselves of thepurposes for which we meet? If we genuinely wish touphold the Charter  if we really do want to maintaininternational peace and security  help develop oureconomic and social strengths and promote respect forhuman rights and fundamental reforms  surely we canstart by upholding the most basic right of all  that of life.In the face of acts of genocide  or of human rightsabuses on a horrendous scale  the nations of the worldmust act. I am a firm realist when it comes to foreignpolicy  but am also a great believer in the value ofidealism. More than 50 years ago  our predecessorscreated the United Nations in the firm hope that therecould be a new international order to replace the old  aspirit of cooperative international action that could avoidthe competition and aggression that caused two worldwars.As we approach the end of this century  it is truethat the United Nations has not lived up to all the hopesof its founders. But the great promise of the Organizationremains. The United Nations response to developments inEast Timor has shown just what positive action on thepart of this Organization can accomplish. We know thegreat things this body can achieve. Let us all try to buildon those achievements  so that we may create anOrganization that can truly address the most pressingproblems of the international community. We can build anactive and practical United Nations to meet both theaspirations of its Member nations and  also  the legitimateneeds of all humanity."
"10",382,"AUT",54,1999,"Mr. President first let me congratulate you on your election to your highoffice and assure you of the full cooperation and supportof the Austrian delegation. I am convinced that we willhave a successful session of the General Assembly  thelast in this century  under your able guidance.Austria fully endorses the statement which was soeloquently delivered by the Foreign Minister of Finlandon behalf of the European Union. I would like to add thefollowing observations to that very comprehensivestatement.The United Nations in many ways finds itself at acrossroads. The Organization has to find its role andstrengthen its relevance in an increasingly turbulent world.To be sure  we are able to make progress on specificissues. But is that enough in the face of mounting globalchallenges? Much has been said and written in the lastfew years about globalization  and I believe we are allaware of the speed and impact of this very dynamicprocess. What we still need is a coherent politicalresponse to this phenomenon. We have to meet thechallenges and make the best possible use of theopportunities presented to us.While our everyday work must be focused onreaching achievable goals within a realistic time  we mustnever lose sight of our larger duty to provide humansecurity in its fullest sense. This means that we have toprovide individuals and communities with security dignity and quality of life. We have to protect themagainst threats to their safety and well-being  such asconflict  discrimination  poverty  organized crime corruption or repression.In recent years  a number of initiatives have beensuccessfully launched  in particular on landmines  small17arms and child soldiers. Austria is working very actively topromote the human security agenda  and I would like tohighlight three priority areas: human rights education  thefight against child pornography and the fight against whatthe Secretary-General has aptly termed the uncivil society.On the occasion of the twentieth anniversary of thepresence of the United Nations in Vienna next month  wewill organize a high-level meeting on these and otheraspects of human security.Most threats to human security have a human rightsdimension. This is why a human rights security agendamust include an overall strategy aimed at the strengtheningof a worldwide human rights culture. Recent events inKosovo or East Timor have shown that the most basicrights cannot be taken for granted. Again and again we willhave to assert the universality and indivisibility of humanrights. We therefore stress the importance of human rightseducation  which is essential for the promotion and theachievement of stable and harmonious relations withincountries and among communities. We must redouble ourefforts in support of the United Nations Decade for HumanRights Education. Next year’s mid-term evaluation ofprogress made in the Decade provides an ideal opportunity.Institutions and organizations with specialized expertise inour countries should identify specific ideas for furtheraction on human rights education activities at national level in foreign policy  and in the context of developmentcooperation.Every man and every woman must know his or herrights in order to become a full and equal member ofsociety. People must be provided at the national and theinternational level with effective remedies for human rightsviolations. We therefore welcome the successful conclusionof negotiations on the Optional Protocol to the Conventionon the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination AgainstWomen. Its adoption by the General Assembly and its earlyentry into force will have great significance for womenaround the world.Human security starts in the smallest entities of oursociety. The mutual learning process within families is oneof human beings' most valuable experiences. The family  asthe fundamental unit of society and the natural environmentfor the growth and well-being of all of its members  shouldbe afforded the necessary protection and assistance so thatit can fully assume its responsibilities within thecommunity  because it is within the family  first andforemost  where children  the most vulnerable group insociety  seek support and protection.Millions of children are being exploited worldwide.Their basic human rights are being denied in many ways.For some time now  and in particular during the Austrianpresidency of the European Union  Vice-Chancellor andForeign Minister Schüssel has been trying to focusattention on one particular aspect: child pornography onthe Internet. Next week  Austria will host an internationalconference on combating child pornography on theInternet. Organized by Austria  the European Commissionand the United States of America  the conference willbring together high-level officials from Ministries of theInterior and Justice  the judiciary and the police  expertsfrom international organizations  non-governmentalorganizations and the industry  especially Internet serviceproviders. The United Nations system will be representedby experts from the United Nations Children's Fund andthe United Nations Centre for International CrimePrevention. The main objectives of the conference are toreinforce cooperation between law enforcement officialsand the judiciary  establish codes of conduct for Internetservice providers and the further development of hotlinesand networks between them. The results of this initiativewill be presented to the United Nations.The fight against drugs and transnational organizedcrime has rightly been accorded priority status in thework of the United Nations. I am glad that the reformmeasures introduced by Secretary-General Kofi Annanhave reaffirmed Vienna's role as the United Nationscentre for fighting uncivil elements in society.Austria is particularly worried by reports about thesituation in Afghanistan  where the areas under poppycultivation area apparently doubled in 1998. We aretherefore appealing to all partners to enhance their effortsin assisting the United Nations International Drug ControlProgramme (UNDCP) to combat the cultivation andproduction of drugs in that region and elsewhere. As apractical contribution to this effort  Austria will sponsora UNDCP training seminar for Central Asian drugauthorities this autumn. Austria strongly believes that drugcontrol is  above all  in the interests of our children andfuture generations.In April 2000  the first United Nations conference inthe new millennium  the Tenth United Nations Congresson the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment ofOffenders  will take place in Vienna. The key issuescontained in the preliminary draft of the ViennaDeclaration on Crime and Justice: Meeting the Challengesof the Twenty-First Century (E/1999/30-E/CN.15/1999/12 para. 3)  whose final forum will be adopted at the18Congress  address the most burning questions ininternational crime prevention: trafficking in human beings smuggling migrants and illicit transfers of firearms.In this context  I can say with satisfaction that theAustrian initiative to elaborate an international legalinstrument against the smuggling of migrants  whichAustria presented to the General Assembly two years ago has gathered a great deal of support among United NationsMember States. Currently  intensive negotiations within theframework of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Elaboration ofa Convention against Organized Transnational Crime arebeing held and will hopefully be concluded next year withthe adoption of a universal protocol against the smugglingof migrants.The last of the series of world Conferences in the1990s showed that an innovative yet pragmatic approachcan work. This was the Third United Nations Conferenceon the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space UNISPACE III  which took place in Vienna in July thisyear. The Conference focused on the question of how toensure that space technology will benefit humanity in thetwenty-first century and that it is used effectively topromote security in all its forms for the benefit of allcountries. It has provided developing countries withopportunities to define their needs for space applications fordevelopment purposes and to identify ways and possibilitiesfor them to participate in international programmes whichdevelop these applications. UNISPACE III was both anovel and a successful type of Conference in bringingtogether industry and academia  and young people  as equalpartners and incorporating their insights into the finaldocuments.In the twenty-first century  the United Nations and theinternational community will be judged by their capacity toprevent armed conflict. At a time when the world'sproblems appear to be growing and the resources to tacklethose problems seem to be shrinking  we must be morestrategic than ever in devising new ways to approach thesechallenges.Again and again we have had to face the fact that theinternational community is not in the position to bridge thegap between early warning and early action. In future efficient mechanisms will have to be implemented byinternational organizations in order to act at an early stage.In our response to looming refugee crises  much fasteraction is needed to avoid human catastrophes like the oneswe have witnessed in Kosovo and East Timor.As part of its development cooperation concept Austria is currently working on a comprehensive strategyfor conflict prevention which combines all availablemeasures  from facilitation and mediation to a targeteduse of the instruments of development cooperation.Austria is actively involved in the Arusha peace processfor Burundi and is offering a broad range of seminars andtraining programmes on preventive diplomacy  inparticular with its partners in Africa. Austria'sdevelopment cooperation aims to promote bothsustainable development and sustainable peace.Austria has always lent its active support to UnitedNations efforts to maintain international peace andsecurity. Since 1960  it has been one of the majorcontributors to United Nations peacekeeping missions. Atthe moment  more than 1 500 Austrian troops  civilianpolice  military observers and civilian experts are servingin United Nations peacekeeping  and other United Nationsmandated operations  and in missions in which regionalorganizations are participating — from Kosovo to EastTimor  and from Western Sahara to Tajikistan. We willcontinue to do our utmost to assist the United Nations inits efforts to enhance stability in many areas of tensionaround the world.If we are to cope with all these challenges  weclearly have to reinforce the rule of law in internationalrelations. A large part of the legal basis already exists.What is needed to make it work is our common politicalwill to monitor and to ensure its application. This canonly happen in the framework of the United Nations  inparticular through the Security Council.In view of the United Nations primary responsibilityfor the maintenance of peace and security  it is crucialthat the United Nations prove its ability to act quickly anddecisively in conflict situations. The decisive action takenduring the Gulf war in 1990-1991 raised internationalhopes and expectations for the future.But already during the terrible conflicts in theterritory of the former Yugoslavia  particularly in Bosniaand Herzegovina  it took the Organization much longer tofind a successful crisis solution. It only managed to do soby applying a sensible subcontracting policy with regionalorganizations. The recent tragedies in Kosovo and EastTimor have both brought the United Nations and theSecurity Council to the brink of being perceived ininternational public opinion as ineffective or unable to act.19The Security Council  which carries the primaryresponsibility for international peace and security  mustmaintain its ability to act. It cannot be seen to be driven bythe subjective interest of members rather than by anobjective assessment of real requirements. It goes withoutsaying that the permanent members bear a particularresponsibility in this regard  which includes financialobligations. The privileges of permanent membership comewith a heavy obligation: to act whenever necessary. If apeace operation has to be established  it must not matterwhether the conflict situation is located in an area of littlestrategic interest or whether the country in questionmaintains unwelcome relations with another entity. Itsmandate and size must be based on the conditions on theground  and not depend on anybody’s willingness to financeit. Should the Security Council be seen to be unable tofulfil these functions  we will have to heed the call forreforms  including the role of its permanent members.On East Timor  the Security Council has finally livedup to its special responsibilities assigned to it under theCharter. This proves that the international community mustact decisively when confronted with massive violations ofinternational humanitarian law and human rights.Austria welcomes Security Council resolution 1264(1999) authorizing a multinational force for East Timorunder Chapter VII and the commitment of the IndonesianGovernment to cooperate with this force in theimplementation of the mandate. We hope that this initiativewill contribute to bringing about national reconciliation lasting peace and respect for the will of the people of EastTimor  expressed so clearly during the consultations on 30August 1999. Austria underlines the necessity to urgentlyprovide humanitarian assistance  and will also contribute tothese efforts.The vote on the future of East Timor must berespected by all sides. Austria  while underlining its desireto see a strong  democratic and united Indonesia  looksforward to recognizing East Timor once the processtowards independence is complete.Austria sharply condemns the atrocities committed inrecent weeks. Those who planned  authorized or executedthese acts must be held individually and personallyaccountable and be brought to justice.After a long impasse the peace process in the MiddleEast is back on track. Austria greatly welcomes thememorandum signed by Israel and the Palestinians atSharm el-Sheikh  which removes the obstacles to theimplementation of the Wye Agreement. Furthermore  wehave taken note with satisfaction that implementation onthe ground has already begun. Here I should especiallylike to point to the handing over of territory  the releaseof Palestinian prisoners and the beginning of the finalstatus negotiations. This clear commitment of the partiesshould augur well for further speedy progress on the roadto peace. Now it will also be necessary to bring aboutnew momentum in the Syrian/Lebanese track of the peaceprocess by relaunching the negotiations between Israel Syria and Lebanon. I think that all parties agree thatpeace and mutual understanding are the only viable optionfor a prosperous future for all nations in the Middle Eastregion.The western Balkans  being geographically so closeto Austria  will remain in the foreground of Austrianforeign policy. The most burning problem is currently thesituation in Kosovo  which merits the joint attention ofthe international community. I would like to commend thework which has already been carried out by the UnitedNations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo(UNMIK) and by KFOR  and the progress realized so far in spite of such difficult circumstances. True  in theimplementation of Security Council resolution 1244(1999)  and in our efforts to bring Kosovo back tonormalcy  there are delays and setbacks  in particular theinsecurity  the tensions in Kosovska Mitrovica  and theexodus of the majority of Kosovo Serbs and othernon-Albanians. Nevertheless  one must not forget theparamount importance of the Kosovo issue for thestability of the whole Balkan area  which is why we mustnot become discouraged when we meet problems. Rather we have to understand them as an incentive to redoubleour efforts. Yesterday’s demilitarization agreementbetween KFOR and the UCK is  I would say  a veryencouraging step in the right direction.In addition to setting up a functioning civiladministration  including police  creating a democraticpolitical atmosphere respectful of human rights repatriating over 1 million refugees  and reconstructingthe infrastructure and the economic life of Kosovo  it isUNMIK’s crucial task to facilitate a political processleading to a definite status of the province. This is a verycomplicated endeavour  which requires sound and prudentpreparation. We must not try to rush things  since it isclear that stability and reconciliation have to beestablished and solidified before we can tackle the finalstatus question.20The same holds true for Montenegro. We must  andwe will continue to  support the Montenegrin reformprocess  and we must not allow forces in Belgrade toundercut those pluralistic and economic improvements. Forthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as a whole  we willcontinue to work towards democratization  political reformand respect for human and minority rights. Upon suchchanges — which are not only urgently necessary butwhich are also yearned for by the Serb and Yugoslavpeople — Yugoslavia should  and will  take its rightfulplace in the international community.In spite of some progress made by Bosnia andHerzegovina  it still needs and deserves our intense help —both politically and financially. At the same time  it isincreasingly necessary for the Bosnians themselves to takeon more responsibility for their future and to start a processof decoupling themselves from dependency on internationalassistance.Let me emphasize at this juncture Austria’s strongbelief in the protection and promotion of minorities ingeneral. This attitude is based on historic experience andthe conviction that ethnic minorities constitute a trueenrichment of our societies.It is of interest for the international community torecall that there are existing successful settlements ofimportant minority issues in Europe. In particular  I thinkof the Austrian minority in the South Tyrol  which todayenjoys a well-balanced autonomy on the basis of the ParisTreaty of 1946 between Austria and Italy. Time and againit has been noted that this formula could be an example forthe settlement of minority disputes in other parts of theworld.Though regional organizations and coalitions of thewilling have credibly shown their readiness to take onresponsibilities in the maintenance of international peaceand security  the United Nations continues to provide theindispensable political  legal and institutional links to ensurethe acceptance  legitimacy and accountability of theirrespective efforts.The Organization for Security and Cooperation inEurope (OSCE) plays a central role in promoting peace security and stability in the regional context  in particularthrough its broad range of activities in the area of conflictprevention  crisis management and post-conflictrehabilitation. The broad scope and complex nature of thesecurity challenges in the region requires a pluri-institutional response. But that implies also an effectivecooperation among the institutions concerned. The OSCE as a regional arrangement according to Chapter VIII ofthe Charter of the United Nations  is closely cooperatingwith the United Nations in many fields and regions  suchas in Kosovo. In our capacity as the next Chairman-in-Office of the OSCE  we will continue the efforts tostrengthen the relationship between the OSCE and theUnited Nations at both the political and field levels.Let me conclude by confirming Austria's strongcommitment to the United Nations. In a little less thanone year  our Heads of State or Government willparticipate in the millennium summit. I hope that this willbe the occasion to unlock the potential of theOrganization. We must use the wonderful tool of ourOrganization as it was meant to be used: to ensure oursurvival on this planet in peace  freedom and dignity. Onspaceship Earth the supplies are limited  so we have tomake the best possible use of them. Whatever ourdifferences  we all know what needs to be done. Let usfind the political will to do it."
"11",407,"AZE",54,1999,"Allow me first of all tosincerely congratulate Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab on hisunanimous election to the presidency of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-fourth session and to expressconfidence that under his skilful leadership the Assemblywill cope successfully with the complex issues before it.I would like also to commend the President of theprevious session of the General Assembly  Mr. DidierOpertti  on his remarkable commitment to the success ofthe session.I wish also to congratulate and to welcome the newMembers of our Organization — the Republic of Kiribati the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga.Speaking from this lofty rostrum  representatives ofthe States Members of the United Nations are trying tocommunicate to their colleagues and the internationalcommunity the most pressing problems that theircountries face. The truth  which is not always pleasant  isexpressed here with hope for justice  understanding andsupport.States  including the Republic of Azerbaijan  thathave regained their freedom and now face threats to theirindependence  sovereignty and territorial integrity  counton the support of the international community. They arealso deeply concerned about the current difficulties of theOrganization. Member States look to the United Nationswith trust and hope. This places on the Organization animportant responsibility for finding a way out of thecurrent complex situation.In this connection  the Republic of Azerbaijanactively supports the United Nations reform process which our times demand. We believe that a transformedOrganization  adapted to modern realities  will be in aposition to cope with an increasing number of challengesand risks to international peace and security.Threats to the sovereignty  territorial integrity andsecurity of the Member States of the United Nations havebecome appallingly routine. States often face aggression military occupation  “ethnic cleansing”  separatism andterrorism. A conflict that is not dealt with in a timely andresolute manner is later transformed into a humanitariandisaster that brings about a very sensitive reaction on thepart of the international community.Given the resolute action by the internationalcommunity in the Balkans  the situation with regard to theunresolved or frozen conflicts in other regions seemsespecially tragic. We consider it unacceptable to setpriorities in this respect  and wish to draw the attention ofthe international community to the intolerable fact that15one fifth of the territory of a sovereign Member State of theUnited Nations — the Republic of Azerbaijan — hascontinued to be under foreign occupation for more than sixyears and that  as a result of “ethnic cleansing”  one out ofseven of its citizens is a refugee or displaced person in hisown country.The clear trend towards putting up with the behaviourof the aggressor and sometimes even conniving at hisattempts to legalize the situation in the conflict zone  aswell as the eagerness of some mediators to reach an easysettlement on the basis that the “ethnic cleansing” of theAzerbaijani population and the occupation of its territoriesis a fait accompli  will only lead to continued tension andfurther delay the prospects for a settlement of the conflictand the restoration of durable peace and stability in theregion  based on the norms and principles of internationallaw.The only valid premise for a lasting settlement ofconflicts is a timely display of determination and solidarityby the international community  first and foremost by theUnited Nations  which has primary responsibility for themaintenance of international peace and security  for theprotection and observation of the norms and principles ofinternational law and for making every effort to secure theimplementation of decisions taken.Like other countries facing aggression and militantseparatism  Azerbaijan rejects settlement models thatinfringe on its sovereignty  territorial integrity and the unityof its State and run counter to its national interests. Anexample is the concept of the common State  which wasproposed as a model for settlement in the context of certainconflicts  but failed to find the support of the countriesconcerned. That concept is pernicious  because it attemptsto distort the notion of statehood and State sovereignty; infact  it is an attempt to provide a legal framework for theideology of militant separatism.It goes without saying that an important factor in anysettlement is the readiness of the parties involved to find acompromise. At the same time  by definition  compromiseimplies reciprocity and clear limits. Seeking a realisticformula for a compromise based on adherence to the normsand principles of international law  taking into accountnational and State interests  the President of Azerbaijan Heydar Aliyev  has maintained direct contact and held talkswith the President of Armenia  Robert Kocharian. It isAzerbaijan’s hope that this approach can open newpossibilities to steer the settlement process out of thedeadlock that we have witnessed during the past year.It is now possible to speak about the achievement ofa positive climate  which should be complemented withmore active work by the Organization for Security andCooperation in Europe (OSCE) Minsk Group  which isresponsible for the settlement of the Armenia-Azerbaijanconflict  so that the negotiation process can be resumed inthe near future. We regard it as absolutely unjustified thatsome members of the Minsk Group use the fact that thereare direct contacts between Azerbaijan and Armenia as anexcuse for their stepping aside from the process and fortheir inactivity. In this connection  we call upon theCo-Chairmen of the Minsk Group to make every effortnecessary to bring about in the near future a revisedproposal for the settlement of the conflict that wouldrepresent an acceptable combination of elements.It will be necessary effectively to use the timeremaining before the OSCE summit in Istanbul in orderto come closer to achieving concrete results. It isextremely important that the consistency anddetermination of the international community bemaintained in advocating its declared positions on thesettlement of the conflict between Armenia andAzerbaijan. We believe  in particular  that the sequence ofsteps provided for in the Security Council resolutions onthe conflict continues to be optimal.Azerbaijan reaffirms its commitment to a peacefulsettlement and unconditional implementation of theceasefire until a political agreement on the cessation ofthe conflict is concluded. Guided by a spirit of goodwilland a sincere desire to reach progress in the settlementprocess  on 18 September 1999  during the visit of KnutVollebaek  the Chairman-in-office of the OSCE  thePresident of Azerbaijan  Heydar Aliyev  announced theunilateral release of all Armenian prisoners of war held inAzerbaijan. We expect an adequate reaction from theArmenian side in the near future.Azerbaijan supports the reform process in theOrganization  based on the proposals of theSecretary-General and the decisions of the GeneralAssembly. Reform of the Security Council continues tobe the priority problem. Azerbaijan fully agrees with theapproach reflected in resolution 53/30  in accordance withwhich any decisions on this issue would require thepositive vote of a minimum of two thirds of the MemberStates.We still believe that the representation of the Statesof Asia  Africa and Latin America in all membershipcategories of the Security Council should reflect modern16political realities. Azerbaijan reconfirms its support for theelection of Germany and Japan as permanent members ofthe Security Council. We continue to believe that  togetherwith that  objective reality calls for the allocation of oneadditional non-permanent seat to the Eastern EuropeanGroup.With regard to the reform and strengthening of theeffectiveness of the work of the Security Council  I cannotfail to draw the attention of the Assembly to the fact thatthe four resolutions adopted by the Security Council on theArmenia-Azerbaijan conflict  resolutions 822 (1993)  853(1993)  874 (1993) and 884 (1993)  have still not beenimplemented. We believe that the lack of an adequatereaction to the violation of the principles of the UnitedNations Charter and the non-compliance with decisionsadopted within the United Nations is seriously underminingthe image of the world Organization.Azerbaijan welcomes the increased attention of theSecurity Council to acute humanitarian problems in conflictsituations  and supports the inclusion in the mandate ofpeacekeeping forces of concrete and adequate provisions forthe demilitarization of conflict zones and the disarmamentof combatants  as well as of special provisions on theprotection of and support for the civilian population including women and children.Illegal arms transfers to conflict zones make theprospects for settlement more remote and aggravatehumanitarian disasters. Recently this has become a pressingproblem which requires special attention and specific jointaction by the international community. In this context breaches of the relevant provisions of Security Councilresolutions  especially by some of the Council’s ownmembers  are unacceptable. Azerbaijan supports conveningan international conference on the illicit arms trade in all itsaspects not later than 2001.We attach great importance to the timely convening ofa fourth special session of the General Assembly devotedto disarmament  which could determine the future course ofaction in the field of disarmament  arms control and relatedinternational security matters.Azerbaijan stands by the Convention on theProhibition of the Use  Stockpiling  Production and Transferof Anti-personnel Mines and on Their Destruction  andwelcomes its entry into force; we welcome also theoutcome of the First Meeting of States Parties  held inMaputo. A national agency in this sphere has been createdin Azerbaijan; it has begun its activities and has started toestablish cooperation with its international counterparts.Azerbaijan’s formal accession to the Convention isdirectly dependent on the issue of the continuingoccupation of its territory by Armenia.Azerbaijan has a highly positive view of theestablishment of the International Criminal Court  andsupports the work of the Preparatory Commission for theInternational Criminal Court on a number of provisions ofits Statute. We regard as very important the work beingdone by the Commission to define the crime ofaggression  and believe that the definition should be clearand viable  and that it should make provision for a normestablishing personal criminal responsibility. As a victimof aggression  Azerbaijan maintains that the Court shouldbecome an effective organ for the prosecution of thosewho commit crimes against humanity.My country is interested in taking an active part incombatting international terrorism  organized crime andillegal drug trafficking. The fight against these evils canbe effective only if it is based on joint efforts by allcountries  at both the regional and the global levels. Wesupport the idea of convening in 2000 an anti-terroristconference or a special session of the General Assemblyon this issue  and the elaboration of a declaration ofprinciples on the interaction of States in combattingterrorism. We hope that the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme (UNDP) will be able to mobilize additionalresources to continue the joint project on drug-abusecontrol of the UNDP  the United Nations InternationalDrug Control Programme and the Government ofAzerbaijan.Another emerging topical area of activities is theprovision of humanitarian relief assistance in emergencysituations and periods of natural disasters  such as thosethat we have witnessed in recent months. In thisconnection  Azerbaijan calls for increased assistance tothe victims of the tragic earthquake in brotherly Turkey which claimed thousands of human lives.Despite the objective difficulties caused by thearmed conflict and the transitional period  Azerbaijanbelieves that there is no alternative to its chosen course ofreform aimed at building a democratic society with amarket economy. As a State located at a key pointbetween Europe and Asia  Azerbaijan is keenly interestedin securing access to trans-European and trans-Asiancommunication networks; this would facilitate thedevelopment of industrial and trade links amongparticipating countries  improved access to markets 17increased integration links  and closer cooperation amongthe economies of European and Asian countries.Unfortunately  the process of the profoundtransformation of the national economy is facing the seriousconsequences of the presence in the country of 1 millionrefugees and internally displaced persons. Coping with thisemergency situation has been a primary concern of theAzerbaijan State for many years. Given the limited financialresources of our State  humanitarian assistance from theUnited Nations and other international organizations is anecessary element not only of the physical  but also of themoral survival of people who have lost their homes. Wewould like to express our most sincere gratitude to theUnited Nations  to the relevant United Nations agencies andto donor countries providing humanitarian assistance toAzerbaijan  and we call upon them not to reduce thevolume of that assistance.Allow me to touch briefly upon the role that theUnited Nations and its agencies are playing in Azerbaijan.At the last session  I spoke about the constructive workbeing done with respect to the social and economicdevelopment of our country by the United NationsDevelopment Programme. The UNDP is actively assistingthe Government of Azerbaijan and bilateral and multilateralhumanitarian organizations in addressing developmentissues. At the same time  my Government is deeplyconcerned at the fact that UNDP is entering the newmillennium with an extremely decreased financial base. Weall need a UNDP able to cope with the developmentproblems that we are not in a position to solve alone. Allparticipants in this process — donors and recipients ofassistance — should provide sincere and solid support tothe development activities of the United Nations.In this context  I would like to call upon all concernedto improve significantly the very difficult current financialsituation of the Organization.With reference to relations between my country andthe United Nations in general  I would like again to drawattention to the fact that Azerbaijan is still not representedin the United Nations Secretariat.The world is tired of crises and wars. Mankinddeserves a peaceful  prosperous and happy new millennium.Our Organization is designed to play a leading role inovercoming obstacles to global peace and progress. It mustbe in a position to implement that noble mission. This isnot an abstract desire  but a realistic task based on anassessment of the situation and an awareness of bothneeds and possibilities."
"12",453,"BDI",54,1999,"Allow me first of all to associate myself with previousspeakers in expressing to you  Sir  and to the members ofthe Bureau  my delegation's warm congratulations on yourelection to lead us in the General Assembly at thissession. You can count on our total support for theaccomplishment of your difficult task.I would also like to express my appreciation to yourpredecessor  Mr. Didier Opertti  for the skill andcompetence he exhibited during his mandate.I would also like to take this opportunity tocongratulate the Republic of Kiribati  the Republic ofNauru and the Kingdom of Tonga on having joined thegreat family of the United Nations.Finally  allow me to pay tribute to the work of Mr.Kofi Annan  the Secretary-General of our Organization for his ceaseless efforts in favour of international peaceand security. My country  Burundi  fully appreciates hisvaluable contribution to the search for a negotiatedpolitical solution to the crisis it has suffered since October1993.As the work of the current session of the GeneralAssembly is taking place  my country is striving to turna new page in its history. Burundis have decidedly chosendialogue and negotiation to put an end to the armedconflict that has lasted for almost six years. The Arushapeace talks that began in June 1998 under the aegis of theformer President of the sisterly country of Tanzania Mwalimu Julius Nyerere  are being actively pursued andare now at a crucial stage.The sixth round of the Arusha peace talks  whichended a few days ago  was preceded by fruitfulconsultations held in Dar-Es-Salaam among the sixprincipal negotiators aimed at reaching a compromise23based on the drafts submitted by the negotiating parties orgroups of parties. These consultations  which represent thekeystone of the peace process  should resume on 4 October.We hope that this time they will have tangible results thatcould serve as a basis for the final Arusha agreement.Let me briefly recall the specific context in which theArusha process was initiated in June 1998: five years ofrelentless fratricidal war between the rebels and theGovernment  in which the principal victims had been  asthey continue to be  hundreds of thousands of innocentchildren  women and elderly people  for the most partunarmed. More than 30 years of massacres and killingshave torn asunder the very fabric of society and resulted inentrenched hatred and extreme mistrust among the variousethnic and political groups. Repeated crises have resulted inmassive flows of refugees and a major diaspora.Furthermore  economic development plans have beenconsistently hamstrung by recurring political instability.It was in that context that the Government objectivelyand deliberately decided to abandon the logic of war and tochoose political dialogue in which all the people of Burundicould participate without exception  regardless of themanner — peaceful or armed — in which they previouslyhad chosen to make their political demands. The armedgroups were a particular focus of this dialogue  and it wasmainly because of them that the negotiations were heldoutside the country.The goal is to reach a comprehensive peace agreementand ultimately achieve full national reconciliation amongthe entire population of Burundi  without exception.Several obstacles continue to stand in the way of thatlofty goal  which will not be attained if timely efforts arenot made to overcome those challenges.The first obstacle is the failure of the armed rebelfactions to participate in the negotiations. Differences ofopinion within those movements  where the armed groupsno longer recognize the authority of the political leaderswho are participating in the Arusha negotiations and thusreject the outcome ahead of time  have resulted in asituation in which the validity and viability of any peaceagreement reached without those parties would be in doubt.The Government of Burundi believes that it isimperative to set aside the formalities advocated by themediators and to invite the armed factions to participatefully in the peace process. The Government of Burundi iswilling to consider any form of negotiation with them within or outside the process.Mediation should take place immediately  becausewe are working against the clock in this fragile peaceprocess  which could be jeopardized or brought to a haltby events. If  after being invited  the armed factions orother parties to the negotiations refuse to participate in thepeace process  we would agree with the mediators thatBurundi  in close and steadfast cooperation with itsneighbours  must isolate and neutralize the rebels or otherparties that are unwilling to participate in the negotiations.The second obstacle is the continuing violence. Inother crisis situations  political dialogue for conflictsettlement is preceded by a ceasefire or a suspension ofhostilities. In the case of Burundi  however  that necessarycondition for negotiation has been neglected since thebeginning  as if it were optional. The Government drawsto the attention of the subregion and of the internationalcommunity the serious and continuing acts of violencecommitted by the rebels despite the ongoing peacenegotiations. These unrestrained and cowardly acts ofviolence  whose main target is unarmed civilians  have nomoral or political justification. No one even claimsresponsibility; it is pure terrorism.If the rebels were eventually to use as a pretext thefact that they had wished to participate in thenegotiations  it would have no validity because  as I havejust stated  the Government is open to any initiative thatmight lead to the cessation of the hostilities  which havegone on for far too long. The situation is serious  and theGovernment of Burundi requests the international andregional communities to help it in the following ways.First  through effective cooperation withneighbouring countries in the area of security  includingwith the Republic of Tanzania  with which cooperationdecisions were taken at the ministerial level on twooccasions  in February and August 1999; those decisionshave not been implemented. There is no doubt that ifthose decisions were translated into joint action on theground  both external and internal rebel activities wouldsoon cease.Secondly  it is necessary to disarm and neutralizethose Burundi rebels who are active in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo  where they are able to obtain aready supply of arms and ammunition for their bases inTanzania  as they have not been able to re-establish those24they lost in South Kivu in 1997 after the first war in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo.Thirdly  the countries of the region must wage acommon struggle against transnational rebel movements arms trafficking and genocidal ideology. Those movementshave created alliances without borders. Among the rebelswho operate in Burundi are the Interahamwe  the formerRwandan armed forces and Ugandan rebels  among others.The Burundi rebellion has become regional in scope andmust be combated from that perspective. Intensified activityhas been noted on the part of the factions in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo since the Lusaka agreement  whichprovided for their disarmament. The conflict is thus beingregionalized  with Burundi and/or Tanzania as its epicentre.Prevention is better than cure. There is a real risk ofanother regional conflagration resulting from the countriesconcerned taking measures to protect themselves againstthese widespread rebellions. In any case  the Governmentwill find it difficult to sign the peace agreement if it is notpreceded by an effective halt to the violence on the ground.The population  parts of which are still being massacred would simply reject it.The third — although not the least significant —obstacle to the peace process is the extreme poverty thatthreatens the people of Burundi with social and economicannihilation. That poverty is not the result of a reduction inagricultural production  which has continued somehowthanks to the hard-working nature of our countryfolk. Noris it the result of the embargo imposed by the countries ofthe region  since economic and financial cooperation withthose countries was and still is very limited. It results aboveall from the freezing of bilateral and multilateralcooperation by certain partners  countries and financialinstitutions in line with the economic sanctions imposed bythe subregion. Those regional sanctions were suspended on23 January this year  and Burundi expected that  mutatismutandis  our international partners would resume theircooperation in conformity with the subregional action. Thathas not yet happened  and some financial institutions  whichanticipate no practical problems  are blocked by theirshareholders at the political level. It is said that we willhave to wait for the signing  or even the implementation  ofthe Arusha Agreement.Peace and national reconciliation in Burundi will notbe restored through revolution. It is a process that will beconsolidated over time. Nothing spectacular will happen theday the peace agreement is signed. It is progressive reformactivities  taking place as a result of courageous anddetermined political will  that will stabilize the countryover the months and years following the signing of theagreement. All the parties involved in the negotiationsagrees that peace will be not an event  but a process.Furthermore  the rate at which negotiations proceed willnot be subject to the Government’s control; it will belinked to the procedures followed by the mediators and tothe willingness of the 17 other parties to the negotiationsto place the national interest above all else  to distinguishbetween what is essential and what is of secondaryimportance  and to realize that the true road to peace willbegin after the signing of the Arusha Agreement  amongthe citizens of Burundi themselves.The Government of Burundi calls on its partners toreassess the situation and consider the realities on theground as a matter of great urgency. The extreme stressunder which the population has been suffering for sixyears is pushing it towards a popular uprising. Theresponsibility lies with the international community which is committed in this respect. The Government hasprovided all it can: proof of its irreversible political willto negotiate until a peace agreement is reached.The Great Lakes region has become a real powderkeg because of the persistence of insecurity. With regardto the Democratic Republic of the Congo  Burundiwelcomes the signing in July of the Lusaka PeaceAgreement. We call on all the parties to that conflict tocontinue to make efforts to restore a climate of dialogue trust and reconciliation  so that energy can beconcentrated on actions aimed at economic recovery anddevelopment.Burundi is not a belligerent in the war that is pittingthe Democratic Republic of the Congo against some of itsneighbours. The Government of Burundi has already hadthe opportunity to explain that fact to the internationalcommunity on several occasions in various forums including from this lofty rostrum last year; in Lusaka where it participated in all the meetings as an observerand as one of the countries neighbouring the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo that were concerned about thesecurity of their common border; and in meetings of theOrganization of African Unity.Listening to the statement made in this Assembly bythe Chairman of the delegation of the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo on 29 September  I was astonishedby his confusion and the degree of malice he expressedtowards my country  Burundi. I should like to respond bymaking several comments.25First  Burundi is not at war with the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo  either individually or in alliancewith any other party.Second  Burundi has no reason to be at war with theDemocratic Republic of the Congo. It is true that it is poorand that the Democratic Republic of the Congo is rich. ButBurundi has never wanted  does not want  and will neverwant to live off the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Itwill develop a policy of normal cooperation with thatcountry  as has always been the case  in particular withinthe Economic Community of the Great Lakes Countries.Furthermore  the trading arrangements that exist betweenthe border towns and border provinces do not causeBurundi any problems and should continue.Third  Burundi has no political ambitions in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  at either the central orthe provincial level.Fourth  Burundi had just signed an agreement forcooperation on border security when war broke out.Fifth  Burundi has adopted an attitude of strictneutrality with regard to the conflict  and has no interest init.Sixth  several months after war broke out Burundi wasinformed of the presence among the Congolese troops ofthe armed Burundi rebel movement  the FDD. Burundi’sassessment was that the FDD had a threefold objective:first  to obtain arms and munitions to strengthen their basesin Tanzania; secondly  to cross Lake Tanganyika andrecover the bases they had lost in south Kivu facing thecapital  Bujumbura  and the provinces of Bubanza andCibitoke  where the civil war broke out in 1994; and thirdly  to obstruct trade on Lake Tanganyika to and fromBurundi through the port of Mpulungu in Zambia  which isthe only import-export corridor remaining following theeconomic blockade imposed by the region in an attempt tosuffocate the country.Seventh  Burundi had to defend itself  and decided toadopt necessary border defence and security measures onland and on Lake Tanganyika in order to counter-attack theFDD rebels. It was a question of life or death. Thosemeasures will remain in place as long as the threat ofinsecurity caused by the FDD  and coming from theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  remains.That is the absolute truth. The allegations made by thedelegation of the Democratic Republic of the Congo thatBurundi is acting aggressively towards their country  aregroundless and based on invention and misinformation.Burundi is ready to do all it can to help to resolve theconflict. It welcomes in particular the fact that twomilitary observers were sent to Burundi in the frameworkof the pre-deployment exercise decided upon by theUnited Nations.Burundi cannot fail to welcome the prospects for afinal resolution of the crisis in the Democratic Republicof the Congo  which would immediately remove the threatof insecurity at the common border and  we hope  involvethe FDD rebels in the peace process in Burundi.At this final General Assembly session of themillennium  my delegation hails the giant steps taken bymankind in science and technology  information andcommunication  democracy and development —especially during the twentieth century  which is nowdrawing to a close. At the same time  we deplore thescourges that have marked this century  such as allmanner of wars and conflicts and a range of evils andnatural or man-made catastrophes. Our greatest wish isthat the new millennium will bolster our achievementsand add new triumphs for the well-being of the whole ofmankind. We want to see in the next millennium a worldin which peace will prevail over conflict  justice overinjustice and impunity  freedom over oppression andgenerosity over selfishness.We seek the creation of a world in which the gapbetween rich countries and poor countries will be bridged;a world in which all men and all women will live decentlives  work in peace and eat their fill; a world in whichthe concepts of freedom  democracy  brotherhood anddevelopment can have true meaning in every corner of theearth.For all peoples and all nations to set about attainingthese purposes  the United Nations must play the role ofvanguard and catalyst to generate and maximize all thenecessary energy. The key to such success is  first andforemost  peace. The peace that we desire for Africa wealso want to see benefitting all mankind everywhere onearth."
"13",500,"BEL",54,1999,"I shouldlike first of all to congratulate you  Sir  on your election asPresident of the General Assembly and to thank you forhaving accepted the weighty task that you will be carryingout during this session. We also wish to express our bestwishes to your country  Namibia  which you so ablyrepresent. We also pay tribute to your predecessor  Mr.Opertti  for the manner in which he guided our workduring the previous session.I should also like to take this opportunity to extendmy sincere congratulations to the Republic of Kiribati  theRepublic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga on theiradmission to our Organization.My statement is in line with the statement made hereby the Presidency of the European Union. I wish merelyto highlight some of the issues that are particularlyimportant for us.Early in the month of August  two young Africanchildren  Yaguine and Fodé  were found dead  stowedaway in the landing gear of a Sabena aeroplane  victimsof an idealism and an innocence that led them to embarkon a reckless voyage in search of the mirages of westernsociety.Yaguine and Fodé left us a moving message  ofwhich I would like to quote some passages here:“To the people in charge in Europe: it is toyour solidarity and to your kindness that we makean appeal for help for Africa ... We are sufferingenormously ... We have war  disease ... We haveschools  but in order to get a good education andgood teaching  one needs large amounts of money;and our parents are poor.“So  we Africans  especially African childrenand young people  ask you to create a great andeffective organization for Africa ... We need you tofight poverty”.The great organization of which Yaguine and Fodédreamed is here before me in its most universal form. Itwas conceived from the outset for the maintenance ofpeace and for economic and social development. Theauthors of the Charter regarded those two aspects asinseparable. Over the last decade  this great Organizationhas succeeded in laying a worldwide foundation foreconomic and social values aimed at creating a morecivilized world  a world in which globalization hasgradually come to the fore.Here I am thinking of the discrete but tenaciouswork at the great United Nations conferences andsummits to find new directions for development. Thatsignificant work must be continued and consolidated. The15universal commitments made at Jomtien for education  atRio de Janeiro for the environment  at Vienna for humanrights  at Copenhagen for social development  at Cairo forpopulation and development  at Beijing for women  atRome for hunger and at Istanbul for human settlementsconstitute irreversible gains for mankind. It is gratifyingthat the concerns debated and the conclusions adopted atthose conferences have increasingly become the inspirationfor our national policies and are helping to bring about theindispensable convergence among those policies.But the tragedy of Yaguine and Fodé brings us face toface with the harsh reality of unbalanced development. AsI speak  1.3 billion women and men are surviving — ortrying to survive — on less than one dollar per day; 840million of them  including 160 million children  suffer dailyfrom hunger or malnutrition. Even more serious  as thosetwo teenagers remind us  260 million children have noaccess to primary or secondary school because of a lack ofmeans. Every day  250 million children go to work insteadof to school. At the dawn of the third millennium  it isincreasingly difficult for our civilization to tolerate suchsocial and human marginalization and such a lack ofsolidarity  in particular for our children.We must forge stronger solidarity within the UnitedNations. We must restore humanism to its rightful place ininternational relations. For this fight against poverty andthis campaign for emancipation to succeed  we must agreeto a decisive review of the mechanism that underlies theeconomic fluctuation  that causes financial tension and itsattendant social consequences  and that tolerates massiveexploitation of the weakest by forces that are oftenimpersonal and unidentifiable.Hence  we are deeply convinced that we must restorethe primacy of political leadership in our globalized society.We must endeavour without hidden agendas to organize anew world political order. We need stronger and morecoherent United Nations action for economic and socialdevelopment  which requires the use of all available globaltools for economic  financial and commercial governance.This means we must be more determined to restoring theprimacy of policy and no longer to permit democraticlegitimacy to be circumvented or even flouted by selfish orspeculative interests. The rights of peoples must alwaysprevail over the power of money.Belgium will support United Nations efforts to restorethe Organization's mission to protect against theunacceptable side-effects of globalization. In that spirit  mycountry attaches great importance to the success of thecoming Millennium Assembly. In that context  Belgiumis pleased that it will serve as host to the Third UnitedNations Conference on the Least Developed Countries inthe spring of 2001  which will bring together in Brusselsall development partners. We hope that this major eventwill lead to a renewed commitment to the integration ofthese countries in the world economy on the basis ofconcrete and quantifiable objectives. The BelgianGovernment  which recently came into office  has clearlyexpressed its political will gradually to increase ourfunding of bilateral partnerships and cooperation. Weshall pay particular attention to the quality and thecoherent implementation of the projects we sponsor.I express the wish that this Assembly session beconducted under the banner of Africa. Your stimulatingopening statement  Mr. President  and the addresses byPresident Mbeki of South Africa and by PresidentBouteflika of Algeria  sent a strong message in thatregard. We Belgians have a traditional interest in thepolitical  economic and development prospects of CentralAfrica. Belgium must reestablish the bonds with thatregion which history and experience have bestowed uponit. This also implies responsibilities which myGovernment will endeavour to shoulder in a responsibleand coherent manner. I am thinking in particular of thetwofold task of the United Nations as an organizationboth for the maintenance of peace and for the promotionof development. I also have in mind human rights issues of which my Government is particularly aware.Against this backdrop  the new Belgian Governmenthas placed cooperation with Central Africa at the top ofits agenda. To us  it is important that peace and stabilityshould return to Central Africa. The Lusaka CeasefireAgreement offers hope. It requires the political will of thevarious parties concerned to address the root causes of thepresent conflict and to seek solutions at a regional level.A significant effort by the international community willbe necessary to encourage and support them. My countrywill do its share  and will intensify its direct contacts andits financial support. Belgium has responded to the appealof the Security Council by placing liaison officers at thedisposal of the Secretary-General. They will be deployedin accordance with Security Council resolution 1258(1999) of 6 August 1999.It goes without saying that we fully respect the wishof African leaders that they should find their own politicalsolutions to the conflicts that undermine the continent.But this can imply no ambiguity about the roles of theSecurity Council and of the General Assembly. Nor does16it mean that the rest of the world should refrain fromaction: achieving peace in the Great Lakes region willrequire tremendous efforts and resources.Here we must think about concluding a truepartnership pact with the countries of Central Africa.Inspired by the Stability Pact for the Balkans  this wouldform part of a genuine strategy for cooperation amongcountries. With the support of the major financialinstitutions  such a pact could revitalize the economicmechanisms of partner countries and reinvigorate theirsocial and democratic development. We believe such spartnership pact should be based on the voluntary andmutually respectful cooperation of each African and non-African signatory country and should in no way beconstrued as an attempt at neo-colonial domineering of thatpart of the world.Other regions of Africa deserve more attention andeffort on the part of the international community. I think inparticular of the bloody conflict which has plunged Angolainto unspeakable humanitarian tragedy. I also think of thewar between Ethiopia and Eritrea  which must be preventedfrom extending into Somalia. In Sierra Leone  the efforts ofneighbouring countries  which Belgium and other partnershave supported  give reason for optimism. We also hopethat Guinea-Bissau will regain civil peace. But muchremains to be done to improve the situation of the peoplesof southern Sudan and of Somalia.Whatever the media's focus  now turned towards otherparts of the world  it is important that we do not forget thesuffering of men  women and especially children of thosecountries of Africa  who aspire to education  health anddevelopment. The new international policies  based more onbalance and on the sharing of prosperity  should be directedtowards them  too.I turn briefly to North Africa. The presidency of theEuropean Union recalled that the Maghreb countries areexperiencing significant growth. They remain an essentialpartner for Europe and for world peace  prosperity anddevelopment. Economic  social  cultural and political tieswith the southern Mediterranean basin will have to bestrengthened in the coming months and years.I also hope that the international Community will fulfilits commitment to support the Middle East peace process.There  too  it will be a matter of releasing the financial andhuman resources to ensure the economic  social anddemocratic development of the various regions and peopleswho are committed to peace. My country is ready torespond to calls for cooperation in this regard.There is another region where the United Nationshas been called upon to play a crucial and difficult role.The Kosovo crisis has implications for the security of mycountry and Europe as a whole. It also obliges us to aska sensitive question about the limits to the right of theinternational community to intervene in the internal affairsof a State.The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)intervention has appreciably reinforced the idea that moraland ethical considerations are in the process ofovershadowing the traditional concept of nationalsovereignty in international relations. If there is onelesson for our Organization to learn from the twentiethcentury  it is that for no State can the massacre of its ownpeople be considered an “internal affair”  under anypretext. This legal formalism would ultimately amount toadmitting that  as the head of the United Nations InterimAdministration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK)  BernardKouchner has said  it would be “legitimate  although notelegant  to massacre one's own people”.Yet the Security Council is well-equipped to dealwith massive violations of human rights. Article 42 of theUnited Nations Charter allows the Council to qualify suchviolations as a threat to international peace and securityand to authorize armed intervention  as it has on severaloccasions — for example  in Iraqi Kurdistan in 1991; inSomalia in 1992; in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1994; andin Liberia and Sierra Leone in 1997.If the Security Council could not fully play its roleat the beginning of the Kosovo crisis  this was due less toa divergence of views between States over the essence ofthe problem than because there was a rift between theadvocates of the right of humanitarian intervention andthe defenders of the traditional legal system  whichregards national sovereignty as the absolute foundation ofinternational relations. My country deeply regrets that apotential double veto constituted an insurmountableobstacle that was inappropriate given the extreme urgencyof the situation. We hope that resorting to force withoutthe Council's approval will not constitute a precedent. Theworld needs an international legal order that prevails overthe law of the jungle. In this respect  we all hope thatresolution 1244 (1999) signals a return to internationallegality.17Belgium welcomes the decisive attitude of the SecurityCouncil regarding East Timor. We hope for a speedyrestoration of normality there  with the return of itsinhabitants  reconstruction of the country and theestablishment of a state of law resulting from the expressedwill of its people.Here it is opportune to recall the urgent need for theinternational community to provide itself with the toolsneeded to prevent and punish barbaric acts. We need atribunal charged with prosecuting those responsible for thegravest crimes affecting the whole international community.The adoption in Rome of the Statute of the InternationalCriminal Court is an important landmark. I appeal to allStates to sign and ratify it so that the Court can start tooperate as soon as possible. Belgium's ratification of theStatute is imminent. This new tribunal must be endowedwith the human and material means necessary for theaccomplishment of its mission.This leads me to the issue of United Nations reform and primarily the reform of the Security Council.For six years a Working Group under the guidance ofthe President of the General Assembly has attempted  withmore or less success  to ascertain which reforms wouldmake it possible to re-gild the coat of arms of the SecurityCouncil. In spite of the efforts of successive Presidents little progress has been made. Nevertheless  the scope ofthe issue and possible improvements have been identified.I believe that new momentum can come only from a newdetermination on the part of our Governments.In the view of my country  the Security Council is ananachronistic reflection of the world of 1946. In 53 yearsthe number of independent countries has grown fourfold and new great Powers can  whether on economic demographic or geopolitical grounds  legitimately claim alarger share of international responsibility.The reasons for reform are evident. Lack of it continuance of the status quo and opposition to changeinvolve the following dangers.Countries which are legitimate candidates for apermanent seat on the Security Council  frustrated in theirambitions  will be less inclined to contribute to thecollective effort to maintain peace  prevent conflict and givemultilateral development aid. Equally  other countries unable to justifiably claim a permanent seat  will bedeprived of participation in shouldering globalresponsibilities  because of their number and the lack ofobjective rotation criteria. That will bring about a loss ofrepresentativeness and legitimacy  and ultimately of theCouncil's authority.My country chairs a group of 10 Member Statesseeking a solution that can command the broadestpossible support. In spite of the obstacles  we intend topersevere.The reforms that we are considering are not limitedto the Security Council; they also aim at rendering themachinery of the United Nations more effective andefficient. I pay tribute to Secretary-General Kofi Annan who has thrown himself into the task with greatdetermination.The United Nations continues to be an indispensableOrganization. It must be strengthened so that it can carryout the tasks and responsibilities given it by the Charter.Reform is therefore essential to strengthen themechanisms for the solidarity and harmoniousdevelopment to which we all aspire.This reform must be accompanied by a soundfinancial outlook. There has been no improvement overthe last 12 months; this situation must be redressed.Belgium  like the many other States which pay theircontributions on time and unconditionally  calls for allMember States to do the same. It will be understood  ofcourse  that here I am looking particularly towardsWashington. Belgium  a friend and ally of the UnitedStates  reaffirms that it is essential that that country playits role in the United Nations. We all need the UnitedStates  but it must shoulder its responsibilities  includingits financial responsibilities  within our Organization.So far I have mostly spoken of what is not working.But there are many areas where progress  evenconsiderable progress  is being made. The Organizationhas played a considerable role in giving an ethicaldimension to the criteria governing international relations.My country welcomes this. As the first victim ofchemical weapons — gas used on the battlefields of theYser — Belgium was a passionate advocate of theprocess that led to the conclusion and the implementationof the Chemical Weapons Convention. Similarly  we aresupporting the efforts to combat biological andbacteriological weapons and the fight to abolish anti-personnel mines. We are also presently engaged in effortsto reduce the spread of small arms.18The anarchistic accumulation of small arms and thescourge of anti-personnel mines remain among the mostacute problems at this close of the century. These weaponsexacerbate conflicts and are instruments of death and terror in Africa as well as in Asia  Latin America and theBalkans. Nor do the societies of Western Europe and NorthAmerica escape this cancer  the full extent of which has yetto be felt.Several initiatives have been taken to tackle theseproblems  and my country was fully involved in them. Byway of example I would like to mention the Brusselsconference of October 1998 and the Code of Conduct andthe common action of the European Union  as well as ourparticipation in and financial support for the expert groupsset up by the Secretary-General.We will continue our policy of prevention andreduction with regard to accumulations of small arms  aswell as our fight for the abolition of anti-personnel mines.In general  in the appropriate forums we will continueto take initiatives to promote arms control and disarmament.I am thinking  for example  of the reinforcement of theBiological Weapons Convention  limitations on arms-trafficking  the intensification of the fight against theviolation of embargoes on weapons transfers and the fightagainst the increase of nuclear arsenals.From economic and social development todisarmament or humanitarian intervention  there is a centraltheme that underlies all our actions: human rights. It hasbecome clearer and clearer in the past few years that humanrights are intertwined with the promotion of internationalpeace and security  economic prosperity  sustainabledevelopment and social justice.In all the reforms of the activities and the structures ofthe United Nations that have been carried out with theimpetus of the Secretary-General  the promotion of humanrights is a cross-cutting theme involving all theorganizations and agencies that operate on a global scale.Belgium supports this global and integrated approachwithout reservations; but the task is immense. Thus  it is inthe interest of the United Nations to ensure thecollaboration of regional organizations  whose competenciesand potential in this field can help in the achievement ofthese common objectives.The inaugural address of the new Belgian Governmentunequivocally put human rights at the top of its agenda andannounced its intention of pursuing an active policywithin all the relevant international organizations.I would like to pay particular homage to ourSecretary-General  whose patience and tact have oftenmade the difference in extremely difficult circumstances.My Government remains a steadfast supporter of all hisinitiatives to prepare our Organization for the challenges known and unknown  that lie ahead in the next century.Through the Secretary-General I would like to payspecial tribute to the United Nations personnel  andparticularly to all those who died on the field of honourin humanitarian or peacekeeping missions. Every year thelist of victims gets longer. My country appeals to theglobal conscience to respect United Nations personnel andto ensure that crimes against them do not go unpunished.In conclusion  I sincerely hope that the actions of theSecretary-General will make our Organization morecredible and more effective  for the United Nationsremains the indispensable universal instrument to achieveour common goals. It is a beacon in an increasinglyinterdependent world  a source of hope for the Yaguinesand Fodés of all the continents."
"14",545,"BEN",54,1999,"In taking the flooron behalf of the delegation of the Republic of Benin  Iwould like first of all to express my heartiestcongratulations to the entire Bureau of the fifty-fourthsession of the General Assembly. I would also like toexpress my satisfaction at seeing the Foreign Minister ofNamibia  Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  presiding over theAssembly at this session  the last of the century and of theclosing millennium.At a time when the United Nations more than ever iscalled upon to act in the interest of the peace and well-being of humankind  Benin takes pride in seeing arepresentative of Africa holding that important post. Iwould assure him of my delegation’s full cooperation andsupport  for it will be under his enlightened presidency thatthe Organization will stride forward into the twenty-firstcentury. We see this felicitous and remarkable coincidenceas a definite assurance of the success of the importantdebates we will be holding and a sign of hope that thedecisions to be taken will so direct our actions as to ensurethat the coming century is one of peace  progress anddevelopment  for the African continent in particular.Allow me at this stage to pay tribute to Mr. DidierOpertti  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Uruguay  for theoutstanding work he did in the service of the Organizationthroughout the fifty-third session of the General Assembly.I wish also to pay a highly deserved tribute to our brother Mr. Kofi Annan  the Secretary-General of the UnitedNations  for the unstinting devotion that he hasdemonstrated since his election and for the undeniablesuccesses that he has achieved for the United Nations inparticularly difficult circumstances.I should like here to reaffirm the full support andconfidence of the Government of Benin as we pursue thelofty and legitimate goal of giving the United Nations themeans of tackling the challenges that await us on thethreshold of the first century of the new millennium.I should like also to congratulate and warmlywelcome the three new States Members of the UnitedNations — the Republic of Kiribati  the Republic ofNauru and the Kingdom of Tonga.This session of the General Assembly is beginningat a particularly important moment in the history ofhumankind  for  after a century of deeds and eventsfraught with all kinds of consequences  the entireinternational community is preparing to move forwardinto the first century of a new millennium. We who havebeen privileged to witness this twofold historicaltransition should not ignore the great responsibility thatwe have borne throughout the century that is now closingand the equal responsibility that we will have to shoulderthroughout the one that is about to begin.The challenges that face us are many and rangeacross all human areas of activity. It is our conviction thatif we so desire  we can make the next century an era ofpeace  security  development  understanding and concordamong peoples. In order to do this  we will have topromote and strengthen worldwide cooperation  inparticular in tackling the serious problems that the centurythat is now ending will have bequeathed to the one thatis now beginning.Combating poverty should  it seems to me  be one ofour priorities  because poverty is a factor ofdestabilization and a source of conflict and war particularly in Africa.The holding of the millennium summit in September2000 will be a historic opportunity for us to strive tostrengthen peace  security and stability  for which allpeoples of the world yearn.We could hardly overemphasize the closerelationship among development  peace  security democracy and human rights  and we all share theresponsibility of day by day translating these words intoreality. We can overcome poverty.30The international community is in a position to put anend to the atrocities and the savagery that have been on therise recently in all continents. To this end  it is essential forthe process of revitalization  restructuring anddemocratization in the world Organization  begun under theauthority of the Secretary-General  to be continued so as toenhance its effectiveness in carrying out the urgent tasksthat it will face at the beginning of the third millennium.Benin is at peace within its borders  with itsneighbours and with the whole of the internationalcommunity. But we are seriously disturbed by the appallingconflicts that continue to devastate and destabilize ourcontinent.We are ready to continue to support the efforts ofAfrica itself and those of the great Powers in the context ofthe prevention  settlement and sustainable management ofconflicts.Here I wish to pay tribute to the Organization ofAfrican Unity (OAU) and certain subregional organizationssuch as the Economic Community of West African States(ECOWAS) and the Southern African DevelopmentCommunity for their bold initiatives aimed at bringingpeace and security to Africa.I have no wish to forget or to minimize thecontribution of other countries  but I wish in particular topay tribute here to the tremendous sacrifices made by thepeoples of West Africa and in particular by the people ofNigeria in the context of the ECOWAS Monitoring Group(ECOMOG) to help the West African subregion to put anend to war and insecurity  which hamper development andeconomic progress.I wish also to welcome the bold resolutions adoptedby the Heads of States at the OAU Summit in Algiers  aswell as the initiatives of the subregional organizations inWest Africa and in the Great Lakes region  which attest tostrengthened political resolve to reverse the course ofevents in a positive and constructive direction. Theseendeavours deserve to be sustained and strengthened byinternational solidarity.The example of Kosovo is there to remind us of thekey importance of prompt and determined action on thepart of the international community in order to restore andmaintain peace. The distressing events in East Timor areanother eloquent example of this.Allow me in all honesty to state here that humanrights are universal and indivisible. If we wish to build aunited and peaceful international community  let us notintroduce into the defence  protection and promotion ofhuman rights any conditionalities or preferences  be theygeographical  cultural  geostrategic or others.In this age of rapid globalization  we must realizethat the risk of marginalizing the weakest economies andthe most vulnerable peoples is very real; it is a mortaldanger. Fortunately  there is still time to avert it. If weare to succeed  our vision for the twenty-first century andour prospects for the future must be clarified andstrengthened by the effective implementation of thevarious plans and programmes of action adopted since thebeginning of this decade within the framework of theUnited Nations system.In this context  the situation of the developingcountries  the least developed countries in particular deserves more attention from the international community which should endeavour to create favourable conditionsfor those countries to develop. In this respect  we cannotevade the anguished question of the future of Africa onthe threshold of the third millennium  particularly giventhe debt burden and the deterioration in the terms oftrade. These are sad realities which are killing at least asmany people as are dying from AIDS.Fortunately indeed  Africa can cease to be thecontinent of bad news. Today  it has the ability and thewill to make it so. Throughout the decade that is nowdrawing to a close  the international community hasrepeatedly stated that Africa must be a priority. Mindfulof the need for that continent to achieve economicprogress  the United Nations has worked out appropriatestrategies and embarked on specific developmentprogrammes. But none of those initiatives will have anyimpact on the development of the continent if Africancountries themselves  supported by their developmentpartners  do not redouble their efforts to carry out thenecessary reforms and mobilize the necessary resources.While we clearly reaffirm our own responsibility  wemust also say that for Africa better economic performancenecessarily involves a rapid and lasting solution to theproblems caused by external debt; inputs of the new andadditional financial resources required to meet thegrowing need for funding; transfers of new andappropriate technology; promotion of a genuine  open andfair system of international trade; and appropriateincentives for our efforts to diversify and modernize our31economies. What we need in this age of globalization is agenuine solidarity pact.This new partnership with Africa should set out toenable all African countries to enjoy the benefits ofglobalization. This implies mobilizing and pooling theefforts of the whole international community  inspired bythe same vision of a common destiny and a new philosophyof sharing. That vision of development prompted theGovernment of Benin to host  in February 1999 in Cotonou a conference of United Nations Development ProgrammeResident Representatives working in Africa to consider theproblems of development in Africa in the comingmillennium. The conference identified the major problemsthat African countries face at the close of the twentiethcentury: social and political upheaval; poverty; problems ofaccess in meeting essential social needs; populationpressure; the debt burden; and economic marginalization among others. The conference also highlighted the assetsand potential of the continent: significant natural and humanresources; cultural wealth; a spirit of sharing; and a senseof solidarity.Accordingly  the conference recommended anotherapproach for Africa's development  based on the promotionof peace and security within and between States; realintegration of Africa into the world economy; and thecreation of an African regional observatory forglobalization. It would be regrettable if these highly lucidand relevant analyses and findings came to nothing becausethe United Nations Development Programme itself is stifledby a lack of resources.In keeping with those recommendations  Benin together with several other African countries  hasundertaken far-reaching political and economic reforms toimprove the living and working conditions of its people particularly those in rural areas. The measures includeaction to stabilize public finances  liberalize the economy develop the private sector  stimulate economic growth combat corruption and preserve social peace and politicalstability through the establishment of a State based on therule of law that respects democratic principles andfundamental rights and freedoms.Against that background we are striving  tirelessly andresolutely  to ensure that the democratic process takes firmroot in Benin. Our young democracy has just successfullycompleted an electoral process culminating in the renewalof Parliament before the deadline set by the Constitution. Ina few months' time we will be holding local elections toelect mayors and councillors to help entrench democracyat the grass-roots level.However  despite these significant efforts andsacrifices  we know that our political and economicstructures will continue to be fragile and vulnerable solong as poverty and disease continue to lay waste to ourtowns and countryside  so long as HIV/AIDS is notconquered or  at least  contained at the same levels as inEurope and America  and so long as insecurity andappalling internal and regional conflicts continue to undothe work of the African peoples and enrich a few armsmanufacturers and traffickers.I should like to extend the recognition and gratitudeof the people and Government of Benin to all itsdevelopment partners  to the Powers which have realizedthat today poverty more than ever is a matter for all ofus  wherever it may be found  and that violations ofhuman rights involve us all wherever they may takeplace. I wish once again to express our thanks to all thosewho are assisting us in our activities aimed at makingBenin  indeed Africa in general  a haven of peace political stability and successful  integrated development.During its fifty-first session  the General Assemblyaccepted Benin's offer to hold the Fourth InternationalConference of New or Restored Democracies andencouraged it to do so  no doubt because of our efforts which I have just outlined  to maintain peace  democracyand the constitutional rule of law. I am convinced that thefourth International Conference of New or RestoredDemocracies — the first that Africa will have the honourand privilege of hosting  following the conferences heldin the Philippines  Nicaragua and Romania — will be anopportunity for all the friends of Africa — indeed  all thefriends of democracy — to pool their experience and towork together to consolidate a political system that 32unfortunately  is not yet the most widespread ofphenomena. The Cotonou conference  scheduled for earlyDecember 2000  can have significance and impact only ifall democrats agree to make a sincere contribution; thiswould enable democracy all over the world to take a crucialqualitative leap forward.For this reason  I fervently appeal to all those ofgoodwill  and to all development partners eager thatdemocracy  the rule of law and good governance should besolidly established in every one of our States and on allcontinents  to lend their material and financial support andtheir experience to the preparation  organization andconvening of the Cotonou conference. We earnestly hopethat the Cotonou conference will enable us to build onexisting achievements in the maintenance of internationalpeace and security.Peace  security and sustainable human developmentare the themes that my delegation would like to see as thebanner of this session of the General Assembly  the lastbefore the year 2000: peace above all  so that the foundingcry of this Organization  “never again”  may in the newmillennium become a reality for all peoples and for allindividuals."
"15",591,"BFA",54,1999,"Your brilliant election  Mr. President  to the presidency ofthe General Assembly at this session pays tribute to yourpersonal merits and your eminent qualities as a diplomat and to your country  Namibia  a country that is to us asymbol of the struggle against oppression. First of all  allowme to address our most sincere and warm congratulationsto you. Your country and Burkina Faso share the sameideals and values  and a similar vision of the future ofAfrica and the world. Suffice it to say that we extend toyou in advance our willingness and cooperation for thesuccess of your mission.We must also pay tribute to your predecessor  Mr.Didier Opertti  who so brilliantly discharged his importantresponsibilities during this particularly trying year. I paytribute as well to our Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan whose work at the helm of the United Nations deservesour appreciation and our fullest support.Finally  I would like to congratulate the three newMembers that have joined the great family of the UnitedNations — Tonga  Nauru and Kiribati.This session of the General Assembly — the last ofthe century — is beginning at a time when recurring andpersistent inter-State and inter-ethnic conflict and hostilityare characteristic of the international scene.The globalization of the international economy andthe liberalization of world trade appear to have worsenedthe economic and social differences between peoples. Thelofty objectives of our Organization — the promotion ofpeace  security  justice and equality — seem to bereceding into the distance.We are faced with increasing challenges  which ismaking the task of the United Nations more difficult. Andyet we sense that the coming millennium will be a timeof growth for our peoples  in particular those of thedeveloping countries.The waning century threw down every possiblechallenge  but it also gave rise to great hopes. It has beenone of the most productive as regards legal instrumentsaimed at enhancing the protection and promotion ofhuman rights. Nevertheless  grave dangers emerged duringthis period that came close to jeopardizing humankind'svery existence. The memory of the two great warsremains very much alive.It must be underscored that the United Nations —born of the general upheaval of the post-war period andcharged with working towards peace and a genuinecollective security for our world — has accomplished agreat deal  with the assistance of regional or subregionalorganizations such as the Organization of African Unity(OAU)  the Organization of American States  theAssociation of South-East Asian Nations  the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and so on.But despite all these efforts  the quest for peaceremains an immense and difficult undertaking. On theinternational scene  wars  conflicts and confrontations of12all stripes continue to rage  wiping out any progress madein the field of development.In the Middle East  the level of tension between theparties remains very high  even though recent politicalchanges have given rise to hopes of a comprehensivesolution to the Palestinian question  particularly since thesigning of the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum on 4September last.In an international situation so fraught with conflict we can only rejoice at seeing the spectre of war  which hadseemed inevitable  recede from East Timor thanks to thewisdom and realism of the parties to this painful conflict.I cannot fail to mention the military intervention of theNATO countries in Yugoslavia and more specifically inKosovo  an operation whose legitimacy was supposedlybased on the right of humanitarian intervention. But mycountry  Burkina Faso  is among those that believe thatsuch an intervention should take place only on the basis ofa clear and precise mandate and under the supervision ofthe United Nations.Though the objective of this type of intervention —protecting a victimized minority — may seem defensible the manner in which it was carried out is a cause forconcern because it represents a challenge to the UnitedNations and to the basic norms of international law.Burkina Faso is gratified that the United Nations has takenup its proper role in the resolution of this conflict.But Africa is undoubtedly the continent that hassuffered the most from these crises. Though peace has beenrestored in Guinea-Bissau  and in Sierra Leone the LoméAgreement  signed on 7 July 1999 with the activeparticipation of Burkina Faso  has put an end to the gunfire we must continue tirelessly to strive to resolve the situationin the Democratic Republic of the Congo  in the Horn ofAfrica and in Angola.In the Democratic Republic of the Congo  a solutioncan be found if security issues  which remain the essentialconcerns of the various States involved in the conflict  aretaken into consideration. Accordingly  Burkina Fasoconsiders that the Lusaka agreements must be accepted byall of the parties if indeed they wish to give peace achance.Turning to the dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea President Blaise Compaoré  during his tenure as the head ofthe high-level OAU delegation and in close cooperationwith the United Nations  made every effort to promote apeaceful settlement of this conflict  in conformity with themandate he was entrusted with at Ouagadougou by thethirty-fourth Summit of Heads of State or Government  inJune 1998.Our efforts led to the acceptance by both parties ofthe Ouagadougou framework agreement  and  at thethirty-fifth OAU Summit  held in Algiers  of themodalities for the implementation of that agreement. Weare convinced that President Abdelaziz Bouteflika  thecurrent Chairman of the OAU  to whom we have passedthe torch  will strive to ensure a successful outcome tothis delicate situation. In doing so he will enjoy thecontinuing and vigorous support of the OAU SecretaryGeneral  Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim  and the cooperation ofthe United Nations and all of the States that have playeda very positive and discreet role in finding a pacificsolution to the conflict between these two brotherlycountries. To this end  he will require the cooperation ofboth parties and the support of all  particularly the UnitedNations.The fratricidal conflict in Angola has lasted morethan two decades  despite all of the sanctions andmeasures taken against Mr. Jonas Savimbi and hismovement  UNITA. Burkina Faso is convinced that  as inother cases — particularly in Sierra Leone and theDemocratic Republic of the Congo — it is only througha dialogue between the parties that a just and lastingsolution can be found.It is clear that  because of their increasingly complexand interrelated nature  the various conflicts I havementioned cannot be resolved in a just and lasting wayunless the efforts of all are conjoined. This includes notonly the parties to the conflict and the internationalcommunity — meaning the United Nations — but alsothe regional and subregional organizations.In this respect  we noted  throughout our mandate asChairman of the OAU  the determination and commitmentof this Organization fully to discharge its responsibilities as evidenced by the various initiatives it has undertaken.We stand convinced that Africa has resolutelyconsidered the serious consequences these multipleconflicts entail for the economic and human developmentof its population. Accordingly  at the thirty-fifth OAUSummit in Algiers  it took the courageous and historicdecision of declaring that the year 2000 would be a yearof peace and security throughout the continent.13Of course  we know full well that in order for thatobjective to be attained  the support of the internationalcommunity is crucial  not only at the political level  whereits backing will be needed for the implementation of ourdecisions and resolutions  but also at the equally importantlevel of logistics and material support  technical assistanceand humanitarian considerations.But any peace is fragile that is not backed by genuinedisarmament. That is why we support all internationalinitiatives in this field  in particular the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).My country has joined in the fight against anti-personnel mines by signing and ratifying the relevantConvention. Burkina Faso is gratified at the growingsupport of the international community for the initiative ofthe Economic Community of West African States relatingto a moratorium on the production and transfer of lightweapons. Together with other members of the internationalcommunity  my country is also participating inpeacekeeping operations  in particular in the United NationsMission in the Central African Republic.At the dawn of the twenty-first century  it isdistressing to note that the world economy is stilldominated and controlled by a minority of States thatmanipulate its rules and the way it operates in their owninterests and to the detriment of the interests of the greatmajority — the countries that make up the South.With regard to social development  poverty hascontinued to increase in developing countries  where about1.5 billion people — one quarter of the world's population— are living on less than $1 per capita per day. Foodsecurity is far from guaranteed in those countries  while inthe affluent countries food is destroyed on a huge scale inorder to stabilize prices. The scarcity of drinking watersupplies and medical services condemns a third of humanityto a life expectancy of no more than 40 years. Illiteracygreatly limits the access of the poorest to knowledge and by extension  to information about how their countries arerun. The most disadvantaged and vulnerable strata —women  children and elderly people — do not fully enjoythe benefits of a legal protection system.At a more general level  there are unacceptabledisparities in international economic relations between theindustrialized and the developing countries. The latter arebecoming increasingly vulnerable because of the chronicstructural imbalance in trade with the developed countries.Despite the decisions taken by the ministerial conferencesof the World Trade Organization  the integration of theless advanced countries into the multilateral tradingsystem is still an issue  particularly with regard to thespecial and differentiated treatment that should be grantedto those countries. The greatest challenge in the twenty-first century will undoubtedly be the struggle against themarginalization of the countries of the South.The burden of debt remains a constant concern  too despite the initiative of the Heavily Indebted PoorCountries Debt Initiative and the important decisionstaken by the Group of Seven Summit in Cologne  whichI welcome.In order to promote the genuine and lasting humandevelopment to which all developing countries aspire  wemust work for greater justice and equity in internationaltrade  through the implementation of various measures including price stabilization and export guarantees for theproducts of developing countries through the revaluationof raw materials and the stabilization of export earnings;index-linking of the prices of raw materials to those ofindustrial products; free access for the products the Southto northern markets through the elimination ofprotectionist measures; reform of the Bretton Woodsinstitutions to bring them into line with the needs andpreoccupations of the developing countries; and thepromotion of a genuine North-South dialogue. In thisrespect  Burkina Faso welcomes with interest andsatisfaction the European initiative to hold an economicsummit next year for the European Union countries andtheir African partners.As everyone knows  we can make many plans  havemany ambitious dreams and imagine all sorts oftransformations for our world. But if we do not placejustice  equity and solidarity at the heart of all ourprojects  they will remain fantasies. Justice demands  forexample  that we not starve a population through the useof international sanctions in order to punish itsGovernment. Since I am touching upon that subject  Iwould like to reaffirm our full solidarity with the LibyanArab Jamahiriya  and I hope that  as a result of theconcessions made by that country with regard to theLockerbie affair  the unfair sanctions against the brotherlyLibyan people will be lifted for good. Since the historicdecision at Ouagadougou  this requirement has becomeimperative  in our view.In this context  the issue of the Republic of China onTaiwan also deserves attention. In the interests of equityand of the principle of universality  Burkina Faso believes14that it is unfair virtually to ostracize 22 million Chinesepeople. That is why we firmly support the initiative tocreate a study group to examine the particular andexceptional situation of the Republic of China on Taiwanso as to determine how that entity could be represented inthe United Nations.In that connection  in the interests of justice withininternational relations  we must restructure the Organizationso that we can better respond to the demands of our timeand the expectations of humanity. If the United Nations isto be more democratic and more just  such reform must goto the heart of its main body  the Security Council  whosecomposition and operating methods must be reviewed andcorrected. The operational capacities of the Organization —the structures and activities linked to the promotion ofeconomic and social development — must also bestrengthened.Burkina Faso believes the human being to be thesupreme measure of all things. That is why human rightsand the dignity of humankind are at the centre of ourconcerns. In fact  since 1991  my country has beensteadfastly undertaking an irreversible process ofdemocratization that has led to several rounds of municipal legislative and presidential elections under conditionsrecognized by international observers as being calm andunbiased. The process is being consolidated and the cultureof democracy and citizenship in a republican system is wellunder way. The stability and security of our country in thecurrent turbulent environment bear witness to that fact.We believe that no price can be placed on democracyand freedom. That is why we will spare no effort tostrengthen and extend those values. Burkina Faso intends tomake a modest contribution to building a more humanworld of greater justice and solidarity  because we areconvinced that the new international order to which we allaspire requires that political  economic and social forcesthroughout the world join hands and become catalysts ofprogress for the benefit of humanity."
"16",634,"BGD",54,1999,"This year is veryspecial to Bangladesh at the United Nations. It is thetwenty-fifth anniversary of Bangladesh’s admission to this“Parliament of Man”. I bring greetings from the people ofBangladesh.It is gratifying to us that on this twenty-fifthanniversary  we have you  Sir  presiding over the GeneralAssembly. You are a freedom fighter. You lead a countrywhich was liberated in recent times  and yet  in its shortmembership in the United Nations  it has contributed somuch to the work of the Organization.We convey our sincere appreciation to ForeignMinister Didier Opertti of Uruguay  our President duringthe last session  for his excellent work. I would also like towelcome the three new members of the General Assembly:Kiribati  Nauru and Tonga. We sense their joy andexcitement  as we experienced 25 years ago.I convey our sincerest thanks and gratitude to theSecretary-General and to all Member States for theirsupport and assistance in helping us overcome the aftermathof the disastrous floods that hit our country last year. Themagnitude of the disaster was unprecedented in our history.The support of the international community was a source ofinspiration and encouragement to our people in facing thechallenges of rehabilitation and reconstruction.I stand here today with pride and satisfaction. TheFather of our Nation  Bangabandhu Sheikh MujiburRahman  25 years ago delivered our first address to theGeneral Assembly as head of Government of thesovereign and independent State of Bangladesh. Hismessage on that day expressed the nation’s gratitude tothe international community for standing by our people inthe darkest days of oppression; to apprise the internationalcommunity of our great struggle for freedom and self-determination; to articulate to the world our faith indemocracy  justice  freedom and human rights; and tospell out the basic elements of our foreign policy.Despite the political upheavals in the country sincethen  none ventured to alter the foreign policy guidelineslaid down by the Father of our Nation. We were thus ableto contribute positively to the United Nations by servingin several important commissions and executive bodies inits system and participating actively in United Nationspeacekeeping operations. We were privileged to presideover the forty-first session of the General Assembly andto serve one term in a non-permanent seat on the SecurityCouncil.Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman carried thetorch of an indomitable people to the United Nationswhen he stood at this very rostrum before the GeneralAssembly in 1974 and said “The noble ideals enshrined in the Charter ofthe United Nations are the very ideals forwhich millions of our people have made thesupreme sacrifice. I know that the souls of ourmartyrs join us in pledging that the Bangaleenation fully commits itself to the building of aworld order in which the aspiration of all menfor peace and justice will be realized.”(A/PV.2243  para. 2)Twenty-five years later  I am here to renew thatpledge. In these 25 years we have seen the partnershipbetween Bangladesh and the United Nations mature. Fromour early reconstruction needs for national developmentto steps for empowering people and establishing socialjustice  the United Nations has been with us. We havealso been able to lend support to the strengthening of theOrganization and have contributed in its efforts toeradicate poverty and disease  maintain peace and securityand support the fulfilment of the rights of the oppressedand the subjugated. We sincerely hope that thedevelopment of cooperation between Bangladesh and the14United Nations agencies in our country will be expandedand strengthened in future years.Bangladesh has noted with great concern the recentdecline in commitments by donor countries to the UnitedNations development system  and to the United NationsDevelopment Programme (UNDP) in particular. Bangladeshattaches great value to multilateral assistance as a reliableand trusted source of impartial expertise and urges donorcountries to meet the commitments made in the ExecutiveBoard of UNDP for the multi-year funding framework enabling countries such as Bangladesh to plan developmentprogrammes accordingly. Recalling the recent statement ofthe G-8 in Cologne  Bangladesh wishes to note with pridethat it is already utilizing over half of the country fundsavailable from UNDP for programmes relating to improvinggovernance  which are helping us to address fundamentalconstraints to faster development. Now is the time fordonors to recognize the commitment we have made and thesuccess we have achieved by increasing resources for thesevaluable programmes.Within months of his historic address to this worldbody in 1974  my father and the Father of our Nation along with my mother and three brothers  the youngest onebeing 10 years of age  were brutally assassinated by agroup of murderous and misguided military officers on 15August 1975. Amongst those killed were my uncles  mytwo sisters-in-law  two cousins and a host of other relatives.My sister and I were the only survivors  as we were out ofthe country at the time. Coups and counter-coups followedone another at regular intervals  leading to military rule ofone sort or another. I was forced to live in exile from thelate 1970s to the early 1980s. I began to struggle from exileagainst the autocratic rule. After coming home in 1991  Istepped up that struggle for the restoration of people’s rightto vote and their right to freedom and to food. I washarassed and arrested by the authoritarian regimes  andseveral attempts were made on my life. But nothing coulddeter me either from my path or from my goal  therestoration of democracy. The movement grew in strength and finally victory was on the side of the people. Todaydemocracy has taken firm root in Bangladesh for all timeto come.We have strengthened the parliamentary system. PrimeMinister’s question time has been introduced. The sessionis televised and broadcast live. To institutionalizedemocracy and make it sustainable  we have ensured thepeople’s right to vote by introducing the institution of anon-party  caretaker Government to be formed three monthsbefore each election. My struggle now is to guarantee thepeople’s right to food; in other words  economicemancipation to a sustainable livelihood. I am driven bya desire to create a just environment  not only for myown people but also for all of humankind.The creation of the United Nations was aimed atsparing the world from the scourge of another world warand to ensure that human beings are guaranteed theirbasic rights. During its more than 50 years of existence it has stood the test of time. National and internationally we have taken peace and development as two vital andintegrally linked objectives. We have taken steps to fosterpeace regionally. Immediately after it came into office my Government took the initiative to solve the Gangeswater-sharing issue with our neighbour  India. We solvedthis long outstanding issue successfully in December1996. I visited India and Pakistan following the nucleartests in South Asia and urged that we all must do ourutmost to deserve peace in our region and devote ourlimited resources to economic and social development.An accord was concluded in December 1997between the Government and representatives of the tribalpeople living in the south-eastern part of our countrywithout third-party mediation. The accord brought peaceafter more than two decades to the strife-torn area of theChittagong Hill Tracts. Peace now reigns in the area: theformer insurgents surrendered their arms and returned topeaceful lives; all 63 000 refugees from across the borderhave returned; and there have been no incidents ofviolence there since the signing of the accord.We have no illusions that the key to ourdevelopment and progress is directly linked to investmentin our people. Our efforts are now being directed towardstransforming our vast human resources into a productiveforce. Our development programmes are targeted on rapidpoverty alleviation. We have adopted policies tostrengthen the socio-economic infrastructure of ourcountry. We have given priority to the various socialsectors  including education  health care  povertyalleviation and population growth control  and we haveallocated more than 30 per cent of the budget to thesocial sectors with the objective of poverty alleviation empowerment and human development. Our programmesinclude shelter and sustainable livelihood through theAshrayon programme  housing for the poor  health care education for the poor  microcredit  old-age pensions income transfers to destitute women and targeted povertyalleviation programmes. This effort towards the economicemancipation of the people is our preoccupation now: we15want to build the golden Bengal dreamt of by the father ofour nation.We have adopted specific policies to ensure equalitybetween women and men. We have promulgated laws andset up institutional mechanisms to promote women’s rights to ensure that they have choices and opportunities  thatvictims are given redress and that stern punishments aremeted out to rapists for their deeds. The effectiveness ofmicrocredit in empowering women has been phenomenal.We have also brought women into decision-making at alllevels. During the last local Government elections  morethan 14 000 women were elected to office.In our foreign policy  we adhere to the principle offriendship towards all. It is a constitutional requirement tobase our international relations on the principles set out inthe United Nations Charter.How do we address the critical issues of the newmillennium? We consider peace to be a fundamental humanright to be attained  sustained  promoted and carriedforward at all times. Without development there can be nopeace  and without cooperation  no development. There isno option  then  but to have genuine cooperation betweenthe developed and the developing countries for theeradication of poverty and the fulfilment of the people’saspirations for development.Bangladesh has been the coordinator of the leastdeveloped countries for the last two decades.We believe strongly that special measures should betaken by the international community to help thesecountries in their efforts to develop and to participate fullyin the global economy. Human rights is the essence ofpeace. Unless we ensure that citizens live a life of dignity where their rights are secure  we cannot have a just andpeaceful world. This is equally true for communities andnations. In our region  we have nurtured the South AsianAssociation for Regional Cooperation (SAARC)  which hastaken many initiatives to improve the lives of the peoplesof the region. At the subregional level  we are cooperatingwith Bhutan  Nepal and India in the South AsianDevelopment Quadrangle.The United Nations is the only universal body thatdeals with all fields of human activity. It has been acatalyst in many initiatives and has bettered the lives ofpeople around the world. In the 1990s the United Nationsconvened a series of global conferences to address majorchallenges facing humankind. They addressed problemswhich were beyond the capacity of individual countries tosolve and which called for wide-ranging internationalcooperation. I believe that the international communityshould ensure coordinated and integrated follow-up foreffective and full implementation of the decisions of thoseconferences. In Bangladesh  we have taken concretemeasures in this regard.We need to ensure that the United Nations cancontinue to meet the evolving needs of humankind in thenext century. For that  we must have an effective andefficient United Nations. I am happy that Bangladesh hasbeen at the forefront of the adoption of these steps at theUnited Nations. In this regard  I would like to put onrecord our great appreciation of the Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan. He has made remarkable achievementsin the short time that he has been at the helm of theUnited Nations. He fully deserves our wholehearted praiseand support.There is no denying the fact that the world needs theUnited Nations. But we must remember that it is equallytrue that the United Nations needs the world. Allcountries must do their best to fulfil their commitments tomake the Organization strong and durable. This has beenthe endeavour of Bangladesh for the last 25 years.May Bangladesh live forever. Long live the UnitedNations."
"17",680,"BGR",54,1999,"May I first congratulate you  Mr.President  on your election to this responsible position. I amsure that your vast knowledge and experience are aguarantee of the success of this session.I avail myself of this opportunity to express my mostsincere congratulations also to the Secretary-General  Mr.Kofi Annan  for his contribution to strengthening the roleof the United Nations in line with the challenges of themodern world.I am going to spare the Assembly the review of thisyear's international developments that it probablyanticipated  because I come from a region that hasgenerated enough bad news and is still the focus of worldattention.Some of the developments in our region were notthe result of human will. The earthquakes in Turkey andGreece  which claimed tens of thousands of victims shook the world. Regrettably  man-made disasters havetaken a high toll on our region. The war in Kosovo  thefourth in a row in the former Yugoslavia  has left in itswake a comparable trail of tragedies.Now that the war is over  there are two things wemust do: as soon as possible  repair the damage andalleviate the trauma it has inflicted  and build aninfrastructure of security and prosperity that precludes anyfuture repetition of such tragic events.The international community has in the past set itselfsimilar ambitious tasks. This time  I hope  the experienceit has gained has reached the critical mass needed for theachievement of lasting peace settlements in conflict areas.The consequences of the Kosovo crisis have spilledover the borders of the region. That is why I find itworthwhile to share with the Assembly some conclusionsabout what was  hopefully  the last war in the Balkans.With the adoption of Security Council resolution1244 (1999)  the world community has endorsed thepolitical end of the system established by the cold war.That resolution reflected the new international status quoand the understanding that has grown during the past 10years of the importance of individual security.Today  the rights and dignity of the human individual civil freedoms and the international rule of law overrideeven the sovereignty of States. This calls for a newresponsibility on the part of the international community fortheir protection. The resolution also showed thecommitment of Security Council members to internationalstability.Paradoxical as it may sound  the Kosovo crisis hasserved as a catalyst of post-bipolar relations and of a newtype of political dialogue among States. Significantly  forthe first time since the Second World War  four permanentSecurity Council members are participating in one force —KFOR. Furthermore  they have been involved inpeacekeeping operations — something that would havebeen unthinkable 10 years ago.The Kosovo crisis has also highlighted the need forchange within the United Nations system itself. Forexample  the world Organization is in serious need of amechanism for compensating neighbouring States fordamage caused by international intervention or sanctions. Iraise this issue not only because of the losses sustained bymy country during the past eight years from the embargoagainst Iraq and because of the military conflicts in theformer Yugoslavia  but also because this will increase theefficiency and boost the image of the United Nations. Itwill certainly improve the credibility of United Nations-ledoperations and provide better motivation for individualcountries to participate.On the other hand  the crisis in Kosovo promoted anew type of relations among international organizations inrespect of the protection of human rights. As a result of thecrisis  a new kind of interface has been born between theUnited Nations and the regional organizations in Europe such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe the European Union and regional initiatives such as theStability Pact for South-Eastern Europe. This hasstrengthened the role of the United Nations on thatcontinent.Today  the Balkan people expect the internationalcommunity to show the same commitment to the future ofthe region as it did during the crisis. Threats to peace andsecurity should cease to be the only international mobilizingfactor  and we must act towards this end.I am convinced that the developments in the formerYugoslavia have not been due to some peculiar Balkanmentality or to any historic predestination. Half a centuryago  Western Europe was embroiled in wars that were noless bloody. The difference is that after the Second WorldWar the nations of Western Europe were rescued at thesame time from fascism and communism. This helpedthem attain a democratic and economic homogeneity that in turn  enabled victors and vanquished alike to set asidetheir differences and build their present prosperity whilerespecting human rights and protecting their nationalidentity.Unfortunately  a different lot fell to the countries ofSouth-Eastern Europe after the Second World War. Stateslike Greece and Turkey  both NATO members  preservedand built up their potential for liberal-democraticdevelopment and a free market  and the rest of the Statesin the region were forced to become a part of the Sovietcommunist system.Today  10 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall  theBalkans still lack democratic homogeneity. This has beena source of tensions  which  translated into ethnic hatred are the favoured tool of any totalitarian regime attemptingto cling to power. But I am sure it is wrong to apply acommon denominator to the whole region. TodayBulgaria  as well as most of the Balkan States  is acountry with a working democracy  a free marketeconomy and the rule of law.An earlier democratic homogenization of South-Eastern Europe can be achieved only if the vision for ourcountries' integration with the rest of the European Statesis shared by both the Balkan nations and the people ofWestern Europe. Efforts and perseverance to this end arethe safest guarantee for converting the whole of Europeinto a continent of peace  stability and prosperity.This common European vision fully applies to thefuture Yugoslavia. There is hardly any country that has ahigher stake in Yugoslavia's earliest possible integrationin the family of democratic Balkan States than Bulgaria.I cannot but share here the concern of the worldcommunity at the continuing ethnic tensions in Kosovo which distance us from the desired state of peace andethnic tolerance. Six months ago I firmly supportedNATO's operation  designed to end ethnic violenceagainst the Albanian population in Kosovo. Today  just asfirmly  I oppose ethnic violence against the Serbpopulation in that province.The Balkans have paid a high price for peace inKosovo. Today the region needs direct assistance for itsreconstruction. The priority beneficiaries should clearly be2the hardest-hit countries and areas. Nonetheless  rather thandiscussing figures and reparations  I believe it would bemore productive for both the Balkans and the world toadopt a clear vision for the future of South-Eastern Europe.This future has no alternative but the transformation of theBalkans into an integral part of a united Europe of the nextcentury.The General Assembly is the right forum to discussthe issue of how this can be done. The path leads throughthe direct rehabilitation and reconstruction of theBalkans — the best form of assistance for our region being“help for self-help”. The Stability Pact for South-EasternEurope can provide the necessary framework.We are convinced that the economic prosperity of theregion is a vital condition for achieving political stability.We need infrastructure and strategic investment thatgenerate and guarantee more security than any politicaldialogue. We need the promotion of trade and a maximuminvolvement of the economic potential of our countries inthe reconstruction effort. This will encourage them tocooperate with each other  while opening up the region andtransforming it into a natural  organic part of Europe  ratherthan isolating it.The crisis in Kosovo will be long over before itseffects  such as the blockage of the Danube to shipping have been eliminated. The international waterway shouldnot become a new line of conflict; we should help it playits natural role of a link rather than allow it to act as adividing line across Europe. The issue I am raising at thispoint concerns both the economic damage that has beencaused and the very principles of the European architecturesince the end of the crisis in Kosovo.The location of the Balkans at a crossroads has beena curse for its people in the past; in today's globalizedworld  it is our greatest blessing. The Balkans should serveas a link between Western Europe and Central Asia  theCaucasus and the Caspian Sea. It is one of the mostpromising regions for the coming century. A case in pointis the restoration of the historic silk road  which crosses thewhole of Asia and links it to Europe. Restoration will entailhuge infrastructure projects and investment which in turncould improve the quality of life of whole nations andregions.The Balkan nations have already demonstrated awillingness to adopt a new approach in their relations withone another. The various forms of aid which neighbouringStates generously offered each other in response to therecent natural disasters were a positive new sign. Anothersignificant fact is the formation of the multinational peaceforce for South-Eastern Europe  staffed jointly bycountries that were enemies earlier this century  includingduring the cold war. It is an honour for my country thatthe first headquarters of that force is based in Bulgaria.I cannot fail to mention here the success of thetrilateral initiatives between Bulgaria  Romania andGreece and between Bulgaria  Romania and Turkey forcooperation in combating organized crime and illegaldrugs and arms trafficking.The Kosovo crisis calls for a contemporary rereadingof the chronicles of the Balkan wars by all the Balkanpeoples: the modern perspective will reveal to them thatthose wars have done no country in the region any good.The new task facing the political elite is to translate theselessons of history into a lasting commitment to peace andcooperation. Having paid such a high price in sufferingand fear  it would be a pity if we failed to learn from ourexperience.In conclusion  I reiterate my country's willingness tocooperate with and contribute actively to the joint effortsof all Member States to streamline the United Nations  anOrganization with a key role in maintaining internationalpeace and security and achieving the objectives ofsustainable development in the coming century."
"18",725,"BHR",54,1999,"Mr.President  I have the pleasure of congratulating you on yourelection as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session. Confident that your experience and abilitywill strongly influence the successful outcome of theproceedings of this session  I assure you of my delegation'sreadiness to cooperate with you in fulfilling your task.I would like to avail myself of this opportunity toexpress my thanks to His Excellency Didier Opertti Badán President of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session for his contribution to the achievements and success of thatsession. It is also my pleasure to express appreciation forthe efforts that Secretary-General Kofi Annan has exertedin order to enable the Organization to fulfil its role inpromoting international peace and security and in furtheringinternational cooperation. I also extend the sincerecongratulations of the State of Bahrain to the Kingdom ofTonga  the Republic of Nauru and the Republic of Kiribatiupon their admission to the United Nations.On 6 March 1999  the State of Bahrain announced tothe people of Bahrain and to the world the sad news of thepassing away of His Highness Shaikh ‘Isa Bin Salman Al-Khalifa  may God grant him peace and mercy. He was agreat and humane emir who loved people and was loved bythe people by virtue of the remarkable traits he exhibited which are the embodiment of the Bahraini character:loyalty  tolerance and civility. He  may God bestow Hismercy upon him  championed national independence  theConstitution  the consultative process and the erection ofthe State institutions and the rule of law. He championeddevelopment  comprehensive renaissance and diversificationof the national economy. He championed Gulf cooperationand Arab solidarity through the most difficult times andsituations. He championed peace and internationalcooperation and genuine friendship among all peoples.These causes were the legacy of the late emir  whoseapproach will continue to be the beacon that guidesBahrain as it moves forward along its national path andas it pursues Gulf cooperation  Arab solidarity  regionalcooperation with neighbours and international cooperationwith one and all.In view of this session’s special momentousness  asit is being held at a juncture between the end of a centuryand the beginning of a new millennium  it behoves us topause and reflect on the experience of the United Nationsover the last half century. It should again be emphasizedthat  as we approach the third millennium  we ought todirect our actions in consonance with the principles andpurposes of the United Nations Charter  which are aimedat enhancing peace and economic and social development in the interest of the world as a whole and on the basis ofequality  justice and respect for law.The Organization’s experience of more than 50years  with all its successes and setbacks in dealing withcrises and in addressing the challenges facing the world has demonstrated that the benefits of past experienceshould be taken into account as we prepare for the future.In this way we would be better equipped to contribute tothe building of a new world and a brighter future andwould be better committed to the United Nations. Someof that experience has proved that departure from theUnited Nations principles  Charter and resolutions hasstrained relations among many States and caused regionaldisputes and ethnic conflicts that have threatened securityand stability in numerous regions of the world. Yethumanity has accomplished much during the last halfcentury  particularly through United Nations involvementin the maintenance of international peace and security sustainable development and international cooperation.Such United Nations endeavours deserve our appreciationand commitment so that we can alleviate the humansuffering of those who are beset by poverty and lack ofsecurity  stability and the basic requirements of a life ofdignity.17Hence  our common agreement on enhancing thevitally important role of the United Nations during theforthcoming millennium as the embodiment of theinternational community’s conscience and its hope ofbuilding a better world in which our common humanaspirations  as enshrined in the Charter  can be realized.Bahrain’s experience on the Security Council duringthe past two years has demonstrated that small countries arecapable of effectively contributing to the causes ofinternational peace and security. That experience has alsoreaffirmed Bahrain’s convictions  most notably itsadherence to the principles of the United Nations Charterand international legality  which reflect the will and desireof the international community to live in security  toleranceand peace. It has also confirmed the importance ofstrengthening the principles of equitable geographicrepresentation and transparency as important values andprinciples in international relations. Such principles wouldenhance the Security Council’s role in maintaining peaceand security and help develop its ability to functioneffectively. Therefore  it is essential that efforts be exertedto reform the Council so that it can adequately reflectpolitical realities and cope with the changing internationalclimate during the next century.The role of the Security Council in dealing with thequestions of peace and security requires that the processesof peacekeeping and peace-building be interrelated in orderto prevent the renewal of conflicts; hence Bahrain’s requestfor the convening of an open meeting during its term asPresident of the Council last December  to consider therelationship between peacekeeping and peace-building. Theextensive participation of members of the Council and otherMembers of the United Nations bears witness to theconviction of many Member States that such linkage isessential for the integration of political action with actionin the field of economic and social development.Bahrain’s enthusiasm and interest in taking part injoint efforts to reach solutions for issues of peace andsecurity have been demonstrated by its active andconstructive participation whenever the Security Councilhas dealt with such questions. By virtue of the expertisethat it has gained  Bahrain will be active  both within itsregion and at the international level  in furthering theprinciples of security  peace and stability.Since the beginning of Bahrain’s modern revival  ourcountry has been building a modern State and a developedcivil society on the basis of developing  preparing andqualifying the individual to deal with the demands of ourtime and to participate positively in present and futuretransformation. As a result  Bahrain has been able to buildan open and developed economy that has made it possiblefor the country to realize comprehensive and sustainablehuman development  as reflected in its remarkableranking in the human development index for fiveconsecutive years. This is also reflected in the reports ofthe United Nations Development Programme  whosecontributions and efforts in the field of development inmany States we commend.The State of Bahrain has long been aware of theimportance of human development and has thus drawn upplans and policies for the development and utilization ofthe capabilities of Bahrainis in all fields. It has alsoenacted legislation encouraging women to join theworkforce and to enter the labour market. Thus  thepercentage of Bahraini women in the entire public sectorlabour force reached 33.5 per cent in 1998  and the totalnumber of women in the private sector labour force hasreached 20 per cent. The State of Bahrain takes pride inthis achievement at the regional and international levels.It makes available equal opportunities to both men andwomen in the fields  inter alia  of education  health careand social welfare  as these are basic priorities of humanrights for which Bahrain’s efforts have been applauded byUnited Nations human rights bodies and experts.In its new era under the leadership of its emir  HisHighness Shaikh Hamad Bin Isa Al-Khalifa  Bahrain willcontinue on its course  which has allowed it to assume aprominent place economically and socially  therebybecoming an example of progressive development thattakes into account both the global dimension and thepreservation of its heritage and traditions.Over the last two decades  the Gulf region haswitnessed serious and painful events  the ramifications ofwhich continue to pose a threat to the security andstability of this vital region  which is an important hub forworld trade and for mutual  beneficial exchange betweenvarious nations of the world.Those events have demonstrated that themaintenance and preservation of regional security can bebased only on respect for and strict observation ofprinciples that the State of Bahrain has always advocated most notably respect for the status quo and theinviolability of established boundaries. Relations amongcountries of the region should be based on the principlesof good neighbourliness  mutual respect and non-interference in the internal affairs of other States.18Recognition of each State's national sovereignty is anessential factor for the preservation of security and stabilityin the region  as is the settlement of disputes by peacefulmeans acceptable to the States concerned.Accordingly  and reaffirming its consistent positionwith respect to a number of regional and internationalquestions and its keen interest in the maintenance ofsecurity and peace in the world  particularly in the Gulfregion  Bahrain again calls on Iraq to implement relevantSecurity Council resolutions  especially those relating toweapons of mass destruction and the release of prisoners ofwar and detainees of Kuwaiti and other nationalities.At the same time  Bahrain urges anew that efforts becontinued with a view to alleviating the suffering of thebrotherly Iraqi people resulting from sanctions. It is alsoeager to ensure the independence  unity and territorialintegrity of Iraq and opposes any interference in its internalaffairs.In the interest of security  stability and peace in theGulf region  Bahrain wishes to emphasize again its supportfor all efforts aimed at settling by peaceful means thedispute between the United Arab Emirates and the IslamicRepublic of Iran over the three islands  namely Abu Musa Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunb  all of which belong to theUnited Arab Emirates. In this respect  Bahrain wishessuccess to the work of the Tripartite Ministerial Committeeformed by the Gulf Cooperation Council to solve thedispute in a manner that would lead to the establishment ofgood and normal relations with the Islamic Republic of Iranon the basis of the principles of good neighbourliness mutual respect and observance of mutual interests.In conjunction with the questions of security andstability  it is imperative that we re-emphasize the dangerof territorial claims aimed at changing established  inheritedand traditionally accepted boundaries. Bahrain thereforewelcomes the resolutions adopted by the summit of theOrganization of African Unity (OAU) held in Algeria inJuly 1999 which confirmed the adherence of member Statesto the principles set out in the OAU Charter and OAUresolutions in respect of inherited and traditionally acceptedboundaries.During the last three years  the Middle East peaceprocess has encountered a setback which froze and almostcompletely destroyed the process  owing to the rigidpositions and contradictory policies of the previous IsraeliGovernment. Now that a new Government has taken overand has made promises regarding its readiness to revive thepeace process  Bahrain  having endorsed that process fromthe very beginning and having consistently workedtowards its success  expresses its hope that the new IsraeliGovernment will translate its promises into full  completeand faithful implementation of all the agreements reachedand will be responsive to international efforts to make thepeace process a success.Accordingly  the State of Bahrain has welcomed thelatest Palestinian-Israeli agreement on the implementationof the Wye River accords signed at Sharm el-Sheikh asa positive step towards a final settlement between the twoparties and the enhancement of the peace process amongall other parties.The Arab side has repeatedly confirmed itscommitment to the peace terms reflected in the principlesof the 1991 Madrid Conference and the relevant UnitedNations resolutions. It believes that achievement of a just comprehensive and lasting peace in the region should bethe strategic option that would obligate Israel to recognizelegitimate Arab rights  to comply with the relevantresolutions of international legitimacy  including SecurityCouncil resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  to respectthe right of the Palestinian people to have their ownindependent State with Jerusalem as its capital  to fullywithdraw from all occupied Arab territories  including theSyrian Arab Golan Heights  to the boundaries that existedon 4 June 1967 and to withdraw from Lebanese territorypursuant to Security Council resolution 425 (1978).The success of the peace process and theachievement of a just  comprehensive and lasting peacewill undoubtedly have a bearing on the future stabilityand development of all the countries and peoples of theregion.At the same time  we wish to stress the importanceof intensifying efforts to make the Middle East  includingthe Gulf region  a zone free of all weapons of massdestruction  including nuclear weapons.The world has witnessed this year positivedevelopments in respect of an issue that was a source ofdeep concern to the international Organization and theinternational community  namely the question ofLockerbie. We should like here to commend the LibyanArab Jamahiriya for complying with relevant SecurityCouncil resolutions  as well as the other parties in thecase for the cooperation they have displayed. We alsowelcome the suspension by the Security Council ofsanctions against Libya and express our appreciation of19efforts exerted by the Governments of the brotherlyKingdom of Saudi Arabia and South Africa and by theSecretary-General  as well as the concerned regionalorganizations  which have led to agreement on the case. Wehope that this will lead to the complete lifting of sanctions.The easing of the Kosovo crisis by virtue of the returnof refugees and displaced persons to their homes andvillages has imbued the international community with hopeand satisfaction. However  the whole world has seenshocking images of the crimes of ethnic cleansing and theterrorizing of innocent people and of the human sufferingthat has beset the people of Kosovo  including thedisplacement of about one million Kosovars  mass gravesand the destruction of villages and homes. It is incumbentupon the international community to unfailingly guardagainst and to address the causes of the phenomenon ofracism and all its manifestations.In view of its keen interest in the maintenance ofinternational peace and security  the State of Bahrain callsupon the United Nations and the international communityquickly to intensify their efforts  in cooperation with thecompetent regional organizations  to settle the ongoingconflicts in various regions and among a number of States.These include the tense situation between Ethiopia andEritrea and internal strife in Afghanistan  Somalia  theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  East Timor and otherparts of the world.Other sources of concern are the phenomena ofterrorism  violence  organized crime and related activitiessuch as transnational drug and weapons trafficking thatcontinue to pose a threat to all societies. To address theseproblems the State of Bahrain supports the call by the ArabRepublic of Egypt for the convening of an internationalconference  under the auspices of the United Nations  witha view to drawing up a comprehensive strategy to combatand eliminate these phenomena.Since the end of the Second World War  the worldeconomy has experienced tremendous changes on theinternational trade landscape  including the emergence ofgiant trade conglomerates and a revolution in the fields oftechnology  information and communications.About half a century after the establishment of theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF)  the World Bank andthe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)  theinternational community was able to establish the WorldTrade Organization (WTO) in order to undertake theresponsibility of establishing frameworks for world trade inthe forthcoming decades. Now  with the advent of thetwenty-first century and the rise of economicglobalization  the international community has to setambitious goals  most notable of which are the eradicationof poverty and the pursuit of economic and socialdevelopment.Although the positive and constructive position takenrecently by the Group of Eight regarding the settlement ofthe problems of indebtedness has created an atmosphereof confidence and satisfaction  two important pointsshould be stressed. First  the burden of repaying theremaining balances and the servicing of debts should notinterrupt the growth and integration of the nationaleconomies concerned into the world economy. Secondly it is essential to create a favourable environment for thepromotion of economic and trade cooperation betweenStates on the basis of equality and mutual benefit andwithin a framework of transparency of capital markets  inaddition to facilitating the transfer of technology andencouraging international investment  which wouldenhance development and growth for all  as well asfacilitating the equitable integration of the economies ofdeveloping countries into the world economic system.This will enable the world economy to avoid any othershocks that are liable to have a universal impact.The State of Bahrain is pleased and willing tocontribute to international efforts aimed at achievingincreased international economic cooperation  due to itsstability and strategic location  and the trade andinvestment environment it enjoys — elements that havehelped it attract foreign capital and enhance its standingas an advanced financial and commercial centre.With the imminent approach of a new century  theworld has witnessed major historical changes precipitatedby technological and scientific advances  atelecommunications revolution  a rapid flow ofinformation  a trend towards open global markets and awidening scope of interaction between nations  culturesand civilizations. All this serves as a harbinger signallingthe advent of a better world for humanity as a whole. Yet while we appreciate the positive aspects of such advance we are duty-bound to warn against the dangers thataccompany those positive aspects. Those dangers raise thefollowing questions.To what extent can poor countries benefit from thetechnological revolution? If they cannot  then therevolution will serve only to widen the gap between thepoor and the rich. To what extent can scientific advance20and globalization solve the various environmental problemsthat endanger the entire world  if such a solution is notlinked to solving the problems of development in poorcountries  on the one hand  and to curbing and rationalizingconsumer and welfare trends in rich countries  on the other?To what extent can globalization of capital flows andmarkets facilitate the flow of investments into developingcountries and boost their export capacities in a manner thatwould enhance the development of their economies andtheir contributions to the world economy? To what extentcan the potential of such advance and globalization beutilized to help prevent the proliferation of weapons ofmass destruction  address ethnic conflicts  settle disputesand eliminate the threat of international terrorism? To whatextent can this advance and globalization be utilized toenhance opportunities for improving the quality ofeducation  culture and worldwide intercultural knowledge with a view to upholding the ideals of peace  equality andbrotherhood among the entire human race?With the advent of the third millennium  it behoves usto consider and reflect upon the accomplishments ofhumanity  on the one hand  and the horrible humansuffering that has beset thousands of individuals as aconsequence of disputes  conflicts and poverty  on theother. We believe that the United Nations is the principalforum for such reflection and consideration so that solutionscan be found for these disputes and conflicts. It is Bahrain’sconviction  in this connection  that the internationalcommunity can enhance its standing and its values duringthe next millennium and ensure a better destiny for itself through the achievement of peace  security  solidarity andcooperation within a framework of universal humanpartnership and pluralism. Bahrain regards these elementsas essential for the survival of the planet and calls forstrengthening the role of the United Nations system  as it isthe trustworthy custodian of our accomplishments andaspirations  so that it can carry out its task to the fullestextent. We are confident that mankind can reach higherlevels of advancement  development and growth throughcoordination and cooperation within the United Nations andother regional organizations. It is our hope that the newmillennium will usher in a new era of abundance whereinthe world will be endowed with security  peace andstability."
"19",763,"BHS",54,1999,"The Bahamas shares theconfidence that the international community has placed inyou  Sir  as the envoy of Namibia and of the continent ofAfrica to preside over this fifty-fourth session of theGeneral Assembly  the last in this twentieth century. Mydelegation congratulates you and pledges its full support asyou guide our deliberations at this critical juncture.My delegation’s congratulations are also extended toMr. Didier Opertti  who represented our Latin Americanand Caribbean region as President of the fifty-third session.My delegation wishes to commend the Secretary-General of the United Nations for his leadership of thishighly complex Organization on which rest the hopes andaspirations of the world’s peoples and which is our bestprospect for a stable world.I am pleased on this occasion to warmly welcome theKingdom of Tonga  the Republic of Kiribati and theRepublic of Nauru  the United Nations newest MemberStates  to this community of nations. These countries add tothe growing number of small island developing States in theUnited Nations and underscore the need for theOrganization to increase its efforts in support of thisimportant constituency.The United Nations was created with a mandate towork collectively for a better world  and since itsinception it has contributed to positive developments inthe global arena. However  significant challenges persist.The agenda of the fifty-fourth session shows that even assome progress has been made  we will continue at thissession to grapple with many of the thorny issues thathave preoccupied the international community over thedecades. At the same time  new challenges will have tobe addressed.Recent events in Europe and elsewhere in the world spawned by internal conflict  have raised questions as towhether States fractured by ethnic  religious and otherstrife could build national identities to span these divides.At the same time  they remind us that the greatest caremust be taken in making exceptions to the generalprinciple of non-intervention in the internal affairs ofother States. The Bahamas believes that this principleremains an important safeguard for international peaceand security.The Bahamas accepts that internal conflicts createsituations in which the Security Council should act  inaccordance with the Charter. However  we believe thatwhenever the United Nations responds to internalconflicts and threats to regional stability  it must do sowith one and the same degree of urgency  with adequateresources and with consistency. It is with theseconsiderations in mind that the Bahamas supports UnitedNations efforts to bring peace and stability to areas ofconflict in all regions of the world.Recent United Nations peace initiatives give us hopethat long-standing and seemingly intractable problemsmay have solutions. Indeed  the Bahamas is encouragedby developments in the Middle East  particularly thesigning this month of the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum.We see these developments as having the potential to enddecades of conflict in that troubled region. If enlightenedself-interest were to prevail in long-standing conflictselsewhere in Africa  Asia and Latin America  they toocould be resolved. Global attention could then be turnedtowards development and human betterment  as envisagedin the Charter.Globalization and trade liberalization are gainingcurrency as means of promoting accelerated developmentand opening opportunities to bridge the gap between rich15and poor. However  concerns are being expressed that therules of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and itsdispute settlement mechanisms put the interests of thestrong ahead of the interests of the weak. Indeed  theanticipated benefits of free trade give little comfort toCaribbean States and farmers dependent as they are onbananas for their foreign exchange earnings and their verylivelihood. Where preferential treatment is removed beforeCaribbean countries can restructure their economies  severehardship results. We therefore believe that all concernedmust make an effort to find a solution to the bananaproblem.We see the new round of WTO negotiations scheduledto begin in Seattle in November as an invaluableopportunity for developing countries to have their concernsincorporated into the discussions. The Bahamas is currentlygiving consideration to acquiring observer status in theWTO. It fully intends to follow the multilateral negotiatingprocess and to bring its concerns to the table  particularlyin the areas of trade in services and differential treatmentfor small economies.Growth in the economy of the Bahamas is in partattributable to the services it offers as an offshore financialcentre. The Bahamas is concerned about the action takenwithin the international community to inhibit or prevent theuse of offshore centres and to label them  impertinently  as“harmful” tax jurisdictions. Furthermore  there is a tendencyto treat all offshore jurisdictions as a homogenous group which they are most definitely not.The Bahamas had the opportunity to address theOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Developmenton harmful tax practices in August this year in Paris. Weemphasized there that strict regulations and appropriatelegislation  specifically formulated to counter moneylaundering and other illegal activities  govern financialinstitutions in the Bahamas. The Bahamas is committed toworking with all concerned to address these and relatedissues.In May this year  it was reported to our Parliamentthat the economy of the Bahamas was experiencing aperiod of dynamism. In 1998  our economy grew some 3per cent  the unemployment rate was 7.8 per cent and netforeign investment inflows amounted to $491 million. Buton 14 September 1999  hurricane Floyd struck theBahamas  and the entire archipelago felt its impact.Significant damage was done to the environment infrastructure and property. The full implications for theeconomy of our country of the relief  recovery andreconstruction efforts have yet to be calculated.What happened in the Bahamas underscores thecontinuing validity of the Barbados Programme of Actionfor the Sustainable Development of Small IslandDeveloping States  adopted in 1994. We cannot help butemphasize — as so many States did at the recentlyconcluded twenty-second special session — howimperative it therefore remains for the BarbadosProgramme of Action to be implemented. It is in thiscontext that we urge renewed commitment on the part ofall to the search for consensus on the draft resolution onthe recognition of the Caribbean Sea as a special area inthe context of sustainable development.Together with our Caribbean Community sisterStates  the Bahamas has made known our concernregarding the transhipment of nuclear and hazardouswaste through the Caribbean Sea. Yet these shipmentscontinue. We reiterate our wish to see these shipmentsstopped: they constitute the gravest risk to the fragility ofour marine environment and our economies.The significant number of reviews issued recently orexpected in the coming months  of the outcomes ofUnited Nations Conferences on small island developingStates  population and development  social developmentand women  attest to the efforts of the United Nations tomeet its economic and social obligations under theCharter. The Bahamas confidently expects that thesereviews will all confirm that renewed political will andaction are required to meet the goals we set  at a highlevel  in Barbados  Cairo  Copenhagen and Beijing.Let me comment briefly on our continuing efforts tomaintain the momentum for gender equality  a subjectwhich will be taken up in the five-year Beijing review.Women worldwide continue to break through glassceilings. In the Bahamas  for example  women have madesignificant strides in Parliament  the judiciary  publicservice and business and service organizations. However the Bahamas is cognizant that there are still seriouschallenges to women’s equality. We are particularlyconcerned about the traffic in human beings predominantly women and children. The Bahamas intendsto continue its active support  both nationally andinternationally  for efforts to help women realize theirlegal rights  attain economic empowerment and rise abovepoverty. It is our hope  therefore  that the Beijing reviewwill result in strategies to further engage the internationalcommunity in support of the world’s women.16The Bahamas supports the growing consensus onhuman rights  which focuses on principles and valuesincluding democracy  good governance and the rule of law.We also believe that United Nations Member States shouldhonour the human rights commitments they have made.The Republic of Haiti is a fledgling democracycourageously facing significant political  economic andsocial challenges. These myriad challenges have resulted ina sustained influx of illegal immigration from Haiti into theBahamas. Together with other illegal immigration particularly from other countries in the Caribbean region illegal Haitian immigration continues to be a burden to thesocio-economic structures of the Bahamas. We thereforehave a vested interest in the stabilization of Haiti’sdemocratic institutions and economy. The Bahamasparticipated in a Caribbean Community mission to Haiti inJuly of this year; that mission reviewed with the HaitianGovernment its preparedness for elections. In so doing  wesignalled our support for the process of free and fairelections in Haiti. We also fully support the efforts of theEconomic and Social Council and of the General Assemblyfor Haiti’s reconstruction and for the strengthening andfurtherance of its democracy.Last year  at the twentieth special session of theGeneral Assembly  on the world drug problem  theinternational community adopted a new and detailedprogramme of measures to enhance the effectiveness ofnational  regional and international drug control activities.Member States must now implement the programme particularly by meeting the targets set in the specialsession’s concluding documents. For the United NationsInternational Drug Control Programme to carry out itsmandate  adequate resources must be allocated to it.Drug trafficking into and through the Bahamas is amajor threat to our socio-economic development. Asignificant proportion of the national budget continues to bespent on drug law enforcement. I wish to emphasize thateven though we do so at the expense of vital nationalprogrammes  the Bahamas will not relent in its efforts toovercome the serious challenges posed by drug traffickingand related criminality. We are particularly concerned aboutthe traffic in illicit firearms  which appears to be workingin tandem with the drug trade. Further  with the increase infirearms comes an increase in violent crime committed withthose firearms. We continue to urge greater efforts tocontrol the illicit manufacture of and trafficking in firearms including the ratification and implementation of relevantinternational conventions.The failure to achieve general and completedisarmament means that serious threats to internationalpeace and security persist. The production and stockpilingof chemical  biological and other weapons of massdestruction exacerbate this situation. The Convention onthe Prohibition of the Use  Stockpiling  Production andTransfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on TheirDestruction  to which the Bahamas is a party  has been akey success in recent disarmament initiatives. TheConvention demonstrates what can be achieved whenthere is unity of purpose in the field of disarmament.In a constantly changing global environment  UnitedNations reform must continue to be a priority to ensurethat the Organization remains relevant to the roleenvisaged for it under the Charter. Negotiations on themultifaceted objective of Security Council reform havemoved at a frustratingly slow pace. It is clear that theCouncil must be reformed  and that one of the mainobjectives must be its enlargement. This has the supportof the Bahamas. However  in determining criteria forexpanded membership of the Council  consideration mustbe given to a mechanism for all Members to enjoy theprivilege of serving thereon.The Bahamas welcomes the General Assembly’sdecision to convene a millennium summit at thebeginning of the Millennium Assembly. We share theview that the summit should not be just acommemoration  but should also be substantive. TheBahamas wishes to reflect briefly on what the summit’sapproach might include. We see the summit not as aforum for a restatement of lofty ideals or of the practicalinitiatives that were the outcomes of past internationalconferences. The millennium summit must be used as acatalyst that would build  especially  on the outcomes ofthose conferences to produce a revitalized internationalagenda for the twenty-first century. That agenda shouldtake into account the accomplishments of the UnitedNations system as a whole in the areas of economic andsocial development as well as peace and security  and itshould be realistic. From this last perspective  it is thecontinued position of the Bahamas that the question ofrefugees  for example  should not continue to be divorcedfrom the broader question of illegal migration.Under the revitalized agenda  the United Nationswould have improved partnerships with other regional andinternational organizations. Such partnerships withorganizations including the Commonwealth  theOrganization of American States and the Caribbean17Community would further the coordination of solutions toproblems of a global nature.The United Nations cannot do what we ask of it unlessit is provided with the necessary resources. The commonvalues we share  and our determination to find solutions tothe world’s problems  should give us the political will tobuild on what the United Nations has accomplished to date.Thus  the Organization must be assured of funding on areliable  predictable and timely basis to carry out themandates entrusted to it by its Member States.The broad range of problems and issues on the UnitedNations agenda cannot be solved without investment inmultilateralism and partnerships. It is our responsibility tomake the United Nations a highly effective organizationfully capable of responding to the security  political economic and social challenges of the twenty-first century.The Bahamas pledges its full commitment to play its partin United Nations efforts to secure a better future for all."
"20",788,"BIH",54,1999,"Allow me at theoutset to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Theo-BenGurirab  Foreign Minister of Namibia  on his election asPresident of the fifty-fourth session of the GeneralAssembly. His talent  skills and experience in internationalaffairs guarantee the wise conduct and direction of thissession.Our gratitude goes to the outgoing President  HisExcellency Mr. Didier Opertti.Since the beginning of the fifty-third session of theGeneral Assembly  my country  Bosnia and Herzegovina has achieved remarkable progress in implementation ofthe Dayton/Paris Peace Accords — progress  I might evendare to say  that is encouraging. The progress is visible inthe further strengthening of peace  improvements inefficiency and the stabilization not only of commoninstitutions but also of the institutions of both Entities aswell as of local government bodies. This progress is alsoevident in the further promotion and affirmation ofdemocratic values  human rights and freedoms and evenin the return of displaced persons and refugees.This progress has also been noted in numerousreports by authoritative international representatives andinstitutions from the Council of Europe  the EuropeanUnion  the Organization for Security and Cooperation inEurope (OSCE)  the High Representative and participantsin the Stability Pact Summit. All of them confirmed thatwe have been moving in the right direction.I do not want to suggest that the progress that hasbeen made is spectacular and that we in Bosnia andHerzegovina  or the international players involved in mycountry  are filled with great joy. Nonetheless  despite allthe criticism and all of the shortcomings  progress isobvious  and that is a fact worthy of our attention  if forno other reason than that it is proof that Bosnia andHerzegovina is starting slowly and surely to move awayfrom political  humanitarian  economic and almost everyother form of stagnation. It is also proof that Bosnia andHerzegovina is moving away from the state of deepinternal mistrust  doubt and reservation which has for along time existed between the two Entities and differentconstitutive people  and between their political leaders andrepresentatives in common institutions. It is also areflection of the state of mind and general mood amongthe citizens. I believe that it would not be too optimisticto claim that those positive results and developments areevidence of a higher potential and the growing will tofind a way out of the difficult and depressing state inwhich Bosnia and Herzegovina was a prisoner for almosta whole decade.Of course  there are still many issues which we needto work on regarding the Peace Agreementimplementation and the implementation of the conclusionsof the Peace Implementation Council contained in theBonn and Madrid documents  although it also cannot bedisputed that  unfortunately  we have reached unbalancedresults in the two Entities.36However  this year the common institutions of Bosniaand Herzegovina have been working with greatereffectiveness  intensity and coordination. Furthermore 272 000 displaced persons and 343 000 refugees havereturned to both Entities. However  the return remains oneof the most difficult and painful humanitarian  economicand political issues  especially the so-called minority return.On different levels  the minority return is still being sloweddown  manipulated  blocked and politically exploited.However  we are not accepting the situation. Minorityreturn is not coming off our agenda; rather  it isincreasingly becoming an indicator of success demonstrating the capabilities and responsibilities of manypolitical leaders from the local to the State level. The publicat large — the voters — are monitoring and assessing thisprocess daily. The return of refugees under conditions setby us is the barometer of reconciliation  respect for humanrights and stability in general.Reform of the judicial system has also been initiated and it is aimed at the complete professionalization modernization and independence of judges and prosecutors in accordance with the norms and standards of thedemocratic societies of contemporary Europe and the world.The reconstruction of the Ministry of the Interior is alsounder way  as well as the modernization  professionaltraining and education of local police. The recruitment ofpolicemen and policewomen reflects the demographicpicture of the population. Finally  there has also beenprogress in cooperation with the International CriminalTribunal for the former Yugoslavia  although suchcooperation is still not complete in the region as a whole.Starting with the current school year  children in theschools of Bosnia and Herzegovina are attending classes inaccordance with new programmes which reflect the presenttime and look to our common future. The schoolprogrammes exclude contents which  according to thecommon multinational commissions and internationalrepresentatives  could represent a threat and a danger to thefragile confidence and understanding of the younggenerations.Significant results have been achieved through aprogramme of economic and infrastructural reconstruction.But the restoration of industrial capacity has brought it upto only one third of its pre-war level. We still have a highnumber of unemployed and socially dependent categories.That is why Bosnia and Herzegovina will need internationalassistance for a longer period of time. However  that wouldbe an investment not only in our future but in the future ofeveryone.Activities are under way in regulating the sensitivebut vital field of public information in both Entities. A setof regulations on the organization and functioning ofbroadcasting is in the process of being drawn up.Significant measures have been undertaken in the sphereof economic reform. In addition  the customs law hasentered into force  the reform of the banking system andfinancial transactions has been launched and the firstresults have been achieved in the privatization of smallenterprises. Preparations for the privatization of largerpublic enterprises and industrial conglomerates  whichwere an inheritance from the socialist period  are underway.Bosnia and Herzegovina is speeding up its activitiesin these and many other areas as a reflection of its strongorientation towards the building of democracy and civilsociety  an open market economy and the enlargement ofhuman rights and  by doing so  it is meeting theconditions for admission to the Council of Europe andgetting closer to the European Union and trans-Atlanticinstitutions. Bosnia and Herzegovina has increased itscooperation with the European Union and North Atlanticgroupings  at the same time benefiting from the variousforms of support and assistance that those institutionshave provided to us. In that regard  Bosnia andHerzegovina was particularly encouraged by the adoptionlast year of the European Union Declaration on specialrelations with Bosnia and Herzegovina. The ConsultativeTask Force established pursuant to that document hasintensified its work in assisting us to overcome a numberof technical  legal and organizational problems in therelationship between Bosnia and Herzegovina and theEuropean Union. This has strengthened the functioning ofState and Entity institutions and is enabling us tocooperate more successfully with the European Union.For these and many other results which cannot bementioned because of the time limitations  we have tothank the international community  which gave direct andindirect assistance  and we are especially grateful to theHigh Representative  who used his right to imposesolutions when we in Bosnia and Herzegovina wereunable to reach agreement through the normal democraticprocess. All of those efforts should warn us that thepresence of the international community and its role inBosnia and Herzegovina is still indispensable; it remainsa guarantor that life in Bosnia and Herzegovina will movetowards normalization. I believe that one of the mostconvincing pieces of evidence of the progress which weare witnessing in Bosnia and Herzegovina was itsorganization and hosting of the Summit of the Stability37Pact for South-Eastern Europe  which took place on 29 and30 July this year in Sarajevo. As the Assembly may recall Sarajevo has hosted leaders of the States members ofEuropean Union  the Russian Federation  Canada  theUnited States of America  Japan  the Central and EasternEuropean countries  the most important multilateralinstitutions  such as this one  and  of course  the countriesof South-Eastern Europe — the very members of theStability Pact.At that historic event  the common institutions ofBosnia and Herzegovina  the bodies and organizations fromboth Entities and many individual actors of all nationalities confirmed not only their abilities and their capabilities  butalso their belief in and readiness to make joint endeavoursin their respective and common interests. I am deeplyconvinced that the numerous offers of congratulations andrecognition which were forwarded to us on that occasionfrom the many prominent European and world heads ofState gathered in Sarajevo were more than a simpleexpression of diplomatic courtesy.As a unique contribution to the objectives of theStability Pact  Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia havesigned the border agreement  thereby removing thissensitive issue from our respective agendas. We areconvinced that the Stability Pact and the declarationadopted in Sarajevo have opened new perspectives toBosnia and Herzegovina  as well as to all the othercountries in the region. This has given birth to a stable anddefinite solution to a series of catastrophic events ofBiblical proportions and the fast recovery of peoples andcountries that have paid an extremely high price forignorance  for political and military adventurism and forflagrant violations of the norms of international relationsand international humanitarian law.The guarantees of the success of the goals of theStability Pact — peace  prosperity and security for our partof the world — indeed depend upon the determination andpreparedness of the European Union  the OSCE  theCouncil of Europe  the United Nations and the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)  as well as otherinternational organizations  institutions and regionalinitiatives. The guarantee of their accomplishment alsodepends upon the fact that the European Union and theUnited States of America have made the Stability Pact apriority in their new trans-Atlantic programme  and theEuropean Union and the Russian Federation have made thePact the priority in their political dialogue.Bearing all of this in mind  we in Bosnia andHerzegovina are determined to embrace the Stability Pactin its entirety  to build on it and to accomplish ourobjectives through concrete contributions to its success through our own initiatives and creative activities andthrough the development of regional cooperation withinthe framework of multilateral and bilateral agreements.In that context  I wish from this podium once againnot only to reaffirm the indispensable role of theOrganization in the implementation of the Dayton/ParisAgreement and the Stability Pact  but also to reiterate mygratitude for all the efforts  contributions and manysacrifices made for Bosnia and Herzegovina. We havewitnessed in this past decade the capabilities andefficiencies of international organizations  and especiallyof the United Nations. At the same time  unfortunately we have noticed some weaknesses and imperfections thatendanger the role of the Organization as a vital andirreplaceable Organization for the twenty-first century.I believe that none of us has any doubts that theUnited Nations is ready and able to pursue its noblemission to continue to strengthen and develop its purposeand ideals in the coming century. Even if the UnitedNations has not achieved all of its goals  it was able tosafeguard global peace  initiate and make possiblesustainable development  appease many injusticesworldwide and  on top of all that  to come to very clearvisions about its own reforms.The United Nations started reforming itself severalyears ago but has not yet finished this task. This pathshould indeed be vigorously pursued. I am of the viewthat if the United Nations had the courage to change theworld  it can and must find the determination to changeitself more quickly and to adapt itself to face thechallenges of the next century. The millennium summitcould be envisaged as a great opportunity for heads ofState and Government of Member States meeting in theyear 2000 to verify and adopt a large part of thesereforms.Bosnia and Herzegovina has thus far been to agreater or lesser extent an object of consideration withinmany international organizations and forums. The timeand the context that dictated such a position arefortunately coming to an end. We are now becomingaware of the necessity of38taking a more active  creative and responsible role ininternational relations. That is why we observe with a morecritical eye the duties that we have taken on as a fullmember of the family of nations  but that we have not yetcarried out or accomplished fully. Such an orientation ismore a result of the fact that we feel more self-confidentand are more and more trustful towards our friends andpartners in the United Nations and other internationalorganizations  forums and initiatives. An expression of thisis the decision taken by Bosnia and Herzegovina to reduceits military expenses by 15 per cent in the hope of givingan example to other nations.Allow me to conclude this statement by quoting abrilliant diplomat who once said  “People and States actwisely only after they have exhausted all otheralternatives.”"
"21",835,"BLR",54,1999,"Please  Sir  accept my mostsincere congratulations on your election as President ofthe General Assembly at this session  as well as mywishes for every success in the discharge of this complexand responsible mission. We are thankful for the work ofyour predecessor  Mr. Didier Opertti. We also greatlyappreciate the efforts of the Secretary-General  Mr. KofiAnnan  to effectively and energetically lead ourOrganization.Belarus welcomes the enlargement of the UnitedNations family of nations  which recently accepted threenew members: the Republic of Kiribati  the Republic ofNauru and the Kingdom of Tonga.The fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly isbeing held at the doorway between centuries andmillennia. This fact alone urges us to take an in-depthlook at both the past and the present of the UnitedNations and to think about its future. The expandingglobal challenges  especially ethnic conflicts  deteriorationof the environment  transnational crime and terrorism canbe met only by concerted efforts of the United Nations.Belarus will be actively contributing to the formationof a new image of the United Nations as an organizationcapable of tackling the challenges of the day. Our countrywas among the Organization's founding members  whobestowed upon the United Nations such high and noblegoals and principles. We are interested in theirconsolidation and development.This year the Organization experienced what wasprobably one of the most serious tests in its entire history.The United Nations was virtually marginalized during thecrisis around Yugoslavia. The decision to use militaryforce against a sovereign State was taken without theauthorization of the Security Council.Although the settlement of the Kosovo crisis hasnow been brought back under the auspices of the United3Nations  a recurrence of attempts to randomly use forceoutside the Security Council mechanism cannot beexcluded. Consequently  the question as to whether theSecurity Council should remain the only — I reiterate  theonly — international institution to authorize the use of forcefor the maintenance of international peace and security asyet remains unanswered.The answer that is today given to this question willdetermine developments in the twenty-first century. Will itbe the age of fairness and the rule of law  or will the worldbe thrown back into the era when force was the onlyargument? From a historical perspective  such adevelopment would return us to the beginning of thiscentury. Let us recall that the dawn of the twentieth centurysaw nations divided into two categories: subjects andobjects of international law  with their fate totallydependent upon their ability to defend themselves bymilitary force.I believe that a totally different world order wouldmost adequately meet the interests of all members of theinternational community. This is a world order in which allcountries are equal and are protected by international lawand the United Nations. The prerogative of the SecurityCouncil to establish and maintain peace and security is akey element of this system.Naturally this places a special burden of responsibilityon the Security Council and its members. We view theincrease in both permanent and non-permanent members ofthe Council on the basis of equitable geographicaldistribution to be an important measure that would improvethe Council's effectiveness.Guided by the intention to contribute further tostrengthening peace and security  Belarus has presented itscandidature for a non-permanent seat on the SecurityCouncil for the period 2002-2003. The elections will beheld in 2001  during the fifty-sixth session of the GeneralAssembly.As regards the responsibility of the United Nations forthe maintenance of peace and security  I would also like tounderline the need to make fuller use of the entire set ofmeasures envisaged in the Charter. Special emphasis shouldbe put on the prevention of conflicts by peaceful means which  if applied in a consistent and efficient manner would produce substantial results. This can be explicitlyillustrated by recent positive developments in the MiddleEast peace process  which Belarus welcomes and supports.I avail myself of this opportunity to reaffirm the readinessof the Government of the Republic of Belarus tocontribute actively to the resolution of conflicts in post-Soviet countries and  in particular  to host in our capital Minsk  the international conference on NagornyKarabakh.More than half a century ago  sovereign States including Belarus  founded the United Nations to“reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights  in thedignity and worth of the human person”. To uphold itslegal and moral commitments the international communitycannot and must not remain inactive in the face of grossand systematic violations of human rights. Genocide inRwanda  events in East Timor — these and similaroccurrences must lead to immediate and decisive actionon the part of the United Nations. But such action mustbe taken in full compliance with the decisions of theSecurity Council.At the same time it is obvious that the sacredprinciple of the protection of human rights  onceinterpreted selectively  becomes meaningless.Unfortunately  double standards in the interpretation ofthe notion of human rights are still applied all too oftenin international politics. It would be dangerouslymisleading to assume that human rights can be protectedby means that ignore the principle of the sovereignequality of States. Disregarding State interests in thepursuit of individual values can cause unpredictableconsequences.Globalization is creating a situation in which theprosperity and even more the underdevelopment of certainregions  or conflicts in them  directly affect the globalstate of affairs. From this perspective  the developmentsof the twenty-first century will be largely influenced byprocesses taking shape in the enormous Eurasian region of which my country is an integral part.Multi-ethnic and multi-confessional Belarus has thank God  avoided the religious and ethnic conflicts thathave been so characteristic of many post-Soviet countries.Duly organized governmental management and lawenforcement systems have allowed us to ensure anadequate level of security for our society and people.Situated on the crossroads between the east and the west the north and the south of the continent  Belarus will befurther contributing to international cooperation incombating transborder crime  terrorism and illicit drugtrafficking.4A few days ago Belarus became party to theInternational Convention for the Suppression of TerroristBombings. We also support the idea of holding a UnitedNations conference or a special session of the GeneralAssembly on the suppression of terrorism.Belarus is ready to cooperate most actively with allmembers of the international community to address theseand other global and regional challenges. Openness tomutually beneficial cooperation is probably one of the mainfeatures of Belarus' foreign policy  which sincerely seeks toestablish a network of good neighbourly relationsembracing our country.Although consistent in its principled position on theenlargement of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization(NATO)  Belarus demonstrates good will and actsconstructively to prevent the re-emergence of new dividinglines in Europe. In this context  we support the idea ofadopting  at the Organization for Security and Cooperationin Europe (OSCE) summit in Istanbul  the charter forEuropean security  which is to become a code of behaviourfor all of Europe.Historically and geographically belonging to Europeancivilization  Belarus is seeking to become a full fledgedmember of integration processes on the continent. Therapprochement between Belarus and Russia is in line withprocesses of global development. The consolidation ofefforts by Belarus and Russia  enjoying wide public supportin both countries  allows us to more effectively solveproblems faced by the two States and two peoples.Belarus has become a full fledged member of theNon-Aligned Movement (NAM). We share the values andphilosophy of the Movement and the provisions of theNAM Plan of Action that are consonant with the UnitedNations principles and objectives  as well as with the globalchallenges of establishing a multipolar world order.Regrettably  the world is entering the new centurywith the burden of arms so powerful they can extinguish alllife on the planet. For this reason  disarmament  especiallyin the nuclear sphere  remains among the main priorities ofthe United Nations. A few years ago  Belarus made anhistoric choice by relinquishing the possession of nucleararms inherited from the former Soviet Union. Now  weurge all countries which have not yet become parties to theTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)to join those that have made the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free world their utmost priority. We also stand foran early agreement on the prohibition of the production offissile materials.In conditions in which the nuclear Powers are stillnot ready fully to relinquish the possession of such arms there is a pressing need to withdraw them from as muchof the world as possible  especially from heavilypopulated regions. Proceeding from this  we once againcall on countries of our region to review their attitudestowards the initiative put forward by PresidentLukashenka of Belarus on the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free space in Central and Eastern Europe  asreflected in the relevant resolutions of the United NationsGeneral Assembly. The assumption by countries of ourregion of binding legal commitments not to deploynuclear weapons on their territory would be of paramountimportance to the security of the European family ofnations. I believe that  sooner or later  all our neighbourswill arrive at this obvious conclusion. Since time is of theessence  we propose to begin consultations immediatelywith all interested parties to exchange ideas and bridgepositions on this problem.Other types of weapons of mass destruction are byno means less dangerous. We welcome the appeal voicedfrom this high rostrum to protect our children from thescourge of nuclear  chemical and biological warfare. Webelieve that the international community would be takingthe right step if it were to establish a preventivemechanism to take timely and coordinated measures tocontrol the development and production of new types ofweapons of mass destruction.Proceeding from this  the Belarus delegation at thissession will initiate a draft resolution on the prohibitionof the development and manufacture of new types ofweapons of mass destruction and new systems of suchweapons. Likewise  we support the proposal to adopt aresolution on the consolidation of and respect for theAnti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.As was rightly observed in this Hall  the strengthand effectiveness of the United Nations depend on thesustainable development of its Member States. Havingachieved independence  Belarus has chosen its own modelof economic development which adequately reflects itsnational conditions and capacity. This is a model sociallyoriented market economy. Our objective is not simply theimplementation of reforms for their own sake  but theachievement of a more effective economy. In recentyears  we have been maintaining a positive dynamic ofgross domestic product growth that  in 1998  was up by58 per cent. Belarus is a self-reliant country. Our outstandingdebt is only $133 per capita.An open economy  Belarus exports more than half ofits gross domestic product and is taking energetic measuresto find an appropriate place in the international division oflabour. Our country has all the necessary prerequisites forthat  including extensive technical and scientific potentialand human resources. Economic performance is essentialfor safeguarding social stability. The development ofdemocratic institutions is an integral part of sustainabledevelopment. Mindful of that  the Government of Belarushas initiated a broad dialogue between all political forces inthe country in an effort to jointly analyze avenues for thefurther political development of Belarus at the beginning ofthe twenty-first century. The parliamentary elections in2000 and the presidential elections in 2001 should play animportant role in this process. The Government of Belaruswill make every effort to conduct these electionsdemocratically and freely.Among the important global challenges facing theUnited Nations is the protection of the environment and thealleviation of the negative consequences of natural disastersand technological catastrophes. For more than 13 yearsnow  this has been a matter of survival for the Belarusiannation. The elimination of the consequences of theChernobyl disaster accounts for almost 20 per cent of ourannual budget spending. I take this opportunity to expressmost sincere gratitude to all the States and internationalintergovernmental and non-governmental organizationswhich throughout these years have never been dispassionateabout the tragedy of the Belarusian people. Positivelyassessing the efforts of the United Nations  Belarus todaycalls upon the international community to continuecooperation and strengthen the United Nations role in thisdirection. Together with the Russian Federation andUkraine  Belarus will present a draft resolution on this issueat the current session. We are hopeful that the UnitedNations Member States will render their valuable support.The current session of the General Assembly is animportant stage in preparing for the Millennium Assemblythat should take practical decisions worthy of this forum.The Republic of Belarus has proposed as a subject fordiscussion at the 2000 Assembly the issue of the UnitedNations role in the furtherance of peace and humansustainable development in conditions of globalization.Aware of the historic importance of this event  Belarus willactively contribute to the success of the MillenniumAssembly and Summit and reaffirms its commitment to thegoals and principles of the United Nations Charter."
"22",870,"BLZ",54,1999,"We are fortunate that the greatskills and integrity displayed by His Excellency Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  both as freedom fighter and as ForeignMinister of Namibia  will now be at the disposal of theGeneral Assembly. We desperately need those qualities aswe wrestle with the challenges that now face ourOrganization.We are enriched by the presence of our three newMembers  the Republic of Kiribati  the Republic of Nauruand the Kingdom of Tonga.We look forward to the coming millennium withgreat expectations born out of the many greataccomplishments of this century  not least of which hasbeen the creation and preservation of the United Nations.But we would be deceiving ourselves if we did notrecognize that the world of peace and security envisionedby the drafters of the Charter is as far from achievementas it was at the beginning of this tormented century.This has indeed been a century of extremes. Wehave witnessed marvelous scientific and technologicaladvances that could liberate humankind from the drudgeryand misery that have always been its lot. At the sametime  we have seen more billions spent on means ofdestruction than on the construction of a better life for thebillions who still live in poverty.We have witnessed the spread of democracy aroundthe globe  even as inequality between and within nationsgrows unabated and countless millions of lives arewasted. All too apparent are the tragic victims of theinvisible hand of the market.How much has inequality grown during this century?The 1999 Human Development Report of the UnitedNations Development Programme (UNDP) tells us that theincome gap between the fifth of the world's people livingin the richest countries and the fifth living in the poorestwas 11 to 1 in 1913. This had grown to 30 to 1 by 1960 60 to 1 in 1990  and 74 to 1 in 1997. The report concludesin its “Overview”  at page 2  that“When the market goes too far in dominatingsocial and political outcomes  the opportunities andrewards of globalization spread unequally andinequitably — concentrating power and wealth in aselect group of people  nations and corporations marginalizing the others.”The solution  it posits  is not to stop the expansion ofglobal markets  but to create and enforce the rules forstronger governance  both national and global  to ensurethat globalization works for people  not just for profits. Thiscrying need for good global governance is not beinganswered  and it is one of the most important andfundamental tasks facing the United Nations today.During this century there have been two concertedattempts to collectively provide the framework for a newworld order  following periods of catastrophic humanbehaviour. After the First World War the Versailles Treatyand the Paris Conference created the League of Nations  theInternational Labour Organization (ILO) and certaineconomic arrangements. After the Second World War wehad the United Nations and the Bretton Woods agreements which again created new institutional arrangements forregulating a new world order. One of the results of thatreordering was the ushering in of the era of decolonization whereby dozens of countries have emerged and formed partof the family of nations  bringing our number in the UnitedNations up to 188.Today we have witnessed a real change in the worldorder no less far-reaching and momentous than the firsttwo  with the end of the cold war  the creation of a unipolarworld and the phenomena of globalization and tradeliberalization. And still we have not been able to sittogether and negotiate universally accepted rules andinstitutions that are workable and fair for regulating thisnew order. How can we speak of the victory of democracyin this situation?The institutions that  more than national governments govern the real lives of billions today — the InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF)  the World Bank  the G-7  theOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development(OECD)  the World Trade Organization (WTO) — aredominated by a few rich and powerful countries  andthere is no transparency  no accountability  no effectivemechanism for civil society participation. In short  thereis no good governance.We  the developing countries  are constantly beingurged by the international organizations  by the EuropeanUnion and others  to practise good governance  and arethreatened with sanctions if we do not. For our part  wein Belize and other developing countries accept the needfor good governance and are doing our utmost to achieveit. It is time we ensured that these all-powerfulorganizations themselves practise good governance  abideby a global code of ethics that puts people before profits respect the diversity of our countries and be fullyaccountable and transparent.While we have made important advances inenlarging democracy at the national level  we have failedto do so at the global level. Our only hope lies with areformed United Nations that will ensure that the globalinstitutions that determine the quality of our lives aremade democratic and just.Small countries like Belize are understandablyconcerned about the way in which globalization and tradeliberalization are being mismanaged. Yes  we believe inthe potential benefits of globalization. Yes  we want to beinvolved  but as partners  not as victims of larger  morepowerful economic interests.Belize became independent just 18 years ago. It hasbeen said that we became independent just whenindependence ceased to be meaningful as a result of thepower of international organizations and transnationalcompanies to determine not just international  but alsonational economic and social policies.Let me say this clearly: do not expect any of us whowon our independence after years of struggle — someinvolving armed conflict and the sacrifice of manylives — to simply give it up and accept a new form ofdomination. But what does it mean  especially for smalldeveloping countries  to be independent in today's world?It means that we must find a way to makeinterdependence make independence meaningful.This can best be done through effective regionalorganizations. In our own region  our vision is to worktowards a real integration of the Central American andCaribbean countries  to make the Association ofCaribbean States the means of inserting our countries into2the world economy with a stronger voice to secure fairterms of trade  greater market access and more beneficialinvestments.The much vaunted new financial architecture that weseek to construct must be designed to enhance theindependence of sovereign States. We can only do thisthrough negotiated agreements that are fair  transparent andconsensual and in which developing countries are given areal voice.We are heartened by the words of Mike Moore Director-General of the WTO  who told us  members of theGroup of 77  at Marrakesh that he is totally committed toensuring that the WTO be a family in which every memberhas an equal place at the table and that trade liberalizationbring real benefits to all countries  but especially todeveloping countries.We  the smaller and developing countries  must be thebeneficiaries of unselfish actions on the part of ourdeveloped partners. We are aware that free trade can bekind to the strong and deadly to the weak  and so our callis this: Give us time to adjust and move our economiesforward. Help us to develop our capacities and technologiesto make our people competitive. We are challenged tonarrow the gap between those who earn billions and thosewho work for pennies.If we are to be successful at this  everyone must beincluded. Our political ideologies and differences will haveto be put aside in the interest of the elimination of poverty.But none of this is possible if we do not face up to meetingthe first objective of our institution: the achievement ofworld peace and security.True  since the inception of our Organization there hasnot been another world war  but local and regional conflictshave taken a more vicious toll than the two world warscombined. If we are to prevent these human tragedies  wewill have to move  in the words of our Secretary-General from a culture of reaction to a culture of prevention:preventive diplomacy  preventive disarmament  preventivedeployment.If only we had followed these prescriptions in EastTimor  we could have prevented the large-scale massacresand destruction that were visited on an entire people in thepresence of our United Nations Mission  which had assuredthem that they could exercise their right toself-determination in peace and security. None of us canfeel comfortable with the fact that although internationalagencies in the field had warned of the impendingmassacre for months  nothing was done to prevent it. Westill have the task of ensuring that the people of EastTimor can live in peace and enjoy the benefits of theircourageous decision to be independent  and Belizepledges its unconditional support for any measures takenby our Organization to this end.We do not fail to recognize and applaud thetremendous success of the United Nations in theeradication of colonialism and occupation. How could wefail to do so  when the very existence of Belize as anindependent State is due in no small part to the support ofthe United Nations? How could we fail to do so  when werecall the role of the United Nations in the independenceof Namibia  whose Foreign Minister presides over ourAssembly  or when we recall the work of the FourthCommittee in brokering the independence of so many ofour present members? But the job is not over till it isover  not until all peoples of the world are guaranteedtheir right to self-determination and independence inpeace and security. In this context  we look forward towelcoming Palestine as a full Member of the UnitedNations at the millennium summit and to achieving peaceand security for all the peoples of that region.As we leave this century of unparalleled sufferingand violence  we look forward to creating a better worldin the next. None of us can dare predict what awaits us.On the other hand  we must all commit ourselves to tryto shape the future in ways that redound to the benefit ofall human beings regardless of race  colour  sex nationality  class  religion or political opinions.We will not succeed in this if we do not succeed ineradicating poverty. Poverty  in the words of the Presidentof the World Bank  is much more than a matter ofincome alone: the poor seek the sense of well-beingwhich comes from peace of mind  from good health community and safety  from choice and freedom as wellas a steady source of income.A necessary condition for the elimination of allforms of poverty is the creation of fair rules for trade andinvestment. As my Deputy Prime Minister said at thetwenty-second special session  just recently concluded  theSeattle Round of negotiations must be characterized by awillingness to implement the necessary reforms toameliorate the negative impact of the post-Uruguayarrangements. We — the small  vulnerable  disadvantagedStates — must benefit from trade liberalization along withour developed partners.3Those partners  however  must live up to thecommitments they have made to the world over the pastdecades: it is scandalous that not only has the promise ofdedicating 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product todevelopment assistance not been met  we are getting furtherfrom this goal every day  with barely 0.2 per cent of grossdomestic product now being so dedicated.Effective solidarity between the haves and the havenots is an essential part of the solution to the problems ofmarginalization and poverty. That is why we commend theactions of the Republic of China on Taiwan  which has notbeen reluctant to help less well-endowed countries. Taiwanis a good friend of Belize  and I would like to express hereour deep condolences to the people of Taiwan for the tragicconsequences of the earthquake that struck recently. It isour hope that the United Nations will be able to embracethe Republic of China on Taiwan in the family of nations as part of a peaceful and just solution to the Chinaquestion  one that respects the aspirations and rights of allChinese people.I would like to endorse the support of our Secretary-General for the concept of individual sovereignty in thesense of the right of every individual to control his or herown destiny. This  of course  presupposes a democraticworld  one in which people have the right to participate indecisions that shape their lives. Indeed  such participationdefines the very existence of people; I participate  thereforeI am. But it is tantamount to putting Descartes before thehorse if we do not recognize that people cannot participateeffectively if they do not have access to education  toknowledge  to information. My Government has made theprovision of such access its number one priority  and I urgethe international community to focus its resources onassisting developing countries to empower their peoplesthrough human-resource development programmes.We have squandered billions of dollars and millions oflives in the real or imagined defence of State sovereignty;let us now resolve to dedicate our resources to education the sine qua non for the realization of personal sovereignty.We all want a better  more just  more peaceful and secureworld  and to achieve this we must have a world free of theculture of violence and instant gratification  from thescourge of drug-trafficking: we need a world of toleranceand solidarity. None of this is possible without education.People everywhere  but especially in theunderdeveloped countries  are asking what there is tocelebrate as we enter the new millennium. The least we cando  the least we owe our people  is tell them the truth andface the reality together. Let us not pretend that the futureis bright and untroubled  or that we have the answers toall the problems that plague humanity. Let us insteadresolve to work together to harness the power oftechnology  of science  of the marketplace  so that theyact for instead of against humanity.Other speakers before me have called for a newcentury of human development  for the creation of a newglobal human order. This dream can become reality when at last  the powerful agree to sit down with the rest of usas equals and together design the political  economic andsocial architecture that will ensure global prosperity alongwith global justice. Only then will the world live in peaceand proclaim  in the words of the prophet Isaiah:“And he shall judge among the nations  andshall rebuke many people: and they shall beat theirswords into plowshares  and their spears intopruning-hooks: nation shall not lift up sword againstnation  neither shall they learn war any more.” (TheHoly Bible  Isaiah 2:4)Amen."
"23",917,"BOL",54,1999,"The men of the Andes scrutinized the skies todecipher and predict the future. If they were looking atthe skies today  they might not manage to understand themessage written there. On the one hand  there is thepromise of unlimited prosperity  with man in apparentcontrol of nature and his environment  thanks to theoutstanding strides made in knowledge  the tireless flowof data and financial resources  the almost genetictransformation of the means of transportation andcommunication  the growing empire of freedom and thereaffirmation of democratic values on a global scale.On the other hand  however  the new millennium isarriving with disquieting signs. Financial crises areincreasingly frequent and ever more acute. The gapsbetween the haves and the have-nots are widening.Confusions  fear and uncertainty prevail over a large partof the planet. Thus must one see both sides ofglobalization: one of promise  the other of threat.The effects of the two aspects of the process are feltin Latin America with singular intensity. The crisis of thefinancial markets and the constant decline in commodityprices have struck at the heart of the economies of oursocieties and subjected them to pressure  in some casesintolerable. Nothing seems to be in its place and few dareto anticipate the future.8Nevertheless  the men and women of Latin Americahave a right to keep hoping. My own country maintains avery cautious optimism. Not many years ago  Bolivia feltwith particular intensity the tragedy that is affecting othernations of Latin America. Drug trafficking  the externaldebt  the collapse of mining and the crisis in the politicalsystem all conspired to create a picture of confusion andanguish that seemed to be insurmountable.What we have done since then belongs to history. Ishall summarize it here for no other reason than to shareour experience  because our task  far from over  seems tohave only just begun.Tired of sterile and debilitating political confrontation Bolivians decided to take the road of cooperation anddialogue. The coalition Governments on which the politicalsystem has been based and nurtured since the early 1980sproved the intelligence of an old constitutional norm  butthey also showed that the letter of the law is worthless if itis not steeped in the spirit in which it was written. It wasin the spirit of questing for consensus that the politicalConstitution was reaffirmed  the true independence of theNational Electoral Tribunal was guaranteed and theConstitutional Tribunal  the Judicial Council and the Officeof Ombudsman were established. Lastly  institutions andsocial organizations were incorporated into the discussionsof the major problems affecting the nation in a dialoguethat President Hugo Banzer  at the start of his mandate called on to support the Government’s work with a broadcivic consensus.The first conclusion that can be drawn from this rapidsummary is that the economy cannot be modernized withouta solid base of political reform. Indeed  it was on thatpolitical foundation  on the basis of the will of the peoplerepresented by the parties  that we were able to makestrides in modernizing and opening up the Bolivianeconomy. We controlled inflation. We renegotiated andreduced the external debt burden. We transferred control ofpublic companies to the private sector  and we created theconditions for the sustained development of Bolivia.However  when we seemed to be achieving theimpetus required to launch that development  the Asiancrisis and its effects on our region abruptly slowed downthe rate of our growth  after almost a decade of a modestincrease in per capita income. The storm will pass undoubtedly  but I cannot deny that the legitimateexpectations for development have been affected by thissudden and unexpected return of old fears.We know how Bolivia managed to control itseconomy  and you have already heard the figures thatshow how the reserves grew  the way the fiscal deficitwas reduced and the mechanism that enabled us to gofrom an inflation rate of more than 20 000 per cent peryear in 1984 to 4 per cent in 1998  just to mention themost significant data.But there are other things that are sometimesoverlooked. One is that the process of structuraltransformation requires perseverance and time. Boliviapersevered  perhaps because it had had difficultexperiences. Nevertheless  more than a decade wasnecessary to come out of that emergency situation. Theother element is that what was built in years of sacrificecan be lost in a moment of inattention or rashness.With all the limits and difficulties that were involvedin the transition process that began in the early 1980s  theliving conditions of Bolivians improved significantly  aswe see in the data that was published in the last UnitedNations Human Development Report. Public spending oneducation increased from 2.1 per cent of the grossdomestic product in 1985 to 5.6 per cent in 1997.Illiteracy in young people under 15 years of age waspractically eradicated. Between 1976 and 1997 themortality rate of breast-fed infants dropped from 144 ofevery 1 000 live births to 69  and life expectancy grewfrom 45 to 61 years of age in the same period. However we have to say that the growth rate is still insufficient andunfair.As in other countries  development was focused ona particular segment of Bolivian society. Therefore thefight against poverty is the main task of the Governmentof President Bánzer. Thus the cornerstone of that strategyis the active participation of the very sectors that hadbeen ignored in choosing ways and means through anintelligent and active decentralization mechanism. Thereis full awareness that access to the means of productionshould be added to the effort that has already been madein allocating resources to social  educational and healthpolicies.At the beginning of the 1980s  when we began thedemocratic stage I have just described  illicit drugtrafficking cast a long shadow over development inBolivia. At the critical moment of the collapse of tinmining  the cultivation of coca leaves employed thousands9of families of unemployed workers and became a majorsource of income for the Bolivian economy. Even worse however  was that the risk that drug trafficking wouldinfiltrate the economic and political system became a realpossibility.The situation today is radically different. Bolivia willemerge from this coca-cocaine cycle in the next three years within the timetable President Bánzer set for himself whenhis mandate began in the face of the scepticism of all friends and critics.In August 1997  the land occupied by coca plantationsexceeded 40 000 hectares. In the 25 months of theimplementation of the Dignity Plan  25 000 hectares havebeen removed and the remaining 15 000 will be eliminatedin the time-frame planned  or earlier. The undeniablesuccess of that plan can be explained by the conviction ofthe Bolivian people that the drug-trafficking cancer had tobe eradicated from the body of national society.President Bánzer had the merit of interpreting thatdecision and of making it concrete  making it an irrevocableState policy. He applied it without altering even amillimetre of the structure of democratic institutions andwithout breaking the spirit of civil peace and security whichmy country fortunately enjoys. The occasional moments offriction that arose in the beginning were brought undercontrol  and the police forces were required to carry outtheir tasks with the utmost respect for human rights.The international community has pointed to theBolivian strategy as one of the most successful andpragmatic ones of the continent. I must say  nevertheless that the task has not been completed  and its support isessential to create sources of work and productive and legaldevelopment opportunities for the farmers who are nolonger involved in the cultivation of coca leaves. Only inthat way can we claim victory.The century ends in Latin America with the goodnews of the peace agreement between Ecuador and Peruand the announcement that very soon Chile and Peru willend years of patient work in order to resolve the matterspending from the 1929 treaty. These are very importantevents  to which we must add the treaties through whichArgentina and Chile resolved their disputes along theirextensive border. In that way  the countries of this part ofSouth America altered the legacy of confrontation andconflict that men of other times and circumstances leftbehind.However  there is still an open wound in theconscience of America  the injustice of the landlockedsituation of Bolivia  which has existed for more than acentury. Members know very well how Bolivia lost theextensive coastal strip that it enjoyed when it achievedindependence and the enormous cost that loss representsfor the development of my country. It is  undoubtedly one of the main reasons for Bolivia’s backwardness  as Ipointed out in my message last year with more detail andprecision.I can affirm that my country has made all possibleefforts to find a friendly and peaceful solution to itslandlocked situation. We have left no stone unturned inevery forum in which Bolivia participates. We uphold ourrequest for sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean inirrefutable legal  historical  political and economicarguments.With ever greater dedication and perseverance  mycountry sought contact and direct negotiations with Chilein order to find within dialogue a friendly solution thatwould meet the needs of both countries. In the twentiethcentury alone  we began at least five bilateralnegotiations. Unfortunately  none were successful  forreasons which I do not have to point out now. I mentionthem only to show that this path has been explored withthe support of countries friendly to Chile and Bolivia  andthat Chile formally agreed to grant Bolivia a sovereignoutlet to the Pacific Ocean and that route is known.Now  at the threshold of a new century  Bolivia hasdecided to insist on calling for direct dialogue  a dialoguewhich would encompass all the themes in our relationswith Chile. I trust that very soon we will define  withChancellor Valdés  the terms of that dialogue  which  inmy opinion  should encompass the complete range of ourrelations and identify ways for the economic  cultural andpolitical cooperation which will unite our nations whenBolivia recovers its maritime attribute. The experience ofthe past does not discourage us. New times  new men new realities must bring along with them new solutions.That is our hope.The United Nations system  one of the mostimportant creations of the century  is at the threshold ofa new millennium and is subjected to many tensions. Itsfunction as a channel for official development assistancehas remained constrained by the privatization of financingand technology groups which go from advanced countriesto emerging markets.10Its role as a forum for negotiation and dialoguebetween the North and the South and between developedcountries and developing countries is being disregarded fora new and different structure which revolves aroundessentially technical mechanisms  such as the InternationalMonetary Fund  the World Bank and the World TradeOrganization  in which negotiations are different from whatthey were in the past. Its very role as a collective securitysystem sometimes seems at times eclipsed by the unilateralaction of countries or groups of countries intent on makingtheir agenda prevail over the world mechanism.I mention these changes here simply as an argumentin support of the need to think about the reform of thesystem  as a process of creating it anew  and not simply anattempt to stop the clock because of a nostalgic vision. I amconvinced that this is the view of the statesmen whorepresent the United Nations and whose patient yetpersevering work will bear fruit sooner rather than later.Bolivia  of course  as always  is ready to make its firmcontribution."
"24",964,"BRA",54,1999,"Brazilcongratulates you  Sir  on your election as President ofthe General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session. Yourpersonal record in defence of democracy and humanrights  which was forged in the struggle of the people ofNamibia for liberty and self-determination  offers aninspiring example for our work.4As a sister nation of Uruguay  we take pride in thework done by your predecessor  my friend  Minister DidierOpertti. I would like to express the appreciation andgratitude of the Brazilian Government for his decisive rolein presiding over the fifty-third session.Secretary-General Kofi Annan is equally deserving ofspecial recognition. In these times of far-reaching anduncharted challenges before the international community his sense of proportion and the strength of his sereneleadership have been valuable aids in the search for realisticand innovative solutions. We appreciate and support hisendeavours in the cause of peace  development and justice.The Brazilian Government warmly greets theadmission of Kiribati  Nauru and Tonga  which have justjoined the United Nations family.Year after year  for over half a century  we havegathered here to discuss and debate the issues of our time.Year after year  the representatives of the Member countriesof the United Nations have come to this rostrum to set forththeir vision of global affairs and to provide analysis and topropose solutions.As the requirements of our societies become evergreater over time  there grows a sense of an ever-wideninggulf between our words and our deeds  a distance thatserves only to feed the scepticism of some and thepessimism of others.Whenever an unfolding crisis and its human tragedybreak through international indifference and becomenewsworthy  it is to the United Nations that the publicopinion of our countries looks for meaningful answers.Unfortunately  however  the international communityfeels compelled to act in a coordinated fashion  mobilizingthe necessary resources and political will  only when long-festering problems threaten to get out of hand  making asatisfactory solution all the more difficult.The upshot is a sense of frustration and impatiencetowards the United Nations. This may be because thenecessary initiatives are in the end adopted outside theUnited Nations framework  as was the case in Kosovo. Orit may be because the measures agreed are not up to theconcrete needs  as we have seen in East Timor. Or it mayeven be because the United Nations finds itself once againconfronted  as in Angola  with well-known conflicts ofcatastrophic proportions that the international communityhas failed to address in a timely manner.Why is it that certain predicaments generate intensemobilization of ways and means  but not others? Whydoes human suffering in some parts of the globe fuelgreater indignation than when it takes place elsewhere?The plight of Angola and that of East Timor offer twoglaring examples of what amounts to a clear pattern ofone-sided and unequal attention.In Angola  UNITA’s refusal to abide by the LusakaProtocol and hardened positions threaten to rekindle in allits intensity the same civil war that over a quarter of acentury has caused incalculable suffering to millions inthat country  particularly the defenceless and the deprived.In Angola  which has special bonds with Brazil  theinternational community is squarely faced — despite thelimited international press coverage — with an immensepolitical challenge and a humanitarian disaster ofshocking proportions. Urgent and priority action is calledfor. The Security Council can no longer allow itsresolutions to be blatantly ignored  as has been the case.No less urgent — and in this case the UnitedNations is now actively engaged — is the task of helpingguarantee the right of the East Timorese people to decidetheir own future as an independent nation  a decisionunmistakably voiced in a free ballot. Brazilian society which shares linguistic  cultural and historic ties with theTimorese  joined in their rejoicing when the vote returneda resounding verdict for independence. There wasconsternation in Brazil at the violence against our brothersin East Timor and at the loss of innocent lives thatfollowed.Brazil cannot accept  nor can Brazilian citizensunderstand  that the self-determination of the Timoresepeople is not fully assured. We therefore believe that themultinational force authorized by the Security Council —a force in which Brazil was determined to participatefrom the very outset — will put a stop to the atrocitiescommitted since the popular ballot and will be able tore-establish the necessary conditions for a peacefultransition to independence.Over the past decade  Latin America  long viewed asa land of backwardness and dictatorships  has fashioneda new international image for itself through thetransformations it has undergone. The return todemocracy in our countries has had a decisive role in this as did our important achievements in fostering respect forhuman rights — although much remains to be done. Theadoption of consistent economic policies  in turn  has5made it possible to overcome the endless dilemmas that hadensnared us  and to put an end to the inflationary spiral thathad brought so much uncertainty and injustice to ourcitizens.Let there be no doubt that the difficulties that weexperienced  on and off  throughout 1999 will not cause usto lose faith and relinquish our achievements. For a fewdays  or maybe weeks  at the beginning of the year  Brazilwas dubbed by some “the sick man of Latin America”. Itwas thought that we might slip back into the trap of highinflation  that we would experience deep recession  that wewould once again resort to the panacea of stoking short-term growth and return to the old boom-and-bust cycles ofthe past.Yet we have arrived at the end of the century with aninflation rate under 8 per cent. We fully expect to embarkon a course of sustained annual growth of more than 4 percent and are set to bring to completion a large-scalemodernization programme by means of important reformsin tax  fiscal and social security matters. President FernandoHenrique Cardoso will not flinch in his determination to laythe groundwork for our country to become modern economically fit and dynamic  as well as socially more justand politically mature.With the advent of democracy  Brazil and Argentinahave developed the solid friendship that binds our peoples and have over a short space of time built a lastingmonument to integration. Our bilateral agreements in thefield of nuclear cooperation are exemplary and a stabilizingforce in the region and worldwide. The Southern ConeCommon Market (MERCOSUR) — which our twocountries joined Paraguay and Uruguay in establishing andwith which the democracies of Bolivia and Chile haveassociated themselves — has fundamentally altered theeconomic face of the hemisphere and indeed of the world.Our integration process is not directed against anyone  but on the contrary  seeks to strengthen our historical ties bothwithin and beyond the Americas. Both individually andwithin the framework of MERCOSUR our countries havebecome a powerful force in the drive to set the internationaltrade system on a more open  balanced course  one that nolonger aids and abets protectionist privileges at the expense more often than not  of developing countries.Democracy has made it possible for the countries ofLatin America to provide mutual assistance — withoutundue and unsolicited foreign interference and in a spirit ofcollaboration — whenever there is a jointly perceived threatto the institutional stability of one of them. Thanks todemocracy  the countries of our region have successfullysolved disputes that for long disturbed the harmony of themore peaceful and stable of continents. At the end of lastyear  Ecuador and Peru  with the diplomatic support ofBrazil  Argentina  Chile and the United States  signed inBrasilia the agreements that put an end to their long-running boundary dispute. Thus  despite all manner ofdifficulties  Latin America is transforming itself into atightly knit entity that is politically  economically andsocially integrated.It is in this spirit of integration  and in the abidingawareness that we belong to one family  that Brazil feelsclosely attuned to the various efforts at renewal underway in the region. The elections scheduled for nextOctober in Argentina will no doubt confirm the politicalvitality of this great neighbour of ours and guarantee thenecessary economic conditions for stability andreinvigorated growth. These same favourable expectations we are sure  will be fulfilled at the elections to be held inChile and in Uruguay this year  and in Mexico next year.Their outcome will most certainly underline thedemocratic character of Latin America.The political and economic achievements of Boliviasince the 1980s in overcoming obstacles that 20 years agoseemed insurmountable are a further indication of howmuch our region has changed for the better. Peru as wellhas gained international recognition through itsresounding successes in reversing the adverse economictrends of past decades and in the war against terrorismand drug trafficking. This capacity to overcome obstaclesis equally noticeable in Ecuador  where  with the supportof international financial institutions  political forceswill — through democratic and constitutional channels —undertake the needed reforms to overcome the presentcrisis. Paraguay  in turn  successfully dealt with a delicatepolitical crisis at the beginning of this year and is movingsteadily along the road of democratic institution-buildingand economic development. Brazil  as always  willcontinue to decisively support Paraguay in that endeavour.Guyana provides a further demonstration  not onlyof our commitment to upholding and fostering democraticvalues  but equally of the integrationist spirit that inspiresus. It is our hope that Suriname will join in the effortsand achievements of the region in bringing about thesepositive changes. The transformations that Venezuela isundergoing have drawn great international attention. Thisprocess of change must be respected  for it clearly andlegitimately reflects the Venezuelan people’s desire forrenewal. The expression of this aspiration through6institutional channels is the best guarantee that the changesunder way will stay on the track of respect for the norms rights and duties that define democracy.Brazil is also confident that the Government ofPresident Andrés Pastrana  in Colombia  will persevere inits endeavours to bring peace to this kindred nation. Undueforeign interference would only aggravate an alreadycomplex situation  which it is up to the Colombiansthemselves to overcome.It is on the success of our neighbours  in which wetrust  that hinges the success of the Brazilian people and itsGovernment in solving their own problems and inovercoming their own challenges  which are neither few norsmall.Organized crime and drug trafficking today pose amajor challenge to democratic societies. They clearlyrepresent a serious threat to the security of nationalinstitutions and to citizens directly  who pay with their ownlives the intolerable price for this scourge of our times. Thespiralling stockpile of and trade in small arms is closelylinked to organized crime and drug trafficking. As itscitizens find their lives daily at risk because of contrabandfirearms  Brazil gives the utmost priority to tackling thisquestion. At the regional level we approved the importantInter-American Convention on Transparency inConventional Weapons Acquisitions. We would like thisAssembly to endorse the proposal to hold an internationalconference on illicit arms trafficking in all its aspects.Similarly  Brazil attaches considerable importance to thework being done on a draft convention against transnationalorganized crime.In turn  the continued existence of weapons of massdestruction remains a threat to the security and even thesurvival of humankind.All actions contrary to the aims of thenon-proliferation regime should be firmly condemned bythe international community. At the same time  it behoovesthe nuclear-armed States  as well as the threshold States  tomove towards the complete and irreversible elimination ofnuclear armaments. For this reason  Brazil  Egypt  Ireland Mexico  New Zealand  South Africa and Sweden will onceagain submit  at this session  a draft resolution on a newagenda for nuclear disarmament. The draft resolution which seeks to pave the way for a constructive dialogue onthis issue  is grounded on a realistic and balanced appraisalof the nature of the nuclear disarmament process.Our countries’ democratic institutions and theinternational organizations  particularly the UnitedNations  face fundamental challenges today. Our countriesare confronted daily with economic difficulties and acutesocial grievances  such as poverty and extremes ofinequality  which heighten impatience: impatience witheconomies unable to grow at a rate compatible with fasterimprovement of the well-being of societies; impatience inthe face of vulnerability to crises and to turbulence ininternational markets; and impatience with politicalprocesses that sometimes appear slow to respond to thelegitimate and pressing demands of citizens. It is vital however  that this collective impatience be voiced andguided through democratic channels.Brazil’s commitment to democratic institutions andto the primacy of law also applies to internationalrelations. At the outset of his second term of office  towhich he was elected last October by an absolute majorityof Brazilian voters  President Fernando Henrique Cardosomade it clear that:“The rule of law is the only admissiblefoundation for the international order. Shouldunilateralism and the use of force come to beaccepted as organizing principles of internationalrelations  in the long term it will be more rational toside with the instruments of power politics ratherthan to strive for order and to abide by law. If weare to see a truly new world order emerge  one of itscornerstones must be the acceptance that multilateralinstitutions — not least the Security Council — arethe source of legality and legitimacy for thoseactions that guarantee peace and the peacefulresolution of disputes”.Our societies await  again with increasingimpatience  seeing multilateral organizations  and inparticular the United Nations  show themselves to be upto the challenge of playing a meaningful — in fact crucial — role in establishing an international orderattuned to the shared aspirations and values of humankindas a whole.The road ahead calls for renewal and change. If theGovernments of the world desire a strong and effectiveUnited Nations  they must not only change how theythink and act with respect to this Organization  but theymust also think and act to bring about change in theOrganization. This is what is at stake. This is thechallenge before us."
"25",1008,"BRB",54,1999,"It is my pleasure tocongratulate the President on his election to thepresidency of the fifty-fourth session of the GeneralAssembly. The Barbados delegation shares the confidenceexpressed in his leadership and offers its full cooperationas he presides over our deliberations.Let me also warmly commend his predecessor  myfriend and colleague  Mr. Didier Opertti  Foreign Ministerof Uruguay  for his outstanding stewardship of theAssembly during the last year and for the vision anddirection he gave to the ongoing work of the UnitedNations.We are delighted to welcome to our family ofnations Tonga  Kiribati and Nauru  which are  like25Barbados  small island developing States and members ofthe Commonwealth and also of the African  Caribbean andPacific Group of States. We have long enjoyed goodrelations with our sister Pacific islands and wish to assurethe new Member States of our continued friendship andsolidarity.As we reflect on the twentieth century  we see aperiod remarkable for its contradictions. We see  on the onehand  astounding developments in many fields of humanendeavour and  on the other  national and internationalconflicts  resulting in mass destruction of human life andinfrastructure as well as the almost irreversiblecompromising of the ecological system. It is evident that ifas nations we refuse to use our accumulated knowledge andexperience  these contradictions will be carried well into thetwenty-first century  making it even more difficult for us toface and overcome the challenges that lie ahead.One of the most serious of these challenges is that ofthe concept of globalization. The proponents of thisideology  which embraces trade liberalization and globalgovernance  wish us to believe that it is a natural andlogical development in international relations. It is not. Inmany of its important aspects it is an imposition. One hasonly to examine the bases of the clamour for tradeliberalization to become aware of this.Trade liberalization assumes that small States competewith larger  stronger  more experienced countries on thesame terms  or become mere satellites in a neo-colonialsphere. No nation  large or small  would willingly accept asatellite role. The international community must thereforecome to recognize that within the context of tradeliberalization free trade must import fair trade: trade ingoods and services that have been produced and suppliedunder conditions respectful of the rights and dignity of thelabour force; respectful of the preservation of theenvironment  and guaranteeing fair prices that providereturns to the supplier.Barbados and the Caribbean are confronting seriouschallenges in the effort to remain viable economies astraditional systems of cooperation between individual Statesand groups of nations are supplanted by the modernconcepts of supranational interests and of globalization. Tofully grasp the enormity of the adjustment process nowfacing Caribbean economies one must first appreciate thatthe Caribbean is perhaps the region which under theoriginal post-colonial regime enjoyed the highest level oftrade preferences with Europe.The World Trade Organization (WTO) has evolvedas the dominant forum for the reform of the world tradingsystem  but it is now evident that more democratic participatory and transparent systems are needed toprotect the interests of the smaller and more vulnerablemembers of that Organization. For surely the WTOcannot be meant to operate as a weapon of oppression ina new millennium. Surely it cannot be acceptable in a justworld that the new trade ethic should derive solely fromthe rigid application of technical rules.Our new system is clearly seriously flawed when adispute between two powerful transatlantic partners canbe settled in a political vacuum which totally ignores thevery real and disastrous consequences it will inevitablyunleash on the economies of a fragile group of smallStates. This is certainly not globalization with a humanface.And so it must be appreciated that theinterdependence associated with globalization is atwo-sided coin. Just as it is claimed that the benefits offree trade will be enjoyed by all  so too will we all sufferfrom the repercussions of failed economies  unable tocope with the impact of global trade liberalization.In the Caribbean region  we are haunted by theprospect of failed societies. Prime Minister Arthur ofBarbados is particularly concerned  and has repeatedlywarned of this possibility. Recently he made the followingobservation:“The economic decay in some economies hasbeen so severe and corrosive as to set in train socialand political disorder which  unchecked  will createa new Caribbean species of failed society'.”Indeed  we have already seen how the dislocation of someStates  whether large  or small and marginalized  canimpact negatively on the world's most developedeconomies. When the global system economicallydisenfranchises large numbers of the world's population we should not be surprised that their hopelesscircumstances might propel them towards the underworldof transnational crime.The unique nature and scope of vulnerabilities ofsmall economies cannot be disputed. Barbados stronglyreiterates the call for the recognition and adoption ofvulnerability indices to assist in determining access todevelopment financing.26The United Nations has a critical role to play as thedefender of the right of all States  regardless of size orinfluence  to voice their concerns. As a forum forconstructive consensus-building in an atmosphere of freeand open dialogue the United Nations is even more relevantin an era characterized by complex negotiations andsupranational interests dominated by a powerful few.As a community of nations we have one commonfactor that unquestionably unites us all. We share oneEarth. The need to sustain the Earth's oceans  seas and theenvironment in general is undeniable. Indeed  thisrepresents one of the greatest challenges to globalization.As a small island developing State  Barbados has nurtureda strong commitment to the implementation of practicesthat seek to ensure sustainable development in all aspectsof our lives.The dedication of Barbados to the promotion of globalsustainable development has been affirmed by our activeparticipation in numerous international negotiations devotedto these issues. It is also demonstrated by our vigorousefforts to foster a shared vision to reverse the conventionalwisdom of the past  which sacrificed environmentalconcerns in blind pursuit of that other ideology of economicgrowth. That shared vision will be as relevant in the newcentury as it was when the international communityassembled in Barbados in 1994 for the first United NationsGlobal Conference on the Sustainable Development ofSmall Island Developing States.Barbados is proud  as is the entire region  of theprogress made by the small island developing States infulfilling their commitments under the Barbados Programmeof Action. At the national level  our Government hassuccessfully forged greater links with civil society including the private sector and labour  in the preparationof our environmental policies and action plans.The just-concluded special session to review andappraise the Barbados Programme of Action drew attentiononce more to the serious way in which the small islanddeveloping States have accepted their responsibility tointegrate sustainable development practices into all aspectsof their economic and social activity. We trust that theoutcomes of this review will be fully implemented by theinternational community.The Caribbean Basin States will shortly be addressingin this forum their interest in working towards theinternational designation of the Caribbean Sea as a specialarea in the context of sustainable development. While weacknowledge that there is work still to be done to fullydevelop and implement this concept  we are also firmlyconvinced of the validity of our efforts  which we believewill ultimately lead to an integrated approach to thesustainable management of the Caribbean Sea and to theprotection of its resources.Significant progress has been achieved over the lastdecade to bring peace and stability to the hemisphere ofthe Americas. Barbados subscribes to the philosophy ofinclusion and constructive engagement and stronglybelieves that these must be our guiding principles as westrive to banish the last vestiges of the cold war from ourregion. Like other countries of the Caribbean Community(CARICOM)  we have developed a productive andcooperative relationship with our neighbour Cuba. We areconvinced that Cuba has a significant role to play in ourregion  and we view its reintegration into hemisphericaffairs as an urgent necessity. The continuation of theunilateral economic embargo against Cuba runs contraryto that spirit and is out of tune with the significant effortsof engagement being practiced by the remainingGovernments of this hemisphere. We urge the suspensionof this anachronistic measure.The world still awaits the peace that was promisedwhen the Charter of the United Nations was adopted  andthat was confidently reproclaimed at the end of the coldwar. As a small democratic State  Barbados is ever-conscious of the peaceful climate which it has enjoyedsince independence  in 1966. The political stability ofBarbados and the Caribbean region  which has facilitatedand fostered economic and political development  mustnever be taken for granted. It is a therefore a source ofgreat distress to all peace-loving people that despite allthe wonderful technological and scientific advances wehave made over the centuries of this millennium  we areentering into the third millennium still carrying thebaggage of ancient ethnic and tribal conflicts and ofnationalistic rivalries. Today  crises that threaten the veryexistence of some States remain of deep concern to theinternational community.Barbados shares the profound anguish and sufferingof the people of Kosovo and was appalled by the barbaricslaughter and the massive displacement of innocentpeople and the destabilizing effect this has had onneighbouring States. We support the role that thepeacekeeping forces are playing in restoring order toKosovo and providing the conditions for the return of thedisplaced population to their homes.27We wish to reiterate  together with the members of theCaribbean Community  that military intervention should beauthorized by the United Nations Security Council. As asmall  defenceless State  we are uncomfortable with thenotion that intervention can take place without the priorauthorization of the United Nations Security Council.We welcome the restoration of democracy and thereturn of civilian government to Nigeria and look forwardto its renewed participation in the forthcomingCommonwealth Heads of Government conference.We hope that concerted action will continue amongthe parties involved to implement the Lomé Agreement andto bring a final peace to the suffering people of SierraLeone.We are also heartened by the decision to mobilize aUnited Nations peacekeeping force into East Timor to endthe abominable infringement of the basic human and civilrights of the people of that country. It is intolerable that inthis so-called civilized age people can still find themselvespersecuted and terrorized because they vote according totheir conscience and in keeping with their vision of theirown future.We are following what is taking place in the MiddleEast and hope that the conditions now exist to resolve alloutstanding issues and so bring about a lasting peacethroughout that region.The multifaceted areas of the sustainable developmentprocess demand a holistic approach. No longer can weservice only the economy  the agricultural sector or any onesector at the expense of others. The value of building strongsocial institutions becomes more relevant when placedagainst the backdrop of globalization and its effects.Mechanisms must be put in place to ensure that socialrights are safeguarded.Barbados places strong emphasis on socialdevelopment. We are convinced that more needs to be doneat the international level to ensure that this emphasis ismaintained. It must be understood that economicdevelopment cannot be sustained unless a framework foroverall development is in place. The alleviation of povertyand the promotion of gender equality  democracy and therights of the child are issues that must be simultaneouslyaddressed.The first World Summit for Social Development which was held in 1995  gave an international focus toissues such as poverty eradication  full employment social integration  gender equality and universal access toeducation. Barbados remains committed to themaintenance of a sustainable economic  political andsocial environment that will enable its citizens to achieveadvanced social development. In furtherance of thisobjective  the Government of Barbados has created aMinistry of Social Transformation that will be the mainfocal point for all social and welfare services  withemphasis on poverty alleviation — indeed  eradication —and support for the disadvantaged and the disabled.At the international level  Barbados welcomes andsupports the special session that will take place during thenext year. This will provide an opportunity to review theactions that have been taken to give effect to thedecisions adopted at the World Summit for SocialDevelopment. It is anticipated that this special sessionwill lead to a renewal of international commitment tofulfil the objectives of the 1995 Copenhagen Summit. Thematter takes on greater urgency when it is realized that four years after the United Nations Summit  internationaland economic crises have led to a reversal of the gainsmade in social development.One of the main deterrents to sustainabledevelopment remains the illicit traffic in narcotics  whichis a major concern to the Governments of the Americas.This transnational phenomenon is one of the more adverseconsequences of globalization  which has brought in itswake the associated evils of money laundering  armstrafficking and violent crime. Geography places theCaribbean in the direct path of this phenomenon as atransit point of illegal drugs. It must be borne in mindthat the illegal drug trade undermines democracy and caneventually lead to the destruction of the nation-State. Thiscircumstance has compelled the Caribbean countries togive the highest priority to the development ofcooperative efforts at drug interdiction  demand-reductionand the containment of transnational crime.Barbados currently serves as a focal point in theseregional efforts  which enjoy the support of the EuropeanUnion  the United States of America  Canada and theUnited Nations International Drug Control Programme.We will continue to play an active role in support of allcoordinated efforts at the regional and international levelsto combat the narco-trafficking threat and the dangersposed to the security of the small States of the Caribbean.28Barbados is firmly committed to the United NationsOrganization. We have supported all constructive efforts atreform  but we insist that the Organization can remainviable only if all Members scrupulously honour theirfinancial commitments. We also believe that a healthybalance must be maintained between the United Nationspeacekeeping focus and its developmental mandate. In thisregard  we continue to be concerned at the decliningfunding available to the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme (UNDP) and other United Nations agencies resulting in a diminished capacity on their part to carry outtheir important mandate. We reiterate the importance of thework of these agencies in support of the national efforts ofdeveloping countries to achieve economic and socialprogress.We very much value the work of UNDP and of theUnited Nations system as a whole. As a net contributingcountry  Barbados is eager to enter into a new partnershipwith UNDP that can make a significant contribution to ourefforts to achieve the next critical phase of ourdevelopment  the transition to a globalized economy.In appreciation of the United Nations contributionover the years  the Government of Barbados has agreedto construct a permanent home for all United Nationsoffices located in Bridgetown and servicing the EasternCaribbean. To this end  we expect to commence shortlythe construction of the United Nations common premisesin Bridgetown.The new millennium brings with it a sense of giddyexpectation  a passion for renewal and the tendency tobelieve that things will miraculously change for the betterovernight. We must not delude ourselves into thinkingthat the fifty-fifth  the fifty-sixth or even the sixtiethsession of the General Assembly will take place in anenvironment any less complex and challenging than ourgathering here today. What we do know is that we maynot be expected to complete the task  but then  neither arewe at liberty to abstain from it."
"26",1040,"BRN",54,1999,"Iextend my congratulations to Mr. Gurirab on his electionand my warmest respects to his predecessor  Mr. DidierOpertti. My very best wishes go to them both and to ourfellow Members  together with my great appreciation toSecretary-General Annan for all his work on behalf of theGeneral Assembly during the past year.I would like to offer a special welcome to our newMembers  the Kingdom of Tonga and the Republics ofKiribati and Nauru. They join us at a time when all of us big and small  are feeling what we might call the “cuttingedge” of certain problems. These problems cut verydeeply indeed into the lives of the people we allrepresent. They are the ones the United Nations will beincreasingly called upon to address in the comingdecades.I refer to a host of challenges facing us on the eveof the new millennium  problems touching on all aspectsof human affairs: overpopulation  migration anddiminishing resources; economic and financial problems;social and cultural ones; far-reaching environmental ones;and even transnational criminal ones. These are what Iwould describe as today's problems. I say this becausetoday we are at a special time when the birth of a newcentury is bound to provide renewed hope for the peoplewe represent. This means that every one of us here  fromthe newest Member to the great nations of the SecurityCouncil  has a valued contribution to make to our effortsto meet this Organization's overriding future challenge.This challenge  I feel  amounts to a choice betweentwo basic approaches. On the one hand  we can continueto devote our severely stretched finances to deal withwhat I would respectfully call yesterday's problems. I callthem that because many date back to the founding yearsof the Organization. They are most obvious  of course  inthe Middle East  where a just and lasting settlement forthe Palestinian people is so long overdue. Others are thelingering concerns of the century before that. A few evengo back half a dozen centuries or more.Yet we are still using up many scarce human andmaterial resources sticking temporary patches over theseproblems. Of course  sadly  that is always going to bepart of our work. We have them in every continent  everyregion and subregion  even today in our own part of the34world in South-East Asia. But this should not be the primegoal of the General Assembly or of the Security Council for we have an alternative.This is to give our wholehearted support to theSecretary-General in his efforts to direct us towards thethings the United Nations is equipped to do: identifying thecauses of future division and possibly inevitable conflict;coordinating world efforts to address them; and devisingeffective solutions. I hope we can resolve to choose thislatter course  as it is what the United Nations does best. Itis why  if anyone should ask: “Is the world a better placefor its people than it was over 50 years ago?”  we cananswer with conviction: “Yes”. And if asked why  we cansay  equally surely: “Because this Organization exists”.This has been well illustrated over the last few years.The United Nations has demonstrated great compassion forthe people of the world. Together with various non-governmental bodies  it has resolutely sought to directMembers' attention to the major problems we will face inthe next century.This is preventive diplomacy at the highest level. It iswhat we are trying our best to do in our own region inpolitical and security matters through the Regional Forumof the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)and  in economic affairs  with our partners in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (APEC). TheSecretary-General and his staff are therefore to becommended for their efforts to conduct it on the widerinternational stage in spite of all their financial constraints.I believe that this aspect of our work is the reasonwhy the United Nations has survived and  in fact  grown inmembership. It is why our people still look up to this bodyin their hopes for the future. However  if we are to continueto enjoy such esteem  it is most important for the UnitedNations to strengthen its role. The way to do this is clear.We must press ahead with plans for reform.With this in mind  I am very pleased that some of theSecretary-General's reform measures have been successfullyimplemented. Certainly  a few complex issues  such as thereform of the Security Council  remain unresolved  but Ihope these matters can be completed quickly. It is a crucialtest of our ability to proceed with reform and we verymuch welcome the efforts of all who have been activelyworking to achieve progress in this matter. What is calledfor  as always  is enormous political will on all our partsand a determination to work together. We dearly hope thatthis will be the hallmark of our millennium celebrations.Today's world  of course  tests every concept ofinternational cooperation. In South-East Asia  we havefound this out the hard way. In doing so  we have learnedmany lessons from the economic crisis which struck ourregion two years ago. Perhaps the most important is apowerful human one. This is the need to work together asneighbours and partners  to appreciate each other'sconcerns and to do what we can to help each other. Inshort  we have learned about the vital need forcooperation in the hard  practical terms of today'scompetitive  globalized world.At the same time  we have begun to recognize whatwe need from this Organization and how important it isfor our people. Basically  it is to this body that we lookto stimulate our awareness of what will be required if weare to meet the challenges of the new centurysuccessfully. That is why we very much appreciate theprogrammes which have been set up this year and willbegin over the next five years to do just this. We offerthem our full support  whether it be on global matters  asin the recent International Conference on Population andDevelopment; on special concerns  such as this month'sspecial session on sustainable development in small islanddeveloping States; on such basic human concerns as theproblems faced by older persons  women and children; onsuch human needs as proper food and shelter; or merelyon the chance for our people to lead a peaceful and non-violent life in a decent environment.We are gradually beginning  therefore  to identify thekind of relationship we wish to have with thisOrganization. It is one in which the world body as awhole assumes the role performed so well by its manyworkers in the field. It does not try to take on jobs it isnot suited for; rather  it advises  it provokes  it stimulatesand it helps.This  I believe  is the way forward. For this reason I am particularly encouraged by the Secretary-General'splans for next year's millennium summit. I look forwardto hearing him review and maybe more closely define therole of the United Nations. I hope it will be along thelines I have mentioned  addressing today's problems andsuggesting tomorrow's solutions. On that note  Mr.President  may I assure you and the Secretary-General ofour support in all your efforts on our behalf."
"27",1082,"BTN",54,1999,"Allow me to congratulate youmost warmly  Sir  on your assumption of the presidency ofthe General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session. Mydelegation is confident that with your vast experience youwill steer us through the daunting array of issues beforeus with great skill. I assure you of the full cooperationand support of my delegation.May I take this opportunity to express our gratitudeto His Excellency Mr. Didier Opertti for his leadershipand for his contribution to the work of the fifty-thirdsession of the General Assembly.My delegation takes great pleasure in welcoming theRepublic of Kiribati  the Republic of Nauru and theKingdom of Tonga as they assume their rightful positionsin the comity of nations. It is appropriate that  at this finalsession of the General Assembly of the twentieth century the United Nations family has been expanded by yetanother three Members. We look forward to the valuablecontributions they will make to the Organization  and toworking closely with them on issues of mutual concern.This century has witnessed perhaps the greatestchanges in the annals of civilization  from enormousstrides in science and technology to advances in socialthought and organization. Yet we continue to witness theworst forms of devastation arising from conflict and fromthe buildup of destructive capacity. The United Nationswas born out of the ashes of the Second World War as areflection of the desire and aspiration of all people to livein peace and harmony. At this  the last session of theGeneral Assembly before the end of the millennium  it isincumbent upon us to consider whether the UnitedNations has lived up to the high ideals and expectationsof all its Members.The primary objective and responsibility of theUnited Nations is the maintenance of global peace andharmony on the basis of international law and thesovereign equality of all nations. Even though the UnitedNations moved swiftly to assume this importantresponsibility of maintaining peace and security rightfrom its inception  its effectiveness has not been optimal.The end of the cold war raised new hopes andexpectations  and renewed efforts to exercise thatresponsibility. The task has been complex and difficult and  sometimes  decisive action on some issues has led usto question why there was inaction on others. In our view the primary mechanism for the maintenance of peace andsecurity must make use of early dialogue aimed atpeaceful resolution of differences. The use of force toresolve conflict must be considered with extreme caution;it must be fully within the context of international lawand must enjoy the support of all the members of theinternational community.25The United Nations Charter entrusts responsibility forthe maintenance of international peace and security to theSecurity Council. While the Council must have theflexibility to act promptly  it  or its individual members must not operate in isolation. The Council must beresponsible to the international community at large andmust respond to our collective aspirations for a morerepresentative  relevant and effective Organization.Bhutan associates itself with the position of the Non-Aligned Movement  which maintains that new globalrealities must be reflected through reform of the SecurityCouncil  in terms of both its composition and its workingmethods. The legitimacy of an increased role and voice fordeveloping countries must find expression in an increasedpermanent representation on the Council. We trust thatdeliberations on this matter will proceed within theestablished framework of General Assembly mechanisms with the involvement of all Member States and withcontinued transparency.The threat to international peace and security posed bythe abundance of weapons of mass destruction as well asconventional arms has not diminished. Progress on nucleardisarmament can take place only if the legitimate securityconcerns of all countries are addressed and if there is a firmcommitment to the eventual elimination of all suchweapons. Equal attention  we believe  must be given also tothe regulation of global trade in conventional weapons andsmall arms.Terrorism continues to jeopardize and underminehuman rights  fundamental freedoms and security in agrowing number of countries and situations. There is anurgent need to accord greater priority to the elaboration ofa comprehensive convention on international terrorism. Theglobal community must enhance cooperation to prevent combat and eliminate this scourge.Globalization offers unprecedented opportunities forsustained economic development. Paradoxically  the rapidprocesses of change and adjustment have been accompaniedby intensified poverty  unemployment and socialdisorientation. Fears that current patterns of market-drivenglobalization may even give rise to further marginalizationof developing countries are not altogether unfounded. Allthese clearly indicate that there is an acute need for balancein order to forge a middle path for the process ofglobalization.My country welcomes the decision taken at theCologne Summit in June 1999 by the G-8 aimed atalleviating some of the debt burden of the heavilyindebted poor countries. We are hopeful that the effectiveimplementation of this decision will go a long way insupporting national efforts to reduce the debt burden ofthese countries to more serviceable levels and open forthem the opportunities for real and sustained economicgrowth.While we commend our development partners thathave reached or surpassed agreed official developmentassistance targets  we regret that with a few exceptions the long-standing commitment to United Nations targetsfor official development assistance remains largely anunfulfilled goal. In this regard  Bhutan joins otherdeveloping countries in underlining the importance of theconvening of a high-level conference on the financing ofdevelopment within the framework of the United Nations.Bhutan recognizes that all parties must exert equal effortsin order to foster a successful development partnership but it is increasingly concerned by the growingmarginalization of least developed countries in globaltrade  whose share remains below 0.4 per cent. While theleast developed countries have taken steps towardseconomic liberalization and institutional reform  theirsmooth integration into the global economy must befacilitated through preferential access to markets andassistance for institutional capacity-building andinfrastructure development. In this regard  we areheartened by the general sensitivity and responsivenessshown by the World Trade Organization.As a founding member of the South AsianAssociation for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) family Bhutan is committed to further strengthening cooperationin South Asia  where infinitely vast resources andpotentials remain locked and unrealized. We have madeprogress in fostering cooperation  particularly in the socialfields  and in strengthening cooperation in the coreeconomic areas. Of special significance is ourcommitment to establish the necessary mechanisms toenable SAARC to move from a preferential tradearrangement to a free trade arrangement within areasonable period of time.One of the overriding responsibilities of the UnitedNations is in the field of socio-economic development.Over the decades  the contributions of the various UnitedNations agencies have been remarkable  although thesehave sometimes been taken for granted. It is importantthat we recognize their contributions and provide themwith the necessary resources to effectively continue theirsupport to developing countries.26Bhutan has always pursued a people-centreddevelopment process. Our national development strategieshave always aimed at enhancing gross national happinessrather than merely increasing gross national product. Thisconcept calls not only for economic development in theconventional sense  but for enriching the lives of the peoplein a holistic way  through the preservation and promotionof our rich cultural heritage  through the protection andconservation of our fragile mountain ecosystem and throughthe strengthening and exercise of good governance.In pursuit of an equitable balance between materialand spiritual development  the Government has consistentlyallocated a large share of resources over the last fourdecades for social services. Almost 30 per cent of thepresent national budget is allocated to the provision of freebasic education and primary health care. To these areattributable a substantial jump in our literacy rate — andthe advance in enrolment rate — and an increase in lifeexpectancy for the average Bhutanese by 20 years in twodecades.We have realized that balanced development is notalways the easiest route to take. It entails considerablecontemplation  a cautious approach and a deliberatechoice of a measured path. It requires patience  restraintand; indeed  courage: patience to persevere over manyyears in order to reap long-term benefits  restraint andself-control to refrain from fleeting compulsions andcourage to sacrifice immediate gains in favour of long-term sustainable development.I would like to seize this opportunity to thank themany worthy members of this Assembly and the variousUnited Nations and other multilateral agencies for theirinspiration  cooperation and meaningful support in mycountry's endeavour to ensure progress and sustainedgross national happiness."
"28",1123,"BWA",54,1999,"I take great pleasure incongratulating you most warmly  my dear brother  on yourelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at itsfifty-fourth session. Your great country  Namibia  and itsillustrious leader  President Sam Nujoma  have been verygenerous indeed in allowing us to benefit from theprodigious knowledge and experience you command on theworkings of the United Nations  having spent the better partof your life in this institution. We are confident that underyour seasoned leadership the fifty-fourth session will serveas a fitting climax to a tragic century. My delegation isready to render you all the support you will no doubt needin carrying out your onerous responsibilities.Your predecessor  Mr. Didier Opertti  has earned ouradmiration and gratitude by the exemplary manner in whichhe presided over the fifty-third session of the GeneralAssembly. We thank his country  Uruguay  for allowing usto tap his wisdom and benefit from his leadership skills.Our Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  and his teamin the Secretariat have continued to discharge theirresponsibilities with unstinting devotion. The problems theyhave to deal with  and/or seek solutions to  are enormous and yet they remain undaunted. We owe them an immensedebt of gratitude.We warmly welcome in our midst three new membersof our Organization  Nauru  Kiribati and Tonga. We wishthem the best and assure them of our friendship andsolidarity.Despite the many horrors of the twilight of thisturbulent century — the civil wars  the rampant terrorismin many places and other acts of savagery committedagainst millions of our fellow human beings all over theworld — we have made commendable progress in thepast few years in the maintenance of global peace andsecurity and the consolidation of freedom and democracy.An increasing number of the world's nations haveorganized successful elections in the past few years  manywith the help of the United Nations. In two weeks’ time my own country  Botswana  will for the seventhsuccessive time in a generation afford its citizens anotheropportunity to exercise their democratic right to choosetheir leaders.Political pluralism may not have taken root in all thecorners of the globe  but it has undoubtedly enthralled theimagination of all peoples yearning for freedom. It hasbecome the weapon of choice  a powerful one at that against tyranny. Democracy is  of course  not necessarilya foolproof panacea against all the societal imperfectionsthat are our natural inheritance as human beings  but webelieve that only in societies where the rights of allcitizens  their fundamental freedoms  their beliefs  theirculture  are protected and allowed the fullest expressionpossible under the law  can peace prevail. Peace is aprerequisite for development  for sustainable development.At independence in 1966 Botswana was regarded and rightly so  as an abject basket case  the poorest of thepoor of the emerging African nations. Our desire to befree in those inauspicious economic and politicalcircumstances was derided by those who did not wish uswell as nothing more than a suicidal wish.Today  a mere generation later  my country pridesitself on having one of the fastest growing economies inthe world  thanks to the peace and stability we haveenjoyed since independence and the wise utilization of thefew resources with which our desert- scarred and drought-prone country is  thankfully  endowed.Democracy has been a way of life and second natureto Botswana. We attribute our peace and stability to it.We cannot  of course  forget the support we were givenby the international community  particularly during theearly years of our independence.This is why we welcome the end  at long last  ofmilitary rule in Nigeria  a country whose importance toour continent and to the world at large cannot be gainsaid.A vibrant democracy in Nigeria will have a powerfuleffect not only on the west African region  but also on thecontinent as a whole.5We pledge our support to our Nigerian brothers andsisters in their struggle to nurture their democracy and toreconstruct their economy as well as to rehabilitate theirinstitutions. We reiterate our aversion to coups and militaryrule  and laud the Organization of African Unity (OAU)Algiers decision to the effect that from now on those whooverthrow Governments by means other than democraticelections will face isolation by our African community.We welcome the signing in Togo recently of a peaceagreement between the democratically elected Governmentof Sierra Leone and the rebels. We understand fully thecircumstances which compelled President Kabbah to signthis peace agreement. We hope the agreement will bringpeace to Sierra Leone. We urge the internationalcommunity to contribute generously to the rehabilitationand reconstruction of that devastated country.The Great Lakes region in Central Africa remainsunstable  despite the signing recently of an Agreement toend the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.The signing of the Agreement by its Government and itsSouthern African Development Community (SADC) alliesand the rebels is the first step in a difficult journey to peacein Central Africa.The Agreement will  however  amount to nothingwithout the full support of the international community  inparticular that of the United Nations. We therefore urge theSecurity Council  in collaboration with the Organization ofAfrican Unity (OAU)  to become actively involved in thefull implementation of the Lusaka Agreement. Time is ofthe essence.The case of Angola is a very sad one. The departureof the United Nations from that war-ravaged country hasleft a void  which has abetted one of the deadliest conflictsthat has ever afflicted Africa. In the absence of the UnitedNations Angola Verification Mission  it is not possible toassess accurately the magnitude of the slaughter  thestarvation and the general mayhem caused by disease andlandmines in Angola. Nevertheless  we call upon theinternational community to intensify its efforts to end thetragedy  and we firmly believe that the tragedy can beended only by the full implementation of the LusakaProtocol.We further call upon those among us who continue togive Savimbi’s rebellion sustenance to cease doing so. Wemust all cooperate in ensuring that sanctions imposedagainst UNITA are effective.We welcome  in this regard  the Security Council’srecent establishment of panels to investigate violations ofthe sanctions imposed against UNITA and to findeffective ways of tightening them. It is our fervent hopethat the panels will not only be able to reveal theidentities of UNITA’s merchants of death  but will alsoadvise on how such violators of United Nations sanctionscould be deterred from defying the will of theinternational community.The bloody war that has been raging between theEast African neighbours of Eritrea and Ethiopia may beexperiencing a lull as we meet here  but the fact  in ourview  continues to be that this terrible war does not makesense. It is a war of brothers who  more than anyone else should have found it easy to sit down to discuss whateverdifferences might have arisen between them. We urge ourtwo fellow African countries to embrace each other underthe OAU-brokered peace agreement and to make peace.The question of Western Sahara has been on ouragenda for too long. We urge the parties to redouble theirefforts to conclude the identification process so that areferendum can be held to decide the future of WesternSahara once and for all  as called for by the OAU summitin Algiers.The decision by Indonesia last year to allow thepeople of East Timor to decide their future as they saw fitwas hailed by my country — and  I am sure  by manyothers across the globe — as a momentous and wise one.We lavished praise on Indonesia for this decision  fullyconscious of the fact that it could not have been an easyone to make.The decision was quickly followed by the equallymomentous Agreement signed in May this year betweenthe Governments of Indonesia and Portugal  on one hand and the United Nations  on the other  by which the peopleof East Timor were to decide their future through areferendum. We were therefore disappointed  to put it asmildly as I can  by the tragic events that followed theholding of the referendum. The unleashing of militias onan innocent population — which had  with so muchdignity and calm  voted in a referendum  as invited to doby Indonesia and the United Nations — deeplydisappointed Indonesia’s friends  including my owncountry. The destruction of Dili  the capital of EastTimor  and its environs by the militias ennobled no one including Indonesia  and deserves our censure.6Now that the East Timorese have unequivocally statedtheir preference  which is independence  they should beafforded all the assistance they need to fulfil their nationalaspirations without hindrance. Relations between the soon-to-be independent State of East Timor and the Republic ofIndonesia should be cordial  and it is our hope that this willbe the case.The resuscitation of the Wye River Memorandum andits implementation recently have given a needed fillip to thepeace process between the Israelis and the Palestinians.This gives us hope for the final phase of the negotiationsthat have just begun. We urge the Israeli authorities and thePalestinians to persevere in the quest for peace in theMiddle East.In the past few years we have witnessed aproliferation of summits and major conferences aimed atbuilding a consensus on issues as diverse as women anddevelopment  youth  the environment  human rights population and social development  human settlements education and health. We have also convened conferencesto address the dangers of weapons of mass destruction andto intensify the campaign against landmines. If summitryand conferences alone were the solution to the world’s ills our planet would by now have become a wonderful placeto live. But this is not at all the case.The cold war may have ended  but the old danger orthreat posed to the security of humankind by weapons ofmass destruction remains. This is  as always  exacerbatedby the build-up of conventional weapons beyond thelegitimate requirements of self-defence. Once again we urgethose concerned to show political will and commitment bytaking progressive measures to reduce nuclear weaponsglobally  with the ultimate goal of eliminating them.The adoption by the OAU of the Pelindaba Treaty andthe establishment of the African Nuclear-Weapon-FreeZone has demonstrated Africa’s commitment to an earlyconclusion of a legally binding instrument to avert thedangers posed by nuclear weapons. We will continue towork assiduously with our partners in the developing worldto pursue efforts aimed at ridding the southern hemisphereof all weapons of mass destruction  particularly nuclearweapons.Landmines have continued to maim and kill innocentpeople. We must redouble our efforts to ban theirproduction  stockpiling and use. We must all become partyto the 1997 Convention on the Prohibition of the Use Stockpiling  Production and Transfer of Anti-personnelMines and on Their Destruction.The challenges of development have become moreformidable in today’s globalizing world. Increasedintegration of markets and the rapid transfer of technologyand of other innovations  as well as a wide array ofeconomic  social and political relationships  band ournations together and dictate a common destiny for ourpeoples. To survive the global competition  we in thedeveloping world must timeously and adequately respondto the opportunities and challenges facing us. In order todo so we need to vigorously pursue strategies that willincrease trade prospects. We need also to raise theproductivity of our labour force and the quality of ourhuman resources. It is crucial that in our pursuit ofsustainable economic development  the basic tenets ofdemocracy and good governance be upheld at all timesand never be sacrificed.At the Algiers summit of the OAU  our leaders hadsubstantive discussions on how to harness the forces ofglobalization for the benefit of the African region and forthe prosperity of our peoples. They solemnly committedthemselves to striving to ensure that globalization doesnot transform Africa into a marginalized bystander. Werecognize  however  that to move forward  the entireinternational community has to be fully engaged. Thiswould by no means be merely a charitable act  but ratheran investment in global peace and security.The United Nations  as a universal forum  isuniquely placed to promote international cooperation byaddressing the challenges of development in the contextof interdependence. However  this can be achieved onlyif the United Nations is provided adequate financialresources. We note with deep concern that the last fiveyears have seen a steady decline in the resources of theUnited Nations Development Programme  the leadingoperational arm of the United Nations.Far too many of our people live in abject poverty.Far too many die of preventable diseases such astuberculosis and malaria. Unemployment remainspervasive  especially among the young.Africa’s economic recovery and growth potentialcontinue to be frustrated by the mounting foreign debt.Despite the numerous relief efforts  a durable solution tothe problem has remained unattainable. My delegationacknowledges the efforts being made through the HeavilyIndebted Poor Countries Debt (HIPC) Initiative in 1996.7But while the HIPC Initiative can be a catalyst in thesearch for the solution  it cannot be the solution itself. Toreach the heart of the debt problem  it is imperative that thedebtors and the creditors acknowledge the seriousness ofthe problem and work together to strike a compromise thatcould yield long-term results.We appreciate the efforts being made by the BrettonWoods institutions and the donor Governments to addressthe debt problem  particularly the seminar recently held inthe Kenyan capital of Nairobi  chaired by the President ofBotswana  Mr. Festus Mogae  whose results we hope willbe followed up. We still believe  however  that thepermanent solution to Africa’s debt problem should gobeyond the mere rescheduling of the debt-payment periodto outright cancellation and debt forgiveness.The alarming rate of the spread of the HIV/AIDSpandemic is undoubtedly the most worrisome and urgentproblem facing sub-Saharan Africa  Botswana being one ofthe hardest-hit countries. My Government is respondingwith an aggressive national information and educationcampaign to combat this destructive disease. Theachievements made so far in the health sector and theeconomy are in jeopardy.The advancement of women and the elimination of allforms of discrimination and violence against them in manysocieties are yet to be achieved. Women and young girlsare still subjected to all manner of brutalities.The plight of millions of children who are conscriptedinto armies in various parts of the world is an outrage. Theimages of children being conscripted and trained toparticipate in senseless wars caused by the folly of adultsdehumanizes us all. Everything must be done to discouragethis evil practice and to punish those who insist onperpetrating it. The Government of Botswana fully supportsthe work of the Special Representative of GeneralAssembly for Children and Armed Conflict and remainsfully committed to upholding all the international legalinstruments on the rights of children. My delegationattaches great importance to these issues and urges thecommunity of nations here gathered to join their efforts inthe search for solutions to these socio-economic problems.In turning now to the reform of the United Nations  letme briefly say the following: A wise man adapts tocircumstances  as water shapes itself to the vessel thatcontains it. So says a Chinese proverb. That the UnitedNations  particularly its Security Council  needs to adaptitself to the era in which it exists today  I think isaxiomatic. The fact that the Security Council’sundemocratic composition is an insult to theoverwhelming majority of the Members of thisOrganization is also  I think  self-evident and recognizedas such even by those who would  if allowed  keep thisimportant organ as it is.Africa  demands to be properly represented in theSecurity Council in both categories of representation. Wewill never tire of insisting on our demand for threeadditional non-permanent seats and at least two permanentseats.Let me conclude by once again wishing you well Sir  in your tenure of office as President of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-fourth session. We can assure youthat our commitment to the United Nations remains asstrong as ever. This Organization  I am sure we all agree is irreplaceable."
"29",1212,"CAN",54,1999,"Allow me first tocongratulate you  Sir  on your election as President of theGeneral Assembly. Canadians are proud to haveaccompanied you and your people on their journey to jointhe community of nations.On behalf of Canada  allow me also to welcome theRepublic of Kiribati  the Republic of Nauru and theKingdom of Tonga as new Members of the United Nations.Mr. President  your election is a tribute to yourwisdom and your dedication to the goals of the UnitedNations. I am convinced that you will guide us well incarrying out the work that we are gathered here to do onbehalf of all of the world's people.Indeed  it is we the people for whom the UnitedNations was founded and its purposes forged. We thepeople  not we the nation States  or the ministers  or theambassadors  or the Secretariat. Let us recall these linesfrom the United Nations Charter:“We the peoples of the United Nationsdetermined to save succeeding generations from thescourge of war  ... to reaffirm faith in fundamentalhuman rights  ... to establish conditions under whichjustice ... can be maintained  and to promote socialprogress and better standards of life in larger freedom ... have resolved to combine our efforts to accomplishthese aims”.These are noble words and compelling goals. But dothey still ring true  or is there a need for new meaning andnew commitment?How would we the people assess the handiwork of theUnited Nations to date and judge the world scene todaywhen we have seen in the last year alone the brutal ethniccleansing of Kosovo  the slaughter and maiming ofinnocents in Sierra Leone  Angola  both Congos and Sudanand the cruel suppression of the independence agreement inEast Timor? Or when we see kidnapping and terrorismplaguing virtually every region  the growing  powerfulinfluence of the drug-traffickers and criminals  the return ofthe slave merchants and the emergence of modern warlordswho brutalize and exploit communities for economicgain? Or when we are all subject to the darker side ofglobalization  where international commerce brings newbut poorly distributed wealth  where helpless children arerecruited into armies or sold on the internet for exploitivepurposes  where environmental degradation inflicts a highcost on the smallest countries  which can least afford it?Our world on the eve of the millennium isincreasingly shaped by these and a variety of other directthreats to people. If we the peoples were to have thechance to rethink the Preamble to the Charter  we mightwell say that we are determined to save existinggenerations from the grave new risks to their personal andfamily security.It is true that there is another perspective  one thatgives a glimmer of hope. We could point with somesatisfaction to the fact that  through the combined effortsof people working together across borders  there is anemerging sense of accomplishment in responding to thesenew threats to human security.As of today  86 nations have ratified the Conventionon antipersonnel mines  ushering in a legal regime and aplan of action that will save the lives of thousands.Working together last year  120 nations voted infavour of an International Criminal Court  which willestablish individual accountability for crimes againsthumanity.In the field of conflict  the United Nations is nowattempting to rebuild the broken fields of Kosovo after anunprecedented intervention for humanitarian reasons. Andin East Timor  peacekeepers are bringing order to thatlong-troubled land.So we the peoples have not given up in the face ofthe confusion  turmoil and misery which beset our world;and we still search through the corridors of this buildingfor words of cooperation and acts of consensus.(spoke in French)But it is not easy  because many forget that it is wethe peoples  all the world's people  whom we are here toserve  not just their particular national interests. Too manyprotect their prerogatives  engage in exclusive powerpolitics or refuse to pay their bills  thereby paralysing theinstitution and rendering it incapable of meeting thechallenges to our collective well-being.16It is difficult to promote an agenda for the security ofpeople when some stand opposed  on the basis of a desireto protect at all costs the sovereignty of the State. Ofcourse  State sovereignty remains a fundamental tenet ofpeace and security; but it is not absolute  and it is not ashield behind which the most egregious violations of humanrights and fundamental freedoms can be hidden.It is time  therefore  for we the peoples represented inthis Assembly to reassess our influence and make ourvoices heard.(spoke in English)There is a new road map to lead the way. Last weekthe Secretary-General tabled a report on the protection ofcivilians in armed conflict (S/1999/957) in which hecaptures many of today's challenges and sets out 40recommendations for action.The heaviest burden falls on the Security Council. Thesearch for global peace increasingly turns on issues ofpersonal safety. Modern conflict takes a huge disproportionate toll on civilians. In this world  theprotection of civilians must be central to the Council'swork. It must provide the subtext for our future collectiveaction and the impetus behind our efforts to preventconflict  keep the peace  enforce sanctions and support thecollective will of the United Nations.The way ahead is not without obstacles. There arelegitimate questions about the purposes  limits andstandards for Council engagement for humanitarian ends which itself also present difficult contradictions with regardto the principle of non-interference. Clear and consistentcriteria are needed against which the necessity or otherwiseof humanitarian intervention — including enforcement —can be judged and applied. These tests must be verydemanding: the basis must be the existence of fundamentalbreaches of international humanitarian and human rightslaw.The human dimension makes it imperative that theCouncil adapt the blunt instrument of sanctions into atargeted tool so that they hurt where they are supposed tohurt. The Council needs also to show the resolve toimplement sanctions once they are in place. This isCanada's objective as chairman of the Council's Angolasanctions Committee established pursuant to resolution 864(1993) — to develop tougher measures to constrain thetrade in arms and diamonds  thereby making it moredifficult for UNITA to wage war. It is time to tackle thenew war economy in which a direct relationship existsbetween certain businesses  mercenaries and warlords  arelationship that perpetuates misery  conflict and thevictimization of innocent people.A human security agenda highlights the urgent needto face clearly the issue of the Council's representationand its decision-making processes  especially theinappropriate use and persistent threat of the veto whereit can compromise  complicate and slow downdetermined  urgent international action to protect people.The Council needs to come to grips with these challengesif it is to maintain its credibility in the eyes of the peopleit serves. Membership in the Council is a trust  andCouncil members need to demonstrate their capacity tomaintain that trust.The issues raised by the Secretary-General in hisreport on the protection of civilians in armed conflict areissues that plague all peoples. The Secretary-General'sproposals in fact go beyond the purview of just theSecurity Council; the onus for taking action lies with allMember States. For that reason  I strongly urge that theGeneral Assembly should begin consideration of thisreport and move quickly to establish mechanisms to giveeffect to its recommendations  including a system ofreporting to review implementation. Towards this end Canada looks forward to working with the Secretary-General and fellow Member States to establish a “friendsof civilians in armed conflict” group to help guide theseefforts.To protect civilians in armed conflict  the Assemblyhas the means to enable the United Nations to act morequickly; the moral authority to establish universalstandards that hold us all accountable; and the legitimacyto direct efforts into new areas of global endeavour. Theability to respond rapidly when the security of civilians isthreatened is essential. Giving the United Nations a rapidresponse capability — particularly through the creation ofa United Nations headquarters for rapid deployment —would be an important step. How much more effectivecould the United Nations have been in East Timor or inKosovo if such a capability had existed?The civilian side of peace operations — the policeand the judges  the civil servants and the human rightsexperts — is also of growing importance  but insufficientcapacity for rapid deployment is a problem here too.Clearly the “White Helmets” are as critical to buildingpeace as the Blue Helmets  and they deserve no less ofour attention. Those of us who are able might start by17improving our respective national capacity to makecontributions to be put at the service of the United Nations.This is something my Government has begun and isworking to improve. Globally binding humanitarian andhuman rights standards for behaviour and practicalmechanisms to hold transgressors accountable would alsoadvance the security of people subjected to the horrors ofarmed conflict.The adoption of the Statute of the InternationalCriminal Court was a qualitative step forward. It will helpto end the culture of impunity and protect all people againstthe most egregious violations of humanitarian law. TheAssembly's priority now should be to bring the Court tolife. This means continued cooperation from us all inbuilding the technical underpinnings of this Court. It alsomeans ensuring prompt and widespread ratification of theCourt's Statute.Strengthened standards and strategies are neededelsewhere. For example  negotiating the strongest possibleoptional protocol on the involvement of children in armedconflict  which should be accompanied by a comprehensiveaction plan  will help to confront one of the most heinousaspects of modern warfare and other conflict.We agree with the Secretary-General that more mustbe done to protect humanitarian workers who risk theirlives to help the victims of war. That is why Canada willbe seeking an additional protocol to the Convention on theSafety of United Nations and Associated Personnel toprovide legal protection to all personnel working insituations of armed conflict  including a broader range ofnon-governmental organizations and locally employedpersonnel.Finally  the Assembly can direct its efforts towardsmaking the safety of people the emphasis in a wider rangeof global endeavours.(spoke in French)The greatest threat to human safety remains thepossibility of annihilation by nuclear or other weapons ofmass destruction. Yet the non-proliferation regime that wehave painstakingly built over the past 50 years remainsfragile. We should now ensure that the obligations underthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons arerespected  and we should implement the ComprehensiveNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and reduce the risk that nuclearweapons pose to our collective security.Human security is also the impetus behind efforts toaddress the problem of small arms  which kill in conflictzones as well as on neighbourhood streets. This is aglobal challenge that requires a global solution. Weshould therefore convene a conference on the illicit trafficin small arms  with a comprehensive agenda.(spoke in English)Transnational crime  including the illicit drug trade terrorism and human smuggling  is a closely relatedchallenge. It has a direct impact on the safety of all ourpeople. The conclusion of an effective United Nationstransnational organized crime convention and its protocolswould be a start to providing that protection.Taken together  those efforts would be a strongbeginning to orienting the Assembly to meet the realsecurity needs of people today. I must be very blunt:improvement in human security is a necessary conditionfor success in the other important actions that we take toadvance human  economic  aid and trade development.Farmers cannot work fields strewn with mines. Childrencannot learn when they are abused and brutalized by war.Investors will not send money to regions racked byconflict. Societies cannot flourish when resources arepillaged to fuel violence and people are victimized byterror.Ultimately  freedom from fear is intimatelyconnected to the freedom from want. And it is freedomfrom fear for all peoples — which is at the heart of theSecretary-General's report and his recommendations —that provides the United Nations with a clear  definingrole at the century's close. Our collective efforts towardsthat end will give concrete expression to the hopes anddreams of the generation that first made “we the peoples”the basis for this Organization. Next year's MillenniumAssembly and summit offer an opportunity to articulate avision of the United Nations that places the safety ofpeople at the centre of its agenda.The United Nations cannot do it all. The challengesto advancing human safety are complex. Regionalorganizations play an important role. Practical cooperationbetween countries can address specific problems and theparticipation of members of civil society and non-governmental organizations is also imperative. Butsecurity for all of us begins and ends with a strong effective United Nations focused on this goal. We thepeoples should resolve to work together to achieve thisend."
"30",1273,"CHL",54,1999,"I would likefirst of all to express to you  Sir  our warmcongratulations on your election as President of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-fourth session. We join theearlier delegations in wishing you success in theimportant task of guiding our debates.I would like to express to your predecessor  theMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Eastern Republic ofUruguay  Mr. Didier Opertti  our gratitude for hisoutstanding leadership as President of the Assembly at itsfifty-third session.I also wish to convey very special greetings to theSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  and to express ourdeep appreciation for the work that he has done and ourfirm support for his efforts to achieve peace in a year thathas been of critical importance for the United Nations.Chile extends a hearty welcome to the new MemberStates of our Organization  Kiribati  Nauru and the19Kingdom of Tonga  fraternal countries of the Pacificcommunity.Globalization and interdependence require new andstronger international institutions. As the internationalenvironment becomes increasingly complex and difficult the United Nations  with all its limitations  remains the onlyglobal actor capable of addressing not only the problems ofcooperation and global conflict  but also issues that  by theirvery nature  are no longer within the exclusive competenceof States.The expansion of the international agenda and theneed for collective management of the problems ofinterdependence are the impetus for this trend. The issue ofdemocracy  or rather of the lack of democracy  has ceasedto be exclusively a sovereign matter for countries to dealwith; it has become a universal concern that no Governmentcan ignore. Protection of the environment has anindisputable international dimension  inasmuch as issues ofvital importance for our future  such as climate change  thepollution and over-exploitation of the oceans  thedeterioration of the ozone layer and growing desertification all require global remedies. Increasingly strict internationalregimes are being established for the regulation andprohibition of weapons of mass destruction and for theelimination of anti-personnel landmines. The fight againstdrug-trafficking can be truly effective only if it is wagedwithin a framework of close regional and internationalcooperation  based on the principle of shared responsibility.Such moving issues as the treatment of refugees  the fightagainst hunger and major epidemics fall squarely within thescope of multilateral action. The Government of Chileenthusiastically supports this trend towards a newmultilateralism.The crisis in Kosovo revealed one of the most seriousweaknesses and contradictions of the United Nations. Thepolicies of ethnic cleansing supported by the Serbianleadership in that region required an immediate andvigorous response by the international community.It was truly regrettable that our Organization wasprevented from the outset from taking action with thevigour that the situation required. It was also regrettablethat the solution to the crisis was found outside theappropriate framework of United Nations mechanisms andin contravention of the principles of the Charter. There isclearly a responsibility shared by all the permanentmembers of the Security Council for the inadequatefunctioning of the mechanisms of collective security. Onceagain  it was evident that the veto or the threat of its usecan reduce to impotence the world's principal organ ofcollective security. Once again  it was evident that  whenthis occurs  a vacuum is created that can lead to theunilateral use of force without the prior authorization ofthe Security Council.More recently  the United Nations has had to face anew challenge  a fresh humanitarian tragedy that it had tostop at all costs. I refer to the crisis in East Timor. Chilesupported with hope and enthusiasm the holding of thereferendum on 30 August  which was made possible bythe significant agreement reached between Indonesia andPortugal under United Nations auspices.A Chilean delegation of two distinguishedparliamentarians was able to observe the successfulorganization of the electoral process and the admirablework of the United Nations volunteers and staff. Theyalso witnessed the onset of the incidents that culminatedin the massacre of which we are all aware. These acts aretotally unacceptable. We are pleased that the Republic ofIndonesia has requested the intervention of the UnitedNations to put an end to violence on the island. We areencouraged by the fact that  after so many unnecessarydeaths  it has been possible to organize a multinationalforce under the efficient leadership of Australia.I wish to reiterate and reaffirm the commitment ofChile to the peacekeeping operations of the UnitedNations. Without interruption since 1949  my country haslent its cooperation to several of these operations. Today we are expanding our participation in this field and havedecided to contribute to the peacekeeping forces deployedin Kosovo and in East Timor. In February  Chile formallyjoined the reserve forces system. We have alreadyidentified the personnel to be kept at the ready in termsof military units  police monitors and civilian experts.I wish to stress the importance that we attach to theimplementation of the Ottawa Convention on theProhibition of the Use  Stockpiling  Production andTransfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on TheirDestruction  which Chile has signed and for which it iscompleting the formalities required for its approval by ourNational Congress. In keeping with the spirit and purposeof that instrument  I reiterate my country's commitmentnot to produce  export  import or lay any new anti-personnel landmines  as we demonstrated last April in ourofficial declaration of a unilateral moratorium.My country notes with optimism and hope thepositive signs that have recently emerged with regard to20the long-awaited resumption of the peace process betweenIsrael and the Palestinian people. Chile has resolutelysupported this process from the very beginning and notedwith great concern its virtual paralysis. We hope that theIsraelis and the Palestinians alike will have the courage andresolve to opt unambiguously for dialogue and peace.Chile expresses its concern and frustration at theobstacles that continue to block the self-determinationreferendum provided for under the United NationsSettlement Plan for Western Sahara. We hope that the datethat has been set will be honoured so that the Sahraouipeople can have the opportunity to express their preferencein a free  informed and transparent manner.Latin America has continued to make significantcontributions to international peace and stability throughoutthe year. A final settlement has been achieved in the borderconflict between two fraternal peoples on our continent:Ecuador and Peru. As one of the four guarantor countriesof the 1941 treaty by which those two countries are bound Chile is pleased to have contributed to the rapprochementbetween the parties and to have facilitated the dialogue thatled this year to the settlement of their differences and thesigning of a peace agreement.The border between Argentina and Chile is one of thelongest in the world. Numerous disagreements have arisenin the past over its demarcation. Thanks to the political willof the two nations  it has been possible to find solutions toeach one of these problems. I have the deep satisfaction ofannouncing to this Assembly that we have reached asettlement with Argentina on the last remaining borderdispute between our peoples. Our Parliaments have adoptedthe Campo de Hielo Sur agreement and we can nowconcentrate without distraction on the task of developing arelationship of peace  friendship and cooperation and a truestrategic alliance between our two countries.Four years have passed since  on the occasion of thecommemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the UnitedNations  the Member States undertook to intensify effortsto reform and democratize the Organization's structures inorder to equip it to deal with the new and complexchallenges that it faces in a constantly changinginternational environment. We must acknowledge  however that little progress has been made. It has become a truismto point to the changes that have occurred in theinternational system set up after the Second World War.Less frequently mentioned is the fact that the institutionshave not kept pace with these changes.Chile has stressed the need for due importance to begiven to the process of reforming the General Assemblyas the prime deliberative and decision-making body of theentire system. It is only here that all Member States arerepresented on an equal footing.On this occasion  we reaffirm our position that thereform of the Security Council must take into accountsuch criteria and principles as the sovereign equality ofStates  equitable geographic representation and the needto create conditions for a functioning that wouldguarantee greater transparency and democracy in theworking methods and procedures of that body. Thepersistence of the veto — which  moreover  can beexercised without any public justification — represents aserious obstacle to the achievement of substantiveagreements. It is a fact that most of the obstacles to theadmission of new permanent members are directly relatedto the right of veto that accompanies such membership.Clearly  the loosening of regulations that govern thefree circulation across borders of the knowledge  goodsand capital that are characteristic elements ofglobalization has entailed significant benefits for oursocieties. It is also true  however  that globalization hasthrown up new challenges and  in some cases  new risks particularly those associated with capital movement.The international financial crisis of recent years hasdemonstrated our ongoing vulnerability to events that wecannot control and for which we are not entirelyresponsible. Following the near collapse of theinternational financial system  the demand for structuralreform has increased exponentially. Today  while thesituation appears more hopeful  nothing has changed insubstance. The systemic risks remain. We must relaunch with fresh impetus and vigour  the necessary reformprocess to stabilize the international financial system inthe future.Capital flows far exceed the value of world trade. Itis ironic that  while we have devoted so much effort toestablishing new trade regimes throughout the world  solittle has been done in the field of international finance.The point is certainly not to impede the international flowof capital  but to establish an appropriate internationalframework to address the problems to which it may giverise. We cannot continue to be passive spectators asfinancial crises interrupt world growth and limit thedevelopment of our countries.21It is also essential that we put all our energies into thenew round of multilateral trade negotiations that is justbeginning. The multilateral trade system  reflected mostaccurately in the World Trade Organization  must bestrengthened with a view to ensuring sustained andgenuinely equitable growth for all countries. It is essentialthat the new round soon to start in Seattle be balanced soas to reflect the interests of developed and developingcountries alike. We also hope that it will be comprehensivein its thematic coverage. We oppose a limited approach inthe form of sectoral trade negotiations.In the framework of the agendas of United Nationssummits and conferences  the closing decade has witnessedgatherings at the highest level to consider the urgent socialproblems that beset mankind. From Copenhagen to Rio deJaneiro  Beijing to Cairo  Vienna to New York  the UnitedNations has accomplished a superlative task in reviewingproblems and adopting programmes of action in the mostimportant social spheres. In this connection  we attach thegreatest importance to the follow-up and implementation ofagreements emanating from the World Summit for SocialDevelopment. A special session of the General Assembly to be held in Geneva next June  should renew theinternational community's commitment to the process begunin Copenhagen.We welcome the recent Convention of theInternational Labour Organization (ILO) on the prohibitionof the most severe forms of child labour. We are confidentthat that organization  under the leadership of our fellowChilean  Mr. Juan Somav'a  will play an increasinglyrelevant role in the new international social agenda.Violations of the basic rights of individuals can nolonger be considered an exclusively domestic problem of acountry. Protection of these rights is the inescapable task ofthe international community. This has been recognized byChile  which  since regaining democracy in 1990  hasfirmly and sincerely supported the establishment ofeffective universal and regional regimes for the protectionof human rights. We must bear in mind that theinternational regime for the protection of human rights isfragmentary and evolving. It consists of a set of standardsand institutions that are gradually beginning to be appliedwith many gaps and imperfections. It should also be notedthat this regime is being applied within the context of acertain international reality characterized by importantdifferences in the relative power of countries and byselective and sometimes paternalistic practices.Genocide and massive violations of human rights aredestined to fall within the competence of internationaltribunals. Chile welcomes that tendency  but it alsorecognizes that we are now in a transitional stage of theprocess of globalization of justice. In this stage the normsof jurisdictions are not clear and are subject to variousinterpretations  including some that may be arbitrary anderroneous.Chile regained its democracy almost 10 years ago.My Government represents those who fought for nearlytwo decades to restore Chile's tradition of freedom. Oureconomy has experienced remarkable growth during thisperiod. We scrupulously respect human rights. Weparticipate avidly in furthering Latin Americanintegration. We are adhering to the new regimes beingestablished by the international community in very diversespheres.We have also faced the dilemma of administeringjustice with respect to violations of human rights thatoccurred in the past in our country. This choice has led toconsiderable tension. Many countries that began theprocess of transition to democracy in more favourableconditions than Chile's preferred to circumvent suchtensions by refraining from prosecuting very seriouscrimes that occurred during the previous regimes.In these circumstances  what grounds would exist forthe judiciary of a third State to exercise jurisdiction withrespect to acts that are currently the subject ofproceedings in the court of the State in which those actswere committed? There is no denial of justice in Chile.We do not accept impunity for human rights violations.The Government has initiated a broad dialogue to dealwith the consequences of the most serious human rightsviolations that occurred in our country  particularly thetragedy of those who were arrested and disappeared. Atpresent nearly 300 cases relating to human rightsviolations committed during the authoritarian regime thatgoverned our country between 1973 and 1990 are beingtried in Chilean courts. In several cases  the Chileancourts have convicted the accused and have sentencedthem to prison terms that are now being served inpenitentiaries.We would understand if the organized internationalcommunity attempted to administer justice in countries inwhich the rule of law did not prevail or where the mostbasic human rights continued to be trampled. But in ademocratic State the task of administering justice must beundertaken by that State and its institutions.22The Government of Chile considers it highlyundesirable that judges of other countries should claimjurisdiction to intervene directly in that process. This claimto jurisdiction  based on the principle of separation ofpowers  means plainly and simply ignoring the principle ofthe juridical equality of States. Interference in matterswithin our country's jurisdiction is inappropriate andmisplaced and is tantamount to a lack of respect for ourState of law and our democracy. Today this interferenceaffects Chile and other fraternal countries of the SouthernCone of Latin America. Tomorrow it may extend to the restof the international community  leading to juridical chaosand competing judicial claims that will end up damagingthe international relations of many of our countries.But our reaction to these imperfections anddiscriminatory practices is not to seek refuge in outdatedprinciples and notions. On the contrary: we must moveforward towards a clear  orderly and non-discriminatoryregime  such as the one envisaged in the Statute of theInternational Criminal Court. The establishment of apermanent organ designed to exercise criminal jurisdictionover persons accused of any of the crimes over which it hascompetence will have the virtue of discouraging bothimproper internal procedures that guarantee the impunity ofthe perpetrators and attempts by judges in other countriesto make themselves the righteous of the world.I wish to conclude by expressing prudent optimism forthe future of our Organization. Many States and otheractors  such as non-governmental organizations that makeup our increasingly vibrant international civil society  wouldlike to raise the standing of the United Nations. We hopethat the Millennium Assembly  to which we have given allour support  will become the symbol of a renewed andmuch stronger United Nations as it faces the new century."
"31",1319,"CHN",54,1999,"Please allow me to warmly congratulate you  Sir  on yourassumption of the presidency of the General Assembly atthis session. I am confident that with your wisdom andexperience  you will be able to accomplish your loftymission successfully. At the same time  I would like toexpress my appreciation to Mr. Opertti for thecontribution he made as President of the GeneralAssembly at its previous session. I also wish to take thisopportunity to extend my sincere congratulations to theRepublic of Kiribati  the Republic of Nauru and theKingdom of Tonga on their admission to the membershipof the United Nations.The current session of the General Assembly is ofspecial significance  as it is the last one of this century. Areview of the past may help us predict the future. Inretrospect  during the past century humanity  on the onehand  created unprecedented material wealth and cultureand  on the other  suffered from the scourge of two worldwars and the ordeal of the cold war  which lasted foralmost 50 years. Since the end of the cold war  the worldhas been moving towards multipolarity and the overallinternational situation has started to relax. Themaintenance of peace  the pursuit of stability and thepromotion of development have become the commonaspiration and demand of the people of all countries.Nevertheless  the harsh reality suggests that the world isfar from tranquil. The cold-war mentality still lingers on.Hegemonism and power politics have manifestedthemselves in new expressions. Military blocs are beingexpanded and reinforced  and there is an increasingtendency towards military intervention. Triggered byethnic  religious and territorial issues  regional conflictsand disputes continue to emerge one after another. Theconflict between the North and the South has becomeever more acute. The gap between the rich and the poorcontinues to grow. World peace is still elusive  anddevelopment faces even more serious challenges.Hegemonism and power politics are the root causesof the turmoil in today’s world. The outbreak of war inKosovo sounded a resounding alarm. A regional militaryorganization  in the name of humanitarianism and humanrights  bypassed the United Nations to take large-scale15military actions against a sovereign State  thus creating anominous precedent in international relations. This act wasa violation of the United Nations Charter and otheruniversally recognized norms governing internationalrelations. It has eroded the leading role of the UnitedNations in safeguarding world peace and security andgravely undermined the authority of the United NationsSecurity Council. During that war  the Chinese Embassy inthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was bombed  whichcaused heavy casualties and much loss of property. It wasan incident such as has rarely been seen in diplomatichistory  and naturally roused the utmost indignation of theentire Chinese people and the strong condemnation of theinternational community.As a permanent member of the Security Council China has held a clear and consistent position on the issueof Kosovo. We seek no selfish interests and are onlyupholding justice. For the sake of peace  we maintain thatthe Kosovo issue should be resolved through peacefulnegotiations on the basis of respect for the sovereignty andterritorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslaviaand with guarantees of the legitimate rights and interest ofall ethnic groups in Kosovo. We are opposed to the use offorce under any pretext.Mankind is on the threshold of the twenty-firstcentury. Where should the world go? What kind of newinternational political and economic order should beestablished? These are urgent questions facing theGovernments and the peoples of all countries.The world is undergoing significant and profoundchanges. A changed world calls for a corresponding newinternational political and economic order. World peace anddevelopment demand the establishment of a just andreasonable new international order  which is the commonaspiration of the international community. It should bebased on the five principles of peaceful coexistence  thepurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter andother universally recognized principles governinginternational relations. In this connection  I wish tohighlight the following points.The first relates to sovereign equality and non-interference in the internal affairs of others. Such argumentsas human rights taking precedence over sovereignty andhumanitarian intervention seem to be in vogue these days.Some countries have even put such arguments into practice.We believe that it is the sacred duty of all Governments topromote and protect human rights and fundamentalfreedoms  and that all countries have an obligation topromote and protect the human rights and fundamentalfreedoms of their own peoples in accordance with thepurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter andinternational human rights instruments  and in the light oftheir respective national conditions and relevant laws. Butas political systems  levels of economic development history  cultural background and values vary from countryto country  it is only natural that countries should havedifferent interpretations and even diverging views onhuman rights. Countries should engage in dialogue andexchanges on the basis of equality and mutual respect soas to better understand each other  expand commonground and handle their differences properly  rather thanresort to confrontation or interference in the internalaffairs of others under the pretext of human rights.The issue of human rights is  in essence  the internalaffair of a given country  and should be addressed mainlyby the Government of that country through its ownefforts. Ours is a diversified world. Each country has theright to choose its own social system  approach todevelopment and values that are suited to its nationalconditions. The history of China and other developingcountries shows that a country’s sovereignty is theprerequisite for and the basis of the human rights that thepeople of that country can enjoy. When the sovereigntyof a country is put in jeopardy  its human rights canhardly be protected effectively. Sovereign equality  mutualrespect for State sovereignty and non-interference in theinternal affairs of others are the basic principles governinginternational relations today. In spite of the major changesin the post-cold-war international situation  theseprinciples are by no means out of date. Any deviationfrom or violation of these principles would destroy theuniversally recognized norms governing internationalrelations  and would lead to the rule of hegemonism; ifthe notion of “might is right” should prevail  a new gun-boat policy would wreak havoc  the sovereignty andindependence by virtue of which some small and weakcountries protect themselves would be jeopardized andinternational peace and stability would be seriouslyendangered.The Kosovo crisis has proved that to engage in so-called humanitarian intervention in a sovereign State withneither a mandate from the Security Council nor the priorconsent of the country concerned will cause a greaterhumanitarian catastrophe instead of resolving the problem.In view of this  under the current circumstances  theprinciples of respect for State sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of others must be16effectively strengthened rather than weakened in order tomaintain world peace and stability.The second principle is the pacific settlement ofinternational disputes. This principle  initiated by the Haguepeace conference 100 years ago  is now an importantprinciple of the United Nations Charter and a basicprinciple of contemporary international law. History showsthat deviation from this principle over the past century hasled to  “the scourge of war  which twice ... has broughtuntold sorrow to mankind”  and to foreign aggression which has inflicted tremendous suffering on the peoples ofa number of countries. In the current international situation adherence to the principle of the pacific settlement ofinternational disputes is still highly relevant to thecontemporary world.The pacific settlement of international disputes ispredicated on the non-use and non-threat of force ininternational relations. We maintain that handling State-to-State relations with the mentality and modalities of “hot”wars  cold wars  power politics or bloc politics will getnowhere. All international disputes and regional conflictsshould be resolved in a fair and reasonable manner throughpeaceful negotiation and consultation on the basis ofequality  rather than through the arbitrary use or threat offorce based on the power of military superiority. Only inthis way can fundamental solutions to disputes or conflictsbe found without complicating or aggravating them orleaving behind a hidden peril. And only in this way canStates coexist in harmony and achieve commondevelopment. This is the only way to lasting peace andstability in the world. Otherwise  the world will never be atranquil place.The third principle relates to strengthening the role ofthe United Nations and preserving the authority of theSecurity Council. The role of the United Nations isindispensable for the achievement of genuine peace anddevelopment and for the establishment of a just andreasonable new international order. Strengthening the roleof the United Nations is in line with the historical trend; itmeets the needs of the times and conforms to the sharedaspiration of all the world’s peoples. In order to strengthenthe role of the United Nations  efforts should first be madeto uphold the sanctity of the purposes and principles of theCharter. The most important reason why the United Nationshas been able to grow from 51 founding Members to itscurrent size is that it has acted according to these purposesand principles. Those purposes and principles of the Charterof the United Nations have already taken deep root ininternational practice and form a legal basis on whichpeaceful and friendly relations between countries areguided. It is the view of the Chinese Government thatdespite the great changes that have taken place in theinternational situation  the purposes and principles of theUnited Nations Charter are still relevant. We are opposedto any irresponsible interpretation or revision of them with whatever excuse.If the United Nations role is to be strengthened  theauthority of the Security Council must be preserved.According to the provisions of the Charter  the SecurityCouncil shoulders primary responsibility for safeguardinginternational peace and security. It has been proved thatthe role of the Security Council is irreplaceable. Giventhe current circumstances  it is imperative to preserve itsauthority and leading role. Any act to weaken thisauthority or to impose the will of an individual country ora group of countries on the Security Council is verydangerous. Instead of contributing to the maintenance ofpeace  it will further breed power politics andhegemonism and will give rise to endless troubles.If the United Nations role is to be strengthened  it isessential to ensure that all Member States have the rightto equal participation in international affairs  so that theirreasonable propositions will be fully reflected and theirlegitimate rights and interests protected by the UnitedNations. Decisions adopted by the United Nations mustgive expression to the common will of the majority of itsMember States. Any attempt by a few countries or agroup of countries to monopolize world affairs and decidethe destiny of the people of other countries goes againstthe trend of the times and will never succeed.Fourthly  we must foster a new security concept andsafeguard international security. The old security conceptis based on military alliance and arms build-up and doesnot help safeguard international security  still less build alasting peace in the world. In today’s world it isnecessary to foster a new security concept that satisfiesthe needs of the times and to explore new ways ofmaintaining peace and security. The core of the newsecurity concept should be mutual trust  mutual benefit equality and cooperation. The Five Principles of PeacefulCoexistence and the purposes of the United NationsCharter are the political foundation for the maintenance ofinternational security  while mutually beneficialcooperation and common development constitute itseconomic guarantee. Dialogue on an equal footing  fullconsultation and peaceful negotiations are the right wayto maintain international security.17Relaxation in the international situation and thedisarmament process are complementary to each other. It isregrettable  however  that some recent negativedevelopments in the international situation have seriouslyhindered the healthy development of the disarmamentprocess. How to promote the disarmament process  preventan arms race and safeguard international security havebecome pressing concerns for the international community.We are opposed to any attempt  on the basis of excuses thatare not genuine  to seek military strength that goes beyonda country’s legitimate defence needs. We are also opposedto any attempt to restrict and weaken other countries in thename of disarmament and non-proliferation in order to seekabsolute  unilateral security supremacy for one country orgroup of countries. We call on the international communityto take the new security concept as a guideline andwholeheartedly promote the healthy development of thedisarmament process  in the interest of world peace andsecurity.Fifthly  we must reform the international economicsystem and promote the common development of allcountries. The old and irrational economic order hasseriously impeded the sound development of the worldeconomy  further widening the wealth gap between theNorth and the South. The East Asian financial crisis thatbroke out two years ago has affected many countries in theworld. To prevent financial risks and ensure economicsecurity has become an urgent task facing many countries especially the developing countries. The world economy isan interrelated and indivisible whole. All members of theinternational community should take a responsible approachand  in a spirit of risk sharing  strengthen their cooperationand jointly promote a steady growth of the world economy.Therefore  it is necessary to reform the currentinternational economic and financial systems. The UnitedNations and the international financial institutions shouldearnestly construct a framework to prevent and overcomefinancial and other economic risks. Accordingly  thedeveloped countries should take on more obligations. Thedeveloping countries have the right to equal participation inworld economic decision-making and the formulation ofrelevant rules. In the new round of negotiations that willsoon begin in the World Trade Organization  the reasonabledemands of developing countries should be fully reflected.Cooperation should be strengthened on the basis of mutualbenefit. No country should prejudice other countries’economic security and development by virtue of itseconomic  technological and financial advantages. Weshould all oppose trade discrimination  the rich bullying thepoor and the arbitrary resort to economic sanctions or thethreat of sanctions against other countries. The developedand developing countries both have their own advantagesand should learn from each other to make up for theirdeficiencies so as to achieve common sustainabledevelopment.Moreover  on such global issues as the environment population  poverty and debt the developed countriesshould not shirk their responsibility and obligation; rather they should take the lead in providing technological andfinancial assistance to the developing countries. We deemit necessary for the United Nations to hold a specialconference at an appropriate time to discuss theglobalization of the world economy  in order to promoteinternational cooperation in this field and to achievecommon prosperity.The People’s Republic of China will soon celebrateits fiftieth anniversary. For half a century  especially inthe last 21 years of reform and opening-up  earth-shakingchanges have taken place in China  and the Chinesepeople have scored tremendous achievements in socialisteconomic  political and cultural development as well as indiplomatic and other endeavours. Following Hong Kong’sreturn to the motherland the year before last  the ChineseGovernment will soon resume the exercise of sovereigntyover Macao. At present  China enjoys political stability sustained economic growth  national unity  socialtranquillity and progress. Although difficulties and seriouschallenges still lie ahead  we are confident and capable ofovercoming the difficulties  rising to the challenges andforging ahead with every aspect of the socialist cause ofbuilding a strong  prosperous  democratic and culturallyadvanced country.In the face of international vicissitudes  the ChineseGovernment will steadfastly take up economicdevelopment as the central task  resolutely press aheadwith reform and opening up  consistently maintain socialstability and unswervingly pursue an independent foreignpolicy of peace. We are willing to continue to developfriendly relations and cooperation on the basis of the fiveprinciples of peaceful coexistence with all other countriesin the world and to make our due contribution tosafeguarding world peace and promoting commondevelopment.The Chinese Government and people will  as always resolutely safeguard China's sovereignty and territorialintegrity and will continue to advance the great cause ofnational reunification. It is a fact universally recognizedby the international community that there is only one18China in the world  that Taiwan is an inalienable part ofChinese territory and that the Government of the People'sRepublic of China is the sole legitimate governmentrepresenting the whole of China. China's territory andsovereignty are absolutely indivisible. The ultimatereunification of the motherland represents the commonaspiration and firm resolve of all the Chinese people including our compatriots on Taiwan. No force can hold usback in this great cause.The Chinese Government will continue to adhere to itsestablished policy for settling the question of Taiwan. Weare firmly opposed to any efforts to create “independencefor Taiwan”  “two Chinas”  or “one China  one Taiwan”.All moves to divide the motherland are doomed to failure.China's great cause of national reunification can and will beaccomplished.A few days ago a powerful earthquake shook China'sprovince of Taiwan. This earthquake caused heavy loss oflife and property damage for our compatriots in Taiwan.We are extremely concerned about this catastrophe andexpress our sympathy to our compatriots on the island. Wealso express our condolences to the families of the victimsof the earthquake. People on both sides of the strait arebrothers and sisters in one big family. The disaster that hitTaiwan and the pains of our compatriots on the island areshared by the entire Chinese people. We will provide everypossible support and assistance to alleviate the harm causedby the earthquake.I take this opportunity to thank the President of theGeneral Assembly and the international community as awhole for their sympathy  condolences and assistance.The twenty-first century is dawning. The future of theworld is bright  and the new century is bound to be a moresplendid one than this. The Chinese people stand ready towork with the people of other countries for theestablishment of a just and rational new international order for peace and development in the new century  and for theoverall progress of human society."
"32",1353,"CIV",54,1999,"I wish toconvey to my friend Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab how proud andhappy I am to see a son of Africa leading the GeneralAssembly into the new millennium. I congratulate himwarmly. I am certain that his experience  gained as therepresentative of the South-West Africa People’sOrganization to the United Nations and in the course of along diplomatic career  will help him resolve the complexissues facing the Assembly at this session. This is anhonour for him and for the African continent. I wish alsoto convey my congratulations to the other officers of theGeneral Assembly. The President may rest assured that mydelegation is ready to work with him for the success of thework of the Assembly at this session.I wish also to convey to the President of theAssembly at its fifty-third session  His Excellency Mr.Didier Opertti of Uruguay  our thanks for the quality ofthe work carried out under his presidency.I pay heartfelt tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr.Kofi Annan  and reaffirm the appreciation of Côted’Ivoire for the unflagging and able way in which he isfulfilling the mandate entrusted to him.My delegation welcomes the three new Members ofthe Organization: the Republic of Kiribati  the Republicof Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga.On the eve of the new millennium  the Organizationmust adapt to the new shape of international relations inorder to increase its effectiveness in all areas  includingthat of the maintenance of international peace andsecurity. Every passing day reveals the dysfunction ofinternational society. Nearly 10 years after the euphoriaborn of the end of ideological confrontation  we have yetto put in place machinery for political  economic andfinancial controls that could lead to the peaceful worldevoked by the 1945 Charter.On the threshold of the twenty-first century  we areobliged to say that might continues to prevail over right that hotbeds of war continue to proliferate  that individualrights are often flouted  and that a large part of mankindhas only a remote idea of social progress.Yet the 1945 Charter remains timely; all that islacking is the full implementation of the great principlesit articulates. The faith of peoples in the United Nationsremains intact. This obliges us to make a sustained effortto increase its credibility and strengthen its capacity tomeet the challenges it faces.For a number of years the Organization has beenengaged in renewal. Working groups have beenestablished to reform the main structures of the UnitedNations and adapt them better to the new internationalcontext. The Secretary-General himself is involved in thiseffort  in part by initiating reforms within his areas ofresponsibility. It is now up to us  the Member States  towork together to complete the process in the months tocome.We hope that the Millennium Summit planned forSeptember 2000 will launch the United Nations into thetwenty-first century. It is therefore of great urgency thatthe plan to enlarge the Security Council be completed.30There can be no doubt that by increasing the number ofboth permanent and non-permanent members  among whichAfrica will have to have its rightful place  we will also beremedying the lack of political visibility from which theCouncil has been suffering. The Kosovo crisis revealed thenecessity of reaffirming the primacy of the Security Counciland hence that of the United Nations.Confirming the authority of the Security Council mustby no means imply a reduced role for the GeneralAssembly. This body  whose representative nature lends itgreat legitimacy  must be at the heart of the system  withall that this implies for its ability to set the overall courseof the United Nations. But such institutional reform can beeffective only if all States meet their financial obligations.By reiterating the validity of the principles of the Charterat the dawn of a new millennium  we commit ourselves toguaranteeing international peace and security for succeedinggenerations.For the past two years the Organization has beenpaying particular attention to the conflicts besetting Africa.In his report to the Security Council of 13 April 1998(S/1998/318)  the Secretary-General identified the manycauses of these conflicts. He reviewed the ways to promotepeace  the most important of which is a development policythat can eradicate the seeds of violence. For their part African States are making every effort to acquire machineryenabling them to avert conflict situations or  if necessary to act.Convinced that war is not inevitable and that the keysto peace are at hand so long as the political will exists  theAssembly of Heads of State and Government of theOrganization of African Unity (OAU) has unanimouslydeclared the restoration of peace on the continent to be itspriority activity for the years to come.But let us not delude ourselves: that goal will be metonly if the international community  as embodied by theUnited Nations  is mobilized and if it firmly supportsAfrica’s efforts. It is not my intention to disregard all thathas been done by friendly countries — the United States France  the United Kingdom  Japan and Canada  to namebut a few — to explore new ways to promote peace andsecurity in Africa and to strengthen Africa’s capacity in thatregard. Let me recall the establishment in my own country at Zambakro  of a military training centre specializing inpeacekeeping techniques  which is open to all AfricanStates.Nor can I fail to mention the initiatives taken by theUnited Nations where the scourge of war is at its horrificworst  such as in Sierra Leone  or where it wantonly flaysits victims  such as in Guinea-Bissau or in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo. The Ceasefire Agreement for theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  signed at Lusaka on10 July 1999  to which all the factions of the CongoleseRally for Democracy have now subscribed  owes a greatdeal to the perseverance of the Secretary-General and tothe persuasive labours of his Special Envoy.To help our continent escape the spiral of violence the United Nations has acted at every stage of crises combining its efforts with those of the OAU and of otherregional and subregional organizations.Based on its success in the former YugoslavRepublic of Macedonia  the United Nations hasexperimented in the Central African Republic with apreventive peacekeeping mission  which has thus far beenachieving its objectives. The Organization has thusprevented that country from beginning a descent into thehell that the repeated mutinies of 1996 and 1997 seemedto prefigure and the political and social tension thatfollowed. I am particularly pleased to say this because mycountry has sent a 235-member contingent consisting ofa medical unit  an armoured squadron and members of thegeneral staff.Even though it is more complex in terms of themany issues in its subregion  the work of the UnitedNations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara(MINURSO) is also praiseworthy. It has made it possibleto build a momentum for dialogue that will ultimatelyprevail over the passions and divisiveness that have longbeen a source of conflict: this is no mean achievement.Côte d’Ivoire welcomes developments in thesituation in the Middle East  including recent steps takenby the Prime Minister of Israel  Mr. Ehud Barak  and byPresident Yasser Arafat with a view to implementing ajust and fair peace that would protect the inalienablerights of the Palestinian people and Israel’s right toexistence within secure and recognized boundaries.I would be remiss if I did not mention all that hasbeen done to strengthen cooperation in peacekeeping withthe OAU  as well as with the Economic Community ofWest African States and the Southern AfricanDevelopment Community. We must welcome the fact thatthe United Nations seems gradually to be overcoming theSomalia syndrome that led it to reduce its commitments.31The prospect of the Organization’s soon deploying apeacekeeping force of 20 000 for the implementation of theLusaka agreement in the Democratic Republic of the Congois certainly a harbinger of an increased effort of theinternational community to restore peace and security inAfrica. But we should take care that this hope not bedashed  thereby strengthening the feeling  widely held inAfrican public opinion  that our continent is subject todiscriminatory treatment as compared with other regions ofthe world. What was possible in Kosovo should also bepossible in Angola  Congo and Sierra Leone. The referenceto the values of democracy and human rights that served asa catalyst for the large-scale action in Kosovo is equallyapplicable to African populations.I am fully aware of the reluctance of the great Powersto become involved in complex conflicts whose localprotagonists are often difficult to identify and tend tocompete with one another  at very great humanitarian cost.Certainly  political prerequisites  especially in the form ofceasefire agreements  are necessary for the deployment ofpeacekeeping forces  but they are not insurmountable whenthe Security Council makes use of all the resources offeredby the Charter.The breathing of new life into the principle ofpeacekeeping operations through the provision of credibledeterrent elements and resources should not absolve us ofreviewing or of clarifying Chapter VIII on cooperationbetween the United Nations and regional arrangements. Toomany uncertainties remain on the scope and modalities ofsuch cooperation and the role that falls to the SecurityCouncil in this regard.The Kosovo crisis and military intervention under theauspices of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization haveonly increased our doubts and questions in this connection.The promotion of the regional approach to collectivesecurity should in no way serve as a pretext for theSecurity Council’s lack of involvement. By reiterating thevalidity of the principles of the Charter at the dawn of anew millennium  we commit ourselves to establishing betterliving conditions for future generations  including all thechildren of Africa.Africa  of course  has little weight in world economicstatistics  but it does have a potential on which the futureof humankind will largely depend. It must participate fullyin efforts to build a new world financial architecture. It isalso important that  on the eve of major trade negotiationsunder the aegis of the World Trade Organization  theinterests of the developing countries not be sacrificed onthe altar of globalization.I welcome the efforts of the Secretariat to strengthenthe resources available for development and to harmonizethe activities of various United Nations agencies. It wasto that end that a development group was established tobring together the various operational bodies  includingthe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)  theUnited Nations Children’s Fund and the United NationsPopulation Fund. The result has been improvedstreamlining of activities  more consistent management ofaid and simplified procedures for funding projects. Thisrepresents progress that we can only welcome by payinga heartfelt tribute to the coordination of the assistanceprovided by UNDP  particularly by its residentrepresentatives.But this satisfaction cannot calm the anxietyprovoked by the continued decline of official developmentassistance  which the statistics of the past decade show tobe precipitous. Official development assistance has nowfallen to below 0.2 per cent of gross national product.We welcome the initiatives taken last June inCologne at the summit of the G-8. These attest to a desireto increase assistance to developing countries  especiallythrough significant debt alleviation. The cancellation ofpart of the debt of the developing countries  against theprospect of the opportunity for these countries to relaunchtheir investment policies  should allow for harmonizationand coordination of the activities of the majorinternational financial institutions. The multilateralframework will also offer the advantage of avoiding directdealings between a given country and aid providers which experience has often shown to be a source ofmisunderstandings that may hamper the smoothfunctioning of national economies. However  decisionstaken by the richest countries for reducing debt are likelyto create disparities among the countries concerned depending on what category they belong to. Thedefinition of these categories may rely on economiccriteria that  by definition  are extremely inflexible.The question of debt is of grave concern to Africancountries  which  at the Fourth Extraordinary Summit ofthe OAU in Syrte  instructed the current OAU Chairman Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika of Algeria  and President ThaboMbeki of South Africa to negotiate with creditors with aview to achieving a total cancellation of African debt. Wehope that this mission  led by a head of State  will soonachieve success.32At the dawn of the new millennium  it is urgent thatwe define a global development assistance strategy andguarantee its financing. We therefore support the conveningof a world conference on development financing to setprecise objectives and emphasize support for education andsocial projects without  however  neglecting the industrialand agricultural sectors. I would make a solemn appeal toall donor countries to reverse the current trend and toincrease their contributions to the United Nations system ingeneral  and to UNDP in particular  so as to enable them topursue their activities on behalf of our countries. I wouldask these donors to base their actions not on short-termeconomic interests  but on solidarity.By reiterating the validity of the principles of theCharter at the dawn of the new millennium  we commitourselves to restoring dignity to every human being because nothing is lasting if it is not based on mankind.I wish here to express my Government’s satisfactionwith the activities of the United Nations and its twospecialized Programmes  the Joint United NationsProgramme on HIV/AIDS and the United NationsInternational Drug Control Programme  in our countries.The campaigns against these pandemics  especially that ofHIV/AIDS  and endemic diseases  as well as the struggleagainst narcotics and drugs  are designed to end these twoscourges  which directly threaten the individual and upsetsocial stability. At the International Conference onHIV-AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Diseases  held inAbidjan  Côte d’Ivoire  from 7 to 11 December 1997  Côted’Ivoire and France proposed the establishment of asolidarity fund to mobilize the international community. Atthe suggestion of Côte d’Ivoire  this proposal was taken upby the OAU last June in Ouagadougou.The actions undertaken by President Henri KonanBédié  especially to protect and manage forests  developand manage coastal areas  improve the water supply andadopt a water code demonstrate our concern to preservehuman health and to protect the environment.For several years now and in the context of moresustained economic growth  most African States have optedfor political pluralism and the consolidation of the rule oflaw. These are the counterparts of improved economic andfinancial management through internationally recognizedcriteria of good governance. Much remains to be done andthe situation varies from one region to another and evenfrom one country to another. But the progress that has beenachieved should be taken into account in major internationalnegotiations. In particular  we must never lose sight of thefact that violence is born of poverty. Anything that canhelp to eradicate the latter is a source of hope to millionsof men and women.An Africa in peace and committed to the path ofdevelopment is the best guarantee of a better world. ThisAfrica must be united and free of small arms  traffickingand rivalry. It must be united.An Africa at peace and on the road of development is the best guarantee for a better world. Such an Africamust be united and free from arms — particularly smallarms — trafficking and greed. Above all  it must beunited.During the OAU summit in Algiers  Heads of Stateand Government proclaimed their faith in the integrationof the continent enshrined in instruments such as theLagos Plan of Action for the Implementation of theMonrovian Strategy for the Economic Development ofAfrica  the Final Act of Lagos and the Abuja Treatyestablished by the African Economic Community.Africa now realizes that time is not on its side; it isfaced with rapid globalization  whose effects do notalways seem to be in Africa's favour. With thisawareness  the fourth special Summit of OAU Heads ofState and Government  meeting on 9 September 1999 inSirte  Libya  decided to create an African Union and aPan-African Parliament. Next year  another special sessionwill be held  also in Sirte  to adopt the text establishingthe Union. For Africa can continue to exist only if theAfrican Union becomes a true Power.Côte d'Ivoire  keeping faith with this commitment has started taking action to strengthen the existingsubregional integration machinery  within the WestAfrican Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) andthe Economic Community of West African States(ECOWAS). Within WAEMU we have alreadyestablished policies to harmonize tax rates  price statistics with a regional stock market and transferable securities.All these actions by Côte d'Ivoire  instigated byPresident Henri Konan Bédié  have no other purpose thanto contribute to internal peace  peace in Africa and peacebetween Africa and the rest of the world. They aredesigned to buttress greater solidarity and to seek a morejust world  with progress and happiness for each andevery one of us.33The millennium summit will afford world leaders anopportunity to reiterate their commitment to thefundamental principles of the United Nations Charter which urges us to unite our strength to maintaininternational peace and security and to employ internationalmachinery for the promotion of the economic and socialadvancement of all peoples  because the principles set forthin the Charter — dignity  the value of the individual equality including gender equality and equality betweennations — are immutable. They cannot be changed. Theyare absolute. It is up to us to act  and we must do so  foraction is the very essence of politics.Let us therefore work together to make real thesenoble objectives of a better future for us all."
"33",1397,"CMR",54,1999,"We are pleased to note that the annual sessions ofthe General Assembly are increasingly each year not onlya special forum for discussing international affairs  but alsoand in particular an opportunity for the democraticexpression of our shared experience  a time for eachMember State of the Organization to freely state his or herviews.In this context  Cameroon is particularly pleased thatthe presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourthsession has been assumed by a fraternal country  Namibia.We regard it as highly symbolic that this role  at thisdelicate time of a bridge between two centuries and twomillenniums  has been entrusted to you  Mr. Theo-BenGurirab  worthy representative of Namibia  the last State inAfrica to recover its sovereignty. My country fullyassociates itself with the praise addressed to you and weassure you of our full support as you exercise your difficultand lofty duties. I hardly need recall that your country'sattainment of independence  just like the end of apartheidin South Africa  demonstrates what the United Nations andthe international community are capable of.Cameroon wishes also to reiterate its full appreciationto your predecessor  Mr. Didier Opertti  for the skill devotion  effectiveness and open-mindedness hedemonstrated throughout the fifty-third session.Finally  we wish to pay tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for his continuing work toconsolidate peace and combat poverty  and for his specialattention to the problems of the African continent and thepoorest regions or those in crisis. His outstanding report onthe work of the Organization illustrates again this year theintelligence and determination that are his constant guidesas he performs his duties. The work of the Secretary-General  carried out with an acute sense of the commoninterest of all Member States  deserves our support.Cameroon welcomes the new Members of theOrganization: Kiribati  Nauru and Tonga. Their admissionreinforces the universality of our Organization.Despite great progress in many areas  this last decadeof the twentieth century has been marked  and continues tobe marked  by less positive events in the world. More thanever before  therefore  we need to react  act and even actpreventively  constantly and vigorously  in order to rectifyan inappropriate course of events. There are still toomany conflicts. Too much human blood has been shed.Too many men and women have their fundamental rightsand freedoms flouted. There is too much poverty  evendestitution  which is in stark contrast to an unparalleledopulence: Too many inequalities and too muchinterference and domination persist in inter-State relations.This succession of dangers is accentuated by theproblems of epidemics and illiteracy  and recalls the vitalneed for greater solidarity between prosperous countriesand developing countries  given the growing globalizationof economies and the universal need for peace democracy  prosperity  justice  the guarantee offundamental human rights and the effective sovereignty ofStates.Cameroon therefore welcomes recent positive stepson the path to peace. I refer to the Middle East  with thesigning of the Israeli-Palestinian agreement in Egypt. Theresolution of the Kosovo crisis  and particularly theestablishment of an administration guaranteed by ourOrganization  also deserves recognition. Cameroonencourages all actors in the Balkans and the Middle Eastto continue to advance resolutely towards lastingnormalization.We are also very mindful of developments in EastTimor  and we hope very much that wisdom willprevail — that is  that everyone will respect the processinitiated under United Nations auspices.We welcome the holding in Maputo  Mozambique of the First Meeting of the States Parties to the OttawaConvention on the Prohibition of the Use  Stockpiling Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and onTheir Destruction. That meeting made it possible tocontinue the campaign to heighten the internationalcommunity’s awareness of the need to ban these ghastlyweapons for ever. These weapons continue  particularly inAfrica  to indiscriminately mutilate children  women  theelderly  civilians and military personnel every day.Cameroon  in confirmation of its commitment to thisgreat struggle  recently ratified the Convention.We welcome the results achieved in Sierra Leone Guinea-Bissau and Northern Ireland. These and otheradvances cannot  however  make us forget either thedeadly conflicts that continue to destroy lives or thethreats of holocaust that persist because of the lack ofsignificant progress in the field of nuclear disarmament.19In this overall context  which remains full of elements  theproliferation of hotbeds of tension and conflict in Africa particularly in Central Africa  is a major source of concernfor Cameroon. That particular situation deserves moreattention from the international community than everbefore. Unfortunately  as the Secretary-General notes in hisreport  these African crises  no matter how grave  havebasically been ignored.Is it conceivable that Somalia  fragmented anddisorganized  with its helpless  starving  sick people  andnow bereft of any viable state structure  could be purelyand simply forgotten  abandoned and allowed to perish?Could the situation in Somalia today not be the fate ofother countries on our continent and elsewhere? Should theinternational community abdicate its duty of solidarity withand assistance to Western Sahara  to the Sudan or in theconflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea?We deplore the continuing bloody destructive crisis inAngola. That disastrous civil war directly or indirectlydestroys thousands of lives and systematically obliteratesinfrastructure every day; this  too  seems to have beenforgotten by everyone. Since the withdrawal of the UnitedNations Observer Mission in Angola (MONUA)  the Statesmembers of the United Nations Standing AdvisoryCommittee on Security Questions in Central Africa  whichfor a year now has been chaired by Cameroon  is trying todo the impossible in order to prevent Angola frompermanently locking itself up behind fratricidal closed doorsin the face of this kind of widespread indifference.Together with some other regional and internationaldiplomatic actors  the Standing Advisory Committee hasalso made many efforts to try to restore peace in Burundi the Republic of the Congo  the Democratic Republic of theCongo and Rwanda  particularly through the resolutedissemination of a culture of peace.In this respect  Cameroon and all States Members ofthe Committee welcome the peace accords on theDemocratic Republic of the Congo signed in July inLusaka  Zambia. This came as a result of the doggednessand tenacity of African mediators  and it proves  if anyproof is needed  that Africa  with the support of theinternational community  is able to overcome its difficulties.We wish to reiterate the solemn appeal of the StandingAdvisory Committee to all signatories of these accords tosee to it that the peace process is carried through.Cameroon is convinced that their determination toconsolidate peace will be supported by the internationalcommunity  in particular through the speedy and effectiveestablishment of the peacekeeping force that the UnitedNations is planning to deploy in the Democratic Republicof the Congo.No matter what the cost  we must eradicate wars andconflicts in Africa  particularly in Central Africa. Wemust halt the spiral of bloody confrontation and fightingin that subregion  which pits ethnic group blindly againstethnic group  political group against political group. It isnot true that love of and devotion to one’s own people orfaith in one’s own ideals must be proved by one’s hatredtowards others. These grim tragedies  as we know  are notinevitable. Fundamentally  they are the result of practicesto which Africa must put an end; otherwise  the continentwill be for ever left out of humankind’s majestic marchtowards modernity.The diagnosis of the causes of this situation isalready apparent: poverty  destitution  ignorance  theabsence of good governance  the fragility of the nationsand States concerned  and acts of interference of all kindsare at the heart of the problem. Together we can combatthem and overcome them.This is why one of the priorities of Cameroon’sdiplomacy  promoted by President Paul Biya  with the fullendorsement of his peers  is to help guarantee peace security  stability  democracy and prosperity for the 100million women and men of Central Africa. Thisdetermination has guided our action as we head theUnited Nations Standing Advisory Committee on SecurityQuestions in Central Africa.As we prepare to hand over the chairmanship toanother fraternal country  we would like to recall theprogress that member States have made together over thelast 11 months in our quest to strengthen peace  securityand stability in Central Africa. The most significantinitiative undoubtedly was the threefold decision taken atthe meetings in Yaoundé  on 25 February 1999  and inMalabo  on 24 June 1999  by 9 of the 11 heads of Stateof Central Africa  to establish the Council for Peace andSecurity in Central Africa (COPAX); to adopt theYaoundé declaration on peace  security and stability incentral Africa; and to integrate COPAX into the structuresof the Economic Community of Central African States(ECCAS). Through this threefold decision  those heads ofState have given our subregion a politico-diplomaticorgan and ethical framework  as well as a code ofconduct to meet the challenges of prevention management and the lasting settlement of crises and20conflicts. The practical modalities for the functioning ofCOPAX are now being worked out in the secretariat ofECCAS.Since crisis and conflict prevention remain absolutepriorities  the States of Central Africa have continued theirefforts to establish an early warning mechanism. Thisstructure has just acquired premises that serve as itsheadquarters in Libreville  Gabon.A number of other initiatives mark important progressfor the establishment of peace and stability in CentralAfrica.I refer first to the decision taken in June at the Malabosummit by the heads of State of Central Africa to lend theirprestige to the establishment of a subregional centre for thepromotion of human rights and democracy. With thesupport of the United Nations High Commissioner forHuman Rights  this centre will be both an observatory ofrealities and trends and a kind of think tank to producerecommendations on human rights and democracy. I wish on behalf of the peoples of Central Africa  to welcome theencouragement shown by Mrs. Mary Robinson for thisproject  as well as the steps she has taken to follow up onthe resolution adopted on this subject by the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-third session.I also wish to refer to the establishment of a networkof parliamentarians of Central Africa — an initiative thatshould lead to the establishment of a subregional parliamentwhich will be both a democratic forum and a subregionalplatform for cooperation and harmonization of laws dealingwith questions of peace  security and integration.I would also mention the establishment of the CentralAfrican Court of Justice  the seat of which will be inN’Djamena.I would like to refer to the high-level seminar held inYaoundé from 19 to 21 July this year on the report of theSecretary-General on the causes of conflict and thepromotion of durable peace and sustainable development inAfrica  proceeding from the desire and determination of theleaders of Central Africa to build peace and progress in thesubregion. This high-profile meeting — which broughttogether parliamentarians  seasoned experts  civilians andmilitary  men and women with experience representing civilsociety and non-governmental organizations and whosereport was published by the United Nations — made itpossible to identify ways and means for the specificimplementation in Central Africa of the recommendationsof the Secretary-General.The main actions recommended by the seminar tofollow up the very frank diagnosis of the situation seek topromote effectively human rights  participativedemocracy  methods for the peaceful settlement ofdisputes  good governance  transparency  internationalhumanitarian law and accelerated national and regionalintegration.The proliferation and illicit circulation of small armsand light weapons in the region is another major concernfor the member countries of the Committee because theythreaten their stability. A subregional conference will beheld on this subject at the end of October in N’Djamenaunder the aegis of the Committee and with UnitedNations support. It will make it possible for memberStates to assess the scale  causes  mechanisms andconsequences of this phenomenon and to envisagespecific steps to be taken.All of these actions — in particular theestablishment of COPAX  the early warning mechanism the subregional human rights centre  the parliament andthe Central African Court of Justice — are challenges  notmerely for Central Africa itself  but clearly for the entireinternational community. They will be priority areas forfruitful bilateral and multilateral cooperation at thethreshold of the new millennium. That is certainly thewish of the peoples of Central Africa.The design of a subregional policy for peace stability  democracy and development in Central Africa ispartly related to the domestic policy of Cameroon. Thehead of State has always believed that there is no crisisthat cannot be resolved peacefully through dialogue pooling of efforts and especially through respect for thelaw. It is this conviction that prompted Cameroon tostress the search for a settlement through legal means ofthe dispute with the Federal Republic of Nigeria regardingthe land and maritime border.In this year which marks the closing of the UnitedNations Decade of International Law  we must forcefullyreaffirm our total support for the rule of law in inter-Staterelations and the peaceful settlement of disputes  includingthrough jurisdictional means when other mechanisms haveproved to be ineffectual. That is why we urge theinternational community to continue to help our twocountries  Cameroon and Nigeria  to adopt effectivemeasures to strengthen peace and the climate of21confidence which has emerged following the contacts at thehighest level which have taken place this year.Pending the verdict of the International Court ofJustice in The Hague  three of these measures could betaken right now: a solemn declaration of commitment toabide by the Court’s decision  withdrawal of armed forcesfrom the battlefield to positions which they held before theoutbreak of fighting  and the lifting by Nigeria of its recentreservations about the optional clause regarding bindingjurisdiction of the International Court of Justice reservations which negate an international society based onlaw. The positive winds of change now blowing acrossNigeria  following the coming to power of thedemocratically elected civilian regime  give us enormoushope.Through the work it did last year  Cameroon  likeother States in Central Africa  is resolutely committed tosaving succeeding generations from the scourge of war. Butwe did more than that. We also determined for the sake offuture generations to protect the environment and tosafeguard the natural resources. An example of this was thesummit on conservation and sustainable forest developmentorganized last March in Yaoundé in the presence of headsof State and Government of the subregion and adistinguished host  His Royal Highness Prince Philip  theDuke of Edinburgh of the United Kingdom of Great Britainand Northern Ireland  who is past President of the WorldWide Fund for Nature.Four resolutions were adopted by the heads of Stateand Government of Central Africa to preserve and extendthe millions of hectares of forest in our subregion. Theyundertook to conserve and manage the forests of CentralAfrica in a sustainable manner to safeguard our richbiodiversity. They then undertook  in particular  to protectnew transnational forest zones in the Congo basin. Then themajor partners and donors agreed to provide financial andtechnical assistance to implement the resolutions andcommitments adopted at the Yaoundé summit. Finally  thesummit participants agreed that good forest management isan important part of work for sustainable development inCentral Africa.However  in the areas of the protection  conservationand sustainable management of forests and biodiversity  aprofound dilemma has arisen. Central Africa is  after theAmazon region of South America  the second largestforested area of the world whose natural characteristics aredecisive for the balance of the biosphere and theecosystems of the entire planet. The accelerated andmindless destruction of this forest would in fact be adirect way to prepare for the disappearance of all life onearth. In a word  the forests of Central Africa are thelungs of the world.Following the Yaoundé summit  the senior officialsof Central Africa and the peoples concerned becameclearly aware of their duty to all humankind  a duty thatshould be reflected in the sound conservation andmanagement of forests and the diverse resources theycontain. But at the same time  the experts rightly notedthat this would involve extremely heavy and increasinglyhigher costs. The costs of protecting species  reforestationand reintroducing animals  as well as the administrativecosts involved in the functioning of the institutionsneeded to do those jobs  will be an additional burden onthe already meagre resources of the countries of oursubregion.This is why we believe that it would only be rightfor the whole of humankind — for which we are makingthis vital sacrifice of forest and biodiversityconservation — to find the ways and means to support usin this work for the common good. This could be done byproviding matching funds or  better yet  by bringing aboutgenuine global action under the guidance of the UnitedNations and financed by a fund for the preservation andsustainable management of forests and biodiversity inCentral Africa. That fund would support all the importantpreliminary work to be done in this essential area ofglobalization.We will be submitting a draft resolution on thissubject for the kind consideration of the GeneralAssembly.When Cameroon campaigns with other States for theprotection of the environment and for the safeguarding ofnatural resources  we do so very mindful of the long term which has meaning only in relation to the future ofmankind  and of younger generations in particular. We areall the more conscious of the importance of the legacy wewill leave for the adults of tomorrow because more than46 per cent of the population of Cameroon will reachadulthood at the beginning of the twenty-first century.The proportion of our children who are today under 15years of age  like all men and women of the world in thenext century  have a legitimate right to demand of us  asthe most important part of our legacy  peace  security andstability in freedom and development and in a healthyenvironment. That is why  in conclusion  I wish to22address our partners in the prosperous countries  particularlythe Group of Eight.I wish first of all to say how much we appreciate thesteps that have been taken this year to reduce the debtburden of the poorest countries  particularly those in ourcontinent. According to the Secretary-General  the Africandebt burden represents more than 300 per cent of the valueof goods and services exported from the region. Therefore the spirit of solidarity in the Group of Eight  which is agood sign  must be pursued and consolidated while takinginto account the situation of the so-called medium-incomecountries. That spirit of solidarity must be resolutelycontinued and take root in all other developed countries.The Secretary-General's in-depth coverage of manysubjects in his report calls for us to reflect on them. I willtake up just one of these subjects: AIDS.Like other pandemics  AIDS not only jeopardizes thefuture of millions of African men and women  it is also amortal danger for all humankind. To show a lack ofconcern for its ravages in Africa  no matter what part of theworld one comes from  would be suicidal indifference. Thefuture of the world is more indivisible than ever before.The choice can no longer be postponed — the choicebetween the universal common good and the chaos causedby poverty  destitution  ignorance  injustice  the absence ofgood governance  interference  wars  et cetera.The end of this century shows every sign of serving asa loud and clear call to the whole of mankind  but first andforemost to the leaders of nations. The end of the centuryhas made hope possible and has brought about the globaladvancement of the values of peace  democracy  solidarityand the struggle for human rights. These principles mustnot merely guide each nation; we believe that they shouldalso inspire the relations between nations. The staunchresolve of all countries to promote these principles togetheris the only guarantee of a better future for humanity. Inorder to bring this about  mankind as a whole —increasingly more united and in solidarity under the bannerof the United Nations — has a duty to provide speedyassistance wherever the life and dignity of the human beinghave been seriously undermined or threatened.Accordingly  it is clear that the internationalcommunity  assembled within the United Nations  has aninalienable  inviolate and sacred right to act. This universalright to act  whose letter  spirit  legality and legitimacycome from the Charter itself  is the reflection and theinevitable consequence of the changes occurring in theworld today. Clearly  it excludes any form of interference.A new world has thus been born; we mustacknowledge this from now on. The MillenniumAssembly and the Millennium Summit  to be held in theyear 2000  should embody the spirit of that new worldand set it in order."
"34",1440,"COD",54,1999,"The convening in the splendidmetropolis of New York of this last General Assemblysession of the millennium affords me the happyopportunity  on behalf of the people  the Government ofPublic Salvation and the head of State  His ExcellencyPresident Laurent-Désiré Kabila  of the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo  to convey our warmest greetings toall people the world over who love peace and justice.It is my pleasant duty also to congratulate thePresident of the General Assembly and the other Assemblyofficers on their unanimous election to the leadership of theAssembly at its fifty-fourth session. My country views theelection to the presidency of Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab asrecognition of his many sterling qualities  both human andprofessional  and as an acknowledgement by theinternational community of the important role played by hiscountry  Namibia  in building an Africa and a world thatwill be marked by peace  political stability and economicprosperity. The President may be sure that the delegation ofthe Democratic Republic of the Congo will unreservedlysupport him in fulfilling his mandate and in guiding thework of the Assembly to a successful conclusion.I also extend to his predecessor  Mr. Didier Opertti our full appreciation of the extremely important work hedid during his presidency  as well as the commitment heshowed throughout to the triumph of the ideals embodiedin the United Nations Charter.Finally  my delegation would like to welcome here inour world Organization three new Members: the Republicof Kiribati  the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom ofTonga.I invite Members to read my prepared text at theirleisure  so that I may say a few other things. I begin witha good quotation  from Article 2 of the United NationsCharter:“The Organization and its Members  in pursuit ofthe Purposes stated in Article 1  shall act inaccordance with the following Principles.“1. The Organization is based on the principleof the sovereign equality of all its Members.“2. All Members  in order to ensure to all ofthem the rights and benefits resulting frommembership  shall fulfil in good faith the obligationsassumed by them in accordance with the presentCharter.“3. All Members shall settle their internationaldisputes by peaceful means in such a manner thatinternational peach and security  and justice  are notendangered.“4. All Members shall refrain in theirinternational relations from the threat or use of forceagainst the territorial integrity or politicalindependence of any state  or in any other mannerinconsistent with the Purposes of the UnitedNations”.I say to representatives: This is the United NationsCharter  your Charter. Are there represented in this Hall— yes or no — Members that violate these principlesgoverning relations between nations? Are thererepresented in this Hall — yes or no — Members that doworse than those that do not pay their dues  or pay themlate  regarding which immediate reminders are sent  andrightly so  since the rules of procedure of theOrganization of which they are Members prescribe thatfor its proper functioning each Member must pay itsdues? Failing to do so even means being stripped of theright to speak here at the United Nations. So  if you haveyour right to speak taken away  if you are punished as aMember of the United Nations because you do not payyour dues  what about those who violate Article 2 of theCharter  who cross the boundaries of another State withtheir armies  sow hardship in that country  occupy vastportions of its territory  plunder its natural resources  stealthe fauna and rare species of animals which internationalorganizations recognize as being received by othercountries  carry out a blitzkrieg such as the one in theearly 1940s  without warning  without provocation entering the country of another people with their arms andeverything else they need  under pretexts which I shallexpose in a little while.On 2 August 1998  some two years ago  our brothersfrom the hills of Rwanda  Burundi and Uganda invadedour country in an unprovoked blitzkrieg  without havingdeclared war  and it continues to this very day. For twoyears now those Members of the United Nations havebeen violating Article 2  and they continue to violate it with arrogance and total impunity  which is not the casefor those who fail to pay their dues.28It is perhaps better to violate Article 2  occupy othercountries  pillage them  deport their inhabitants and torturechildren  women and old persons  than it is to commit themortal sin of failing to pay up. There are two yardsticks double standards  which we regard as an immense injustice.As I speak I feel the presence of illustrious personswho have spoken from this rostrum in the past  such asCabral  Nkrumah and — I say this with a great deal ofemotion — Lumumba  who came here to denounce whatwas being set in train more than 30 years ago  under UnitedNations banners which is now being repeated. We know theUnited Nations. The French rightly say “A cat that has beenscalded is even afraid of cold water.” They have alreadycome  those United Nations forces; they came to restorepeace  and the result was that for one of the most illustrioussons of our people  the most admired African nationalistPresident Patrice Lumumba  the flag of the United Nationsserved as a shroud. We do not wish  we will not allow  thatsame flag to be a shroud for those who have taken up thetorch that fell from Lumumba's hands and who carried it with some help of course  as far as lying down — withtheir boots on — in Mobutu's bed. This is something withwhich the Assembly is familiar.It is on behalf of my President  my friend  my long-time comrade  that I speak. As representatives will see  andas I often say  we will have no more charming “Rastas” because we lost our hair waiting for President Kabila toreturn to relight the torch that fell from Lumumba's hands.If people do not watch out  if they let things slidealong  if they tolerate arrogance and do not stand up toimpunity  there are those who will begin to dream ofwrapping Kabila up in the United Nations flag  as was donein the case of Patrice Lumumba not long ago.When events are repeated  they do not always happenin exactly the same way  but sometimes the repetitionstrikes a familiar chord. Now we see the United Nationsdelaying putting an end to what it calls euphemistically the“conflict” in the Great Lakes region. This terminology isbeing used for some reason — but what? A foreign armycrosses the border  occupies the country  a part of thecountry; it pillages the country's wealth — and the UnitedNations calls this a “conflict”? We should check ourdictionaries. This is a war. Instead of shouting themselveshoarse about sending peacekeepers  Member States mustsend people who can put an end to the war. This is what Iam waiting for. Our Rwandan  Ugandan and Burundibrothers must be solemnly requested here and now to goback home. They have no business being in our country.They are undermining all national reconstruction efforts.This should be clear to those who understand thecondition in which we found this country  which used tobe called Zaire and which we now call  as Lumumbacalled it  the Democratic Republic of the Congo.The presence of these outsiders  their occupation impedes our efforts to reconstruct our country. They cameupon us like thieves who attack without warning. Theyattacked while we were busy sowing corn  peanuts andbeans  and we were doing so because that was what wewas needed in this country that is overflowing withdiamonds  gold  cobalt  copper and so forth. In order tohelp our people we had begun by planting peanuts  cornand beans  but our efforts were stopped cold by thesepeople who are now in our territory  who came from thehills  who came to defend their borders — their bordersthat  according to them  were threatened by genocidalbands in our country.I ask the Assembly to look at a map of Africa  amap of the Congo in particular. I come from the AtlanticCoast province of Bas-Congo. Do you know where thesepeople who began the war came from  in order to securetheir borders? They came from 2 000 kilometres awayfrom my province. They began in my province in orderto secure borders 2 000 kilometres away. They broughtsoldiers 2 000 kilometres from their borders in order tobegin the occupation of our country. Luckily  they took alicking  and they would all have been wiped out if theAmericans had not asked us to allow them to return homealong a designated route. They retreated after theirthrashing and tried their luck in the east of our country.After the ceasefire requested by Secretary-GeneralKofi Annan  United Nations staff went to the area tocarry out an order of the World Health Organization tovaccinate all children up to five years of age. We havevaccinated them in the part of the country that wecontinue to control. But these others — who only havetwo hands  both of which are busy pillaging — have yetto vaccinate the children in this age group. Thus  thesechildren are in danger not only of polio  but also of otherdiseases that the agencies of our Organization have beenstriving to eliminate from our continent.These soldiers do not have time to vaccinate ourchildren. They do not even have time to pillageeffectively because these Horatii and Curiatii have takento fighting each other on our soil. They came to takecontrol of our country  but now  how strange  they arefighting each other  these people who came to teach us29democracy  these people who came to restore peace. Inorder to have a break from their looting  they are enjoyinga little war on our land  and in the process destroying the3 million doses of vaccine that the United Nations  throughthe World Health Organization  sent to Kisangani. Theyshoot at each other  each band allied with this or that local.This is what is happening.And then these people take their place here as UnitedNations Members — after having treated us like that  andas they continue to do so. They are building up theirarsenals  bringing in troops  taking towns. What reassuresus is the teaching of the Marquis de Sade that taking is notthe same as possessing. Thus  these people are taking townsbut they do not possess them. And they will not possesthem because  just as in erotic relations  there is nopossession without consent — that consent that has beengiven to us. Otherwise  our people would not have fled tothe forests to escape from these people who come from thehills. Our citizens' lengthy stay in the forests has led to thereappearance of some diseases that were eradicated as longago as the Belgian colonial era.Having to flee the invaders like the plague makes ourcitizens' lives more difficult. And these people from thehills continue to advance even though they signed with us last 10 July  a Ceasefire Agreement that lacks both fire anda cease  as they continue to advance and lay siege to ourcities.Their latest exploit  which they are now engaged in  isto lay siege to the city of Mbuji-Mayi  the world diamondcapital  but also the world capital of children afflicted withpolio. I do not think that their haste and willingness toreturn to Mbuji-Mayi are out of desire to vaccinate the poorCongolese children who are infected with or at risk ofgetting polio. These people from the hills do not have athird hand  as I said earlier  yet I am sure that  driven bytheir greed  they are going to take as many diamonds andas much copper and cobalt as they can — and at the risk offighting each other for these minerals  since Uganda alsowants to take them. The statistics on sales of diamondsindicate that last month our Rwandan brothers sold morethan a million carats of diamonds — a mineral not minedin their country — and with the money from the sales theyare buying weapons so as to be able to fight us. Then theytake more diamonds  buy more weapons and continue tofight us.In this Hall speeches have been made against dirtymoney. Therefore  we are outraged to see bloodstainedcobalt  bloodstained copper  bloodstained gold andbloodstained diamonds for sale on the internationalmarket  and to see that it does not occur to the buyers ofthis booty to put a stop to this practice by refusing to buyit — even though they oppose dirty money. Doublestandards continue to prevail.Dirty money poses a threat to the world. And yet while the blood of the Congolese people is spattered onour cobalt  our copper and our gold  that doesn't seem tobother those from all over the world who buy them andgive money to the pillagers and occupiers our country. Ifwe revisit this issue  I reserve the right to address itagain.I wish  however  to speak out loud and clear againstthe infamous pretext that has aroused the world'sprurience and sensitivity about genocide. Those who areguilty of genocide are in our country right now. Let themleave and go on sowing misery in their own countries:Rwanda  Uganda or Burundi.As I said at the outset  President Kabila has raisedLumumba's torch and welcomed those who sought refugein our country  because over there you do not seekrefuge — you get your throat slit. I was just a schoolboywhen I saw Hutus fleeing cutthroat Tutsi and Tutsifleeing cutthroat Hutus. They all sought refuge with us.That is how those who helped us  who walked with us onour march on Kinshasa  came to be refugees in ourcountry — they fled Hutus who would have cut theirthroats. That is at the heart of the current instability andreflects the values of our brothers in Rwanda. We musthelp our Rwandese to change their political culture.When the “one man one vote” law was enacted in1960  the obsession of each of these groups was to seizepower and abuse it in order to hasten the carnage. Thiscarnage has been alternating and reciprocal and did notbegin in 1994. I cited a date when I was in short pants and I can assure the Assembly that it was not yesterday.It is the open faucet that produced the interahamwe thatwe must close. Rwanda must become democratic;Rwanda must adopt a culture of politics and abandon itsculture of carnage. Rwanda must leave our country;Uganda must leave our country; Burundi must leave ourcountry and turn over the task of providing security toUnited Nations observers  who will take their place andserve as a buffer force between us. Those people are ourneighbours and we can never replace our neighbours  butthey are on our territory  which means they are no longerour neighbours. I ask the Assembly to help us to resumeour status as neighbours. Let them go back home and if30there are problems that we must settle among ourselves  weshall settle them by peaceful means.I am speaking without acrimony. We hold out ourhands to our brothers from Rwanda  who have been herefor several days. I offer them signals of friendship when wepass  and they respond. We are here so that in threemonths  when the new millennium dawns  we will not stillbe fighting. One must deal with urgent matters quickly.The Lusaka process  in which I participated  raisedhopes that have been dashed by dilatory tactics. Onemoment the Congolese and Rwandese affiliates who refuseto come; the next  it is the Ugandans or their Congolesepuppets. Here we are on 29 September and nothing has yetbeen done seriously to implement an Agreement that wasreached on 10 July.That is why we ask the Assembly  if only out ofrespect for the Articles of the Charter  to do somethingabout it. It is intolerable and incomprehensible that thesepeople remain  and may even take the floor here  whilethey continue to violate the United Nations Charter and theprinciples that bring us together here. If you violate theprinciples of an organization to which you belong  you areno longer worthy of belonging.We must remind our brothers that  as Members of theUnited Nations  they are bound to respect the Charter. Thiscannot be done by occupying other people's countries. Ifdifferences must be settled by invasion and plunder  therewill no longer be a United Nations  because there will nolonger be any rules to unite us. That prompts my request tothe Assembly  because the suffering being endured by theCongolese people and the atrocities being visited upon usare unimaginable.Under the very nose of the Vatican  in the Italianmission of Kasika  these new-style Huns entered  tore openthe chest of a traditional chief  pulled out his heart shredded it and distributed the pieces like hosts. The killerswho did this sucked on the bloody heart as if it were anice-cream cone. We have seen this and continue to witnesssuch acts. Our United Nations mission is at Members'disposal to provide irrefutable testimony  which we havepublished in a three-volume white paper that could easilygrow into further volumes describing similar incidents. Wehave requested that this white paper be issued as a workingdocument of the Security Council. All are invited to studyit in order to understand precisely what is happening and toput an end to this situation — to save the United Nationsitself  to help us Africans  and the Congolese in particular who had to wait 32 years to defeat and eliminate a regimeof notorious satraps  only to see new satraps step in twomonths later to occupy our country and put it to thesword.Help us to make our Rwandese  Ugandan andBurundian brothers understand that they must go home.They have no business in our country; let them relinquishtheir place to United Nations forces  which will securetheir borders. That is in itself a fiction that we have nothad an opportunity to dwell on. They helped us to raiseLumumba's torch. They were in our army. Most officersin our army were from Rwanda  as was the Chief ofStaff  who dispatched his troops on the basis of hisparticular military skills. Moreover  these people haveoccupied that region of our country for two years and arestill hunting the Interahamwe  as the Incas were oncehunted here. They will not stop until Joe the Ugandan andBill the Rwandese have extended their hunting grounds tothe entire territory of our country while they prance afterthe Interahamwe.This is just a pretext. If they were not able to catcha single Interahamwe while their officers were in ourarmy; if they have been unable to stop the interahamwein their two-year occupation of that region  then the taskis beyond them. It must be left to the United Nations tounseat these Interahamwe  if they exist  and let us pursueour national reconstruction.I have a great deal more to say and believe that wewill have further opportunities in due course."
"35",1487,"COG",54,1999,"I wish to jointhe many previous speakers who have congratulated thePresident. I congratulate him most warmly on behalf of theCongolese delegation on his election to preside over thefifty-fourth session  which is a tribute to him personally andto his country  a symbol of the struggle for decolonizationin Africa. The Congo  an old friend of Namibia  welcomeshis election. I am convinced that thanks to his humanqualities and his wealth of experience forged in theliberation struggle and at the head of his country'sdiplomacy  the work of this session will be carried outharmoniously and successfully. I assure him of the supportof my delegation in the discharge of his heavyresponsibilities.To his predecessor  Mr. Didier Opertti  we express ourprofound gratitude for the ability and skill with which heconducted the work of the last session.To the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr.Kofi Annan  we pay a well-deserved tribute for hisprofound commitment to the service of peace anddevelopment.Lastly  I would like to welcome warmly the newMember States of Kiribati  Nauru and Tonga  whoseadmission can only strengthen the universal nature of theUnited Nations.Has not the time come to take stock of our commonlabour? Will the great family of the United Nations enterthe third millennium convinced that it has contributed topromoting the noble ideals contained in the Charter of ouruniversal Organization? Have international peace andsecurity  the development of nations and the rights ofcitizens been treated in a way that allows us to enter thenext century calmly and with hope?In Africa there are still far too many causes forconcern. Far too many challenges leave us doubtful  despitesome positive events in the continent  in particular thepolitical changes in South Africa and Nigeria.In Angola  the many statements and decisions of theinternational community remain unimplemented because ofJonas Savimbi's stubborn adherence to the logic of war. Thewar in Angola  which has rendered fruitless the efforts ofan entire generation of diplomats  has revealed the limits ofour Organization in the restoration of peace. This is theoccasion to reaffirm that the solid base for a definitiveresolution of the conflict remains the effectiveimplementation of comprehensive mandatory sanctions.They alone will lead to the complete isolation of Mr.Jonas Savimbi and UNITA  so long as the internationalcommunity truly complies.With regard to the Democratic Republic of theCongo  we welcome the conclusion of the LusakaAgreement  which opens the way to resolving the politicaland military crisis in that fraternal country. My country iscounting on the commitment of the various protagonistsfor the Agreement's implementation. We strongly hopethat the observer mission planned by the United Nationswill be effective and that it will create favourableconditions for the holding of a Great Lakes regionalconference  which the international community is callingfor wholeheartedly.The conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea is anothermajor concern in Africa. We invite those two fraternalpeoples to rise above the situation by fully supporting thepeace plan of the Organization of African Unity to put anend to that war.Lastly  we cannot fail to pay tribute to the couragedisplayed by the authorities of Sierra Leone  who haveagreed to pay a very high price for the restoration ofpeace in that country.In this world  in which the universality of principlesis often limited by force  great men can be guided onlyby the interests of their peoples. A year ago  from thisvery rostrum  I proclaimed our faith in the future of ourcountry following the civil war that started on 5 June1997. I said then that for the Congolese Government thefuture was national reconciliation  the restoration ofpeace  the reconstruction of the country and theresumption of the democratic process. We have explainedthis great project wherever and whenever we could — atthe United Nations  at the Organization of AfricanUnity and in all our contacts with all of our partners —and we have found understanding and attentioneverywhere.In the context of the resumption of the democraticprocess  we have carried out an administrative census ofthe population in order to identify the electorate; we haveelaborated a draft Constitution; and we have establishedour higher courts — the Supreme Court and the HighCourt of Justice.13Regrettably  this impetus has been hampered by aresumption of violence  orchestrated once again by thosewho on several occasions plunged our people intomourning — first in 1993-1994 and then in 1997 — andwhose only aim is the partition of Congo into ethnicghettos.The consequences have been catastrophic for the entirecountry. These have included heinous crimes such as theassassination of officials and leaders of local communities the kidnapping of tens of thousands of people to serve ashuman shields for the armed groups  and the systematicdestruction of infrastructures vital to the economy of thecountry.But those plans to overthrow institutions have failed.Today the pacification efforts made by the Governmenthave borne fruit. The fighting has ended. Several formermilitia members of the failed regime have laid down theirweapons and have given themselves up to the authorities.We are also seeing a mass influx of civilians back intoBrazzaville and to the main towns in the interior.The guests who did us the honour of participating inthe Pan-African Music Festival that the city of Brazzavillehosted from 1 to 8 August 1999 witnessed thedetermination of the Government and the entire people torebuild this country as a haven of peace. That event — atime of great joy and reunion for the Congolese people —strengthened our conviction that the worst was behind usand that henceforth we could look to the future withcalmness and optimism.All of these steps forward on the path of peace are tothe credit of one man  President Denis Sassou Nguesso. Hisfaith in reconciliation and national unity was again madeclear on 14 August 1999 on the occasion of the nationalholiday  when  on behalf of the fraternal republic  hesolemnly reaffirmed his desire for dialogue and decided togrant amnesty to all combatants guilty of war crimes whoagreed to renounce violence and definitively to lay downtheir weapons.In this same context of a return to a stable situationunder full control throughout the national territory  theGovernment reiterates its firm and unswerving will toresume the inter-Congolese political dialogue with a viewto pacification and reunion in order to consolidate thenewfound peace and security  strengthen national unity andthe reconciliation of all the sons and daughters of theCongo  rebuild the country on a lasting basis  and resumethe democratic process  which had been interrupted byviolence.The offer made was favourably received  leading inparticular to the return to Brazzaville of many politicalleaders who had gone into exile following the war of 5June 1997. We are confident in the positive outcome ofthis process.In the wake of such a tragic period  naturally we arestriving to cope with emergency situations. These includethe shelter  management and social reintegration of tensof thousands of displaced persons  a humanitarian tragedywhose scale has not always been clearly perceived by theinternational community; the protection of people andproperty; the respect of human rights; and the restorationof normal living conditions in many war-torncommunities — an overwhelming task that anyone wouldagree requires means exceeding by far the capacities of aState bled dry such as Congo is today.We are assuming all of our responsibilities  and herewe call on the international community  which shouldaccompany our efforts with greater commitment andcontribute  as it wishes to do  to the restoration on alasting basis of peace  security and democracy and to thereconstruction of Congo.At a time when our people are suffering frompoverty and destitution and from the economic crisis there is no place for conflicts that are both fratricidal andsuicidal.In the context of the quest for sustainable and lastingpeace and development in Africa  specific and practicalmeasures must be resolutely taken along the lines of theconclusions contained in the report of the Secretary-General of our Organization. Among those conclusions which we unanimously supported  I would like to mentionthose relating to the proliferation of  and illicit traffic in small arms  which is an important factor in the increasein terrorism and crime in our States.That is why  at the thirty-fifth Summit of theOrganization of African Unity (OAU)  held last July inAlgiers  the African Heads of State and Governmentdevoted most of their consideration to ways and means ofconsolidating peace in order to create modern Statesbased on the primacy of law  respect of the fundamentalrights and freedoms of citizens  and the democraticgovernance of public affairs.14Along the same lines  on 20 September last  at theopening of the general debate  the current Chairman of theOAU  Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika  President of the People'sDemocratic Republic of Algeria  clearly set out in this veryHall Africa's views on the key questions of peace  security economic development and international cooperation. TheCongo associates itself fully with that important declaration.I cannot conclude this political analysis withoutmentioning other areas of tension that are a source ofconcern for us at this session. Thus we express the hopethat the impetus provided by the Wye River accords and theSharm el-Sheik Memorandum on the Middle East will beconsolidated. The Government of the Congo is also closelyfollowing the evolution of the situation in East Timor andwelcomes the efforts of the international community  whichled to the dispatch of an international force to restore peacein that territory and to ensure the respect of the politicalwill clearly expressed by that people during the referendumorganized by the United Nations.On the threshold of the twenty-first century  buildingpeace and security in the world requires real commitmenton our part to work for economic and social development.In this context  our planet can never be certain of lastingpeace so long as there is destitution and poverty  which notonly affect the quality of human life but are also a cause ofpolitical instability.But how can we achieve lasting sustainabledevelopment when the world economy is opening up noencouraging prospects for developing countries  when debtreceives discriminatory treatment in initiatives whoseconditions for implementation show how illusory they are when resources allocated to official development assistanceare constantly declining  and lastly  when there is a clearrefusal to grant developing countries opportunities tointegrate their economies into the new trade system.In any case  because of what is at stake  globalizationwill be the main challenge of the next century. Today it isgiving rise to fears because of the threat it implies to thesovereignty of our States and to our cultural and historicalcharacteristics  and because it raises grave questions aboutour countries' prospects for development. Its implementationcalls more than ever for the creation of appropriate  agreed-upon mechanisms so as to translate into reality hopes forhumankind's unified development and for prosperity sharedamong peoples.It was in this context that recently  at Algiers and atSirte  that the Heads of State and Government of themember countries of the Organization of African Unityresolutely committed themselves to working for thestrengthening of subregional economic groups  inaccordance with the spirit of the Abuja Treaty.The coming century will bring with it challenges forour Organization. Overcoming them will requireharmonized approaches taken in a representative context.Thus my country attaches particular importance to thestrengthening of the role of the United Nations and to therestructuring of its main bodies  so as to combat theuncertainties born of an unequal world and to take firmsteps to make multilateralism truly democratic. TheUnited Nations remains an irreplaceable tool. However  itdeserves to be rethought and revitalized so that it will beequal to the challenges confronting us.To succeed  we will need to join together the will the efforts and the means of the whole of the internationalcommunity. Congo reaffirms its commitment to make itsfull contribution to the achievement of that goal."
"36",1534,"COL",54,1999,"Allow me  onmy own behalf and on behalf of my country  to express ourcongratulations to you  Sir  on your election as President ofthe General Assembly for the current session. I am certainthat  with a person of your qualities and experience at thehelm  the Assembly will achieve the desired results.I wish to express my congratulations and gratitudeto your predecessor  my friend Chancellor Didier Operttiof Uruguay  for his efficient work.I would also like to express my appreciation to theSecretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Kofi Annan for his dedication and his contribution to the renewal ofthe Organization  and to reiterate to him our confidencein his work and his leadership.This session of the General Assembly is the last oneof the twentieth century. In the last hundred years  despitetwo disastrous global conflagrations  the nations of theworld have come to the collective realization that all warsare civil wars  all killing is fratricidal  and that any minorconflict could  by escalating to the nuclear level  sparkhumankind’s final war. It has thus become clear that inorder to survive and prosper  nations must be united in abasic agreement on the prevention of war and theprotection of human rights  with the preservation of thehuman race as a first priority.Today  on the eve of the new millennium  after halfa century marked by setbacks as well as by majorsuccesses  the United Nations must renew its mandate asa source of social and economic development and as aforce for peace.Here I would prefer to avoid pro forma statementsand present instead some concrete and explicitconsiderations  as we believe that this Organization mustbe the catalyst of a fair and realistic response to thechallenges of our common destiny.No one could argue with the lofty principlesunderlying the Charter of the United Nations. Itsunquestioned universality is one of the characteristics ofthe second half of the twentieth century. We agree thatrespecting the Charter must mean  above all else  applyingthose principles effectively  without interpreting them inways that distort the purposes of the Charter.Our collective experience of over half a century hasshown that the proper application of the Charter of theUnited Nations is indeed the best and safest way ofachieving and consolidating the benefits of world peace.One of the Charter’s cherished principles is the obligationof States not to interfere  directly or indirectly  in theaffairs of other States  as sovereign equality excludes8interference in the internal jurisdiction of other countries. Italso implies complying  in good faith  with agreedcommitments; observing the principles underlying them;and simultaneously respecting freedoms and human rights.This is a fundamental aspect of international affairs.The founders of the United Nations — and mygrandfather was among them — were not mistaken in theirbelief that international peace is based on the sovereigntyof Member States. Nor were they wrong when  ruling outthe unilateral use of threats and force against the integrityand independence of States  they envisaged the use ofeffective collective means.Over the past year  we have worked withdetermination to put an end to the 40-year-old conflict inColombia. We have reached agreement on an agenda fornegotiations between our Government and the ColombiaRevolutionary Armed Forces (FARC)  the oldest and largestof the guerrilla groups. But as the world knows  we arenegotiating in the midst of conflict  without benefit of aceasefire  so the killings  kidnappings and attacks by theguerrillas and the “self-defence” groups are still taking ahigh human  social and economic toll. Achieving peace willrequire time  patience and optimism in order to successfullyovercome the obstacles and doubts inherent in this process.When I last stood upon this rostrum  one year ago  Ioutlined a new direction for my country: to work to put anend to the corruption and violence in Colombia. I mustadmit that the past year has been difficult; the challengeswe face are complex. The most important lesson we havelearned is that peace is a primary goal for Colombia. Notpeace at any price  but a genuine peace that strengthens ourdemocracy  preserves territorial unity and gives everyColombian his or her rightful place in our common destiny.The quest for peace is not limited to dialogue andnegotiation or to putting an end to armed conflict.Achieving peace requires much more than convincing theparties to sit at the negotiating table and reachcompromises. It requires rebuilding a society and State inwhich the causes of conflict have been eradicated  whichstrengthens the State and helps to create the foundations ofa stable and lasting peace.We Colombians have taken seriously the responsibilityof achieving peace. As our recent history makes clear international support is also necessary for us to face ourchallenges. Colombia needs financial support frommultilateral organizations  from friendly countries and fromnon-governmental organizations to complement myAdministration’s efforts. Such support is key forColombia.To this end  we have formulated a strategic packagefor peace  economic prosperity and the strengthening ofthe State; it is called Plan Colombia. It synthesizes oureconomic  political and social views and aims to defendColombia from the threat of drug trafficking  tostrengthen our democratic institutions throughout thenational territory  and to guarantee the security of ourcitizens and the full enjoyment of their rights andfreedoms. For that reason  we are counting on thesolidarity and contributions of the internationalcommunity.Given the complexity of the process  it is clear thatcooperation for peace must be carried out with the utmostcaution. Careless actions can thwart these efforts. That iswhy we are increasingly concerned by the groundlessrumours of alleged military interventions in Colombia whose supposed purpose is to help my country in thestruggle in which it is engaged.I would like from this rostrum solemnly to state thatColombia  true to the principles that govern our Republic rejects any foreign interference or intervention in itsinternal affairs. We Colombians will work to overcomeour own challenges. These are times of cooperation  notintervention.My Government also believes that the peace processis key in winning the fight against the worldwide problemof drugs. That immoral trade  which ruins lives  fuelsviolence  promotes corruption and destroys our ecosystem must be opposed by all nations  by all available means.To that end  we must coordinate our efforts regardingproduction and consumption as well as the numerouslinks between these two evils.Over the past two decades  Colombia has been onthe front lines of this battle  facing down the drug cartelsand their campaigns of intimidation and terror. In theprocess we have lost many of our finest citizens  to whomwe owe an immeasurable debt of gratitude.But as the major Colombian cartels are wiped out the illegal drug trade has become a kind of hydra — morespread out  more international and less public  andtherefore more difficult to defeat. To vanquish it requiresa genuine partnership among the countries that consumeand produce illegal drugs  underpinned by the principlesof joint responsibility  reciprocity and fairness.9Increased efforts must also be made to confiscate fromdrug traffickers the money and property they have obtainedfrom that illegal trade. In particular  we must fight thesmuggling of industrial products to Colombia  which servesto launder drug money and ends up suffocating Colombia’sindustries. We must also halt the flow of precursorchemicals needed for the production of narcotics. Andmultinational corporations that benefit in one way oranother should be held accountable for not taking thenecessary precautions to prevent their helping andparticipating in drug trafficking through negligence.There will be no peace in Colombia as long as thegreedy businesses of drug trafficking and the black marketin weapons continue supplying irregular groups. We arevery concerned about the significant amounts of varioustypes of weapons illegally entering Colombian territory.There is an urgent  inescapable need for all Governments tocooperate to control and halt this unacceptable traffic indeath and destruction.For the last two years  since the first shock wave ofthe so-called Asian crisis  the economy has been sufferingthe difficulties of instability and slow-down. This crisis hasshown that no State  however powerful  is immune  and thatthe poor countries have suffered the most from itsconsequences.The hypothesis that capital flows would promoteaccelerated and sustained economic growth has faded in thelight of the facts. We have seen the growth of enormoussums of virtual money  whose uncontrolled movementshave brought economic turbulence  unemployment  morepoverty and even  in some cases  political instability. LatinAmerica has become the most recent victim of the crisis.We must  therefore  give the most serious consideration andpriority to the design of a new financial structure. This willbe viable and efficient only if it involves increasedresources from multilateral financial institutions. It mustalso involve support mechanisms to lessen the social impactof structural adjustment programmes  especially thoseaffecting the most vulnerable. The Secretary-General  Mr.Kofi Annan  said so when he spoke about the need torespect essential values to give a human face to the globalmarket.At the end of the twentieth century  we are movinginto an era of powerful changes  accompanied byworrisome tensions. Globalization is deepening  but itcoexists with forces that encourage fragmentation. As thepeace processes move forward in many regions  newviolence explodes in others. Wealth is expanding tounprecedented levels  but alienation and poverty persist.The technological means that promote interdependenceand development also support networks of organizedcrime  drug trafficking  money laundering  terrorism andarms trafficking. New struggles and conflicts haveappeared  some using means for which the internationalcommunity does not seem to be prepared.Global confrontation is a thing of the past  as are theold plots resulting from strife and spheres of influence.These are times to think in terms of a real community ofnations  as competing partners  but mainly as partners thatshare a common destiny.There is  nevertheless  a perception that noteverything is going well. The world is still not satisfiedwith itself. There are forces of destabilization andimbalance which put at risk the achievements made todate. Many millions still suffer from malnutrition illiteracy  disease and exclusion.We must  therefore  revitalize internationalcooperation to make the best of globalization  to distributeits benefits more fairly so that development and peace cancomplement each other efficiently and productively.Revitalizing cooperation is not an option; it is a duty.After over five decades of existence  the UnitedNations has partially fulfilled its promise. It has been ableto avoid the horrors of a new world holocaust. But theanticipated order  wherein the United Nations wouldguarantee peace  security and development for all peoples remains to be built.After the progress achieved with the Secretary-General’s reform proposals  we see with great concernthat the pace of change has slowed. Reform must be acontinuing process. The United Nations must continueadapting ever more effectively to new conditions andrealities. But this cannot simply take a form that is aproduct of the post-cold-war era. We need a concertedwill. From various directions there are calls for theSecurity Council to become more effective  to consult thespirit of the Charter and to balance the realities of worldpower with the just aspirations of those peoples which areleast strong.The system of collective security is one of thecornerstones of multilateralism. It is the rational responseto interventionist or isolationist tendencies  the maximumguarantee of the principles to which we all adhere.Colombia reiterates its confidence in these principles of10collective security and its commitment to work  decisively with the different sectors of the international community inorder to invigorate the capacity of the Security Council torespond to problems and crises in all regions. That is whymy country has submitted its candidature for a seat on theCouncil for the period 2001-2002.The time for simple reform intentions is past. With thearrival of the new millennium  the historic moment hascome to begin anew real negotiations in the differentinstitutions. We need to find genuinely universal paradigmsto ensure that multilateralism leads to the globalization ofsolidarity. It is necessary to leave behind generalities orfragmented criteria in order to find a comprehensive visionof the United Nations system. A great effort of coordinationis required between these institutions and the newinternational actors  including non-governmentalorganizations  and the promotion of a real associationwithin a globalized but fairer system. The twentieth centuryhas demonstrated that  alongside the horror and cruelty there has prevailed what was once considered utopian: theUnited Nations.Our paramount commitment must be to the humancondition  the ethics and culture of peoples  solidarity andrespect for others  regardless of ethnic  ideological  religiousor any other considerations. We cannot give in until the daywhen the freedom and democracy proclaimed in ourdocuments have become a universal reality. When we haveliberated the human spirit so that it may fully develop itsenormous potential  we will have laid the foundations of aworld truly at peace.Colombia  amidst its difficulties and problems  doesnot want to be  nor will it be  simply a witness to thechanges of these times. Colombia is not a military oreconomic power. Nonetheless  it is respected by thecommunity of nations for its unlimited and unconditionalsupport for the norms and principles of international law.We offer our contribution — modest  but part of thecommon effort — to a better future for all mankind."
"37",1574,"COM",54,1999,"It is anhonour and a pleasure for me to take the floor once againbefore this Assembly. At the outset I would like tocongratulate the President on his brilliant election to leadour work at this session. His election is an unparalleledtribute to all of Africa and particularly to his fraternalcountry  Namibia  which today sees one of its sonspresiding over the destinies of this fifty-fourth session ofthe General Assembly. We are confident that his qualitiesas an eminent diplomat and his great experience guaranteethe success of our work.I would also like to take this opportunity to payglowing tribute to his predecessor  His Excellency Mr.Didier Opertti  for the devotion and the ability with whichhe conducted the previous session.At the same time  allow me to express appreciationfor the full value of the efforts deployed by our Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan  in the serviceof our Organization. The evidence he gives of an untiringwill and of constant dedication to the human cause especially in the field of peace  deserve saluting  and Iwould like to express all of our gratitude to him.At the same time  I would like to wholeheartedlywelcome the delegations of the Republics of Kiribati andNauru and of the Kingdom of Tonga  and to express toall of them our congratulations on their having beenadmitted to the great family of the United Nations.The time has come to assess the century that iscoming to a close and to see together how we are goingto face the challenges of the next millennium — amillennium that we hope will be one of peace andprosperity  bringing hope to our peoples and ourcountries. This is the wish of the Comorien people for allthe nations of the world. But how can we realize thiswish?Our Organization offers the best framework forfacing the challenges of the third millennium  but it willneed to be supported by a more active commitment onour part  a greater willingness to face problems and a realwill to deal with them — without excessive fervour oruncertainty — and to resolve them rationally. With suchwill we can achieve the objectives of the founders of ourOrganization in the field of peace  justice and progress.Achieving a disarmed world  which will at the sametime guarantee peace  social justice and progress  is thefundamental purpose of our Organization. In addition  weall hoped that the 1990s would be the decade of peaceand solidarity among nations  because certain positiveaspects led us to expect this. The various day-to-day15realities we have experienced unfortunately are reviving ourfears that the next millennium will begin in uncertaintyabout the future of humanity.In fact  the wars that are tearing our continents apart the grave violations of human rights  the extreme povertyto which many peoples have been reduced and whichreveals the enormous disparities between the social strata and the recent tragedies such as that in Kosovo make usfear the worst and require us to be more vigilant. OurOrganization  the efforts of which we salute  must perseverein the search for solutions for eliminating the major andvarious problems besetting the world today.Human rights has always been an essential concern ofour Organization. Thus  how can we not deplore that  at thethreshold of the next millennium  humanity is stillwitnessing flagrant violations of fundamental rights. It isbecause of this major concern that I would like to salutehere the efforts to establish an international criminal court which  I am certain  will contribute to greater justice. Wehope that this court  once it becomes operational  will enjoyall the necessary independence to carry out its functionsfully and effectively and to apply the fundamentalprinciples of humanitarian law.With regard to economic issues  we must agree thateconomic recovery is not yet in sight for many countries especially those suffering from armed conflicts. Certainlymany agreements emerging from international meetingshave highlighted the special attention that must be paid tothe problems of developing countries. But we must insistfurther on this and demand that genuine solidarity withthese countries be shown. Through such solidarity positiveaction could be mobilized.With regard to Africa  in general it continues to bemarked by several things. First  its external debt hasbecome a major obstacle to development  especiallybecause financial flows are often used for debt servicingrather than for promoting the expansion of the economyand sustainable development. Also  the level of debt hasdiscouraged domestic and foreign investment. Secondly  thecontinent is heavily scarred by wars which have sharplychecked development. Thirdly  global trade practices havereduced the commercial prospects of the continent.Fourthly  the continent is to some extent excluded from theglobal information revolution. In Africa the basic educationsystem is generally the most limited  the effects of povertyare extreme  and the health system needs reforming.To create the necessary conditions to solve thesedifferent problems which are hampering the developmentof our African countries  national  regional andinternational initiatives must be undertaken  encouragedand supported by the international community. A genuinepartnership among African countries must be the basis forsolid and effective cooperation that allows these countriesto share their experiences and promotes the rapidintegration of regional economies.In the context of this need for South-Southcooperation  my country welcomed most favourably theholding of the special summit in Sirte  which revealedonce again the solidarity of African States and theirsupport for Libya  a brother country. We believe that theconditions are now in place for the total and final liftingof the embargo imposed on that country. The summit alsoput in place new rules to improve the structures of theOrganization of African Unity  with a view to an effectiveunion of its countries through the strengthening ofsecurity and cooperation arrangements. In this regard theSirte summit continues to serve as a point of reference and we hope its objectives will be achieved.I also take this opportunity to express our thanks tothe Government of Libya for the generosity it showed tocertain African countries  allowing them to honour theircommitments to the pan-African organization.Moreover  the international community  especiallythe international financial institutions  must support thesenational and regional efforts by facilitating their access tomarkets and investments  reducing debt constraints andallowing developing countries to benefit from new tradeagreements.Like all developing countries  the Islamic FederalRepublic of the Comoros also faces enormous difficulties.The regrettable events that have unfolded there sinceMarch 1997 have further weakened an economy that wasalready in decline and beset by considerable deficits inpublic finance; a chronic deficit in the balance ofpayments; a large foreign debt; and strong competition forexport resources by synthetic products.This situation is of great concern to the Governmentwhich I have the honour to represent. It is firmly engagedin a process of development through the establishment ofsolid bases for the rule of law and the adoption of apolicy of rehabilitation and economic and politicalrecovery through the strict management of public financesand the promotion of morality in administrative practices16and political customs. This rehabilitation policy shouldallow the State to fulfil its priority domestic commitmentsdomestically and to honour its commitments to its foreignpartners.In addition  other objectives to complement this goodgovernance policy are being considered by the currentGovernment. They include respect for human rights; theimprovement of social policies and hence of the efficacy ofhealth and education services for all; the protection ofchildren and women; the implementation of the Conventionon the Rights of the Child; the advancement andmainstreaming of women; guaranteed autonomy for thejudiciary; freedom of the press; and so on.To encourage private investment and promote theintroduction of new technology and foreign capital opportunities have been opened to domestic and foreigninvestors by suppressing constraints on approvals of foreigninvestments.Furthermore  aware of the enormous contributionSouth-South cooperation makes to development by offeringthe opportunity to exploit the economic prosperity of otherregions  the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros mustrespond to the two-fold necessity of participating fully inthe globalization process and of steadfastly prospering in itsown regional and subregional environment. That is why itis striving further to consolidate its participation in theIndian Ocean Commission and planning to join othergroups of the region. These endeavours  undertaken sincethe accession to power of the current Government  maywell be insufficient  but they constitute a serious andessential foundation  and a guarantee of in-depth reform.The President returned to the Chair.After this general summary  I would be remiss if Ifailed to report the prevailing political situation in theComoros. My country is experiencing a secessionist crisisin the sister island of Anjouan  which has shaken the veryfoundations of the Republic and threatened its unity territorial integrity and  above all  the peace and tolerancethat have always characterized relations among theinhabitants of our four islands.My country’s Government cannot endorse secession orindependence  which could dislocate the Comoros  whoseunity and social coherence are the only guarantees for theevolution of harmonious social and economic development.Three inter-island conferences have been held under theauspices of the OAU and the League of Arab States with aview to rapidly settling this crisis. The most recent  heldin Antananarivo  Madagascar  in April  resulted in anagreement to establish a new institutional framework tomeet the aspirations of the Comorians  guarantee unityand territorial integrity  and give each island greaterautonomy. In this respect  I have the pleasant duty onceagain to convey our sincere thanks to the Malagasyauthorities  not only for having held that importantmeeting on the sisterly large island  but also for havingestablished conditions conducive to our debate.At the conference  the lack of cooperation and theintransigence of the representatives of the island ofAnjouan — who postponed the signing of the finaldocument — provoked extremist groups among thepopulation of Grande-Comore  where anti-Anjouan riotsbroke out. The threat of civil war  of hateful “insularcleansing” and the violent and forcible separation offamilies led the National Development Army  in the faceof the inertia of the political authorities  to act to avoidthe worse by assuming control of the country. Atransition Government was immediately formed to restoreand guarantee civil peace and to create new republicanand democratic institutions to ensure greater autonomy forthe islands  in compliance with the Antananarivoagreement. Thus  the consolidation of the Antananarivoagreement remains a Government priority and we aredoing everything possible to establish the conditionsessential to the implementation of the agreement.In the context of the settlement of the crisis  a frank direct and constructive dialogue has been established forthe first time between the central authorities and theAnjouan separatists. In this respect  a joint communiquésigned on the Comorian island of Mohéli in July by theleaders of the two parties to the summit. I wish to stressthat Comorians view this act as a step towards thesettlement of the crisis. In his meetings with Comorians the Head of State  Mr. Azali Assoumani  is seeking thenecessary breakthrough to achieve an honourable peace tothe benefit of all that unites us.We hope that the ratification of this agreement byour Anjouan brethren will not be long in coming so thatthe process may continue in the interests of the unitedComorian people. The Comorian Government has begunin-depth reflection in order to draft the fundamental textsto govern the future union of the Comoros. The next stepis very crucial in order to implement the publishedelectoral timetable  which anticipates  inter alia  a popularreferendum on the constitution and mayoral  legislativeand presidential elections.17The Comorian Government welcomed the relevantresolutions adopted by the OAU at its thirty-fifth Summitin Algiers; the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of theOrganization of the Islamic Conference at their most recentConference in Ouagadougou; the Ministers for ForeignAffairs of the League of Arab States at their 112th sessionin Cairo (A/50/864/Annex II  res. 1) and the PermanentCouncil of French-speaking Countries  meeting in Paris  inthe framework of the speedy establishment of constitutionalorder and of the settlement of the separatist crisis. To thatend  we invite all people of good will and friendly brotherly and neighbour countries  as well as organizations to come see with their own eyes the process that has beenlaunched and to contribute to the consolidation ofdemocracy and the rule of law in the Comoros.Nevertheless  we remain concerned by the fact thatholding elections in Anjouan would be tantamount torecognizing secession or ratifying independence. Indeed such a formula is contrary to the principle of unity of thecountry  the spirit of the Antananarivo agreement and thevery principles of the OAU  the sponsor of the agreement.In this regard  we invite the OAU and the entireinternational community to join us in the considerationnecessary to overcome this dilemma.In this vein  I should also like to take this opportunityto express the sympathy and profound gratitude of thepeople and the Government of the Comoros to the countriesof the region  especially South Africa and Madagascar;friendly countries such as France and Egypt; andinstitutions such as the OAU  the League of Arab States the International Organization of La Francophonie and theEuropean Union  which have never ceased attaching theirspecial interest to this problem. I should like to tell themonce again that the people of the Comoros hopes to be ableto rely on them  again and always  to find a speedy solutionto this crisis.The Anjouan crisis  in the view of Comorians  is allthe more threatening to unity  peace and love among themas it is added to a painful 24-year-old problem  that of theComorian island of Mayotte. The Assembly will understandthe helplessness of a people threatened with dispersion following the amputation of part of the territory of itscountry  Mayotte  and witnessing an attempt by a sisterisland to leave the Comorian union. This crisis has revivedthe pain of the Comoros people caused by the problem ofMayotte  which still shows no signs of being resolved. OurOrganization  which is regularly seized of this question  hasalways recognized that Mayotte belongs to the Comorosand has adopted resolutions in favour of the integration ofthe island into its natural family.The Comorian Government  faithful to thefundamental principles of the Charter of our Organization continues to give priority to dialogue to resolve thisproblem. It is with deep respect for these principles thatit appeals to France  a country with which the Comoroshas for long had close ties of friendship and cooperation to consider opening a direct  constructive dialogue to finda rapid  negotiated solution to this unfortunate dispute.My country is very concerned about the situation inthe Middle East. It hopes that the new IsraeliAdministration will commit itself more to the peaceprocess begun on 4 September at Sharm el-Sheikh  Egypt for a lasting  fair and harmonious resolution of the Israel-Palestine crisis. We also hope that the other problems regarding Syria and Lebanon  will soon be settled.The question of Jammu and Kashmir continues to beof concern to us. We appeal to India and Pakistan toshow restraint in order to prevent any escalation in theregion.My country welcomes the diplomatic initiatives ofthe United Nations which made it possible for peace to berestored to Kosovo and East Timor.We also welcome the Lomé Peace Agreement of 7July 1999  with regard to the Sierra Leone conflict; theAbuja Agreement and its additional protocols regardingthe conflict in Guinea-Bissau; and the Lusaka ceasefireagreement  signed on 10 July 1999 by the parties to theconflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.Having noted these hopes reasons for hope  wecannot forget the situation in Angola and Somalia and thesituation prevailing between Ethiopia and Eritrea  wherethere are no signs of a solution. The efforts made by theOAU should be supported by our Organization in order toachieve peace and reconciliation in these fraternalcountries.The ideals of peace  security and development arethe responsibility of the international community  whichmust work to make them a reality. Each of us mustcontribute to ensure these values and to build a morehuman  peaceful and just world which is a harbinger ofhope for future generations.18"
"38",1613,"CPV",54,1999,"Mr. President  it gives megreat pleasure to convey to you and your country  Namibia my heartfelt congratulations on your election to thepresidency of the General Assembly for this session. Weare fully confident that your ability  well-known experienceand personal talent will crown our work with success  towhich the delegation of Cape Verde will contribute itsgreatest efforts.We would like to express our appreciation andgratitude to your predecessor  Mr. Didier Opertti ofUruguay  for the professionalism and devotion with whichhe conducted the work of the Assembly at its fifty-thirdsession. We would also like to say that  at a time when theinternational community must confront complex challenges it is a great privilege for the United Nations to be able torely on the creativity  dynamism and determination that theSecretary-General brings to his lofty office.We are pleased to welcome the Republics of Kiribatiand Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga as new members inour Organization.The annual session of the General Assembly whichopened a few days ago will lead us into the nextmillennium; during the session  preparations will be madefor various important events planned for the year 2000 including the special sessions of the General Assembly onthe implementation of the outcome of the World Summitfor Social Development and Further Initiatives and theFourth World Conference on Women.The fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly willalso prepare for a major event  the millennium summit.Therefore  this will be a time when we will need todemonstrate not only our most lucid thinking  but also andperhaps primarily a firm will to act. The core of ourdiscussions will be the great challenges that humanity facestoday and will face in the foreseeable future  and we willneed to identify what must be done to meet themsuccessfully. In that regard  clarification of the role whichthe United Nations must play and specific ways for it toattain this goal must be a priority of the summit agenda.We are at the end of a decade marked by a new phasein international affairs  a decade  however  that was one ofunmet expectations when we think back to how high theywere at its beginning. The experience of the past few yearshas been one of continuous increase in the complexity andfrequency of emerging situations leading to a veritableoverhaul of concepts and perceptions. But we are not surethat we are any closer to the major solutions we lack. Itmight even be said that we have embarked on a processthat has its own logic and momentum and in which theattainment of common aspirations does not always seemto be the driving force. Yet today  and not only today  wehave at our disposal sufficient intellectual and materialresources to build a successful future. It is thereforedisquieting to have to acknowledge that  despite all thispotential  humankind is still incapable of controlling itsown destiny. Acquiring this ability is an imperative therefore  and must be the fundamental goal of ourdebates at the dawn of the new millennium.Given that the destiny of humankind is a collectivechallenge  control over it must be sought collectively forit to be meaningful. The effective implementation of theconcept of “international community”  which has been thebasis of our political philosophy for a long time now  canno longer be avoided or postponed as it has been so far.When the millennium summit meets a year fromnow  the leaders of the world must be prepared to startrebuilding an international community and usher in a newera in which sustainable human development will becomea real right for all peoples; in which international justicewill be more effective; and in which the United NationsCharter will no longer be applied in a manner that bendswith the wind.Democracy as a means of ordering and managingsocieties has seen important progress during this decade.In its most visible aspects  such as the selection of leadersthrough pluralistic  more transparent processes  it isbased on an understanding that governance by electedofficials can and should bring peace  prosperity andjustice to a society and that elected leaders are politicallyaccountable for the results obtained.As we all know  these assumptions are not absoluteand are becoming even less so. When looking atgovernments individually  it is apparent that commandand control of important factors which determine thewell-being of citizens are sorely lacking. Meeting thenecessary conditions for each State to succeed depends toa large extent on multilateral concertation andcooperation. This dialogue between States  however  willnot be enough to resolve all the points at issue  which areincreasingly in the hands of third parties.Today  therefore  there is a growing gap betweensocial responsibility — which remains limited to thepublic and the political domains — and the availability10of the wherewithal and will to act on which thisresponsibility is based. However the situation evolves adjustment must be ensured through revitalization of thissame concept of “international community” to which Ireferred. Once again  this concept proves to be thecornerstone of the quest for a harmonious and prosperousdestiny for humankind.The progress to which we aspire will always coexistwith differences and even inequality. Of that we are wellaware. But the shocking magnitude of poverty today mustprovoke a gut feeling of rejection that makes it imperativefor this situation to be remedied at any cost. The palliativemeasures that we seek to introduce and maintain should notlull us and cannot take the place of definitive solutions. Itis imperative that poverty should no longer be seen as anacceptable or inevitable by-product of the economic andsocial process: rather  we should come to see it as a seriousbreakdown in it that must be attacked and corrected. Evenin societies considered to be well off  poverty victimizescertain segments of the population that lack even theminimum material conditions to live in dignity. The least-developed countries are even less able to roll back povertyin any meaningful way.Speaking of poverty necessarily prompts a discussionof the situation in Africa  where the greatest number ofleast-developed countries are found. We have saidbefore — and this does not detract from Africa's own inherent responsibility — that the way Africa has been leftout of development is also a failure of the internationalsystem. Africa's development difficulties have often beenaggravated by conflicts  but we cannot just wait for peaceto happen there or be discouraged by the current situation.Finally  while conflicts in Africa have many causes economic underdevelopment has been recognized as animportant factor. It is therefore regrettable to witness thereduction in development assistance in Africa; this has adirect negative impact on the living conditions of itspeoples  including a decline in health standards  thedooming to failure of adequate education prospects and aslowdown in provision of the necessary Africaninfrastructure. The impact has been worsened by thedecrease in official development assistance to small islanddeveloping States  some of which — in apparentcontradiction to their particular structural constraints — areshowing relatively acceptable human developmentindicators and higher gross national product per headindicators than those found at the bottom of the worldscale. That  together with the good performance of thesecountries  has often been used to justify a precipitous anddisastrous reduction in official development assistance.We would not claim that our countries should bespared from changing and improving in order to mobilizeand rechannel resources towards these areas and manyothers that I have mentioned. I would  however  stressthat this reduction in assistance  due to a certain “fatigue”that sometimes takes on the appearance of a form ofpunishment  cannot solve anything. Rather  developmentassistance policy should continue to seek means ofcombating and eliminating wasteful activities andguarantee an effective channelling of resources towardsactivities that are necessary to development.Of course  we agree that official developmentassistance is not the key to prosperity. But  added tovigorous strides with regard to debt to ease the currentfinancial stranglehold  it facilitates the creation offavourable human and material conditions for directinvestment  competitiveness  fruitful trade and Africa’slasting integration into the world economy.This reference to Africa’s external debt is not mererhetoric. While welcoming recent steps taken andannounced by countries and groups of creditors that havea particular solidarity with Africa  I must say that thisquestion has for too long been dealt with tooungenerously  too late and too slowly. Today’s steps limited in content and in the range of countries concerned and with overly restrictive eligibility conditions  wouldhave had much more impact if they had been taken whenthey were so urgently demanded a long time ago.Moreover  they would have facilitated the continuationand necessary deepening of the economic and politicalreforms under way on the African continent  and wouldhave stimulated increased African regional cooperation.After 24 years of illegal occupation and extremesuffering inflicted on the people of East Timor  theprocess of self-determination appeared to be leading to anhonourable conclusion for all interested parties. But withgreat dismay and indignation we witnessed violent eventsin the Territory in recent weeks. These vile acts perpetrated by people determined to reverse the choice ofindependence that the Timorese clearly expressed at theballot box  could and should have been prevented  andthey should receive the total rejection and most vigorous effective condemnation of the international community.Since the illegal occupation and annexation of EastTimor by Indonesia  Cape Verde always stronglydefended the cause of the Timorese people and alwaysfought for the retention of the problem of East Timor onthe Assembly's agenda. We reaffirm our tireless support forEast Timor’s independence and for the territorial integrityof this fraternal country  and we call upon the UnitedNations to act with all necessary firmness to promote andguarantee the full implementation of the New Yorkagreements  in particular the provisions of Security Councilresolution 1264 (1999).We therefore welcome the arrival of the InternationalForce in East Timor (INTERFET) and strongly support anynecessary measures it might take to carry out its mission ofrestoring order and security; protecting the Timorese peoplefrom coercion  intimidation  violence and terrorism; andguaranteeing a peaceful transition towards independence.However  our pleasure at the effective quick reactionby the international community as a result of the pressureof worldwide public opinion should not allow us to forgetthe thousands of Timorese suffering great shortages andbrutal violations of their most elementary human rights  orthe men  women and children persecuted and forciblydeported to West Timor and elsewhere in Indonesia simplybecause they freely exercised the right of a people to self-determination under the aegis of the United Nations. Itfollows that the international community has a moral andlegal duty to give them immediate  sufficient humanitarianassistance; to promote and guarantee the return of allTimorese refugees and deported persons  with dignity andsecurity; to bring to international justice all those morallyand physically responsible for crimes against humanity andgross violations of the most fundamental human rights committed in East Timor in a planned  systematic way; andto provide substantial  effective support for thereconstruction of a country which has suffered fromcriminal  premeditated destruction.In Angola  unfortunately  hostilities have resumed andthe prospects for the implementation of the Lusaka Protocolhave vanished  despite United Nations intervention  which it must be acknowledged  has not been successful. Theclear inability of the international community to securestrict compliance by all the parties and States concernedwith the commitments that they undertook underagreements negotiated under the aegis of the UnitedNations  including resolutions of its own bodies  has led tothe re-emergence of this conflict. That is because it has notprevented UNITA from seriously rearming and impedingthe extension of State administration to the whole ofAngola's territory.The magnitude of the long and bloody conflict inAngola should be a source of great concern to theinternational community  which should continue andintensify its efforts to identify possible ways of restoringpeace to Angola  efforts that should be deployed by allthe entities that can contribute. Cape Verde will not failto participate to the extent that its resources allow.One priority must be to bring together everythingneeded to deal with the unprecedented humanitariancatastrophe hitting Angola. The need is great and urgent.Everything possible should be done to provide immediateand adequate humanitarian assistance to the peoplesuffering from the scourge of war.Cape Verde follows with the same fraternalsolidarity developments in neighbouring Guinea-Bissau where the Government is making preparations  with theassistance of the United Nations and the internationalcommunity  to hold free democratic elections.We look forward to the success of the people ofGuinea-Bissau as it enters a new stage in its life  whenthe whole of society is preparing to rebuild its countryand to use all of its resources to improve its livingconditions. We call upon the international community toprovide ongoing generous support to rebuild the countrywithin this long-term process.We welcome recent events reflecting the decision ofthe United Nations to intervene more concretely tomaintain peace in Africa  particularly in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo and Sierra Leone — and we hopesoon in Eritrea and in Ethiopia.Today it is clear that our continent is more than everdetermined to harmonize its efforts to control and resolveconflicts in the region while hoping for the necessaryoutside support to strengthen its capacity in this regard.Regional responsibilities cannot  however  take the placeof the responsibilities of the United Nations  which mustfully play the role given it by the Charter.As well as efforts to contain and resolve conflicts there must be — as has often been stated  but all toooften not put into practice — efforts to prevent them.They are often rooted in long-standing situations ofinjustice  exclusion  inequality and the denial of rights.The latter is something that individuals  groups and evenwhole nations continue to suffer from.12Wherever flouted dignity cannot properly voice itslegitimate demands  wherever those demands do not receivea reasonable response  conflict is brewing. It is true thatsome established situations do not lend themselves to rapidor dramatic change. In those cases sincere dialogue andhealthy compromise may open the way to a progress thatintolerance and lack of willingness can never bring about.While the conflicts prevailing today are basicallyinternal  it would be irresponsible for us to ignore theexternal factors that feed them. From classic territorialdisputes to more diffuse questions with an impact on theacquisition of advantages in economic competition  we seeon the international scene various factors that thwart thedesired security and balance. We must replace the narrowcriterion of national self-interest  or its equivalents  as theparadigm of international affairs with multilateralparticipative arrangements based on equity.Among the items on the agenda that this sessioninherited from the previous one  reform of the SecurityCouncil is a key element for rebuilding and revitalizing theUnited Nations. For some years it has been the subject ofongoing negotiations. This entire time  we feel  was neededfor the various bases and arguments underpinning existingpositions and proposals to be properly understood.The questions posed are complex  and we cannot denythe relevance of any position. The basic divergence  wethink  lies in the priority given by some to the preservationof the Council’s effectiveness and by others to therepresentation of the current body of Member States. Webelieve that the impasse we are facing is clear and that theconsideration we have already given to the matter shouldenable us to take decisions in the not-too-distant future.We believe that increasing the Council’s effectiveness while increasing the number of its members  is a challengewithin our grasp. In our view  we should not give moreweight to the size of the gap  which is quite small  betweenthe various proposals made in this area than to the specialnature of the fundamental principles of representativeparticipation.For example  how can one  by attaching moreimportance to the question of effectiveness  refuse to givethe African countries  which represent almost 30 per centof the United Nations membership  at least two permanentseats enjoying full powers?We hope  Mr. President  that under your enlightenedguidance we can make a big leap forward in theconsideration of this important agenda item during thecurrent session.Before I conclude  I wish to reiterate what a constantsource of inspiration the Charter is to us. I refer inparticular to the noble and always relevant words of thepreamble  whose implementation will be a constantchallenge to us in the course of the century to come."
"39",1659,"CRI",54,1999,"Letme congratulate you  Sir  on your election to the presidencyof this General Assembly  a truly global parliament whereall mankind is represented and finds expression in itsdiversity and its fundamental unity. Your election and yourpersonal qualities honour your country and your region.I would like to congratulate also the delegations ofKiribati  Tonga and Nauru  and through them theirGovernments and peoples  on their recently becomingMembers of this Organization. We are convinced that theywill contribute constructively and positively to the work ofthe United Nations  and that their presence here reaffirmsthe universal and democratic vocation of the GeneralAssembly.We are holding this session at a transcendentalmoment in human history. At the threshold of a newcentury and a new millennium  it is timely for the peoplesof the world to reflect on the future of our countries and ofthe international system. Facing the new millennium  wemust draw lessons from the era that we are leaving behind in which we learned all the good and all the evil that wecan do. We saw the first man walking on the moon  the endof apartheid in South Africa and peace agreements signedin Central America; but we witnessed also the consequencesof the nuclear mushroom cloud and the aberration of theHolocaust  ethnic conflicts and local wars which in the last40 years have caused more deaths than the two world warstogether. We have seen the bright-lights of democracy andfreedom  but also the deep shadows of poverty and theviolation of human rights.This has been a century of great contrasts. While insome parts of the globe peace is signed  in others war isnever ending. While thousands of millions live in poverty a small group lives in opulence. While we celebrate thefiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of HumanRights  in many parts of the world gross violations ofhuman dignity are committed. Yes  this has been a centuryof many contrasts. It has given us plenty of reasons to beproud  but it has also made us ashamed of the cruelty andhardness of the human heart. For these reasons we shouldnever forget the lessons of the twentieth century.In the context of these lessons  we  the 188 nationsgathered here — each with its own flag and symbols  eachwith its own political  commercial and strategic interests each with its own problems  suffering  visions anddreams — express our readiness to take up the challengesof the new century  which must take shape  beginningnow  as the century of human rights and humandevelopment.For these reasons  we have to recognize that thegreatest failure of the United Nations and the internationalcommunity in recent years has been the persistence ofcruel armed conflicts and civil wars  which causecontinued humanitarian crises and prevent the peacefuldevelopment of nations. The real victims of war are thedisplaced and refugee children and elderly  the rapedwomen  the youngsters killed  the workers whoseworkplaces are destroyed  the students whose schools arebombed and the sick who cannot receive treatment. Whilewar persists  human rights cannot be respected.In this sense  we condemn the atrocities committedin East Timor against the civilian population  and we jointhe whole world in demanding that its will  democraticallyexpressed  be respected. We view with satisfaction thequick action of the Security Council  which will allow forthe deployment of an international peacekeeping force inthat Territory in order to prevent a greater humanitariancrisis. In retrospect  this crisis teaches us that theinternational community must be willing to actively andpromptly support the processes that it initiates.Regarding the situation in the Middle East  we watchwith hope the progress in the search for a peaceful anddefinitive solution on the basis of full compliance withthe Oslo accords. We acknowledge the tireless efforts ofPresident Barak  of Israel  and President Arafat  of thePalestinian Authority  and their commitment to peace andthe future of their peoples.I would like to express my condolences to thepeople of the Republic of China on Taiwan for the tragicearthquake that devastated its territory on Monday  20September  and the recent after-shock. My most heartfeltsympathy goes to the families of the victims and theinjured.Costa Rica has a firm relationship with the Republicof China on Taiwan. We admire its shared economicprogress  its respect for human rights and its democracy much promoted by President Lee. Our deep commitmentto the cause of peace prompts us to view with concern thegrowing differences and instability in the region duringthe last year. We fear that these threaten peace and mightunleash a new armaments race. For this reason  we trustthat the differences will be resolved through constructive8dialogue and negotiation in good faith  with respect for theinterests of the whole Chinese people.We must remember that the United Nations wasestablished with precisely the mandate of eradicating thescourge of war  and it must again take the lead in themaintenance of international peace and security. Costa Ricatherefore supports the efforts to reform the SecurityCouncil  which cannot be limited simply to an increase inthe number of its members  even if this might be useful.Rather  the reform effort must centre on the Council’srevitalization.Fifty years ago Costa Rica abolished its army. In linewith this example  it has advocated disarmament throughoutthe history of the United Nations  in order to build a worldof progress and peace. The abolition of the army allowedour society to become an example of dialogue  respect andthe peaceful coexistence of all social groups. Costa Ricaactively promotes demilitarization because it knows itsextraordinary benefits for human development; in thiscontext  we have proposed the creation of a fund for thedemilitarization of Central America  as well as thestrengthening of  and full compliance with  the mechanismsof international law  in order to guarantee internationalpeace and security and respect for human rights throughoutthe world.Costa Rica considers that humanitarian crises are inthemselves threats to international peace and security. Whenthey arise  the United Nations and the Security Councilmust not attempt to avoid their responsibility  whateverreasons are invoked. Nowadays any massive violation ofhuman rights  any humanitarian emergency  requires thecoordinated action of the international community  throughthis Organization. For there to be justice at the global level the rule of law and full compliance with the principles thatgave birth to the United Nations must prevail.In this context  we recall the importance of the promptestablishment of the International Criminal Court  and thuscall on all States that have not yet done so to sign theStatute with a view to its prompt ratification  and wereiterate the need to accelerate the negotiations on its rulesof procedure. Costa Rica hopes to receive promptly thefinal text in order to proceed to its ratification.Furthermore  we must recognize that conflicts andcrises are multifaceted and that they present a series ofpolitical  military and economic problems. In this context action undertaken by the United Nations must be designednot only to re-establish peace in military terms but also tore-establish peace in terms of social justice  democracyand development. The actions taken by this Organizationshould not be centred only on the Security Council butmust actively include the General Assembly  theEconomic and Social Council and the United NationsDevelopment Programme as participants in the peace-building process.My people’s manifest desire is for the new centuryto be truly the century of human rights and humandevelopment. I would like to express to the internationalcommunity the desire of a people that  since thenineteenth century  has been building the foundation of afar-sighted society by balancing in a single equationrespect for human rights  freedom  peace  active tolerance fraternity  democracy and solidarity.The end of the cold war  the knowledge-basedeconomy  awareness of gender issues  an understanding ofthe rights of the persons with disabilities and ofminorities  respect for the rights of the future generationsand for environmental protection  and the processes ofglobalization have all begun to delineate a new humanorder: a twenty-first century with a more human mankind.In this new context  which is just now showing its initialcharacteristics  the human development agenda and thehuman rights agenda must coincide and complement eachother. The twenty-first century is taking shape as that inwhich individuals and peoples will demand the right tohuman development  which is nothing more than theappropriate implementation and effectiveness of theinstitutions of freedom: human rights  the rule of law pluralism  competition  solidarity and harmony withnature.It is at once a right and a duty to take part  actively creatively and jointly  in the creation of suchdevelopment  because the twenty-first century is calledupon to be the century of high-intensity citizenship. Maleand female citizens are  together with the State and theinternational community  the creators of their ownopportunities and the builders of their own development.Passivity is a thing of the past.We in Costa Rica who are part of this changegreatly value the foresight and sense of responsibility ofour forefathers  which have made of our small motherlandthe second-ranking country in Latin America in terms ofhuman development and the oldest and most stabledemocracy in the region. Even as early as the end of thenineteenth century  Costa Ricans enjoyed the continent’shighest levels of education and health  thanks to the9country’s far-sighted devotion to education  the rule of law democracy  social solidarity and international trade. Sincethe early days of our independent and republican life solidarity and human rights  in their fullness  have been away of life for us Costa Ricans. Not in vain was our firstConstitution called the “Covenant of Harmony”. Thus  lastyear when hurricane Mitch devastated Central America  inthe midst of the pain over the loss of Costa Rican lives andthe serious economic damage  we also took on the sufferingof our Central American brothers and sisters. We were sideby side with them  sharing with them our food  medicineand territory.Faithful to its humanitarian tradition  Costa Ricaimplemented the most generous immigration policy putforward by any nation in recent years  giving hundreds ofthousands of illegal immigrants from the region —amounting to more than 10 per cent of our population —the opportunity to normalize their situation with a minimumof requirements  as well as the opportunity to enjoy fullequality with our nationals in access to our social welfareinstitutions. We hope that other countries that are soughtout by immigrants because of war  poverty  naturalcatastrophes and ethnic conflicts will follow this example.Our country is making great efforts to look after thesehundreds of thousands of immigrants; therefore  we reiterateour need to be helped so that we can strengthen the health education and basic-services systems that we use in orderto meet their needs.At this end of the century  it has been my task topromote vital transformations for the future of our smallnation. We are protecting human beings even before theyare born. We are fighting against child labour and thesexual exploitation of minors. We are opening havens forour adolescent mothers  and we are fighting the aggressionsuffered by women in many homes the world over. We arestrengthening the family  providing it with more and betteropportunities. We are working in favour of the rights ofelder adults and those of workers  in order to deepen oursocial achievements of the 1940s and to guarantee aretirement pension in old age as a universal human right.Costa Rica is today acknowledged to be the healthiestsociety in Latin America  with high levels of computerliteracy. It is the oldest democracy on the continent and aleader in the conservation and protection of theenvironment. Its human development levels are comparableto those of developed countries. Nevertheless  we faceserious problems that prevent us from indulging inmisguided self-congratulation.We are aware that progress in the field ofdevelopment depends on our own actions and on theinternational context. Human  civil  cultural  economic political and social rights have equal importance andcomplement one another. Having acknowledged theindivisibility and interdependence of these rights  it is amatter of concern that there is still some reluctance toaccept the right of all nations to human development.The awarding of the Nobel Prize to Amartya Sen forhis work on the welfare economy and on theunderstanding of poverty  inequality and hunger remindsus that global development must include the fight againstinequalities and extreme poverty. This  however  must notbe a struggle in which developed countries take part onlyout of a feeling of human solidarity; rather  it must be astruggle that involves the entire system of nations throughthe creation of appropriate instruments and mechanismsfor action that offer opportunities for developmentthrough trade and investment. We welcomed the views ofHarvard University economist Jeffrey Sachs — publishedrecently in The Economist and supported yesterday byPresident Clinton and today by Vice-Chancellor Fischerof Germany — regarding the urgent need to establish newmechanisms to ensure the necessary resources for thepurchase of medicines and vaccines to combat tropicaldiseases  thus securing their development and ensuringtheir distribution to the poorest and most helpless sectorsof mankind.Costa Rica has spoken out to have the internationaleconomic order allow the development of those countriesthat are lagging behind. If we do not take action in thisdirection  the conditions necessary for the long-termmaintenance of international peace and security will notbe created. We have constantly advocated a more just andequitable economic and commercial order  one that willprovide all nations with access to the benefits of theglobalization process and that will provide smalldeveloping States with better opportunities to enter intocommercial agreements. Before the European Union wehave also advocated secure and tariff-free access for LatinAmerican agricultural products to the European Unionmarkets  whose protectionism costs Latin America $4.223billion dollars annually.In order to promote the development of small States it is indispensable to establish open trade systems so thattrade and investment can become engines of economicgrowth and so that more and better opportunities foremployment will be created in a region that sufferspoverty and unemployment.10The developed countries' trade restrictions are barriersto our human development  as are the policies of theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to restrictsupplies of oil and to raise its price artificially at a timewhen the traditional exports of Latin America are sufferinga dramatic slump in prices.On the other hand  the nations gathered here face thechallenge of building an international financial system thatwill protect small States from economic crises. Smalleconomies do not cause the crises  but we do suffer theiradverse effects and we have not received the necessarysupport to face them. To correct this situation  Costa Ricaproposes the creation of a precautionary fund with aflexible and speedy financial mechanism to solve thefinancial emergencies of small and vulnerable States  whichare frequently forgotten by the international financialcommunity because of their limited global impact.As a country that has succeeded in building a cultureof protecting and preserving the environment  we stress  aswe did at the summit between Europe and Latin Americaheld this year in Rio de Janeiro  the urgent need to build aninternational system that will reward those who protect theenvironment and penalize those who contaminate or destroyit. Currently  my country is developing a system ofpayments to the owners of forests for environmentalservices and more than one fourth of our territory isprotected in reservations or national parks. Costa Ricareiterates the need to take action to better apply the KyotoProtocol; to make greater use of new markets; and todetermine efficiently the costs of pollution and the profitsof preservation in order to maintain the sustainable use ofnatural resources.Jointly with Norway  we performed the first globaltransaction of certificates of greenhouse-gases reduction.This mechanism should receive the support of all countries not only in order to apply the right to human andsustainable development in each country  but also to extendthe life of the human species on our planet. Let us recallthat  in this task  the obligations are shared butdifferentiated. It is time to move from words to deeds.It is clear that  if financial systems of broadercoverage are not established; if more open trade schemesare not implemented; if protectionism by developedcountries  which limits our access to their markets  is notreduced; and if the global benefits of our forests are notrecognized  developing countries will see a decline in theiropportunities for economic growth; inequalities willincrease; poverty will further deepen; political stability andsocial peace will be threatened; the loss of naturalresources will rise; and illegal immigration towardsdeveloped nations will intensify  all creating anenvironment of instability and uncertainty harmful to thenew millennium.Wanting the developed countries to recognize theright to human development of small countries is notutopian. It is the real aspiration of those peoples that havefaced with meagre resources the tragedies of wars and thewrath of nature. Solidarity and fraternity among nationsmust be genuine. The twenty-first century awaits us. Letus all join hands. Humankind must enter this new ageunited. The twenty-first century must be the century ofhuman rights — the century of human development."

Moreover  that differencegrows year by year.There are representatives of countries that appear tohave a promising future. These are the countries with only20 per cent of the world's population  but 86 per cent of itsgross domestic product  82 per cent of world exportmarkets  68 per cent of direct foreign investment  and 74per cent of all of the telephone lines on the planet.What can we say about the future of those whom werepresent here who account for 80 per cent of the world'spopulation  living in countries that were colonized andplundered for centuries to increase the wealth of the formermetropolises? It is true that time has passed  and that ourhistory is what it is and not what we might have wished itto be. But must we simply resign ourselves to a future thatis essentially the same?Can we feel reassured knowing that the wealth of thethree richest people in the world is greater than thecombined gross domestic product of the 48 least developedcountries  with their population of 600 million  whoserepresentatives are present in this hall today demandingjustice?In this hall today we have representatives of countrieswhere most of the population — which is hardly growingat all — are guaranteed decent living standards and wheresome live in opulence. These populations spend $12 billionon perfume and $17 billion on pet food every year.But there is a majority represented in this hall that hasno reason to feel optimistic. This majority comprises 900million people who go hungry and 1.3 billion who live inpoverty. My brothers and sisters here today representingAfrica have no reason to feel reassured. They know thattoday there are 23 million people on their continent who areHIV-positive. They also know that it costs $12 000 to treatjust one person infected with the virus  which means that itwould take almost $300 billion a year for all the AIDSpatients in Africa to receive the same treatment currentlyprovided to AIDS sufferers in wealthy countries.Could my colleagues representing 6 billion of theplanet's inhabitants — to which a further 80 million areadded every year  almost all of them in the ThirdWorld — really think that a situation like this couldcontinue unchanged into the next century?How can any of us prevent the continued growth inthe number of emigrants from poor nations who flock tothe wealthy countries in pursuit of a dream  while thecurrent world order does not allow them to find theconditions for a decent life in their own countries?A small number of representatives in this hallrepresent countries that have no need to fear a militarythreat in the coming century. Some even have nuclearweapons  belong to a powerful alliance or build up theirarmies every year with better  more sophisticatedweapons. They are the ones who view the rest of theworld as merely the Euro-Atlantic periphery of the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization  and therefore they willnever have to endure the devastation of massive bombingsby invisible attackers acting under what has come to beknown as a new strategic concept of that aggressivemilitary organization.But the vast majority of those of us gathered heretoday do not enjoy such security. We are troubled to seethat in a world dominated by a single military andtechnological Power  we are today less safe than duringthe difficult years of the cold war.If one day we wished to call upon the SecurityCouncil to discuss a situation that we viewed as a threatto one of our poor countries  does the Assembly thinkthat we would be heard? I fear that recent examples haveproved otherwise.Why is there no discussion in the Assembly aboutgeneral and complete disarmament  including nucleardisarmament? Why is the issue limited to controllingsmall arms  which are necessary in a case such as that ofCuba — a country attacked and under blockade for 40years? Why is there no mention of the deadly laser-guided bombs  the depleted uranium missiles  or thecluster or graphite bombs used indiscriminately by theUnited States in bombing the civilian populations inKosovo?Could anyone claim that our children will inherit ajust and secure world if we do not change the unfair andunequal standards that are currently used to measureissues of such key importance to our collective security?14Must we also accept the imposition of free marketrules and the sacred law of supply and demand in the brutalcommerce of death? What is stopping the internationalcommunity from attempting  in a rational and coordinatedmanner  to redirect a large part of the $780 billion currentlyused for military expenditures to promoting development inthe Third World countries?That is why we so passionately defend respect for theprinciples of international law  which have guided relationsamong all of the world's countries for more than half acentury. What would we have left to defend ourselves inthe future if we poor countries were no longer able to relyon such principles as respect for sovereignty and self-determination  the sovereign equality of all States and non-interference in the internal affairs of other nations? Howcould we call on the international community to protest athreat against one of our countries if those principles  whichare today systematically and flagrantly violated  were to bestruck from the Charter of the United Nations?In a unipolar world  attempts to impose notions suchas the limitation of sovereignty  and humanitarianintervention  do not advance international security: theypose a threat to the countries of the Third World  whichhave neither powerful armies nor nuclear weapons. Suchattempts must therefore be brought to an end: they violatethe letter and the spirit of the Charter.At the same time  we believe it is necessary to defendthe United Nations  now more than ever. We defend theneed for its existence as much as we do the need todemocratize it. The challenge facing us is that of reformingthe United Nations so that it serves the interests of allnations equally. We defend both the need for the existenceof the Security Council and the need to make it moreinclusive  democratic and transparent. Why not expand thenumber of permanent members? Why could not the Councilinclude at least two or three new permanent members fromLatin America  Africa and Asia? The membership now isthree times the number of countries which founded theUnited Nations in San Francisco in 1945  and the vastmajority of them — the Third World countries — do nothave a single permanent member to represent them.However  we do not defend the right of veto. We donot believe that anyone should have it. But if it is notpossible to eliminate it  we should at least attempt to ensurethat this prerogative is more evenly shared  and provide thatall new permanent members have the right of veto. Why if the right of veto cannot be eliminated now  is it notrestricted to votes on proposed measures under Chapter VIIof the Charter? As things stand at present  a singlecountry can override the will of all the other UnitedNations Members. And there is one country that hasexercised its unlimited right to veto an infinite number oftimes: the United States. This is untenable.At the United Nations  we must curb the attempt toimpose a single way of thinking on us by trying to makeus believe that it is our way  or that it is superior to ourrich diversity of cultures and models  or that it is moreadvanced and modern than our multiplicity of identities.To survive  we must resist being treated as merely theEuro-Atlantic periphery and oppose having labelled asglobal threats the problems that we face as consequencesof colonialism: underdevelopment; the consumerism ofthe wealthy countries; and even the results of their recentor current policies.Here in this Hall are the representatives of the Groupof 7  whose countries have 685 million inhabitants andeconomies with a combined gross domestic product of$20 trillion. Also present are the rest of us  who representthe remaining 181 countries  with more than 5 billioninhabitants and economies with a combined grossdomestic product of barely $10 trillion. Yes  we are allequal under the Charter of the United Nations  but not inreal life.While rich countries have the transnationalcorporations that control over one third of all of theworld's exports  we poor countries have the asphyxiatingburden of external debt  which has risen to the level of $2trillion and continues to grow  devouring almost 25 percent of our export earnings just to service our debt. Howcan development be possible under these conditions?While we speak insistently in this Hall of the need for anew international financial architecture  our countries arebeing buffeted by the scourge of a system that allows thedaily occurrence of speculative transactions worth $3trillion. That structure cannot be fixed; it is not a matterof remodelling it  but rather of demolishing it andrebuilding it anew.Can anyone explain the logic of this phantomeconomy that produces nothing and is sustained bybuying and selling things that do not exist? Should we orshould we not demolish this chaotic financial system andbuild upon its ruins a system that favours production takes differences into account and stops forcing ourbattered economies to endlessly pursue the impossibleillusion of increasing financial reserves? Sooner or later those reserves evaporate in the course of the desperate15and unfair battle to defend our currencies from the strongand highly favoured currency of the anachronistic BrettonWoods accord  the sacrosanct dollar.When the history of these years is written  it will bevery difficult to explain how a single country was able toaccumulate so many privileges and such absolute power.What will the economists of the next century say when theyrealize that the United States was able to live with a currentaccount deficit that is already about $300 billion withoutthe International Monetary Fund (IMF) having imposedeven one of the severe adjustment programmes that areimpoverishing the countries of the third world?Who will explain the fact that  thanks to the privilegeof having the world's reserve currency  the Americans  saveless and spend more than anyone else in the world? Willanyone tell them that in 1998 they were able to import$124 billion worth of cars and spend $8 billion incosmetics  thanks in good measure to the fact that theycontrolled 17.8 per cent of the votes of the InternationalMonetary Fund  which gives them a virtual right of veto?How can we explain to the people of Tanzania  forexample  that while all of this was happening they had tospend nine times as much on servicing the foreign debtthan on primary health care  and four times as much as onprimary education?The current international economic system is not onlyprofoundly unjust  but also absolutely unsustainable. Aneconomic system that destroys the environment cannot besustained. The world's supply of drinking water today is 60per cent of what it was in 1970; and today there are 2.3billion more human beings on the planet than there wereback then. The same is happening with our forests. Couldanyone in this Hall defend the proposition that such a paceof destruction can go on indefinitely?An economic system based on the irrationalconsumption patterns of the rich countries  which are laterexported to our own countries through the mass media cannot be sustained. Why not accept that it is possible toprovide a decent life to all the people of the planet with theresources that are within our reach and the degree oftechnological development we have achieved  through arational and solidarity-based exploitation of all thispotential?How will they explain that the member countries ofthe Organisation for Economic Cooperation andDevelopment  whose representatives I now address with alldue respect  have fallen so far behind as to provide lessthan one third of their 1970 commitment to dedicate aminimum of 0.7 per cent of their gross national productto official development assistance?I asked a member of our delegation  a Deputy in ourNational Assembly and a professed Christian  what theBible would say about such an unjust economic order. Heresponded quickly with the words of a Prophet from theHoly Book:“Woe unto them that decree unrighteousdecrees  and that write grievousness which they haveprescribed;To turn aside the needy from judgment  and to takeaway the right from the poor of my people  thatwidows may be their prey  and that they may robthe fatherless!And what will ye do in the day of visitation  and inthe desolation which shall come from afar? to whomwill ye flee for help? and where will ye leave yourglory?” (The Holy Bible  Isaiah 10: 1-3)I know that many people in this Hall share theseconcerns  and I also know that almost all of us are askingourselves the same question. Can the World TradeOrganization (WTO) be spared from becoming a fiefdomof the United States and its allies  as the InternationalMonetary Fund and the World Bank are today? Will wetruly succeed in making the World Trade Organization thedemocratic and transparent forum we need  or will thepowerful interests of a minority be imposed to thedetriment of the silent majority  which is too divided confused and unsuspecting to understand the dangers ofa cold and dogmatic liberalization of world trade? Willthey remember that the vast majority of third worldcountries  dependent on the export of a single agriculturalproduct or a few spices  will be wiped out of world tradeand crushed by the fierce competition of a fewtransnational corporations? Should we or should we nottake these realities into account and accept the need toprotect the interests of the underdeveloped countries  ifonly to guarantee their very survival?How will we poor countries be able to compete ifour professionals leave for the wealthy nations in pursuitof better opportunities; if we are not even allowed to keepour athletes and we must watch with sorrow as theycompete under another country's flag? How will we poornations be able to compete economically if the 10 most16developed countries control 95 per cent of the patentsissued in the last 20 years  and intellectual property  farfrom being liberalized  is ever more closely protected?Talking to us poor countries about trade through theInternet is almost a joke  when we know that 91 per cent ofInternet users live in the member countries of theOrganisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.Will we ever see a change in the current situation  in whichthere are over 600 telephone lines for every 1 000 peoplein the United States  Sweden and Switzerland  yet only 1telephone per 1 000 people in Cambodia  Chad andAfghanistan?As part of this tragic depiction of the situation facingthe vast majority of countries in the world  I feel bound totalk about my own country. The situation in Cuba is aneloquent example  if ever there was one  of what should notbe done in terms of relations between powerful and smallnations.For more than 40 years  my people have beensubjected to a brutal policy of hostility and all kinds ofaggression imposed by the United States. High-levelauthorities in that country have openly admitted that thispolicy is aimed at destroying the political and economicsystem built by the Cuban people of their own free will andat restoring the neo-colonial power that the United Statesheld over Cuba and definitively lost on 1 January 1959 with the triumph of the Cuban revolution.As has been made clear by events  public statementsby American spokespersons and by declassified secretUnited States documents  this policy of aggression has beencarried out through means that have ranged from politicaland diplomatic measures  propaganda campaigns  espionageand subversion  and fostering defection and illegalemigration  to acts of terrorism  sabotage and biologicalwarfare. This policy has also included the organization andsupport of armed groups; air and naval raids against ourterritory; the hatching of over 600 plots to assassinate theleader of our revolution; a military invasion by a mercenaryarmy; the most serious threat ever of a global nuclearconflict  in October 1962; and finally  a brutal commercialand financial blockade and a ferocious economic waragainst my country that have now lasted 40 years.Let me set aside the economic aspects of thisaggression against Cuba and deal solely with the physicalaggression and acts of war carried out by the United StatesGovernment. Recently Cuban social organizations  onbehalf of the entire population of Cuba  filed a civil lawsuitagainst the United States Administration claimingreparation and compensation for loss and damagesresulting from the deaths of 3 478 Cuban citizens and fora further 2 099 survivors who have been left disabled asa consequence of the covert plots and the “dirty war”waged by the United States. The suit demands that theUnited States Government  which is responsible for thesehuman losses and injuries  be sentenced to pay a total of$181.1 billion in reparation as a minimum symboliccompensation for the loss of something that is clearlyirreplaceable and priceless: the lives and physical well-being of the more than 5 500 Cuban citizens who havebeen victims of the United States' obsessive policy againstCuba.At the open and public trial  televised nationwide  atwhich this claim was considered  it was clearly provedthat the United States Government was directlyresponsible for this continued aggression  and that theundeclared war against Cuba had constituted an officialState policy enforced by no fewer than nine successiveUnited States Administrations over the last 40 years.What will they tell their grandchildren  these leaders officials and agents of the United States Governmentwhose consciences are weighed down by the guilt ofplanning and carrying out this “dirty war” against Cubaand by the moral burden of responsibility for the death ofthousands of Cubans?Can we possibly allow an international system tocontinue into the next century that accords total impunityfor monstrous actions such as these  which have beensystematically and flagrantly perpetrated by a majorPower?The ferocious economic blockade that extends toevery facet of our country's foreign trade and financialrelations merits particular attention. This blockade  whichhas lasted over 40 years  began to develop before thetriumph of the revolution. A secret United Statesdocument  declassified in 1991  reveals that on 23December 1958  at a National Security Council meetingattended by President Dwight Eisenhower at which thesituation in Cuba was discussed  the then-Director of theCentral Intelligence Agency (CIA)  Allen Dulles categorically stated: “We must prevent a Castro victory”.Three days later  on 26 December  PresidentEisenhower instructed the CIA that he did not wish thespecifics of covert operations against Cuba to be17presented to the National Security Council. Everything hadto be kept strictly secret.The sudden and overwhelming triumph of therevolutionary forces six days later did not give them timeto prevent a Castro victory. The first United States assaulton the national economy took place on 1 January 1959 when those who had looted the public treasury fled for theUnited States  together with the perpetrators of the worstmassacres and abuses against the Cuban people.Five weeks after the triumph of the revolution economist Felipe Pazos  a professional man — well knownand respected in United States Government circles — whohad been appointed by the revolutionary Government totake over the management of the Cuban National Bank announced on 6 February that the former regime hadembezzled or seized $424 million from the gold and dollarreserves that backed the Cuban peso. The New York Timessubsequently corroborated the report's claim concerning thetheft of the funds  which constituted the country's onlyreserves.The spoils of this colossal theft ended up in UnitedStates banks. Not a dime was returned to Cuba. TheNational Bank immediately requested a modest quantity offunds to deal with this highly critical situation. That requestwas turned down.The Agrarian Reform Act  enacted on 17 May 1959 was aimed at providing food for the vast majority of ourundernourished people and direct or indirect employmentfor the large percentage of the population that was thenunemployed. It was enacted when the word socialism hadnot yet been spoken in Cuba; however  it provoked anextreme reaction in the United States  whose companiesowned much of the best and most fertile land in Cuba.Cuba's willingness  stipulated in the Act itself  to providethe owners with deferred compensation paid out inreasonable and workable instalments was met with animmediate demand from the United States Government forprompt  effective and full cash compensation. There wasnothing in the public coffers with which to meet thisdemand.A month later  on 24 June  at a meeting called by theState Department to consider options for action againstCuba  the view was put forth that the United States shouldtake a very strong stance forthwith against the Act and itsimplementation  and that the best way to achieve thenecessary results was through economic pressure. Theelimination of the Cuban sugar cane quota from the UnitedStates market was proposed. According to a declassifieddocument  this would cause the sugar industry to sufferan abrupt and immediate decline  causing widespreadhigher unemployment; the large numbers of peoplethereby forced out of work would begin to go hungry. Atthat same meeting  Secretary of State Herter explicitlydescribed these proposals as measures of economicwarfare.In a memorandum dated 6 April 1960  Mr. L. D.Mallory  a senior State Department official  stated that:“The only foreseeable means of alienating internalsupport is through disenchantment and disaffectionbased on economic dissatisfaction and hardship ...every possible means should be undertaken promptlyto weaken the economic life of Cuba”.He suggested taking:“... a line of action which ... makes the greatestinroads in denying money and supplies to Cuba  todecrease monetary and real wages  to bring abouthunger  desperation and the overthrow of theGovernment.”On 6 July of that same year  the United Statesadopted one of the measures proposed: the elimination ofthe Cuban sugar quota. Never again would the UnitedStates buy a single pound of sugar from Cuba. A marketthat was established over the course of more than 100years between the United States and Cuba  with Cubaguaranteeing the supply of this essential food product tothe United States and its allies during the first half of thecentury  including during the two World Wars from whichthe United States emerged as the wealthiest  mostpowerful nation in the world  was wiped out in a second dealing a cruel blow to the country's major source ofemployment and wealth and depriving it of essentialfunds for the food  medicine  fuel and raw materialsneeded to ensure the material survival of our people.From that time on  successive economic measuresagainst the Cuban people continued to accumulate untilthey formed a absolute and total blockade  which went sofar as to prevent Cuba from importing even an aspirinproduced in the United States  or from exporting to thatcountry a single flower grown in Cuba.This complete blockade  cynically referred to inofficial terminology with the euphemistic and apparentlyinnocuous word “embargo”  has continued to intensify18over the past 40 years. At the most critical and difficulttime in our history  when the Union of Soviet SocialistRepublics and the socialist bloc collapsed  and with themthe basic markets and sources of supply that the countrycould count on to withstand the ferocious economic warfarewaged against an island only 90 miles from the UnitedStates coast  they decided to be yet more unyielding in theirapproach to Cuba: with truly vulgar and repugnantopportunism  the blockade was intensified to the maximum.The so-called Torricelli Act of 1992  among otherrestrictive measures that greatly affected the maritimetransport of food and other commodities between Cuba andthe rest of the world  prohibited United States subsidiariesbased in third countries from trading with Cuba. This putan end to commercial operations that amounted to over$700 million in imports of foodstuffs and medicines fromthose countries. This genocidal policy reached even moreinfamous heights with the Helms-Burton Act  whichcodified all previous administrative restrictions  expandedand tightened the blockade and established it in perpetuity.Subsequent to the passage of that law  and with theaim of tightening even further the blockade against theCuban people  numerous amendments  introduced into billsof such urgency and length that many United Stateslawmakers did not even have time to read them  wereadopted by show of hands in the United States Congress.The Cuban-American terrorist mafia  which is closelylinked to the extreme right wing  has achieved its goal ofchanging the blockade from an order from the executiveinto rigorous and inflexible legislation. The genocidethereby became institutionalized.Following a 1997 study of the consequences of theblockade for health  the American Association for WorldHealth concluded that it violates the most basicinternational agreements and conventions governing humanrights standards  including the United Nations Charter  theCharter of the Organization of American States and theGeneva Convention Relative to the Protection of CivilianPersons in time of War. The Geneva Conventions  to whichsome 165 countries  including the United States  are parties require the free passage of all medical supplies andfoodstuffs intended for civilian use in time of war. TheUnited States and Cuba are not at war. Indeed  theirGovernments have even maintain diplomatic representationin Havana and Washington. However  the AmericanAssociation for World Health has determined that theembargo's restrictions are a deliberate blockade of theCuban population's access to food and medicine inpeacetime.In the same report  the American Association forWorld Health expresses its belief that the United Statesembargo against Cuba has dramatically harmed the healthand nutrition of a large number of ordinary Cubancitizens and concludes that the embargo has significantlyincreased suffering in Cuba  to the point of causing death.For seven consecutive years  the Assembly hasconsistently adopted a resolution on the need to end theeconomic blockade imposed by the Government of theUnited States of America on the Cuban people. Thecondemnation of that genocidal policy has visibly grownfrom year to year: year on year between 1992 and 1998 the Cuban resolution against the blockade received 59  88 101  117  137  143 and 157 votes in favour  while theUnited States obtained only 3  4  2  3  3  3 and 2 votes including its own. Given the absolute contemptdemonstrated by the United States with regard to theseGeneral Assembly resolutions  the people of Cuba havedecided  independently of the battle taking place in thisAssembly  to resort to the legal procedures to which theyare entitled in order to demand the appropriate sanctionsagainst those responsible for such acts of genocide.Cuba's initiative is based on a solid and irrefutablelegal foundation. The Convention on the Prevention andPunishment of the Crime of Genocide was adopted by theAssembly on 9 December 1948 and signed by theGovernment of the United States of America on 11December 1948 and by the Republic of Cuba on 28December 1949. It entered into force on 12 January 1951and has been signed and ratified by 124 States. Article IIof that Convention reads:“In the present Convention  genocide means any ofthe following acts committed with intent to destroy in whole or in part  a national  ethnical  racial orreligious group”.In subparagraph (c)  it immediately goes on toinclude  among these acts “Deliberately inflicting on the group conditionsof life calculated to bring about its physicaldestruction in whole or in part”.Article III stipulates that the following acts  amongothers  shall be punishable: “(a) Genocide; ... (d) Attemptto commit genocide; (e) Complicity in genocide”. Itexplicitly states in article IV that19“Persons committing genocide or any of the otheracts enumerated in article III shall be punished whether they are constitutionally responsible rulers public officials or private individuals”.The Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection ofCivilian Persons in Time of War was signed on 12 August1949  and was ratified by the Governments of the UnitedStates and Cuba; it entered into force on 21 October 1950.A total of 188 States are currently parties to theConvention. Article 23 decrees that“Each High Contracting Party shall allow the freepassage of all consignments of medical and hospitalstores and objects necessary for religious worshipintended only for civilians of another HighContracting Party  even if the latter is its adversary. Itshall likewise permit the free passage of allconsignments of essential foodstuffs  clothing andtonics intended for children under fifteen  expectantmothers and maternity cases”.The first Protocol Additional to that Conventionspecifically  precisely and categorically stipulates  in itsarticle 54  entitled “Protection of objects indispensable tothe survival of the civilian population”  that“1. Starvation of civilians as a method of warfareis prohibited.“2. It is prohibited to attack  destroy  remove orrender useless objects indispensable to the survival ofthe civilian population  such as foodstuffs  agriculturalareas for the production of foodstuffs  crops  livestock drinking water installations and supplies and irrigationworks  for the specific purpose of denying them fortheir sustenance value to the civilian population or tothe adverse Party  whatever the motive  whether inorder to starve out civilians  to cause them to moveaway  or for any other motive”.Article VII of the 1948 Convention on genocide states without room for the slightest doubt  that“Persons charged with genocide or any of theother acts enumerated in article III shall be tried by acompetent tribunal of the State in the territory ofwhich the act was committed”.Subparagraph (e) of article III of that Conventionstipulates with the same precision that accomplices togenocide shall also be punished.As a consequence  the National Assembly ofPeople's Power of the Republic of Cuba declared on 13September 1999: first  that the economic blockadeimposed on Cuba by the Government of the United Statesconstitutes an international crime of genocide inaccordance with the definition stipulated in theConvention on the Prevention and Punishment of theCrime of Genocide  adopted by the General Assembly on9 December 1948; second  that  on the basis of thearguments put forward and of the foregoing statement  itproclaims Cuba's right to demand that such acts bepunished; third  that as a result of the grave  systematicand ongoing genocide carried out over the course of 40years against the people of Cuba  and in accordance withinternational standards  principles  agreements and laws Cuban courts have the right to try and punish the guiltyparties  whether they be present or absent; fourth  thatacts of genocide and other war crimes are not subject toany statute of limitations; fifth  that the guilty parties canbe punished even with a sentence of life imprisonment;sixth  that criminal responsibility does not exempt theaggressor State from providing material compensation forthe human and economic damage it may have caused; andseventh  that it calls on the international community forsupport in this struggle to defend the most elementaryprinciples of justice  the right to life  peace and thefreedom of all peoples.Here in this Hall today  as members of the Cubandelegation to the General Assembly at its fifty-fourthsession  there are three young Cubans representing ourcountry's university students  secondary-school students and children and adolescents. They are here on behalf ofthe social organizations that went before the relevantcourts to file the claim against the United StatesGovernment  demanding reparations and compensation forthe damages and injuries suffered by thousands of people.Those same organizations also took the legal initiative ofproposing to the National Assembly of People's Power theproclamation I have just cited.Here with us as well are three outstandingpersonalities in Cuban medicine  Deputies in the NationalAssembly  who have testified before that body on thetragic harm that has resulted from the blockade onmedicines imposed against our country. There are alsothree Christian deputies  whose profound ethical  religiousand human convictions led them to support theproclamation made in our National Assembly demandingthe trial and punishment of the guilty parties.20These individuals are prepared to respond  here in theUnited States  to any questions posed to them  or to meetwith the press  academic institutions  non-governmentalorganizations  legislators  senators or even any committeeof the United States Congress. We are prepared not only tomake accusations  but also to engage in debate and provethe facts that support them."
"41",1774,"CYP",54,1999,"I would like to extend mywarmest congratulations to you  Sir  on your election asPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourthsession. I have no doubt that your long experience andproven diplomatic skills will guide the work of this sessionto a successful conclusion. Moreover  we interpret yourelection as a well-deserved recognition of your country Namibia  for which the Cypriot people entertain feelings ofadmiration and friendship.I would also like to take the opportunity to express myappreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Opertti of Uruguay for the determined leadership with which he steered thework of the fifty-third session.Cyprus joins other States in extending a warmwelcome to the new Members of the United Nations: theRepublic of Kiribati  the Republic of Nauru and theKingdom of Tonga.As we are rapidly approaching the dawn of the newmillennium  we have an obligation to reaffirm ourcommitment to this truly global Organization and to theideas that have made the United Nations the hope ofmankind for a world governed by peace  justice and therule of law.And yet  the challenges that we face seem at timesinsurmountable. Our world is characterized by a large arrayof old and constantly emerging new problems  such asviolent international conflicts and internal strife. Moreover the United Nations has to respond to many challenges  suchas the eradication of poverty  sustainable development  thefight against terrorism and drug trafficking  the control ofepidemics and natural disasters  and the proliferation ofweapons of mass destruction.The Organization's efforts in these areas have beenconsiderable and must not be underestimated. I take thisopportunity to reaffirm my Government's strongcommitment to the United Nations and our support for theongoing efforts to reform it  so that it will be able tosuccessfully meet the considerable challenges that lieahead.Cyprus will work towards the successful conclusionof the Millennium Assembly. We look forward to aninteractive Summit. We anticipate an in-depth and result-oriented discussion  with the participation of civil society during the work of the many special sessions on variousfacets of the Organization's work.One of the major issues of concern to all humanityis disarmament. I would like to reaffirm our support forthese efforts including  inter alia  a strengthened reviewprocess of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons (NPT) and the effective implementation of theChemical Weapons Convention.In the field of human rights  the United Nationsplays a very special role not only in developing andenhancing the regime of human rights instruments  butalso in the prevention of possible violations and theconstantly expanding humanitarian relief efforts.On the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of theGeneva Conventions  we reaffirm our commitment to thecause of human rights and the promotion of humanitarianlaw. Cyprus fully supported the adoption of the Statute ofa permanent International Criminal Court.Cyprus follows the situation in the Middle East withintense interest. We rejoice at the winds of hope that haverecently appeared in the efforts to finally achieve peace inthat long-tormented area and welcome the recent Israeli-Palestinian agreement. Cyprus  as a neighbouring Statewith close relations to the parties involved in the MiddleEast  reiterates its support for a just  lasting andcomprehensive settlement based on the relevant UnitedNations resolutions and the implementation of the peaceaccords.The recent tragedy that has unfolded in Kosovo hasdemonstrated the fragility of peace in the heart of Europeand the imperative need to address a new array ofproblems that have the potential to destabilize an entireregion. The international community  as well as theparties involved  have an obligation to create theconditions for reconciliation  so that what has transpired5in Kosovo and Yugoslavia in general will never be allowedto take place again.Cyprus fully supports Security Council resolution 1244(1999) and calls for full respect for the human rights of allKosovars  irrespective of their origin  as well as for thesovereignty of all States in the region. My Government alsowelcomes the initiative of the European Union that led tothe adoption of the Stability Pact last June as an importantinitiative that will contribute considerably to the economicand political stabilization of south-eastern Europe and helpits peoples construct a new future.Cyprus welcomes the several United Nations initiativesand recommendations stemming from the follow-up to thereport of the Secretary-General concerning Africa. Theinternational community should redouble its efforts to assistthe countries of Africa to overcome the ethnic strife andwars; to eradicate poverty; successfully to combat disease;to win the fight against drug trafficking; to obtainsustainable development; and to face the challenges of thefuture.The recent devastating earthquake that struck Turkeyhas once more demonstrated the frailty of human beingsbefore nature's incredible power of destruction. I take thisopportunity to reiterate to the Turkish people our sympathyfor the enormous losses suffered and to urge theinternational community to lend a helping hand for thereconstruction of the devastated areas. Despite the politicalproblems that exist between our respective States  themagnitude of the suffering of the Turkish people has deeplymoved the people of Cyprus.I wish to congratulate all those countries which rushedto save Turkish lives  and in particular Greece  which despite its many differences and problems with Turkey  wasone of the first countries to send its teams to work side byside with Turkish teams to rescue the Turkish people whowere buried alive under the ruins of the earthquake. I wantalso to congratulate Turkey for reciprocating in the samemanner after the subsequent earthquake in Greece and Iwish to salute the new spirit of friendship which has startedto emerge between the two countries.This year marks a quarter of a century since theTurkish invasion and unlawful occupation of 37 per cent ofthe territory of the Republic of Cyprus. I could today  fromthis podium  point an accusing finger at Turkey and talk atlength about the ethnic cleansing it practised against theGreek Cypriots  which resulted in 180 000 Greek Cypriotsbecoming refugees in their own country. I could bring upthe drama of the relatives of the 1 600 Greek Cypriotsmissing since the invasion of Cyprus by Turkish forces in1974. I could point out the many violations of humanrights of the Greek Cypriots by citing decisions of theEuropean Court and reports of the European Commissionof Human Rights  holding Turkey responsible for suchviolations. Today I will abstain from doing so  because Iprefer to look to the future  and not to deal with the past.We are currently waiting for the United NationsSecretary-General to issue invitations to both sides to takepart in negotiations  under the auspices of the UnitedNations  in the most ambitious initiative ever undertakento find a comprehensive solution to the Cyprus problem.This initiative enjoys the active support of theinternational community  and particularly the Group of theeight most industrialized countries  the Security Council the European Union and the Non-Aligned Movement.We are well aware that currently the internationalcommunity  and especially those States which are in aposition to influence the foreign policy of Turkey  areworking methodically to persuade Turkey and the TurkishCypriot leader  Mr. Denktash  to participate in talkswithout any preconditions; that is  not to insist on therecognition of the so-called Turkish Republic of NorthernCyprus  and not to demand that negotiations be conductedbetween the two States  instead of communities  asenvisaged in the Security Council resolutions.Regrettably  on 16 September the Prime Minister ofTurkey  Mr. Ecevit  in a public statement  not onlyinsisted on the two preconditions I have just mentioned but added that the economic embargo against the TurkishCypriots must be lifted. The Prime Minister of Turkeyknows that the so-called embargo is a result of a decisionof the European Court  to the effect that certificates oforigin and/or quality issued by the so-called TurkishRepublic of Northern Cyprus cannot be accepted by theEuropean Union  because the State referred to is notrecognized. The Prime Minister of Turkey should also beaware that there is a category of reciprocal measures thatneed to be discussed and resolved  and that the questionof the embargo falls in that category.I have already stated publicly  but also to theSecretary-General and to the heads of State orGovernment of the five permanent members of theSecurity Council  that we are ready to respond positivelyto the Secretary-General's invitation to attend the talksand to negotiate a solution to the problem within the6parameters established by the international communitythrough Security Council resolutions. The parameters soestablished provide that Cyprus must be a bicommunal bizonal federal republic  with a single sovereignty  aninternational personality and a single citizenship  and thatthe settlement must exclude union  in whole or in part  withany other country or any form of partition or secession.My vision for the solution of the Cyprus problemwithin those parameters requires a partnership of the twocommunities that would constitutionally provide for themaximum degree of internal self-administration for the twoconstituent cantons  provinces or states. Adhering to theprinciple of the equal political status of the constituentparts  it must provide them with the same rights  powersand functions regarding their respective separate internalself-administration. The constitution must also provide forthe effective participation of both communities in thefederal Government.Such a federation  becoming a member of theEuropean Union  will thrive at home and abroad  enjoyinggenuine peace  stability and security  based on internationallaw and legality. It will be supervised by an internationalforce authorized by the Security Council  under terms andconditions so defined as to give the force the right tointervene if it finds that one community  by unlawful acts puts in danger the safety of the other community orattempts to destroy the independence  territorial integrityand sovereignty of the federal State or destroy theagreements reached.I have stated that both communities must learn fromthe mistakes of the past and must work hard for thecreation of a common and bright future for all  instead ofclinging to attitudes which brought about the tragedy in theisland. It is  therefore  imperative that we find a just workable and viable solution which will safeguard thehuman rights of every citizen and heal the wounds of thepast  bringing at the same time a sense of security to bothcommunities by providing full disarmament underinternational supervision.Our side will approach negotiations on the Cyprusproblem with courage and flexibility  partly because werecognize that solving it is in the interest of all Cypriots but also because that will contribute to the overall stabilityof the region  which is so much demanded by theinternational community.I regret that Mr. Denktash is reported to have refusedto respond positively to any initiative to negotiate with meas representative of the Greek Cypriot community  on thepretext that I am also the President of the internationallyrecognized Republic of Cyprus.Time and time again I have explained to him that Isit in the talks not as the President of the Republic ofCyprus  but as the representative of the Greek Cypriotcommunity  because the Security Council resolutions callupon the two communities to negotiate  not upon the Stateof the Republic of Cyprus and the Turkish Cypriotcommunity.It also saddens me when he attempts to set aside theparameters for the solution of the Cyprus problem  set bythe international community and the high-levelagreements he made before the Secretary-General of theUnited Nations twice  for a bicommunal  bizonalfederation. He attempts now to set new parameters for thesolution  based on two separate sovereign States  and toimpose their acceptance by refusing to come to thenegotiating table unless his conditions are met.In support of his precondition  he advances theargument that the term ”equal political status”  referred toin United Nations resolutions  must be interpreted to meanthat his break-away Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprusmust be recognized  since the Republic of Cyprus isinternationally recognized  in order that the twonegotiators may have equal status. He forgets that theSecurity Council  by its resolution  deplored the action ofthe Turkish side of declaring a separate State  and askedall its members not to recognize it  a request with whichall complied  with the exception of Turkey  the occupyingPower.The parameters for the solution of the Cyprusproblem are already in place. They are included in therelevant United Nations resolutions. What is required isthe political will of the two sides. I can assure theAssembly that the Greek Cypriot side stands ready tonegotiate in good faith so that a bicommunal  bizonalFederal Republic of Cyprus will finally become a reality.I join my voice with those of the G-8  the SecurityCouncil and the European Union in asking Mr. Denktashto come to the negotiating table without preconditions. Ihonestly believe that within the parameters of the SecurityCouncil resolutions we can find a solution which willsafeguard the legitimate interests of both communities andbring peace and stability in the Eastern Mediterranean.7I wish also to repeat my invitation to the TurkishCypriot community to join forces with us in our EuropeanUnion accession course. That course  which is the greatestachievement since the establishment of the CyprusRepublic  is continuing with success. Accession to theEuropean Union will benefit both communities equally.The Cyprus problem has often been described ascomplicated and intractable. I do not share this view. TheCyprus problem can and will be solved if the internationalcommunity demands its solution with the necessarydetermination  within the parameters it has set.In the effort for the solution of the Cyprus problem  asa small State  Member of the United Nations  we rely onthe support of the international community and the UnitedNations. We look upon its Charter as a beacon of justice and on the United Nations as the hope for a better future."
"42",1798,"CZE",54,1999,"By way of introduction let me congratulate you  Sir  on your election as Presidentof the fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly andwish you every success in the execution of your importantfunctions. I would like to use this opportunity also toexpress thanks to your predecessor  Mr. Didier Opertti ofUruguay  for his responsible work and for the efforts he hasdevoted to United Nations activities throughout the year.The Czech Republic is very pleased that after fiveyears the Assembly again has an opportunity to welcomenew United Nations Members — Nauru  Kiribati andTonga. This further expansion of the United Nations familyis evidence of its increasingly universal nature  which theCzech Republic unequivocally supports.This year marks an important milestone for the CzechRepublic  which this past spring became a member of theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)  together withHungary and Poland. Recalling Article 1 of the WashingtonTreaty  which refers to the United Nations Charter andcommits its members to address international conflicts bypeaceful means  we believe that this historic firstenlargement of the Alliance following the end of the coldwar will contribute to the enhancement of stability andsecurity  and do so not only in our region. We supportNATO’s continued enlargement through the inclusion ofother countries  and we are convinced that this first stepwill also have a motivating and mobilizing character forthem.NATO’s new strategic concept emphasizes its broadapproach to security issues; it envisages the necessity ofnot only facing military risks but also of monitoringeconomic  social  environmental and political issues thatmay disrupt security and stability. NATO hasdemonstrated that it has both the functional mechanismsfor crisis management and the capacities to managehumanitarian crises. However  there is an obvious needfor the Alliance’s potential to be fully utilized by aneffective cooperation with the United Nations  which hasthe ability to oversee the restoration of civiladministration and infrastructure. It is this closecooperation that underlines the fact that our commitmentto peace is as strong as our will to challenge grossviolations of human rights by military means. And  ofcourse  the concept of regional security in Europe cannotbe imagined without NATO’s cooperating also with theOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe(OSCE)  the Western European Union or the Council ofEurope.Because development in Europe is profoundlyinfluenced by ever-deeper integration  the successfulcompletion of the long-term process of our country’sentry into the European Union is currently the highest-priority goal for Czech foreign policy. Having startedaccession talks in the spring of last year  the CzechRepublic is promoting political dialogue with theEuropean Union member States and associated countries.Through our active involvement in the Common Foreignand Security Policy  we are assuming our share ofresponsibility for development in Europe and the world obviously  to date  within the restrictive framework of ourstatus as an associated country. We attach majorimportance to the social and environmental dimensions ofEuropean integration. We are fully aware that theimportance of these dimensions will continue to increasein order to keep up with the advancement ofglobalization.The disintegration of the bipolar world has broughtabout a transition from confrontation to cooperation givenrise to efforts to create a new security architecture  andled to integration processes  particularly on the Europeancontinent. However  it has also brought about theresurgence of dormant threats and the emergence of newcentres of instability. The Kosovo tragedy and other criseshave brought us closer to recognizing the importance ofthe principle of the personal security of human beings andits guarantees as a precondition of peace and security inthe world. The fact that the worst atrocities  which havenothing in common with the civilized world  are still46being committed at the end of the twentieth century makesthis recognition all the more sad and alarming. In thiscontext  the Czech Republic would express its appreciationand support for the work of the International Tribunal forthe Former Yugoslavia. The Czech Republic is convincedthat the international community’s efforts should result injust punishment for all the atrocities committed.The United Kingdom’s Secretary of State for Foreignand Commonwealth Affairs  Robin Cook  correctly arguedhere that we must counter the culture of impunity. Allcriminals should be held to account. As Secretary- GeneralKofi Annan said  massive and systematic violations ofhuman rights should not be allowed to stand  wherever theymay take place.Kosovo will be the benchmark for the successachieved by international institutions. Kosovo is now in aperiod when it is necessary to defend peace  a period inwhich to achieve political stability and democratization economic stabilization and a gradual development of theregion. The Czech Republic is interested in the region’sstability in all respects. That is why it participated  in itscapacity as the currently presiding country of the CentralEuropean Initiative  in the Stability Pact Summit meeting atSarajevo and why it will be working towardsdemocratization  economic reconstruction and security inthe region. We are  of course  fully aware that this is fareasier said than done. The obstacles on the road arenumerous and enormous.The United Nations plays an irreplaceable role inproviding for international peace and security. The peacefulresolution of disputes will undoubtedly continue to be oneof the main priorities of the United Nations. The CzechRepublic therefore attaches great importance to the use ofpeacekeeping operations in dealing with crisis situations andsupports the efforts directed towards their greater efficiency particularly as regards their rapid deployment. Speedappears to be the key aspect in many cases. However  theUnited Nations must also have adequate funding to carryout this demanding role effectively; unfortunately  itsfinancial resources are considerably limited at presentbecause of the fact that some Member States fail to honourtheir financial obligations. The United Nations InterimAdministration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) has beenmarked by these problems: the Mission was not financiallysecured to the degree which would have corresponded withthe security situation at hand and with the very difficulttask of restoring the civil administration in Kosovo. On theother hand  it was probably the most rapidly deployedmission in the history of the United Nations.The importance of UNMIK is shown by the factthat  as the highest civilian authority in Kosovo  itcoordinates activities of international regionalgovernmental and non-governmental organizations. TheCzech Republic greatly appreciates the positivecooperation between UNMIK and KFOR  although it isevident that the international security forces cannot in thelong term replace civilian administration and policeforces.A major degree of responsibility lies on theshoulders of the United Nations  and especially on thoseof the Secretary-General’s Special Representative  Mr.Bernard Kouchner  in Kosovo. I had an opportunity to getto know his difficult task at first hand during my visit toPristina a few days ago. The Secretary-General’s SpecialRepresentative needs the full support of the internationalcommunity in his efforts  including the transformation ofthe UCK into a non-military Kosovo protection corps.The Czech Republic obviously supports all steps andmeasures which may bring about the establishment of ademocratic and multi-ethnic society in Kosovo asstipulated by the Washington North Atlantic TreatyOrganization (NATO) Summit. Unfortunately  during mystay in Kosovo I did not come across any convincingevidence that that vision could really be implemented inany foreseeable future — just the contrary. Thediminishing number of Serbs in Kosovo  the continuousthreats of murder — even to very old Serbian ladies —the rising influence of a mafia  which Mr. Kouchner toldme about  the ever-present spirit of revenge  the lack oftrained police forces  the absence of local civiladministration  the disease of corruption and rivalrybetween different sectors of the Kosovo Albanians arejust some of the obstacles which have to be dealt withdecisively in order to prevent the vision of the futurefrom becoming nothing but a never-fulfilled dream.I wholeheartedly agree with the Secretary-General’sunequivocal statement that commitment to humanitarianaction must be universal if it is to be legitimate. Thismeans not only that our commitment to peace andstability cannot end with the cessation of hostilities butthat we have to be seen to be objective and even-handedtowards all ethnic groups  as well as towards all regions.I am glad to note that the recent argument that “EastTimor is not Kosovo” was quietly dropped. TheSecretary-General has said that humanity  after all  isindivisible; we have to wholeheartedly agree with him.The Czech Republic intends to continue itsinvolvement in peace operations under the leadership of47both the United Nations and regional organizations  asborne out by  among other actions  the operation of Czechunits under NATO command in Bosnia and Herzegovina aswell as in Kosovo. The first Czech policemen should arrivein Kosovo to join the UNMIK police force within the nextfive days. The number of police necessary to maintain civilorder in Kosovo is now more than double the figureoriginally estimated  Mr. Kouchner told me. Police officials not the military  are trained to investigate murders or  evenmore importantly  to take measures to prevent murders orother grave challenges to law and order. The CzechRepublic is also prepared to consider sending militaryobservers to the United Nations peace missions in SierraLeone and the Democratic Republic of the Congo and  ofcourse  following a recent request we received fromAustralia and the agreement on the Security Councilmandate  also to East Timor.The Czech Republic is concerned about thedevelopments in East Timor. We welcome the fact thatafter decades  the people of East Timor were given anopportunity to implement their right to self-determination and we feel very shocked that the results of the referendumled to bloodshed and indiscriminate killings. Indonesia’sacceptance of the United Nations military peacekeepingforces has made us confident that the United Nations willsucceed in ensuring peace in that area.Peace and security in crisis-ridden areas are alsoclosely related to humanitarian relief  which is provided asa rule to afflicted civilian populations. A radicaldeterioration in the security situation may cause adevastating humanitarian crisis  as we have seen in Kosovo.Here  too  there is a need to look at the possibilities ofsimplifying the United Nations decision-makingmechanisms. It is disturbing that  for example  the Office ofthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees didnot have sufficient resources and capacities to tackle thehumanitarian crisis in that region  which was due mainly tosomewhat rigid procedures.One of the most important tasks of the internationalcommunity is undoubtedly to prevent the proliferation ofweapons of mass destruction and to eliminate themcompletely. Our aim is still a world without any nuclearweapons. With regard to the forthcoming ReviewConference of the Parties to the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)  to be held inthe year 2000  the Czech Republic calls for overcoming thestagnation in negotiations on the relevant treaties supportingthe non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and for developingmore positive attitudes  particularly on the part of nuclearcountries  which will create a more favourable atmospherein the disarmament process and lead to the adoption ofclear  practical and implementable nuclear disarmamentmeasures in the new millennium.There is no question but that early ratification of theSTART II Treaty between the United States and Russiawould help considerably to revive the disarmamentprocess. We consider the achievement of universalapplicability of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons (NPT) and of the ComprehensiveNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) and their speedyratification a very urgent task. In this respect  weparticularly appreciate the CTBT ratification by Franceand by the United Kingdom. The Czech Republic hopesthat the conference of CTBT countries  to be held atVienna in October this year  will help to accelerateratification in other countries.We welcome efforts to improve the effectiveness ofthe Organization for the Prohibition of ChemicalWeapons  and we continue to express our support forearly negotiation of a verification protocol to theConvention on the Prohibition of the Development Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological)and Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction.Regarding conventional arms  the Czech Republicsupports all measures that contribute to greatertransparency. It consistently fulfils its obligations to notifythe relevant registers and supports the efforts for anexpansion of their procedures which would coveradditional types of weapons. The Czech Republic alsofully shares the international community’s grave concernover illegal transfers of hand-held and light weapons  andsupports all measures required to stop such activities. Inthe context of the international efforts to limit and ban theuse of anti-personnel landmines  I can inform theAssembly with satisfaction that  following last year’sratification of Protocol II to the Convention onProhibitions or Restrictions on the Use of CertainConventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to BeExcessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects the Czech Republic has completed the process of ratifyingthe Ottawa Convention on the Prohibition of the Use Stockpiling  Production and Transfer of Anti-personnelMines and on Their Destruction and will soon deposit ourratification instrument with the Secretary-General. Wesupport all efforts towards achieving universalapplicability of that Convention. We continue to beinvolved in international activities focused on deminingand on providing help to landmine victims.48The Czech Republic welcomed the enlargement of theConference on Disarmament by another five countries  towhich I extend warm congratulations. At the same time weexpress our hope that the Conference on Disarmament willsucceed in overcoming the current stagnation and will starttalks not only on a treaty banning the production of fissilematerials for military purposes but also on other topicalproblems of arms control and disarmament  includingnuclear disarmament  and on security guarantees for non-nuclear countries.There is no doubt that this year has been a real test forthe United Nations  as well as a critical test of transnationaldecision-making during crises. This test  so crucial for thefuture of the United Nations  has not yet been concludedand properly evaluated. It is not only Kosovo that hasrevealed that the United Nations in its present form doesnot make full use of its potential to be an irreplaceablevehicle for achieving the goals set out in the Charter. At thethreshold of the third millennium  the Organizationtherefore looks for an answer to the question of how theinternational community can become a truly responsiblecommunity and what role the United Nations will play inthis process.In our view  the United Nations must first of allrespond to the changed substance of conflicts in today’sworld. These are not classical conflicts between States but in most cases  internal conflicts rather similar to civil wars.The United Nations and the international community ingeneral face the need to clearly define the relationshipbetween national sovereignty and the protection of humanrights and ultimately to engage in a discussion on how theyshould support sensible civilian Governments that keeparmed forces under control. In this context  we shouldclearly focus on the Secretary-General’s argument aboutindividual sovereignty and the right of every individual tocontrol his or her own destiny.Secondly  the urgency of a radical acceleration of theprocess of United Nations reform  particularly reform of theSecurity Council  is becoming increasingly evident. TheCzech Republic fully supports the Secretary-General’sreform efforts  and I would like to share the optimismconcerning early substantial progress in reform negotiationswhich Mr. Annan expressed to me during our talks inPrague last July. I have to admit that we consider theresults of this year’s negotiations  especially those onSecurity Council reform  to be inadequate. This  of course corresponds to the role of the United Nations during theinitial stages of the Kosovo conflict. The composition of theSecurity Council requires change. The Czech Republicbelieves that the number of both permanent and non-permanent members of the Security Council needs to beincreased  while representation of developing countrieshas to be strengthened.Thirdly  conflict-prevention mechanisms need to becreated  and attention should be devoted to questions suchas discrimination  poverty  access to raw materials and thearms trade. The arms trade does not include onlyextensive  elaborate weapons systems. It is the excessiveaccumulation of hand-held and other small arms whichabove all requires our tough response  because thesepersonal weapons play a key role in most conflicts. Iwould like to express my full support for the call by theUnited Kingdom Foreign Secretary  Robin Cook  to haltthe illegal trade in small arms. Cooperation with regionalorganizations such as the Organization for Security andCooperation in Europe and the Organization of AfricanUnity  which may be more successful in dealing withconflicts  should also play a role in preventing conflicts.I very much welcome the Secretary-General’s emphasishere on moving from a culture of reaction to a culture ofprevention.Fourthly  the role of the United Nations in the areaof human rights and as part of a broader concept ofhuman security should be considerably intensified. Wewelcomed the Secretary-General’s personal statement inhis address at this year’s session of the Commission onHuman Rights  in which he said  “I have made humanrights a priority in every United Nations programme”.This  it seems to me  accurately reflects the importancewhich the United Nations should give human rights issuesin the future. The United Nations should ensure that theuniversal nature of human rights is accepted and projectedas a leading principle for the conduct of the internationalcommunity. By our joint efforts we should guarantee adignified and complete life for every individual in thenext millennium. It is unacceptable at the threshold of thenew millennium to claim that human rights are relativeand that their violation by sovereign States on their ownterritory is solely their internal affair and as such may notbe a subject of interest to other members of theinternational community. If the United Nations wereunable publicly to defend the existence of human rights it would be unable to defend its own existence.At the same time  let us not forget the Secretary-General’s warning about the need to ensure universallegitimacy  which he issued in connection with thebombing campaign against Yugoslavia. Incidentally  thenew Czech Government has adopted a foreign policy49concept which regards human rights as one of its mainpillars and which at the same time stresses the desirabilityof United Nations mandates for peace-enforcing operations.Fifthly  it is in the vital interest of the United Nationsfor the world to step into the twenty-first century under therule of law in international relations. The situation in theformer Yugoslavia  including developments in Kosovo clearly shows the extremely important role already playedtoday by international judicial bodies in enhancing theprestige of international law and its gradual integration intothe political decision-making processes. The implementationof international law by the United Nations internationaljudicial bodies has considerable positive influence on howglobal public opinion perceives the United Nations itself.Let me now touch briefly on one more seriousproblem. Recent earthquakes in Turkey  Greece and Taiwanhave underlined the need for the world to be prepared toprovide coordinated help to an area hit by a massive naturaldisaster. This experience should  in our view  lead to thefurther strengthening and deepening of the idea alreadypresented some time ago  namely  the idea of the “WhiteHelmets”. The challenge is to extend “White Helmets“ intoregular international rescue forces under United Nationsleadership  capable of coordinated action on the spot —naturally  with the consent of the countries receiving suchassistance. The ultimate goal could be the formation of rapid-response international forces  formed of nationalcontingents and permanently available  well-equipped expertgroups which could be dispatched to the stricken area in amatter of minutes or hours.In conclusion  let us remind ourselves once again thatthe future of the United Nations is primarily a matter of thepolitical will of its Member States. Finding answers to thequestions which have been raised at this year’s session ofthe General Assembly is therefore not only up to the UnitedNations  but up to the entire international community. TheMillennium Assembly should give us a major opportunityfor finding answers to these questions. I also hope that theMillennium Assembly will contribute decisively to theacceleration of work on the United Nations reforms  theneed for which was so clearly highlighted by the Kosovocrisis. I am sure that the recovery of the commitment tomultilateralism and to the leading United Nations role in thestruggle to uphold basic Charter values  such as democracy human rights and the rule of law  is now in sight.My traditionally cautious optimism was  I admit slightly strengthened in this respect by listening here tosome politicians representing countries with far moreresources than the Czech Republic has at its disposal. Ourresources are  unfortunately  fairly limited. Nevertheless we will continue to support the United Nations and  as Ihave said  to participate in its missions to pour millionsof dollars into humanitarian and development aid  and soon. The point I wish to make clear in this speech  even solate in the evening  is that we will always be ready tohelp."
"43",1860,"DEU",54,1999,"First of all  I would liketo warmly congratulate you  Sir  on your election to thepresidency of the fifty-fourth session of the GeneralAssembly and to wish you every success in this difficultoffice.I should also like to thank Foreign Minister Opertti forhis tireless dedication in successfully presiding over thefifty-third session of the General Assembly.I welcome Kiribati  Nauru and Tonga  with whichGermany has long enjoyed friendly ties  as new Membersof the world Organization.I endorse the statement of my Finnish colleague  TarjaHalonen  on behalf of the European Union.This session of the General Assembly is the last inthis “century of extremes”  as the British historian EricHobsbawm called the century now drawing to a close. Thatis reason enough to take stock. Since its foundation  theUnited Nations has greatly enhanced relations betweenpeoples. The development of international law  protectionof human rights  decolonization  worldwide humanitarianand disaster aid  arousing awareness of the great problemsfacing mankind  such as population growth  poverty and theglobal environmental crisis — all of this would beinconceivable without the United Nations.There is no alternative to the United Nationsobjectives and values — peace  human rights  freedom justice and development — and they have gainedworldwide recognition  even if  unfortunately  they are notalways respected everywhere. Nevertheless  even after morethan 50 years  there is still a long way to go before they areuniversally respected and implemented. Despite all itsefforts  the international community has not yet succeededin ridding our planet of war  oppression  tyranny  expulsionand grave human rights violations  including genocide. Atthe close of this century  the United Nations and itsMember States are unable to fully master their core task namely  safeguarding peace and security. The great hopethat following the end of the East-West conflict the era ofmultilateral cooperation and worldwide rule of law woulddawn has not yet come to fruition.Today the question of peacekeeping must beconsidered under conditions very different to those duringthe United Nations early years. First  most conflicts todayare internal rather than international  as in earlier times.Secondly  the role of the nation State has beenconsiderably relativized by the increased importance ofhuman rights and the globalization of the economy andsociety. Against this background  the question ofpeacekeeping arises more and more in an area of tensionbetween traditional State sovereignty and protection ofhuman rights.What is to be done when entire States collapse andthe civilian population is massacred in never-ending civilwars from all sides? What if ethnic tensions in a State arepartly provoked by criminal Governments  which thenrespond with pogroms  mass expulsions and massmurders  even genocide? Should the United Nations thenregard State sovereignty as more important thanprotection of individuals and their rights? Rwanda Kosovo and East Timor are dramatic examples of this.In many ways  therefore  the Kosovo conflictrepresents a turning point. The international communitycould no longer tolerate a State waging war against itsown people and using terror and expulsion as a politicalinstrument. As Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in hisbrilliant and trail-blazing speech to the fifty-fifth sessionof the Commission on Human Rights  no Government hasthe right to use the cover of the principle of Statesovereignty to violate human rights. Non-interference ininternal affairs must no longer be misused as a shield fordictators and murderers. The World Conference onHuman Rights in Vienna reaffirmed this in 1993  with theapproval of all United Nations Members States  with thewords:“the promotion and protection of all human rights isa legitimate concern of the internationalcommunity”. (Vienna Declaration and Programmeof Action  I  para. 4)However  the Kosovo conflict also marks a changeof direction in the development of international relations.How will the international community decide in thefuture — this question has just been raised once more inEast Timor — when it comes to preventing massivehuman rights violations against an entire people? Twodevelopments are conceivable.A practice of humanitarian interventions could evolveoutside the United Nations system. This would be a veryproblematic development. The intervention in Kosovo which took place in a situation where the Security Councilhad tied its own hands after all efforts to find a peacefulsolution had failed  was intended to provide emergencyassistance and  ultimately  to protect the displaced KosovoAlbanians. The unity of the European States and theWestern Alliance  as well as various Security Councilresolutions  were of crucial significance here. However  thisstep  which is only justified in this special situation  mustnot set a precedent for weakening the United NationsSecurity Council's monopoly on authorizing the use of legalinternational force. Nor must it become a licence to useexternal force under the pretext of humanitarian assistance.This would open the door to the arbitrary use of power andanarchy and throw the world back to the nineteenth century.The only solution to this dilemma  therefore  is tofurther develop the existing United Nations system in sucha way that in the future it is able to intervene in good timein cases of very grave human rights violations  but not untilall means of settling conflicts peacefully have beenexhausted and — this is a crucial point — within a strictlylimited legal and controlled framework.In the twenty-first century the individual and his rightsmust take a more prominent place alongside the rights ofStates in the concept of security as defined by theinternational community. The reform of the SecurityCouncil  the central body for safeguarding world peace must be oriented towards this principle. The SecurityCouncil is  in fact  authorized to act  and able to do so where peace or security are at risk due to internaldevelopments. This has been demonstrated by a long chainof decisions  from the apartheid resolution to theinterventions in Iraq  Bosnia and Haiti. However  inRwanda  Kosovo and the Congo  decision making in theSecurity Council was blocked  thus rendering it unable tolive up to its responsibilities enshrined in the UnitedNations Charter  with disastrous results for the peoples inquestion.These conflicts are a pressing reason  particularly inview of the important Millennium General Assembly  tofinally carry out the long-overdue substantial reform of theSecurity Council. The Security Council must be adapted tothe new realities of the global political situation. It musthave a more representative composition and  above all  itmust be equipped to react to the crises and conflicts oftoday. Reform must involve enlargement to include bothmore permanent and non-permanent members  as well as astrengthening of its decision-making powers. As theAssembly knows  Germany has for some time nowexpressed its willingness to assume more and lastingresponsibility in this connection. We stand by thisunreservedly.In the debate on reform we must not avoid the issueof the permanent members' right of veto  a question ofkey importance for the Security Council's capability toact. The right of veto is regarded by many as outdated inits current form. However  it is a situation with which wehave to reckon internationally for a long time to come.How then can decision-making in the Security Council bemade more efficient?According to the Charter  the Security Council actswith the mandate  and on behalf  of all United NationsMember States. But hitherto they have not been entitledto learn why a State has exercised its right of veto. Thisis not only neither democratic nor transparent  but alsomakes it easier for States to veto a draft resolutionunilaterally for national rather than international interests.The introduction of an obligation for a State to explain tothe General Assembly why it is vetoing a draft resolutionwould make it more difficult to do so and thus bringabout substantial progress towards using the right of vetomore responsibly. Why should not the General Assemblyassume more responsibility in the future  too?A second approach to making the internationalpeacekeeping system more efficient would be via ChapterVIII of the United Nations Charter  namely bystrengthening the regional security systems andredistributing tasks and areas of responsibility amongthem and the United Nations. It is becoming clear that theregional organizations could be allocated an even greaterimplementation role. This would also foster thecapabilities of regional organizations to engage in securitycooperation  as well as their collaboration with the UnitedNations. However  the primacy of the Security Councilremains absolutely essential.Without reforms in the area of peacekeeping  theSecurity Council will be circumvented more and morefrequently  resulting in the erosion of the Security Counciland  ultimately  of the entire United Nations system. TheUnited Nations  one of civilization's greatest achievementsthis century  as well as the values and principles itrepresents  would thus be at risk of subsiding intoinsignificance. We must prevent that.12The disaster in East Timor is currently demonstratinghow necessary close cooperation is between a SecurityCouncil capable of taking action and the countries in theregion. The Security Council's mandate to send amultilateral peacekeeping force must be fully implemented.Indonesia must now cooperate closely with the UnitedNations Mission and do everything in its power toguarantee its success. The bloodshed must end. The victimsmust be helped. Those displaced must be able to returnhome safely. Germany has already provided humanitarianand food aid. We will send a medical corps to assist thepeacekeeping troops and make further contributions towardsrebuilding the destroyed country. I am confident that ourParliament will lend this plan its full backing.In Africa  the Great Lakes region  the Congo andSierra Leone have for many years been the scene of terriblewars  mass murders  destruction and much suffering on thepart of refugees. The Organization of African Unity (OAU)and the Economic Community of West African States(ECOWAS) and its Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) havedone much to contain and resolve these conflicts. However these organizations also need the support of the UnitedNations  in Sierra Leone  in the Congo and  in particular  inthe conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea. Both parties tothe conflict must observe the agreements concluded andwork closely together with the United Nations and the OAUso that the peace process now begun can be brought to asuccessful conclusion.The international community must focus on the causesrather than merely the symptoms of wars and conflicts inthe context of multilateral peacekeeping. Secretary-GeneralKofi Annan rightly called for a “culture of prevention” tobe developed in order to prevent the outbreak of wars andavert natural disasters more effectively in future.Everyone knows how difficult the transition from the“culture of reaction” to the “culture of prevention” will be.It takes a lot of persuading to summon up the political andeconomic will for measures intended to prevent somethingwhich we hope will never happen. However  on financialgrounds and  above all  on humanitarian grounds  it is ourduty and responsibility to revise our thinking here. Progressis urgently required in four areas.First  we must move on from early warning to earlyresponse. The United Nations has considerable resources atits disposal for preventive diplomacy  which must be usedeven more. There is also a great potential for synergy incooperation with non-governmental organizations.Secondly  peacekeeping operations must be carriedout before conflicts erupt. The United Nations mission inMacedonia has set a standard in this respect.Thirdly  disarmament and the non-proliferation ofmeans of mass destruction are in need of fresh politicalimpetus. It is essential that the Geneva negotiations gainmomentum  particularly in the fields of global nucleardisarmament and the verification of biological weapons and in the implementation of the Chemical WeaponsConvention. Furthermore  Germany advocates theadoption of a convention on preventing the illegal transferof small arms worldwide.Fourthly  peace-building is a prevention task ofgrowing importance. With the United Nations InterimAdministration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK)  the UnitedNations is facing one of the most comprehensive tests inits history. Building public order by creating an efficientjudicial system and quickly sending the pledgedinternational police units is now crucial. Since the UnitedNations began incorporating national police units in theinternational standby system  they have been able to actmore swiftly. We must continue along this path.Protection of human rights and the growingdemocratization of States form the basis for a preventivepeace policy and civil conflict management. It is ahistorical fact that democracies with a well-developedcivil society hardly ever wage war against each other.Lasting economic success cannot be achieved in theglobalized information society of tomorrow without goodgovernance founded on human rights  the separation ofpowers and a functioning legal and constitutionalframework.In the field of human rights  welcome progress hasbeen made towards broadening the legal basis forinternational relations  particularly during the last year.The detention of Pinochet and the indictment of Milosevicby the International Criminal Tribunal for the FormerYugoslavia are milestones along the path towards creatinga world in which the rule of law prevails. In future dictators and perpetrators of human rights violations willno longer be able to rely on not being called to accountfor their actions. This must also apply to the murderers ofDili and those who issued the orders. Just like everywhereelse in the world  internal peace is contingent uponjustice.The adoption of the Statute of the InternationalCriminal Court represented a quantum leap in the13development of international law. I call upon all States torespect the integrity of the Rome Statute  to sign it and toswiftly ratify it  so that the Court can commence work nextyear.Germany is doing all it can to bring about progress inthe following fields of human rights. The heinous crimes ofchild trafficking and child prostitution must be bannedthroughout the world  as must the use of child soldiers. Inthe Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights ofthe Child on the involvement of children in armed conflicts the age limit must be raised to 18.In many countries women are still largely withoutrights and protection and subjected to discrimination andviolence. This is an unacceptable injustice. Unfortunately our world is still a long way from genuine equality  evenwith regard to fundamental rights. We must therefore aimto adopt the Optional Protocol to the Convention on theElimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women.In our view  the death penalty cannot be justifiedeither ethically or legally. Together with its Europeanpartners  Germany will therefore continue to vigorouslywork towards ensuring the implementation of the jointresolution on abolishing the death penalty.Protection of press freedom must be improved. Thefreedom to inform is a reliable gauge of respect for humanrights. Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of HumanRights guarantees the right to freedom of opinion.However  censorship  intimidation and reprisals are theorder of the day in many countries. It is particularlyshocking that year after year dozens of journalists are killedwhile on assignment. The United Nations should take acloser look at this issue and consider practical solutions aswell as enhance legal protection for journalists. To this endwe will shortly be extending invitations to a conference tobe held in Germany.The United Nations third major task alongsidepeacekeeping and promoting human rights in the comingcentury will be to bring about a reconciliation between richand poor countries.The tenth Human Development Report of the UnitedNations Development Programme came to the sadconclusion that globalization has further widened the gapbetween rich and poor countries. The internationalcommunity must endeavour to counter this trend. Thedevelopment of the poorer and the poorest countries mustnot be left to the invisible hand of the global market. Theindividual  not the market  must be the focus of theglobalization debate. This will also require greatersteering at the political level.The rich countries have a responsibility to help poorcountries take advantage of globalization and enable themto have a fairer share of the world economy by assistingthem with internal reforms and by opening up markets.Within the framework of its European Union and Groupof 8 presidencies  Germany launched substantialinitiatives  which must be further developed in the formof the 1999 Köln Debt Initiative and the commencementof negotiations on a follow-up arrangement for the LoméConvention.Development cooperation in the broadest sense mustbecome one of the United Nations core tasks to a greaterdegree than hitherto. Science and technology are gearedfar too much to the problems of rich countries. Why dowe not make greater use of the United Nations frameworkto build bridges here? The economist Jeffrey Sachs madethe interesting suggestion  for example  that a millenniumvaccine fund could be established  with guaranteedmarkets in the future for vaccines against tropical virusessuch as tuberculosis  malaria and  above all  AIDS.Furthermore  in the context of the emergence of a globalknowledge society  the international regime for theprotection of intellectual property must be revised in orderto ensure that the world’s poor do not lose a large part oftheir rights and freedoms in the near future. Rich andpoor countries should get together with one another morefrequently to discuss such proposals. During itspresidency of the Group of Eight  Germany made a startby meeting the non-aligned countries and the Group of77.The destruction of the environment has long sinceceased to be a soft issue  but  rather  has become a veryhard question which will have an increasingly strongimpact on international security. According to the newstudy by the United Nations Environment Programme(UNEP)  global warming and water shortages will be thebiggest problems facing humanity in the coming century.UNEP also rightly draws attention to the close connectionbetween environmental destruction  poverty and excessiveconsumption. The deadlock in the climate protectionnegotiations must finally be overcome and the KyotoProtocol implemented. The destruction of the rain forestmust be stopped and further desertification prevented  andwe must halt the squandering of our planet’s naturalresources and switch to renewable energy as quickly aspossible. The world does not have much time left to14remap a course towards sustainability. This will also requirea much more active population policy  including along-term strategy to deal with the ageing of our world’spopulation. The International Plan of Action on Ageing adopted in 1982  is in need of urgent revision. We intendto hold a ministerial conference in Germany on this issueunder the auspices of the Economic Commission forEurope.With the leap into the next millennium  the nationState principle will continue to diminish in importance. Itwill no longer be possible to find answers to major globalproblems within the framework of the traditional nationstate. Rather  this will take place in a strengthenedinternational structure and with a transfer of power tointernational organizations  with the United Nations at theirhead. This will entail a transformation of traditional powerinto justice  the reconciliation of interests and a greater rolefor civil society in the international political system  withthe ever-greater involvement of representatives of civilsociety and industry. Reaching agreement on minimumstandards with regard to social issues — on the issue ofchild labour  for example — will be possible in many casesonly in a global context. I support the proposal put forwardby Secretary-General Kofi Annan that a global pact oncommon values and principles be concluded within theframework of a public/private partnership  between theUnited Nations and major companies  in order to lend thelaw of the market a human face.The United Nations must become the core of effectiveglobal governance. Strengthening the United Nations  whichmust begin by guaranteeing its financial basis  is thereforeone of Germany’s most important foreign policy objectives.During the past 50 years  and for the first time in itshistory  Germany has been opting wholeheartedly forintegration into multilateral structures  thereby achievingdemocracy  freedom and reunification. Today  out of asense of deep conviction and historical responsibility  ourcountry is committed to peaceful reconciliation of interestsand to multilateralism. We are taking this conviction withus to our old and new capital  Berlin. In the internationalState system of tomorrow the answer to the challenges ofglobalization will come from multilateralism alone. Ourworld will always be plural  and no form of unilateralismcan therefore work in the long run. For that reason  thetwenty-first century  with its more than 6 billion people andtheir States  will need a United Nations that is capable oftaking action. The United Nations and its Members cantherefore be certain that we Germans will be theirstaunchest allies in the efforts to strengthen the UnitedNations."
"44",1898,"DJI",54,1999,"On the occasionof this historic final session of the General Assembly of thecurrent millennium  which is my first  as I took office inMay this year  I extend  on behalf of the people of Djibouti our sincere best wishes to all the members of the Assembly.I should also like to congratulate you  Sir  on your electionto the presidency of the General Assembly at this fifty-fourth session. Your long and extensive experience with theUnited Nations  beginning as the representative of theSouth-West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) beforeyour country's independence and continuing as itsPermanent Observer  has afforded you a deep insight intothe internal workings of the Assembly  and the challengesit now faces. We are convinced that  thanks to your ampleskills and commitment  this session of the Assembly willbring a remarkable period to a close on a very positivenote.We also wish to express our gratitude to yourpredecessor  Mr. Didier Opertti of Uruguay  for theexemplary manner in which he conducted the work of theGeneral Assembly. The fact that the Assembly was ableto accomplish so much at its fifty-third session was ingreat measure due to his dedication  skill and intelligentmanagement.We must also acknowledge our great admiration forthe tireless efforts of the Secretary-General in continuinghis exemplary work under difficult and tryingcircumstances. On too many fronts the Organization hasbeen facing challenges which jeopardize its properfunctioning  whether dealing with issues of peace andconflict  development  or addressing the severe povertyfaced by many in the world community. Despite a sharpreduction in the inflow of funds at a time of escalatingdemands on the Organization  the Secretary-General hassucceeded in maintaining a high degree of effectivenessthrough intelligent rationalization and restructuring. TheOrganization is therefore continuing to play an importantrole in world affairs  which is in no small measureattributable to the enlightened leadership of the Secretary-General.As this millennium draws to a close  we findourselves in a post-cold-war era of globalism. Thedoctrine that the general pursuit of economic and financialprosperity will necessarily lead to open markets  greaterinternational movement of resources  capital and labour isdeeply entrenched. As we progress  it is claimed  this globalsystem will produce freer societies and expanding middleclasses  which  in turn  will exert pressure for politicalfreedoms. In the end  it is also claimed  we can all expectthe spread of peace as countries become moreinterdependent and economically integrated  for freesocieties do not go to war  at least with each other.This model calls for the ascendancy of a moreefficient private sector and a reduced role for government.For developing countries  the pursuit of maximumeconomic flexibility has been accompanied by a massivereorganization of legal  social  financial  economic  politicaland institutional structures — or  as it is known  structuraladjustment. The cost of these changes has beenconsiderable  not only in financial terms  but also in humanand social terms as well. As the social safety net in manycountries consists of government jobs and services downsizing government has meant considerable suffering and often with a political price to be paid.Thanks to the spread of technology  particularly in thecommunications sector  it is now possible for companiesand organizations to operate on a global scale and to entervirtually any local market of their choosing. Consequently economic domination has shifted to the large  transnationalcorporations and financial conglomerates  which areincreasingly the prime movers in most economic systems.Predictably  the poor and unprepared are increasinglyisolated and marginalized. It is therefore not surprising thatthere is a mounting and widespread backlash against thedestructive effects of this global juggernaut.The old market economy system following the SecondWorld War — the Marshall Plan era — survived becausethere were few persistent losers. Everyone got somethingfrom the system and could claim ownership. We cannot saythat today  for the roster of losers is mounting ominously.This is a distressing omen for the new millennium  made allthe more tragic and infuriating because of the abundance ofpossible remedies. We can make the system workeffectively and beneficially if the will is there. But atpresent the international community lacks determination anda sense of compassion. That does not bode well formankind.Globalization and the rapid expansion and integrationof the international economy have undoubtedly broughtimmense benefits to many countries and positive changesin the living conditions of many individuals. However many countries and their populations  particularly in thedeveloping world  are increasingly facing marginalizationand hopelessness because they are not able to cope withthe rapid pace of integration. The least developedcountries in particular require special attention so thatthey do not slip further into the abyss of poverty anddisintegration.Clearly  the Horn of Africa has had far more than itsshare of wars  natural disasters  collapsing States economic decline and wasted national and humanpotential. For Djibouti  survival alone has consistentlypresented an enormous challenge. However  our nationtoday is stronger and more unified than ever before. Weowe this to the wisdom  perseverance and foresight of ourfirst President and father of the nation  my mentor  TheHonourable Hassan Gouled Aptidon  who voluntarilyretired a few months ago — a praiseworthy decision. Heforged a nation and gave it purpose and strength. Hisenlightened leadership enabled us to remain at peace while sensitive to our region's difficulties and needs. I amproud to follow in the footsteps of this great soul  and Iam determined to safeguard his legacy and our democratictraditions and institutions.Djibouti will continue to work for good governance democracy and independence  with respect for humanrights. We will continue  true to our cultural heritage  togive sanctuary to people displaced by conflicts in ourregion  despite the severe strain this puts on our meagreresources.Africa has many hopeful spots  but there remain anumber of disturbing conflicts involving nations  countlessrebel and separatist movements and factions. Democraticelections took place a few months ago in two majorStates of sub-Saharan Africa — Nigeria and SouthAfrica — and in smaller ones  such as Djibouti  while inmost of the major conflicts ravaging the continentceasefires or peace processes are under way.In looking over these developments  what can wereasonably expect? What must we strive to bring about?Our first priority must be to bring conflict and destructionto an end. That is why ceasefires  the withdrawal ofcombatants  disarmament  the settlement of conflicts  andthe resettlement of displaced persons are importantpriorities for Africa.As conflicts rage in the heart of the continent  adangerous new tendency has begun to appear. Conflictsare no longer localized or fought between two clearadversaries  but attract a growing legion of participants2with divergent agendas. It is depressing to witness themassive loss of life  the wanton destruction and the virtualcollapse of societies.We are therefore relieved that the brutal conflict inSierra Leone is at last resolved. Besides Somalia  perhapsthe most worrying conflict now is Angola  where againoutside actors appear to be playing significant roles.We therefore naturally support the call of theSecretary-General  who in his report on conflict in Africacalled for a reversal of the international community's greatreluctance in recent years to assume the political andfinancial responsibilities associated with deployingpeacekeeping operations.We must also do everything we can to augment theUnited Nations capacity in humanitarian assistance  as wellas in post-conflict peace-building.None of this  though  should absolve Africa of theneed to come together to strengthen its own crisis responseand peacekeeping capability  through the Organization ofAfrican Unity (OAU) and subregional organizations.Last year  in his address to this Assembly  mypredecessor noted the sudden and surprising outbreak ofmassive hostilities between our neighbours  Ethiopia andEritrea. This has been the cause of much anguish apprehension and instability in the Horn of Africa. The lossof life on both sides is among the greatest ever witnessedbetween African States. Persistent efforts by the OAU andvarious countries  including Djibouti  have proved to be invain. Ethiopia is presently seeking further clarification onthe “technical arrangements” proposed by the OAU  and wehope that the ongoing efforts will produce the desiredbreakthrough. If a ceasefire does not take effect andagreement is not reached  the destruction and further loss oflife will once again be deplorable. Years will be needed torepair the damage done to ethnic tolerance and trust in theHorn of Africa. We therefore support the OAU  which isdemonstrating its tenacity and foresight in trying to bringabout a lasting resolution of this crisis.Clearly  Eritrea needs to be a good neighbour to all itsneighbours. Djibouti is now facing a relentless threat ofdestabilization through incursions and landmines  as well asthe training and arming of disaffected elements. Rather thanbeing confined to Ethiopia  hostilities have spread topractically every country in the Horn. We sincerely believethat Eritrea would gain more as an equal partner in thecollective regional efforts to fashion a comprehensivepeace  augment development and address the challengesof environmental degradation  rather than pursuing apolicy of confrontation and senseless and recklessdestabilization.The renewed dialogue between the Palestinians andthe new Israeli leader appears to offer a promisingopportunity for charting a new course in the Middle East.The most urgent need is to restore confidence — a taskthat will involve winning over the hearts and minds ofPalestinians jaded by the cynicism of successive IsraeliGovernments. The timely implementation of theprovisions of the recent agreement should help build thenecessary confidence by making the parties see reason.Advantage must be taken of the current momentum despite the efforts of hostile factions.Now that a time-table has been set for theconsideration of final-status issues such as borders settlements  the status of Jerusalem  refugees  water andstatehood for Palestine  the outcome will depend on thewill and commitment of both sides. The road should alsobe cleared for a settlement of the Golan Heights questionand for the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon  inaccordance with Security Council resolution 425 (1978).The crippling sanctions imposed on Iraq almost adecade ago have taken a heavy toll on the population particularly on the elderly  women and children. We urgethe international community to undertake a realisticreview of these sanctions with a view to lifting themaltogether.The Arab world and the world as a whole haverecently lost several remarkable and pragmatic leaders.King Hussein of Jordan  the Amir of Bahrain and KingHassan II of Morocco are no longer with us. Although weall feel a sense of loss at their premature demise  we haveevery confidence their legacies will live on.Mr. President  I beg your indulgence  as I wouldnow like to speak at length about the tragedy in Somalia.For nearly a decade now we have been witnessing theinexorable disintegration of Somalia. With their countryracked by violence and lacking a government  the Somalipeople are being denied their basic human rights. It isimperative that every effort be made to alleviate thesuffering of the millions of Somalis who have been livinga precarious existence for a decade now. Housing andwater are alarmingly scarce. Rampant lawlessnessprevails  the country is at a political impasse  and itsfuture is bleak. If no concrete steps are taken  the result3will be continued misery and despair  as well as thecontinued destabilization of Somalia's neighbours.This unique situation  I would even say this tragedy ought to be given priority — the kind of seriousconsideration that is given to other tragedies. We stronglybelieve that international and regional stability depend to alarge extent on the domestic stability of all of the StatesMembers of this Organization.It is tragic indeed that the international community isunwilling to acknowledge this reality  simply because  itseems  it has no vital national interests at stake there. Sothe warlords are left to fight it out until a victor emergesand a degree of order is restored. Political will on the partof the international community can bring peace to Somalia too.Because of pervasive indifference and a lack ofresolve  vision and action on our part  Somalia iscrumbling. It is no longer a politically viable entity. Indeed the continued anarchy in that country is indicative of thefailure of global governance to serve poor countries in thedeveloping world. The Somali people know that only toowell. A decade of violence  hunger  disease and uncertaintyhas given rise to unparalleled levels of despair. All Somalis it is safe to say  are living below the poverty line  and thedevastating civil war shows no signs of abating in mostparts of the country. Somalia could easily become a magnetfor criminal elements  drug traffickers and terrorists as wellas a dumping ground of dangerous toxic wastes.Overfishing by foreigners of Somalia's unprotected watersis also a cause of great concern to us.The latest comprehensive report of the Secretary-General on Somalia accurately notes that the country hasdegenerated into a black hole of anarchy  with no nationalgovernment or attributes of statehood. The principal victimsof this senseless conflict are an entire generation of Somalichildren  who are being denied access to education.The United Nations intervened in Somalia in 1992with all the right intentions: to restore peace  stability  andlaw and order. In this respect  it was entrusted withassisting the Somali people in rebuilding their economy andtheir social and political life; restoring their institutionalstructures; achieving national political reconciliation; andrecreating a Somali state based on democratic governance.Regrettably  those laudable intentions came to naughtfollowing the termination of the United Nations Operationin Somalia  due to the lack of cooperation from the Somalifactions over security issues  and despite the exceptionalcircumstances  in particular the absence of a governmentin Somalia.Since the end of the United Nations operation  twoconferences have given rise to a certain optimism — theEthiopian-sponsored Sodere conference and the Cairoconference  sponsored by the Egyptian Government.However  both conferences succeeded only in highlightingthe divisions among the warlords on the one hand and theinterested countries on the other.Several countries and organizations have workedtirelessly to restore some measure of governance inSomalia. The focus  though  has always remained onbringing together the feuding warlords in order to assistthem in reaching an agreement that would end thestalemate. But seeking a lasting settlement through thewarlords  as has repeatedly and unambiguously beendemonstrated throughout the conflict  has proved to bewishful thinking; uncertainty reigns  and the culture ofimpunity persists. Lately  we have seen the formation ofall sorts of political and military alliances across factionallines in a bid to pacify the country  but such initiativesare often greeted with scepticism or even criticism byother factions and even by certain countries. Clearly  nota single factional leader can claim national support oracceptance  because Somali civil society has growncynical about a political game devoid of sincerity  visionand substance.Everybody agrees in recognizing that the warlordscan offer nothing that would lead us to believe that theywill ever agree on a lasting settlement  much less theimplementation of conclusions agreed between them. Thepeople are tired of false rhetoric and deception  as theybecome poorer and their future becomes bleaker everyday. Even beyond Somalia  the warlords pose a potentialthreat. They need to be resisted  for there is the very realproblem of a “contagion” effect  whereby chronicinstability in one country in the Horn might prove to bea real threat to its neighbours  if it is not contained oreliminated within a reasonable period of time.Liberia’s seven-year war  with its child soldiers andunspeakable atrocities against civilians  helped set a tragicpattern that was repeated in Sierra Leone. Obviously already inundated with weapons  Somalia hardly needsexternal involvement by way of arms supplies or proxyconfrontations  but that is precisely what is now takingplace in that country. For all of us  this situation onlyincreases our worry about Somalia’s future.4The challenge that we now face is therefore ofestablishing an authority to fill the void that is continuouslybeing exploited by the warlords. Convening moreconferences that always yield the same results  as has beenthe case over the last 10 years is not the remedy. If wecontinue to entertain the notion of holding yet more of theso-called national reconciliation conferences indefinitely  orinto the next decade  in search of peace in Somalia  thenwe are  in effect  saying that Somali civil society iscondemned to an uncertain future  because the internationalcommunity is not prepared to protect it from criminalelements that usurped power. Despite the “legitimacy”wrongly accorded them by the international community they have never agreed  and will never agree  on anything.Trying to appease the warlords has never succeeded andnever will.The Somalis  too  have human rights; they have thesame right as others to be protected from oppressive malicious and power-hungry individuals who continuallyand freely move from one capital to another  raising fundsand securing armaments. Although these individuals areresponsible for the destruction of their country  for thedeaths of tens of thousands of innocent civilians  countlessnumbers of casualties and for the paralysis that immobilizesthe country to this day  the international community did notintervene in Somalia  “to defend humanitarian principlesand to stand up for the values of civilization and justice” as one Western leader stated in justifying the Kosovooperation. The United Nations Operation in Somalia wasalso saddled with ambiguities in its mandate and there wasnever an intention to rid the country of the warlords.Furthermore  Kosovo represents a clear case ofdetermined and vigorous action to achieve a specificobjective — to drive the marauding Serb army fromKosovo. Furthermore  the United Nations operation inKosovo is vested with unprecedented power  because thecircumstances warrant the exercise of nearly sovereignpowers. It has authority over the territory  the people ofKosovo  the legislative and the executive powers ofKosovo  including the administration of the judiciarysystem. That mandate is a far cry from that in Somalia; butthen Somalia is not Kosovo.We all agree that the current level of fragmentationcannot be allowed to continue. Many ideas have beenfloated in the past  but none of these will succeed or evensurvive as long as the warlords have the luxury ofdetermining the fate of Somalia. Indeed  they continue toexercise a veto over the restoration of peace and nationalauthority. The question remains  for how many more yearswill Somali society have to wait until the warlords accepta power-sharing coalition? Until a final victor emerges?For ever?Liberia was reconstituted through strong internationalefforts. Warlords of varying levels of power and supporteventually submitted to international pressures andaccepted independent  internationally superviseddemocratic elections  followed by the implementation ofagreements during a year of transition carried out underthe leadership of an individual — in fact  a woman — notaffiliated with any of the warlords. The elections weredescribed as “free and fair”  and Liberians were thus ableto bid farewell at last to a destructive and intractableconflict. This was indeed an exemplary process in whichthe Economic Community of West African States supported by the United Nations  played a leading role.Since the outbreak of the Somali crisis some 10years ago  the United Nations  the Organization ofAfrican Unity  the League of Arab States  theOrganization of the Islamic Conference  theIntergovernmental Authority on Development and oursubregional organization  as well as many countries  bothwithin and outside the region  have tried to salvage thatnation from mayhem  anarchy and political paralysisthrough all kinds of conferences  meetings and contactswith and among the warlords. Sadly  however  thewarlords have repeatedly demonstrated their unwillingnessto heed the international community’s call to put the goodof the country above their individual lust for power andcontrol.We have to ask ourselves  as leaders of the worldassembled here  what should be done about Somalia. Thetime has come  in our view  for the internationalcommunity to take a decision to break the long silence onthis forgotten conflict by supporting bold  decisivemeasures against the warlords.That is why  after deep reflection and after takinginto account all relevant factors  I felt compelled to setout before the Assembly today a series of proposals andphased measures that would be the expression of ouroutrage  frustration and impatience with the status quoperpetuated by the warlords.The first phase has to do with the fact that thewarlords  as I have described with great sorrow  havefailed on every count during this long  intractable civilwar. Thus  I am loath to support yet another conferenceheld for these men who have completely lost the5confidence of their people. It is time Somali civil society —including intellectuals  artists and mothers — assumedresponsibility.The Somali people has matured politically during theseyears of suffering and knows what it needs: economicprosperity and social progress in a context of democracy liberty and peace.In line with the wishes of the Somali people  Djiboutiis embarking upon measures intended; to enhance andstrengthen Somali’s confidence in themselves  in each otherand in their common destiny; to make a real contract oftrust and progress between the actors of economic  social cultural and intellectual life; and to implement withdetermination  serenity and equity the work ofrehabilitation  political  economic and administrativenormalization and the promotion of the culture of dialoguebetween the Somali people in order to create a lastingenvironment of dialogue for the emergence of a newgeneration of decision makers.In order for Djibouti to have confidence in the Somalipeople’s responsibility for its future  Somali citizens mustfinally be given the right to speak out so that they canrestore the essential values of liberty  truth  justice responsibility and transparency. By working for and basingthemselves on Somali civil society through the holding ofa genuine reconciliation conference  the representatives ofthe Somali people  including the warlords  will becommitting themselves to the path of peace and nationalreconciliation.We seek a Somalia led and governed by the bestpeople drawn from all generations  in particular people whoinspire confidence because of their commitment to law justice  freedom and peace; those who will govern with aview to fulfilling a mandate that can be withdrawn at anytime in accordance with the requirements of the commongood; those who do not think only of profiting by themisfortune of their brethren to gain a scrap of power nomatter what the cost to the Somali nation. Somalia needsthose men and women who in spite of everything haveretained their ethical values  the force of their personalitiesand their intellectual and spiritual dynamism: free men andwomen who are ready to offer their fellow Somalis acredible way out of their tragedy that will be consistentwith the cultural heritage and collective memory of theSomali people.The reconciliation conference must give rise toagreement and commitment by all Somalis to the followingprinciples. First  there must be acceptance of the basicprinciple that the Somali people is free to exercise itsdemocratic right to select its own regional and nationalleaders in accordance with a time-frame of its ownchoosing. Secondly  the warlords must agree to converttheir factions into political parties that can compete inelections if they choose to do so. Thirdly  the warlordsmust agree to the complete and verifiable disarmament oftheir fighters. Fourthly  the warlords must submit to theprimacy of law. Fifthly  the warlords must accede to theinternational community’s request to participate in therestoration of normalcy  law and order  and a frameworkfor governance. And finally  a national police force mustbe established  one that will represent the entire Somalicommunity and that can incorporate the various militias which will have the opportunity to participate in it.Here I should say that some countries in or outsideof the Horn of Africa  which in one way or another arefueling the conflict in Somalia  must reconsider theirpositions. These countries are pursuing narrow nationalinterests by supporting the profusion of warlords invarious ways  and they are only prolonging the agony andprivation of Somali civil society. I call on all actors in thecivil war to review their priorities with a view toachieving peace in Somalia. It is time that they controlledthemselves: high time.When they can agree that the warlords fully supportor accept the parameters of phase one  the Organizationof African Unity (OAU)  the United Nations and thecountries of the region must work together to helpSomalia in its transition to democracy. As in Guinea-Bissau  the United Nations should establish a post-conflictpeace-building office in Somalia to initiate projects insupport of this process  including by coordinating andmonitoring the holding of legislative and presidentialelections.I turn now to phase two. If the warlords placeinsurmountable obstacles on the road to peace  theinternational community will have to shoulder itsresponsibility and demonstrate robustly that it cannot letthe persecution of Somali civilians continue indefinitelywithout taking action. The warlords must in that case beprosecuted for crimes against humanity: for abuse ofpower  especially through the unjustified persecution ofcivilians; for flagrant violations of human rights; and forhaving caused the collapse of the State and thedestruction of their country. With their unabated violenceand their erratic behaviour  the warlords have stolen thechildhood from Somalia’s young people; they have6deprived their nation of hope and of a future; they havecondemned their people to a precarious existence.Moreover  harsh and targeted punishment must bemeted out to warlords who do not agree to the internationalcommunity’s demand that peace and a framework forgovernance be restored in Somalia: they must be confinedto their bleak and battered areas; they must be banned fromfreely traveling abroad to further their sinister designs; allforeign support and all assistance  whether monetary ormaterial  must be banned; and all their assets  in all formsand wherever they are located  must be frozen.Turning to phase three  if the measures set out in thefirst two phases cannot achieve the objectives because ofobstruction by the warlords  we would be faced with twodifficult choices: We could continue to remain indifferentand to do nothing about the decade-old siege of Somalia; ororganizations to which Somalia belongs  first and foremostthe Organization of African Unity and the League of ArabStates  with support from the United Nations and fromother countries  could decide that they were obliged toresolve the situation by using all necessary means on theprinciple that no State — or criminal warlord in thiscase — may continue indefinitely to commit flagrantviolations of human rights and to hold a country hostageforever.Those are the critical scenarios we need to discuss because  however much one might wish to forget Somalia it will not just go away. We must do something to remedythe situation  and we must do it as quickly as possible.Let me reiterate that we must put an end to thecomplacency we have displayed towards the warlords  andthat Somali civil society must be more closely involved inany future process.It is important to note that the situation is not the samein all regions of the country; anarchy does not prevaileverywhere. Somalia has many contrasting faces dependingon the region. While disorder reigns in areas of the centreand the South  northern regions such as the self-proclaimedstates of Somaliland and Puntland are enjoying relativepeace and stability. Those two areas fortunately escapedmost of the conflict that ravaged the country in the 1990s.They have made a great effort to strengthen security and with very little outside assistance  have carried outadmittedly limited economic reconstruction programmes.The international community has thus far been wary ofproviding meaningful assistance  on the pretext that thepolitical and security situation makes it impossible.As we meet here today  communities in many townsand regions are organizing to determine their own future.This trend towards decentralization or self-administrationis based on the strong determination of the Somalis not tosuccumb  but rather to survive. The internationalcommunity is duty-bound to provide economic support forthese regions and communities that have achieved relativepeace  security and the beginnings of development: near-normalcy. The international community should rewardthose who are trying to provide their people with basicservices  including an institutional framework and mine-clearance efforts.I am grateful to the Secretary-General  who hasplaced the question of Somalia high on the internationalagenda  and to United Nations agencies such as theUnited Nations Development Programme  the UnitedNations Children’s Fund  the Office of the United NationsHigh Commissioner for Refugees and the World FoodProgramme and their partners  who have provided foodand care to the Somali people despite the risks for thesafety of their personnel. But these praiseworthy effortsseem to be showing some fatigue  even frustration because of inadequate support from donors  as reflectedin the lukewarm response to the 1999 United Nationsappeal. We urge the international community to continueto help the Somali people during these times  which areparticularly difficult due in part to the long drought further exacerbated by the ongoing civil war."
"45",1919,"DMA",54,1999,"I am honoured to beafforded this opportunity to extend my delegation’scongratulations to Mr. Gurirab and his country  Namibia  onhis election to the high office of President of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-fourth session. His considerablediplomatic experience is well known  and there is littledoubt that the affairs of this session will be conducted withexpeditiousness  skill and competence. At the same time  Iwish to express my delegation’s appreciation and gratitudeto his immediate predecessor  Mr. Didier Opertti  for theable manner in which he presided over the fifty-thirdsession.Let me extend my delegation’s thanks to ourSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for the excellent andexemplary leadership qualities he has displayed during thiscritical period for the United Nations and the internationalcommunity. The Commonwealth of Dominica welcomesand congratulates the three new Member States — Kiribati Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga — on their admission tothe United Nations. We pledge to work with them onmatters of mutual interest.I take this opportunity to convey my country’s deepestcondolences to the Governments and the people of theBahamas and the United States for the loss of life anddestruction of property caused by hurricane Floyd. I alsoexpress my Government’s sentiments regarding the victimsof the earthquakes in Greece  the Republic of China onTaiwan  Turkey  and  just recently  Mexico. Our sympathyis also extended to the victims of the nuclear accident inJapan.The Commonwealth of Dominica is supportive of theongoing United Nations reform programme  the intent ofwhich is to create a system geared to eliminating waste andduplication and making more efficient use of theOrganization’s resources. At its creation the UnitedNations was charged with responsibility for themaintenance of international peace and security  and thenumerous United Nations missions currently in placearound the globe are testimony to the Organization’sefforts to meet its Charter obligations in this regard.However  we continue to maintain that the restructuringand revitalization process should result in creating anOrganization with the capacity  compassion andeffectiveness to meet the many serious economic  socialand humanitarian problems confronting the majority ofcitizens in the global village.We are not unmindful of the great contributions thatthe United Nations system has made to the improvementof health  the eradication of diseases and the rising levelsof education and living standards in various parts of theworld. Additionally  the United Nations has been at theforefront of efforts to focus international consciousness onhuman rights abuses  while it continues to be the lasthope for the many thousands displaced each year as aresult of political  religious or ethnic conflict.But poverty eradication remains an unfulfilledpromise. Today  increasing numbers of people live inconditions of poverty  with no access to adequate medicalcare  basic education or even clean drinking water. Werecognize that poverty eradication is a task to beundertaken not by the United Nations system alone  butin partnership with the international community  whichmust come to the realization that improvement in socialand economic conditions is less costly than having to dealwith the consequences of sustained economic deprivationand social degradation. The time for engaging in thatpartnership is now.As for the reform of the Security Council  theCommonwealth of Dominica supports the work of theOpen-ended Working Group and its efforts at reconcilingthe many outstanding issues and differences amongMember States. We believe that any meaningful reformof the Security Council should reflect present-dayeconomic and geographical realities and must provide fora reasonable expansion of its membership and equitablerepresentation for regional groupings  with nodifferentiation regarding the rights of permanent members.The Commonwealth of Dominica applauded thedecision of the people of East Timor  as expressed in thepopular consultation of 30 August 1999. We musttherefore deplore and condemn the acts of violence visitedupon the people of East Timor by those determined to21nullify the results of the consultation and maintain thecolonial status quo. We commend the United Nations for itswork in making the consultation possible and we stronglysupport the decision of the Security Council to authorize theestablishment of a multinational peacekeeping force toprotect the people of East Timor as they seek to assert theirright to self-determination.The Commonwealth of Dominica wishes to addressonce again the issue of legitimate representation for theRepublic of China on Taiwan and its people in the UnitedNations. The Republic of China on Taiwan  a model ofdemocracy in the Asian region  is able and willing to carryout the obligations contained in the Charter of the UnitedNations. Over the past few decades  the Republic of Chinahas made tremendous strides in economic development thus enabling it to make a contribution to povertyalleviation through economic assistance programmes indeveloping countries. Dominica is concerned that anindustrialized country  with a democratically electedGovernment  that exercises sovereign authority over adefined geographical area with a population of 22 millionpeople  is denied membership of the United Nations. Thissituation must be addressed in order to ensure that thecitizens of the Republic of China on Taiwan have arepresentative voice in the United Nations and its relatedagencies.The recently concluded special session of the GeneralAssembly on small island developing States provided anopportunity to review the 1994 Barbados Plan of Action.The recognition of small island developing States in thatregard is a significant milestone in the history of the UnitedNations. The follow-up action and the importance which theinternational community places on the implementation ofthe many proposals and recommendations will serve todetermine not only the success of the special session  butalso the credibility of the United Nations and the usefulnessof these conferences.As a small island developing State which has alwaysrecognized the importance of conservation of theenvironment  Dominica made a commitment at the RioSummit to vigorously pursue sustainable development. Twoyears later  Dominica participated in the Global Conferenceon the Sustainable Development of Small Island DevelopingStates in Barbados and has tried at the national level toimplement the Plan of Action within the limits of ourresources.The Barbados Plan of Action recognizes theimportance of coastal and marine resources to thesustainable development of small island developing States.The Commonwealth of Dominica is acutely aware of thatimportance. Prudent use of our coastal and marineresources over many years has contributed immensely tothe economic well-being and sustenance of our citizens.Moreover  the successful implementation of oureco-tourism development programme relies heavily on themaintenance and preservation of the marine and biologicalresources present in the seas around our island State.Those resources are under constant and serious threatfrom a number of sources  such as illegal waste-dumpingwith impunity by foreign-owned ocean liners; overfishingby non-indigenous fishing fleets; and the use of theCaribbean Sea for the transshipment of nuclear waste andother hazardous substances.The Commonwealth of Dominica  together withother members of the Caribbean Community(CARICOM)  continues to view the dangerous practice ofthe transshipment of nuclear waste and hazardoussubstances through the Caribbean Sea as a potentiallyserious threat to the fragile ecosystem and to thelivelihood and well-being of the people of the region  andwe call upon the States engaging in that practice todemonstrate some regard for our justifiable concerns. Weearnestly seek the support of the international communityin our ongoing effort to halt the shipment of thesedangerous materials through the Caribbean Sea. Further members of CARICOM call upon the General Assemblyto recognize the Caribbean Sea as a special area in thecontext of sustainable development and urge theinternational community to support the concept and itsdevelopment.The Commonwealth of Dominica is appreciative ofthe United Nations for paying special attention to theissue of small island developing States at the specialsession of the General Assembly. One sincerely hopesthat this same recognition and support will be in evidenceduring the World Trade Organization (WTO) MinisterialConference later this year  when small island developingStates seek to address their particular concerns andcircumstances.The Commonwealth of Dominica  like most smallvulnerable States  faces increasing challenges fromglobalization; particularly in the area of multilateral tradenegotiations. Due to resource constraints  developingcountries are having difficulties in meeting thecommitments which they made at the Uruguay Round.Yet we are on the eve of making further commitments atthe new round of WTO negotiations to be launched in22Seattle in December. The negotiating process itself exposesdeveloping countries to the growing disparities of themultilateral trading system. We run the risk of developingcountries being further marginalized unless thesenegotiations give full recognition to their specialcircumstances  and in particular to those of small vulnerableeconomies. Small vulnerable economies will continue torequire differential treatment for some time as a means offacilitating their integration into the world economy.My country’s experience with the WTO has not beena positive one. The economy of Dominica and those of theother Caribbean banana-producing countries are heavilydependent for their export earnings on this single crop. TheWTO banana ruling has contributed to a significant declinein our banana exports. Our bananas are cultivated by smallfarmers whose main source of income could be wiped outas a result of the WTO ruling  resulting in increasedunemployment and poverty in the rural areas.We need to find a solution to the banana dispute thatwill allow our farmers to continue to earn a living. Thereis a growing recognition of the need for a tariff rate quotaas the most acceptable solution. However  the NorthAmerican multinational banana companies are insisting ona simple tariff  which will ultimately lead to the demise ofthe small banana producers in the Caribbean and otherAfrican  Caribbean and Pacific States. We continue toreceive assurances that it is not the intention of ourneighbours to the North to hurt the Caribbean producers but their actions indicate otherwise. Moreover  they insiston applying a strict interpretation to the multilateral tradingrules  which displays a callous disregard of the plight ofsmall banana farmers. The rules of the WTO must not beapplied in a manner which is detrimental to thedevelopment process of small vulnerable States.My focus on issues presently facing the region wouldbe incomplete without a brief but sincere appeal to thisbody to address the plight of the citizens of our sister islandCuba. As we progress to a new century  the United Nationsmust continue to condemn the prolonged economicblockade of Cuba.This unjustifiable action is unconscionable unreasonable and a direct infringement on the rights of thepeople of Cuba to pursue a peaceful existence  economicprosperity and self-determination. Dominica therefore joinsother members of the international community in calling foran end to this blockade. We should all seek more amicablemethods of settling bilateral disputes.As a nation preparing to celebrate its twenty-firstanniversary of independence on 3 November 1999 Dominica will continue to equip itself and its citizens tomeet the challenges of the global environment and thenew millennium. The Government of the Commonwealthof Dominica has endeavoured to ensure that its policiesand programmes continue to provide the leadership institutions and infrastructure necessary to attain that goal.The President returned to the Chair.Strengthened by our rich cultural heritage  asmanifested in our Creole music  dance and other forms ofexpression  we are convinced that the world would be asafer and better place if the people of the world learnedto respect and tolerate each other’s culture  religion andtraditions.It is in this spirit that Dominica reaffirms itscommitment to the ideals of the United Nations andpledges to do all in its power to support the efforts of allStates  particularly those of the vulnerable small islanddeveloping States. The challenges facing Dominica aremany  but I am confident that with the support of allMember States and with the help of God we shall prevail."
"46",1963,"DNK",54,1999,"Let me first associatemyself with the statement of my colleague  the FinnishMinister for Foreign Affairs  on behalf of the EuropeanUnion.Let me also  Mr. President  congratulate you on yourelection. Denmark's relations with Namibia and with youpersonally go back to long before your country'sindependence. I am therefore particularly gratified to seeyou in this position.In my statement today  I should like to dwell upon theresponsibility of the international community  including  ofcourse  the United Nations  for human security anddevelopment. We live in an ever more globalized world.Almost every day we are confronted with new challengesthat must be met. Distance or ignorance of events no longerprovides a sense of security.Close international cooperation is needed to meet thechallenges. But paradoxically  although the challenges areglobal  policy-making and institutions still remainpredominantly national in focus and scope.Increasingly we see internal conflicts and blatantviolations of human rights and humanitarian law pose aspecial and serious kind of threat. Terrorism  drug-trafficking and international crime also thrive in aglobalized world.The international community must possess the meansand display the resolve to confront such challenges. Ourfundamental concerns about human security and humandevelopment cannot be met only in a domestic context.I should like to illustrate these concerns  first  inrelation to the Kosovo and East Timor crises and  secondly with regard to international development cooperation.Kosovo and East Timor raised serious questions withregard to the classic concepts of State sovereignty  therespect for human rights and the non-use of force ininternational relations. How do these concepts interrelate?How do they relate to our concern for human security?And what does the interrelationship mean for the role andresponsibility of the United Nations and for the SecurityCouncil?The first point to be made is that the internationalcommunity cannot be idle in the face of gross andsystematic violations of human rights. Nor can we standidly by if the United Nations and its representatives  whohave assisted a people in exercising its right to self-determination  are trampled on.International law finds itself at a crossroads. Wehave spent the last 50 years developing an impressivebody of human rights law  applicable in time of peace aswell as during armed conflict  starting with the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights. Indeed  there is no shortageof rules. What is lacking is effective implementation ofexisting rules  in the very last resort through the use offorce.We must now aim at enforcement in order toprovide assistance  regardless of frontiers  to the victimsof human rights violations. We must show resolve inpromoting respect for the rule of law and for theinstitutions called upon to uphold the rule of law. A broadspectrum of actions is available; the choice of action mustdepend on the problem we face. The thorny question iswhether and when to use military force in the face of anemerging humanitarian catastrophe  such as a plannedethnic cleansing or downright genocide.It cannot be emphasized too often that a negotiatedsettlement must remain the primary and ultimate goal ofany conflict solution. If  however  all attempts at securinga peaceful solution fail or are brushed aside  the questionof whether to use force in one form or another arises.This brings the United Nations Security Council to theforefront. The Council has the primary responsibility formaintaining international peace and security. It has carriedout its functions as foreseen in the United Nations Charterin a much more effective and innovative way since theend of the cold war. I am referring  in particular  to theconflicts in relation to Iraq  Bosnia  Haiti  and Albania. Amain challenge for the Security Council remains that ofreacting effectively against gross and systematic violationsof human rights conducted against an entire population.36The Council has interpreted its competence underChapter VII of the Charter to cover humanitarian situationsthat shock the conscience of mankind. This augurs well forthe victims of brutal oppression and ill for the dictators oftoday. Oppressors of whole peoples  mass murderers andethnic cleansers can no longer invoke the shield of nationalsovereignty. Nor can they expect impunity. Theinternational community has a responsibility to act in theface of a humanitarian tragedy such as the one wewitnessed in Kosovo and the one we are witnessing in EastTimor.Unfortunately  the Council was not able to live up toits responsibilities concerning the ethnic cleansing inKosovo. Should the paralysis of the Council lead to blindacceptance? No; the international community could notstand idly by and watch  while the principle of Statesovereignty was misused in Kosovo to violate internationalhumanitarian law.In this serious situation the decision to launch theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization campaign was legitimateand justified. It opened the way to a political solution bringing the United Nations back into a central role.In East Timor we were faced with widespread organized atrocities against a civilian population exercisingits right to self-determination. In addition  the risk of totaldisregard for the United Nations was looming. Fortunately the Security Council was not paralysed. Pressure from theinternational community brought about action. Anagreement was reached to deploy a multinational force.We welcome this development.We urge the Indonesian Government to cooperate fullywith the multinational force. In the meantime  theIndonesian Government remains responsible for the securityof the population. It must make it possible for thehumanitarian organizations to provide assistance for thelarge number of displaced persons in East Timor.We all share the responsibility for enabling theinternational community to address these issues and forenabling the United Nations to act. Where force has to beresorted to  we have to look to countries possessing thatcapability. In practical terms  this means that we often haveto rely upon countries and organizations in the region.The Security Council must do its utmost to live up toits primary responsibility for the maintenance of peace security and humanitarian decency — a primaryresponsibility that all the Member States have vested inthe Security Council in accordance with Article 24 of theCharter.The Council's permanent members should apply theveto only in matters of vital importance  taking intoaccount their unique responsibility for the interests of theUnited Nations as a whole. And they should state on whatgrounds they consider such a situation to be present.The Secretary-General has said “any armed intervention is itself a result of thefailure of prevention”. (A/54/PV.4)I agree with the Secretary-General that conflict preventionand resolution must be given the highest possible priorityin international relations. It should be carried out on thebasis of a common resolve to secure human rights for all.The United Nations constitutes a needed and valuable toolto this end.Conflict resolution must  of course  not become onlya question of the use of force. Let me point to twoimportant aspects of the post-conflict situation. First those who are responsible for war crimes and crimesagainst humanity must be brought to justice. The creationof the ad hoc tribunals for the former Yugoslavia andRwanda were important first steps towards establishing aneffective international legal order based upon democraticvalues and the rule of law. The work of the tribunals hasunderlined the need for a permanent international criminalcourt designed to bring to justice those who havecommitted crimes of the most heinous kind. Theprospects for lasting peace and reconciliation are severelyundermined if war criminals and the like remain at large.The historic adoption last year in Rome of a statutefor a permanent international criminal court is a landmarkcontribution to restoring the rule of law and endingimpunity. Although not perfect  the Rome Statuteprovides a satisfactory basis for an effective and crediblecourt. We urge all States to ratify the Statute as early aspossible in order to put this historic building block inplace. Denmark intends to ratify in the spring of the year2000.Secondly  post-conflict assistance must be providedto the societies split by civil strife or war. Denmark isready to do its part. With respect to the western Balkans we initially provided assistance to refugees and for theirsafe return. Now we are gradually turning to assistance in37reconstruction and rebuilding of both physical and socialinfrastructure. A plan of action for Denmark's support inthis respect has been drawn up. The plan expects Danishfunds in the order of $100 million dollars to be used in theregion in 1999 and around $120 million dollars in the year2000.The reconstruction of Kosovo is important. It includesthe establishment of a well-functioning civil administration.The United Nations family and many non-governmentalorganizations are undertaking important tasks which deserveour full support. All parties must strive to heal the woundsof conflict.International relations and international cooperation arenot based on a one-issue agenda. Certain issues may graband almost monopolize the headlines for a while. In Europewe have to deal with the Balkans. But we must not neglectthe other important issues on the international agenda  inparticular international development cooperation and thestruggle for the eradication of poverty.In a world where a third of the population ofdeveloping countries earns less than $1 per day  where 30per cent of all children under five in those countries areunderweight  where 14 per cent of the population will notattain the age of 40  where financial crisis has led to amajor setback in poverty reduction — in such a worlddevelopment cooperation must remain an integral part ofthe effort of the international community to promote andprotect human security and human development.The international community must acknowledge itsshare of the responsibility for making the opportunities ofglobalization available to all. Globalization must notbecome identical with protected and selective prosperity.Eradication of poverty is an essential goal in its ownright. Furthermore  poverty is an important cause ofconflict. And again  violent conflict may undo the results ofdecades of development. Development cooperation therefore  constitutes an effective crisis-prevention effort forthe long term.International development cooperation must be basedon the fulfilment as soon as possible of the agreed target of0.7 per cent of gross domestic product for officialdevelopment assistance and on implementing the decisionsof the big United Nations conferences of recent years withregard to human and social development  eradication ofpoverty  sustainable development and gender equality. Thefollow-up conferences to the Beijing conference and  in theyear 2000  to the Copenhagen summit are importantevents requiring our full attention.Denmark stands by these commitments. We willcontinue our policy of contributing 1 per cent of our grossnational product to official development assistance.Poverty reduction is the prime goal of our developmentcooperation programmes. In addition  we are providingfunding to help address global problems in the field of theenvironment as well as peacekeeping and conflictprevention. These grants will grow in the coming years reaching half of 1 per cent of gross domestic product bythe year 2005  thus bringing Denmark's total contributionto international assistance to 1.5 per cent of grossdomestic product.Creating an enabling environment for developmentis a challenge  first of all for developing countriesthemselves. Reforms cannot be imposed from the outside.If they are to succeed  local ownership and local roots areessential. Official development assistance has an essentialrole to play in helping the poorest countries  particularlyin Africa. Official development assistance also assists inbuilding up the sectors that do not attract privateinvestment: health  education  the social sectors andcapacity-building in general. In this way  countries mayalso  eventually  become able to attract private investmentand to avail themselves of the opportunities ofinternational trade.In this context  it is deplorable to see officialdevelopment assistance reaching its lowest point ever.Honouring the commitments of official developmentassistance entered into internationally by industrializedcountries has become a question of credibility. It is alsoa question of the effectiveness of the multilateral system.The United Nations system cannot perform the tasks weask of it if we deny it the necessary means. Thedownward trend of official development assistance mustbe reversed and a higher share should be multilateral.Many poor countries are crippled with debthampering their development. We therefore welcome theproposals to improve the Heavily Indebted Poor CountriesDebt (HIPC) Initiative. We are  however  disappointed bythe lack of progress in financing the Initiative. We appealto the major donor countries to live up to theirresponsibilities following the debt declaration of theCologne summit.Besides aid  not instead of aid  developing countriesneed trade. In the forthcoming new global trade round 38every effort must be made to ensure better market accessfor developing countries and to enhance their real capacityto take part in international trade.The pursuit of human security and human developmentare not two independent paths. They are interrelated.Without economic and social development  it makes nosense to talk about human security. Where security does notexist  there will be no sustainable development. Whenviolent conflict erupts  the results of decades ofdevelopment may be undone in a very short time. We mustuphold the importance of both concerns and we mustemphasize that they are a national as well as aninternational responsibility.We thus face a major challenge at the threshold of thenext millennium — a challenge we should give properattention to at the Millennium Assembly next year."
"47",2008,"DOM",54,1999,"It is a particularhonour for me to address the Assembly on behalf of theGovernment and people of the Dominican Republic and totake this opportunity to express my warmest congratulationsto you  Sir  on your recent election as President of the fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly.I would also like to commend the excellent work ofthat outstanding representative of our region  the ForeignMinister of Uruguay  Mr. Didier Opertti  who so efficientlyconducted the proceedings of the fifty-third session of theGeneral Assembly.Let me also wish Mr. Kofi Annan every success inthe important and delicate tasks he is carrying out asSecretary-General of the United Nations.This venerable institution  the United Nations  wasfounded more than half a century ago with the lofty goalof safeguarding peace among nations and the integrity ofpeoples. The United Nations has made a significantcontribution to preventing armed conflict  reducingtension  resolving differences  promoting negotiation andagreements  and encouraging tolerance and non-violence.But in a world that is becoming increasinglycomplex in the wake of an era marked by bipolarconfrontation between two models of civilization  andwith the rise of a technological revolution that hascontributed to an accelerated sense of time  a reduction indistances and an increase in expectations  the UnitedNations must exercise renewed leadership in order toconfront this new set of circumstances which  while theyrepresent tremendous opportunities for the peoples of theworld  may also threaten their future.It is no longer just a matter of preventing war andconflict; that unavoidable task will always be expected ofthe Organization. The United Nations must ensure forevery human being on this earth a dignified  hopeful anddecent existence.Never before has the world accumulated so muchwealth. At no other time in history has humankind beenable  as it is today  to produce everything it needs in theway of food  clothing  shelter  communications andtransportation. The level of wealth that exists today issuch that each and every day  more than a trillion dollarscirculates in international capital markets for purelyspeculative purposes  producing what today is known asa “casino economy”.In order to give a rough idea of what that volume ofcapital means  I must point out that a single day ofoperations in the financial markets is equivalent to twicethe annual gross national product of all the Africancountries. However  that wealth is concentrated in just afew countries that today are identified as centralcountries  and inside each of them wealth is concentratedin a few hands that control industry  finance transportation and communications. The concentration ofwealth in a few countries  and the influence that those4countries exert in the media  leads to the dissemination ofa consumer philosophy that in turn contributes to theadoption of artificial lifestyles and behaviour patterns thatare conducive to waste  luxury and ostentation.Alongside all this wealth  however  the world hasnever suffered so much poverty. Today  1.3 billion peoplelive in extreme poverty  and most of them suffer fromhunger every day. In such a wealthy world  3 billion peoplesurvive on less than $2 a day  and each year 50 millionchildren are permanently harmed because of malnutrition.Some 1.5 billion people have no access to drinking water and more than 2 billion have no access to drainage orsewerage facilities. A large percentage have very limitedaccess to education  health care and housing  and hundredsof millions are unemployed or have no secure or permanentincome.This stark and horrifying contrast between wealth andpoverty constitutes a huge challenge for all the nations ofthe world and the United Nations system as we approachthe twenty-first century. There are no magic formulas forresolving this situation. Only the concerted efforts of allnations  rich and poor  working to the same end in a spiritof solidarity and a sense of humanity will make it possiblefor the whole of humankind to share on a basis of equalityand social justice in the prodigious and unprecedentedcreation of wealth in this era.For some time  in various international forums  a setof balanced and reasonable ideas have been put forward and if they were applied they would contribute to asignificant reduction in poverty and to the creation ofopportunities.The world welcomed with great joy and satisfactionthe decision adopted by the countries members of theOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Developmentto use 0.7 of their gross national product to finance aprogramme aimed at halving by the year 2015 thepercentage of the inhabitants of developing countries livingin extreme poverty. Despite the public commitment madeby those countries  cooperation for development fell to 0.22of the combined product of the donor countries in 1997 which is the lowest figure since the 1950s.It is unfair that while there is a daily transfer of over$1 trillion from the central or highly developed countries there is a tendency to decrease official developmentassistance for the least developed countries.The developing countries have watched their externaldebt climb from $1.6 trillion in 1993 to $2.5 trillion in1998. The external debt of Latin America increased from$44.786 billion in 1980 to $669 billion in 1997 — analmost fifteen-fold increase in 17 years. Interest payments which remained stable between 1980 and 1994 at a levelbetween $24 billion and $28 billion  increased sharply  in1997 reaching $42 billion.The current proposal is to reduce the debt of onlythe heavily indebted poor countries. It seems to us thatalthough this is a very significant first initiative  it is notsufficient because it excludes a group of countries including the Dominican Republic  that have madesignificant efforts to achieve progress and peace  yet facea titanic struggle to overcome underdevelopment andpoverty.Forgiving external debt  or at least reducing itsignificantly  or eliminating the interest would be a justacknowledgement of those countries that  in spite of theirinternal difficulties  have adopted strict adjustmentmeasures that have made it possible for them scrupulouslyto honour their international obligations. Forgivingexternal debt  or reducing it in any other way  would bea true gesture of international solidarity aimed at reducingpoverty. Furthermore  the resources that would be freedas a result would greatly benefit the creditor countries andthe international commercial banking community  sincethe purchasing power of poor nations would be increased thereby generating a new dynamism in the worldeconomy.The so-called Asian crisis generated internationalturbulence  led to the Russian crisis and had a similarimpact on the Brazilian economy  which in turn affectedthe Southern Cone economies. In analysing that crisis  theWorld Bank and the International Monetary Fund agreedthat it resulted from factors generated by the internationalflow of capital in the Asian stock markets. As a result ofthat situation  which has been identified as the first majorcrisis of the globalized economy  the economists of bothinstitutions have proposed the creation of a newinternational financial architecture. That new architecturewould seek to stabilize the financial markets through theadoption of a set of careful measures  both national andinternational  to prevent another financial crisis in thefuture.These proposals would seem to be wise andbeneficial. However  we believe that a true newinternational financial structure  as the focal point of a5global economy  should include the element of internationalsolidarity and cooperation aimed at the introduction ofmeasures to reduce poverty. We cannot understand whymore than $1 trillion dollars circulates in internationalfinancial transactions every day while not a penny of thoseresources goes to the world's poor. All of Haiti's problemswould be solved with only a single minute's worth ofbanking transactions on the international market. The samecould be said of Nicaragua and of Honduras  and even ofour own country  the Dominican Republic.The eradication of poverty is not an illusory goal.With the wealth currently circulating world-wide  we couldrestore a sense of dignity to each and every human being.Determining how to achieve this is the big challenge facingthis Organization in the twenty-first century.To meet that challenge the United Nations itself has togo through a process of change and reform  beginning withacceptance that all its Member States are equal  with nodifferentiation between the powerful ones that possess theright of veto and the poor ones that have been marginalizedin the very Organization that represents them. There is nodoubt that we now have a unique opportunity to reform theSecurity Council. The Dominican Republic is convincedthat reform of the Security Council must be carried out inkeeping with the principles of equitable geographicaldistribution and the equal sovereignty of Member States since no reform will be acceptable if it leads todiscriminatory treatment of developing nations bydeveloped nations.It is in this spirit that the Dominican Republic aspiresto election in the near future to a seat as a non-permanentmember of the Council. Our country  although small insize  has a pacifist tradition that it would hope to channelinto and combine with the basic principles that should guidethe Security Council.The Dominican Republic is proud to have introducedresolution 47/5  by which the Assembly proclaimed 1999 asthe International Year of Older Persons. Now that the Yearis drawing to a close  we are especially proud of itsinternational success. In the Dominican Republic  thanks tothe concerted efforts of the Government  in September1998  our Congress approved a bill of rights for olderpersons and established a national committee to oversee itsimplementation. We consider this to have been our mostimportant contribution the Year.As host country to the International Research andTraining Institute for the Advancement of Women(INSTRAW)  we wish once again to stress thefundamental importance of the Institute  which is one ofonly three United Nations entities headquartered in adeveloping country  and the only one situated in theregion of Latin America and the Caribbean. It is asimportant as it was in 1978  when it was created topromote the advancement of women  especially in ourdeveloping nations. We therefore appeal to allGovernments to contribute to revitalizing the Institute sothat it may continue its important work.We are confident that this great Organization willrenew itself and will act with the visionary leadership forwhich it was created for by its founders at the SanFrancisco Conference  in a world that expects greatersolidarity among nations and a more just  equitable andhumane international order.I wish to conclude by calling on States Members ofthe United Nations to participate in and support theMillennium Assembly. We believe that that importantassembly will reaffirm our commitment to the UnitedNations Charter  by highlighting the mission of the UnitedNations system in the twenty-first century in the light ofthe problems posed by globalization and of the need toensure that that process will be of benefit to us all."
"48",2055,"DZA",54,1999,"So it isAfrica  through two of its most devoted and eminent sons that has the particular honour of leading the United Nationsinto the new millennium. I refer to you  Mr. President  aworthy freedom fighter for our sister nation  Namibia; Inow salute your well-deserved election to the presidency ofthe General Assembly. I refer also to Mr. Kofi Annan  ourSecretary-General  to whom the international community isindebted for the great perseverance and fervour he hasshown in his promotion of the purposes and principles ofthe Charter and in strengthening the role of the UnitedNations.I am very moved to address this Assembly  because by electing me 25 years ago to the presidency at its twenty-ninth session  the General Assembly was even then showingits esteem for and interest in Africa and its considerationfor all of those generations of freedom fighters who  likethose of my country  have assumed the historicresponsibility of making a decisive contribution to theadvent of a better world. Twenty-five years have passedduring which the inexorable movement towards freedomhas followed its course  toppling the last bastions ofcolonialism and racial segregation  and enshrining theright to sovereign equality of States and the right ofpeoples to development  self-determination andindependence.At the same time  a new situation has emergedmarked by greater interdependence between nations which  as they have gradually become more and moreaware of the unity of their destinies  can no longer affordto live in isolation nor remain indifferent or insensitivewhen something happens to one of their members.I have therefore come to speak about this commondestiny  on behalf of Africa and Algeria  at a time whenour session has chosen the theme of the culture of peaceand non-violence. Throughout this century  the world hasconstantly evolved  created  destroyed  reinvented itselfand moved forward. Despite ideological conflicts andeconomic crises  political tensions and devastating wars humanity has made its way inexorably towards one andthe same history — one and the same destiny.New challenges are today confronting theinternational community in a context occasioned by theeasing of ideological struggles  the end of the cold warand the creation of a unipolar world  with its inherentparadoxes for development.One of these challenges is what is today calledglobalization: a global economy  a global political system even global values and aspirations — but also  globalproblems and dangers. In any case  implementation ofglobalization is encountering a variety of barriers andobstacles. On the economic side  unequal developmentbetween nations certainly does not facilitate theestablishment of a universally accepted new world order.Worrying gaps are beginning to appear  especially inAfrica: a chronic deterioration in the terms of trade; acrushing weight of debt; fratricidal conflicts;environmental degradation; increasing unemployment;persistent epidemics; falling numbers of children inschool; declining official development assistance andmeagre direct investment. Furthermore  two thirds of theleast developed countries and three quarters of the low-income countries are in Africa. In addition  50 per cent ofthe continent’s population live in abject poverty.The thirty-fifth Organization of African Unity(OAU) Summit showed that Africans were ready to face11up to this miserable situation by working for peace  stabilityand cooperation and by entrenching political and economicreform more firmly. But it also revealed how insubstantialNorth-South cooperation is  showing that it is often limitedby policies based on vested interests or selectiveintervention.The Summit also pointed out the difficulties inherentin the social  cultural and psychological structure of ourcountries  with many misunderstandings resulting from themechanical application of criteria adopted in developedcountries not only in the economic but also in the politicaland cultural areas.The problems which have still to be solved aretherefore numerous  and the international community seesthem every day in Africa  Asia  the Balkans and the MiddleEast. To these problems must be added the globalcontroversy between the champions of an optimisticuniversality that easily tolerates the advent of andadjustment to a unipolar world  and those who retain asense of their own identity and consider  rightly  that theinterests of mankind lie in constructing a multipolar world.These problems do not  however  mean that all hopesfor harmonious globalization are purely utopian: theymerely represent obstacles to an evolution which we knowis unavoidable. What would be an illusion  however  wouldbe globalization of the impossible  globalization that ignoresthe legitimate interests of humankind as a whole  becausesooner or later that would be doomed to failure. Theglobalization of problems is a fact of life; that is why it isimperative for us to find global solutions.It cannot be overemphasized how discouraging it is tosee such a constantly widening gap between rich and poorand between rich countries and Third World countries thatare stifled by debt. I certainly do not intend to complain tothe Assembly about the many upheavals of a “ThirdWorldism” whose approach and methods are at least 20years old and have become obsolete. The world is nolonger as it was in the 1970s; it has changed radically. Itseems to me  however  that this movement towardspluralism and the market economy should be continued andencouraged  and that it should be accompanied by amovement towards solidarity. In fact  I believe that thelogic of power and confrontation that has marked thetwentieth century should give way to a logic of solidaritythat will make international relations more humane  basedon fair exchange and shared prosperity.The progress of nations would be incomplete if werestricted ourselves to seeking it solely through themarket. We must also continue to seek it simply bypromoting the most basic human rights. In sharing theidea of human rights  it must be made clear that thedefinition and observance of human rights must take intoaccount the context of each of our States  with theirdiffering traditions  social structures and priorities. For us human rights are balanced by the duties of the citizen andgoverned by inescapable priorities. Apart from thestruggle against poverty  disease and illiteracy — ensuringthat every human being has the right to a decent anddignified life — is it not true that human rights also meanthe protection of society from terrorism  drug traffickersand purveyors of death of every kind? In this respect there are no discrepancies between our concerns and thoseof the developed world on the issue of democracy andhuman rights. Nevertheless  it remains true that these areissues of utmost importance and highest priority.This is why we believe that the idea of the progressof the human race  and its emergence into the twenty-firstcentury through the adoption of the laws of the freemarket  freedom of investment and other freedoms  cannotbe separated from its progress through development aidand solidarity with Third World countries. In other words our interest should be focused on the renewal ofinternational action within the United Nations system soas to adapt it to the new world contexts  to help itrespond to the legitimate expectations of the greatmajority of nations and to bring about renewed progresstowards peace  stability  equity and shared prosperity.I come from a continent where people need to havefaith in justice  because they believe that the countrieswhich exploited their resources to ensure their owndevelopment have a heavy debt to repay. They need tobelieve that  having given so much to building humancivilization in the modern era  they have the right todemand that their dignity and their humanity should befully respected. I seek also to remind this Assembly that by letting poverty proliferate in a world which isbecoming increasingly interdependent  the rich countriesand the community of nations are paving the way fordisruptions in national life and for international relationsthat will be increasingly susceptible to threats of violence conflict and discord  which are harmful to democracy andto economic activity.I also wish to recall that the failure of the ThirdWorld  and of Africa in particular  to make itself heard —a failure reflected in the results of the Uruguay Round —12does not augur well for solutions to all the problems that Ihave mentioned. Does our degeneration mean that we areirrevocably doomed to decline  and that the poverty of themajority is irremediably bound to dominate the comingcentury? I prefer not to believe that that is the case; I preferto believe rather that recovery is possible so long asconcerted and sustained action is taken in parallel withaction by the United Nations.Such action must have two tiers. The first tier lieswith the industrialized countries because the solution to theThird World’s problems is in their hands  as the ManagingDirector of the International Monetary Fund rightly statedover ten years ago: they have sufficient economic  financialand legislative leverage to initiate reform and to restore anenvironment conducive to growth for the developingcountries.The second tier lies with the developing countriesthemselves  which must take on the essential task ofbecoming self-reliant by organizing their entry into theworld economy and by following through with economicand political reforms. Unfortunately  they have no otherchoice.It is against this background that Africans met lastJuly in Algiers  where the thirty-fifth Organization ofAfrican Unity (OAU) Summit was held. During thismeeting  which enjoyed a record number of participants Africans took stock of their achievements sinceindependence  weighed up current reforms in the light ofexternal forces and internal realities and laid down thefoundations of a new approach to and a new vision of thefuture of the continent. Priority was given to concord andpeace in Africa. Africa is determined to speed up thesettlement of the conflicts between Eritrea and Ethiopia andin the Great Lakes region  the Democratic Republic of theCongo and Sierra Leone. Activities within OAU and thesubregional organizations have been intensified towardsrestoring peace and putting an end to the suffering of therefugees.Similarly  Africa has unequivocally stated that itsupports international legality  democracy and respect forlaw  and accordingly it has set out the guidelines for theOAU position on the situations in Angola and in WesternSahara. It fully supports the United Nations initiatives there as it does the OAU good offices in the Comoros  where ithopes that the Comoran people will proceed withdemocratic elections for their institutions so as to preservethe country’s unity and territorial integrity.A concern for peace and concord also underliesAfrica’s assessment of the Middle East peace process which it hopes will come to a comprehensive  fair andlasting solution based on withdrawal by Israel from theterritories unjustly occupied by it and on its recognitionof the Palestinian people’s legitimate and inalienablerights.OAU is similarly concerned about peace and securityin the Gulf  where economic sanctions that are disastrousfor the affected populations should be lifted  as shouldthose unjustly imposed against Libya and Sudan eventhough their Governments have fully cooperated with therelevant investigations.The human race must enter the new millennium freeof the disputes born of the historical vicissitudes of thetormented and tragic century now drawing to its close. Inthis context  hotbeds of tension and crises must beeliminated. The suffering of peoples who are still unableto exercise their right to self-determination andindependence must end. The embargo imposed on theIraqi people must be resolved in a less harmful way  asour Secretary-General of OAU would say  in keepingwith United Nations resolutions. Terrorism  organizedcrime  drug and arms trafficking — which underminerelations between States and weaken peaceful and fruitfulinternational cooperation — must be a top priority. New ethical international relations should also be prioritized inorder to usher in a new era of peace and commonprosperity.The Algiers Summit  however  did not restrict itselfto expressing  clearly  Africa’s desire to bring to an endthe tragic phase of conflicts which are tearing it apart and to go along  step by step  with the efforts of theinternational community to institute a just and long-lastingpeace everywhere in the world. The Summit also studiedeconomic and development issues within the frameworkof the Abuja Treaty  consolidating macroeconomicreforms through the revival of sustained growth andthrough regional integration within the framework ofAfrican unity  the principle of which has just beenenshrined by the Sirte special Summit.The Sirte Summit reaffirmed OAU solidarity withand support for fraternal Libya concerning the need for afinal lifting of the unfair embargo imposed upon it. Itdecided also to establish new rules and norms to facilitatethe development of operational structures and modalitiesfor OAU with a view to achieving effective unionbetween the countries of Africa. Such a union will13guarantee Africa’s security and strengthen cooperationbetween its peoples  which will gain Africa the respect andstatus it deserves in the light of the heavy cost it has paidthroughout history in sacrifice  slavery  exploitation anddespoliation during the colonial era. Such a union will alsopromote Africa’s material and human potential and all thatmakes it so different from the rest of the world. In short the Sirte Summit has reaffirmed in full the right of Africato be an active part of the globalization process. As aresult  justice will be equal for all  and the new conceptsintroduced by globalization will be immunized against anyform of injustice  abuse or exclusion.The Summit also affirmed the necessity of advancingnew reforms in the context of cooperation and partnershipbetween the United Nations and OAU in all fields. Lastly the Summit proposed a new ethics for internationalrelations  where the requirements of production andcompetition should obscure neither the higher interest ofhumanity — whose very existence is under threat from allkinds of environmental degradation and other scourgesaffecting the natural world  humankind and human valuesand institutions — nor the rights of nation States to theirintegrity and sovereignty.We do not deny the right of northern-hemispherepublic opinion to denounce the breaches of human rightswhere they exist. Nor do we deny that the United Nationshas the right and the duty to help suffering humanity. Butwe remain extremely sensitive to any undermining of oursovereignty not only because sovereignty is our finaldefence against the rules of an unjust world  but becausewe have no active part in the decision-making process inthe Security Council nor in monitoring the implementationof decisions.Furthermore  inasmuch as the sovereign state remainsbeyond dispute a place of social contract and the contextwithin which human rights should be organized — politicalrights  as well as economic and social ones — theinternational community should favour stability as well asconcord and the culture of democracy for our developingcountries. But all this will remain a dream so long as thereal issues at stake  those of economic and socialdevelopment  have not been clearly set out  because  forAfrica as for other continents  these issues are the crux ofthe matter.The debate on the concept of interference in internalaffairs consequently seems far from over  as at least threequestions require exact answers: first  where does aid stopand interference begin? Second  where are the lines to bedrawn between the humanitarian  the political and theeconomic? Third  is interference valid only in weak orweakened States or for all States without distinction? Inany event  we firmly believe that interference in internalaffairs may take place only with the consent of the Statein question. We firmly believe that the countries of theSouth are capable of overcoming their difficulties  so longas solidarity  loyal assistance and the concern of thedeveloped countries and the international community donot fail them.Algeria has paid a very heavy price for democracy and like other African countries must shoulder the highsocial cost of the reforms which it is undertaking. It hasembarked upon a vast project of national renewal. It isworking hard to ensure civil concord  enhance democracy establish the rule of law and renew and modernize itsjudicial system and administration. In short  we areworking to create conditions for the best possible use ofthe country’s economic potential and for individual andcollective well-being in a society where peace has beenrestored and where free enterprise  justice and dignity areguaranteed for all.This is an enormous undertaking  but a necessaryone after a decade of ordeals in what was a war ineverything but name — a war that was inflicted on us and which allowed terrorism and extremism to doviolence against society  values  dignity and people’sconsciences. My country is re-emerging  slowly  fromthese tragic events  which were foreign to Islam. Manythings have been said in various forums about this ordealwhich engulfed my country — most often  alas  by peoplewho are hostile to or who have only a superficialknowledge of Algerian society and its problems. I willrefrain here from condemning anyone’s opinions  but I dobelieve that when a people has been exposed to a tragedylike the one in Algeria  for a whole decade  and has facedup to it with the courage and tenacity which the Algerianpeople have shown  then that people should at the leasthave the right to use its own Republic’s institutions todefend itself.Yes  my country has been wounded — the veryflesh of its children has been wounded. Tens of thousandsof them are dead — some victims of fanaticism  somevictims of others’ madness. In general terms  people havebeen victimized by the general confusion that nearlybrought the Republic to its knees  hence Algeria’soverwhelming desire to defend its existence.14In this context of passions unleashed  disorder  theinstinct for murder  the marginalization of society devastating nihilism and blood and tears  men  women andchildren have lived through untold suffering and thecountry’s infrastructure has been flagrantly and blindlydestroyed  with extremely negative effects on our economy.Today the Algerian people are licking their wounds.The main thrust of our national recovery is civil concord;this shows the innate magnanimity of our people and ourunshakeable commitment to the lofty values of tolerancewhich characterize true Islam. Today  the Algerian peopleare rejecting violence because it is not part of our tradition.They are committed to pivotal human rights  as they wereduring their struggle for independence and during thebuilding of their country. They proved this in thereferendum of 16 September by saying a resounding ""yes""to the law on civil concord adopted by the Parliament inJuly. They proved this also by opening their hearts andextending the hand of generosity to those who had defiedsociety and the laws of the Republic. They are proving itthrough their reliance on the law  itself increasingly inspiredby the lofty ideals of the State of law and which  withoutbeing repressive  may not be broken by anyone  includingthe State. They have proved it because  true to their ownselves  they know that peace and solidarity alone are thekeys to economic and social progress.The principles which we are recommending ininternational relations we are also resolutely endeavouringto implement at home  on a national level. With therestoration of peace  we shall consolidate all freedoms. Wewill irreversibly establish a culture of democracy andpluralism. We are currently committed to eliminating allbureaucratic obstacles to free economic activity throughoutthe country  endeavouring in this way to establish the rulesof social liberalism and the market economy.On a regional level  we are pursuing negotiations withthe European Union on an association agreement and on theBarcelona process. We shall spare no effort in relaunchingthe project to construct an Arab Maghreb Union on thebasis of renewed inspiration  rational action and realisticaims established in such a way as to ensure a viable reliable and long-lasting institution. Like other countries Algeria will pursue its negotiations to become a member ofthe World Trade Organization. On an African level  it willwork unceasingly towards the advancement of the economicintegration agreements reached within the framework of theOrganization of African Unity; to settle the conflicts thatare tearing the continent apart; and to promote long-lastingpeace  which is favourable to sustained development.In short  Algeria believes that in order to contributein a useful manner to the future of the world  the peacefulsettlement of conflicts  international stability  solidaritybetween nations and equity in international relations Algeria must adapt to the economic and political realitiesof this world  modernize  reinforce and liberalize thegeneral framework within which its economy operates encourage private investment and ensure equalopportunity for all its citizens while ensuring their humandevelopment. This comprehensive and coherent actionwill be taken by my country in order to adapt to the waythe world is now  so that it can succeed and so that it cangain its rightful place among the nations of the world  aplace we first won thanks to our tradition of support forthe ideals of this Organization.Algeria is slowly but surely beginning to get back onits feet. It has entered a period of convalescence. It hasdone so thanks to its people’s potential  vitality andenergy and  thanks also to the solidarity shown by manysister nations and friends throughout the world. From thisrostrum let me express the Algerian people’s deepgratitude for and recognition of that solidarity.We are at the end of one century and on thethreshold of the next. We are at the end of onemillennium and on the threshold of another. I share tosome extent the belief that these milestones of our era dohave an impact on the life and evolution of the humanrace.The twentieth century has had its moments of glory notably in bringing colonialism to an end  in combatingracism and in eliminating apartheid. But it has also hadits setbacks and failures  manifested in persistentunderdevelopment  in the not always successful struggleto eliminate poverty and in the never-ending quest forbetter concord between peoples.Will we draw enough inspiration from thesemilestones to turn around mindsets that still rigidly abideby outdated concepts of international life? Will we beable to hold out a fraternal hand to each other so thatwell-being can be better shared out in the world? Will webe capable of preparing a world for future generationsthat is better than the one in which we live? We cananswer all these questions with a “yes”  and it is withthese optimistic words of hope that I conclude mystatement."
"49",2102,"ECU",54,1999,"I take greatpleasure in congratulating the President on his well-deserved election  which honours him personally and hisgreat country  Namibia. On behalf of the EcuadorianGovernment and on my own behalf  allow me to greethim most cordially and wish him every measure ofsuccess.I warmly welcome the three new members of thisOrganization  Nauru  Kiribati and Tonga  and congratulatethe Minister for Foreign Affairs of Uruguay  Mr. DidierOpertti  for the intelligent way with which he conductedthe work of the previous session of the GeneralAssembly.The border conflict between Ecuador and Peru thathad prevailed since the very foundation of our republics during the first part of the last century  was concluded on26 October 1998 by means of a negotiation process begun22in February 1995. This historic event  reached by thesigning of the peace agreement in Brasilia  allowed the twocountries to change their relations entirely and to transformthe conflict into peace and  now  to transform peace intodevelopment.Immediately upon the signing of the peace agreement Mr. Jamil Mahuad  President of the Republic of Ecuador put an end to the acquisition of war materials  reducedmandatory military service and  in close collaboration withEcuadorian soldiers  reoriented the action of the armedforces toward tasks linked to development and internalsecurity.The comprehensive peace formula  reached with theassistance of Argentina  Brazil  Chile and the United States included not only the delimitation of the border  but also atreaty on navigation and trade  a broad-ranging agreementon the integration of borders and the establishment of acommission on building trust and security  among severalother peace measures.In accordance with the agreement  Ecuador and Peruhave established an institutional structure that is now fullyoperational in order to attain the goals of an ambitiousprogramme that includes the construction of five bi-nationalroads  joint development of our river basins  the building ofphysical infrastructure and the achievement of a humandevelopment programme designed to improve the livingstandards of the residents along our borders  who during somany decades of stagnation in their territories were victims paralysed by fear and uncertainty.To reach this goal  we have combined our efforts convinced  at the same time  that we will be able to counton international cooperation. We hope that the borderbetween Ecuador and Peru will serve as an example of thefruits of peace for the world. We want to see highwaysinstead of trenches  irrigation canals instead offortifications  hospitals instead of combat airplanes andelectric plants instead of missiles and anti-personal mines.In the name of Ecuador  I call upon the internationalcommunity  on each one of the member countries  onfinancial and development cooperation organizations and onnon-governmental organizations to contribute their aid small or large  to this new peaceful and friendly space ourtwo Latin American nations have built.Having resolved its long-standing border dispute Ecuador reiterates its traditional commitment to continue apermanent search for mutual agreements through thepeaceful settlement of disputes and its firm decision notto become involved in any international war conflict.Within the framework of these principles  Ecuadorrecognizes the gravity of the armed confrontation that issearing its neighbour the Republic of Colombia  butconsiders that fight to be of an internal nature. Hence  itfully supports the efforts of the Government of PresidentAndrés Pastrana to reach peace by negotiating with therebel groups in that country. In that regard  any intentionto internationalize an armed conflict whose solutionconcerns only the people of Colombia could be counter-productive and dangerous.The struggle for development and the efforts tocombat poverty undertaken by Ecuador during the pastyear have been severely affected by multiple crises in theinternational arena and by natural disasters that stronglyhit many places of the world  and Ecuador in particular.The violence of climatic phenomena makes it imperativeto urgently implement a strategy for internationalcooperation to prevent the disastrous consequences ofthose natural disasters on the population  the economy andthe environment. With the support of the United Nations Ecuador has proposed the creation of an internationalresearch centre on the El Niño phenomenon that wouldcontribute to improving the world capacity for predictionand early warning and to facilitate the adoption ofprotective and precautionary measures to mitigate theeffects of the phenomenon.The aftermath of the El Niño phenomenon cost theequivalent of one half of our annual export revenues. Inaddition  the severe impact of the sharp price deteriorationof our main export products  particularly oil  has causedeconomic stagnation  the closure of production units andthe rise of unemployment. The crisis in the financialmarkets of Asia and Latin America has also spread itsnegative effects over our country  while the prosperity ofother  developed areas did little to mitigate the effects ofthat crisis. Within that context of great difficulties  theconditions under which Ecuador renegotiated its foreigndebt became extremely difficult to comply with. On 28August 1999  the national Government used the legalmechanism of deferring for one month the payment of itsBrady bonds debt service and at this time it is preparingto commence a process of restructuring these obligationsthat will enable it to share in a more equitable way thedebt load among all the actors of this financialrelationship.In 1999  poverty affects 61.3 per cent of theEcuadorian population. Last June the unemployment rate23was 15.6 per cent. Four out of ten Ecuadorians have a dailyincome of less than $2  and two out of ten earn less than $1per day. Global malnutrition affects more than 40 per centof the children; one out of three do not complete the sixthgrade  and 40 per cent of all children and adolescents areschool drop-outs. These imbalances break social cohesion limit the possibilities for the exercise of an effectivedemocracy and reduce the validity of citizens' rights. Theeconomic readjustment measures that the Government ofEcuador intends to apply will necessarily be conditioned bysocial development objectives  such as the reduction ofpoverty and malnutrition  the improvement of healthindexes  the increase of access to better education  thereduction of unemployment and the increase of familyincome.Ecuador strongly believes that market mechanismsstimulate competitiveness and efficiency  but also that theinstitutional framework within which these processes takeplace must be capable of correcting distortions  puttinglimits on financial speculation and contributing to puttingin place more stable and predictable systems of pricing  sothat the living conditions of millions upon millions ofhuman beings are not put at risk  and the stability andlongevity of democratic regimes are not threatened bysocial discontent and economic crises.In Ecuador  President Jamil Mahuad and hisGovernment have maintained democracy with a strong gripdespite difficult circumstances. Social discontent from thecontraction in output  natural disasters  the financial crisis the drop in international prices for raw materials andcommodities caused an increase in poverty and unleashedextensive manifestations of social discord.In facing situations such as these  we need to have aninstitutional economic order that gives a way out particularly for countries with small economies  which arethe most vulnerable to and most likely to be affected byextreme economic crises.On the eve of a new millennium  humankind isdeveloping one scenario alone  a scenario not only ofinterdependence but also of globalization. In this globalenvironment  all countries are involved in huge processesof market integration  liberalization of trade barriers standardization of norms and adaptation and establishmentof institutions so that they can cope.Nevertheless  globalization has so far not generated anequal distribution of prosperity  scientific progress  humanhealth or cultural benefits. Right now  more than ever when humankind is a single whole  we must establishshared ways to preserve  first and foremost  humandignity and well-being  the basic requirements of thehuman being  which are based on security and humandevelopment.One example of the effects of human insecurity arethe great migratory waves that we are presentlywitnessing. Ecuador calls upon the General Assembly toorient cooperation strategies in terms of the humansecurity perspective in dealing with shifts in humanpopulation that demand a better distribution of prosperityfar from the extremes of opulence and destitution.Ecuador eagerly welcomes the new focus on providing amodel for international policy including the notion ofhuman security  especially at a time when the scourge ofviolence  drug trafficking  terrorism and environmentaldeterioration have become more acute and when we havewitnessed armed conflicts around the world during thepast year.Combating transnational crime is a shared endeavourfor all civilized peoples. In particular  controlling thetraffic in drugs and illicit drug consumption warrantscoordinated  universal action. Ecuador has made itscontribution and is prepared to continue making itscontribution towards this end. It has therefore acceded tomany international treaties and undertaken manyinternational obligations  which it has fulfilled faithfully.Our country is looking forward to the MillenniumSummit with great anticipation. The summit will be ahistoric opportunity for the community of nations at atime when the challenges of the twenty-first centuryoblige us to define and to affirm a common commitmentto a universal project of understanding and cooperationthat will inspire the United Nations in the coming century.The Millennium Round negotiations of the WorldTrade Organization  and other continental and regionalrounds  should be processes that open up to theopportunities and challenges for creativity and effort andenable us to narrow the gap between the prosperity of justa few countries and the poverty of the great majority.Ecuador firmly believes in open markets  economicintegration  foreign investment and strengthening themultilateral trading system. For this reason it has workedwithin the Andean Community on improving relationshipswith the Southern Common Market (MERCOSUR) andthe European Union on negotiations for the Free TradeArea of the Americas  and on its growing links with the24Pacific basin  but it believes also that these processes mustnot ignore the individual features of the smaller countriesand must strike a balance that will enable them to achieve soon  an international system that is equitable and based onsolidarity.Ecuador was the second country in Latin America topromulgate a national human rights plan  and it did so froma broad-based and democratic perspective. The plan wasconceived and prepared on the basis of a consultationprocess in which civil society and the State participatedfully. This fact has earned special recognition from theOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner forHuman Rights  which described the Ecuadorian plan as amodel for other countries.Our country gives national priority to the projectentitled “Towards a culture of peace”. In this context  undera presidential initiative  Ecuador is promoting wide-rangingactivities linked to international efforts in accordance withthe United Nations culture of peace project and theproclamation of the Year 2000 as the International Year forthe Culture of Peace.Over the past year the international community haswitnessed an aggravation of regional conflicts: war has leftdeep scars in various parts of the world. In this context  theUnited Nations has had to play a special role in resolvinginternational conflicts  and its concerted and decisive actionhas enabled it to resolve some of them successfully.Nevertheless  strengthening our world Organization'sactivities in this field must be carried out in such a waythat all measures taken under the Charter follow itsprinciples faithfully so that the United Nations keeps thenecessary international credibility and continues to be thelegitimate mouthpiece and manager for collective action tomaintain international peace and security.As a party to the Ottawa Convention on anti-personnelmines  and given that it has been directly affected by theproblem of anti-personnel mines  the elimination of theseweapons of war is of particular interest for Ecuador. Sincethe signing of the peace agreement with Peru  our twocountries have begun removing and destroying the minesalong the border. We are sure that the internationalcommunity will continue to offer its cooperation in carryingout our two countries' demining programme. On behalf ofEcuador  I thank the States and organizations that havecontributed or pledged to contribute to this cause.In the light of the realities of the situation facinghumankind  Ecuador reaffirms its unwavering support forthe multilateral system and  consequently  for the UnitedNations which  since its creation  has been the universalmeeting place of all nations to work for the ideals andgoals shared by all peoples inspired by the purposes andprinciples of the Organization. Ecuador draws itsinspiration from the ideal of achieving a world of peaceand freedom  of social justice and development  of fruitfulcoexistence of peoples and nations  a world in whichGovernments work together to solve the complexproblems besetting humankind."
"50",2147,"EGY",54,1999,"At the outset it gives me great pleasure to extend to you  Sir  and to yourfriendly country my sincere congratulations upon yourelection as President of the General Assembly. I am fullyconfident that you will steer the work of this importantsession ably and effectively. I would also like to expressmy appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Didier Opertti  theMinister of Foreign Affairs of Uruguay  President of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-third session  for his wiseconduct of the business of that session.It also gives me pleasure on this occasion to salute theSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  and his efforts tomaintain the role of the international Organization  improveits performance  increase its efficiency and restore itscredibility and effectiveness. My pleasure is all the greaterin welcoming the Republics of Kiribati and Nauru and theKingdom of Tonga to membership of the United Nations.The fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly isbeing held at a historic juncture that comes only once every100 — indeed  every 1 000 — years. This is the lastsession of the General Assembly before the end of thetwentieth century and of the second millennium since thebirth of Christ. That century and that millennium haveembodied a combination of mankind's greatestachievements as well as catastrophic tragedies.Yes  the second millennium has witnessed momentousevents. During the last century of this millennium  theseevents have taken place at a pace faster than any recordedhistory of humanity. The outgoing century has become acatalogue of contradictions  some of which bear testimonyto mankind's genius and others to its ignominies andimmoralities. All our diverse civilizations  withoutexception  have produced warmongers and destructivetyrants. They have also produced great leaders  advocatesof peace  inventors  creative artists  scientists  explorers andstatesmen who provided good leadership and gave wisecounsel.According to the Gregorian calendar  we are at theclose of a century and a millennium. By the Hijri calendar we are in the fifteenth century after the migration of theProphet Muhammad  who revealed to the world a noblereligion and gave it an enlightened civilization. We inEgypt are approaching the end of the seventh millenniumin the life of an ancient country; a country that is as old ashistory itself; a country that contributed to the making andrecording of history. Humanity's attainments at this timeand in this age are not the fruit of the achievements of thetwentieth century alone; rather  they are the result of theaccumulated achievements made since the beginning oftime. The Egyptians excelled at science and engineeringand were the first to profess monotheism. TheBabylonians gave the world the alphabet. The Phoeniciansmastered navigation. The Arab civilization flourished inal-Andalus  preserved Greek philosophy and added to it.The Islamic civilization in Syria  Iraq  Egypt and Turkeymade great contributions to all aspects of life. TheRenaissance in the Italian city-States followed. Then camethe French Revolution  advocating the ideals of liberty equality  and fraternity. The industrial revolution startedin Britain. America ushered in the computer  informationand communication revolutions and the age of spaceexploration and atomic energy. I would also refer here tothe profound philosophies and great civilizations thatflourished in China  India  Japan and elsewhere.This is a necessary statement of fact as we bidfarewell to this century and this millennium. Everyonemust be aware that we are all partners in the creation ofthe contemporary genius. Yet the future is our realconcern. The future brings with it new challenges in thefields of science and information; economic and monetarymatters; culture  politics and security; and the conduct ofrelations between peoples and societies. These are someof the challenges of the coming century. To this list mustbe added the legacy of the unresolved problems of thetwentieth century.The end of a century or a millennium does not meanthe end or solution of existing problems. Indeed  it is ahistorical juncture and will undoubtedly mark newchallenges. Problems  like progress  are characterized bycontinuity. This makes it necessary to agree on a newforward-looking agenda that anticipates the future  itsexpectations and risks — an agenda that will prepare usto solve existing and persistent problems.Here  I hasten to add that new breaths of fresh airhave begun to blow in various parts of the world. They too  will accompany us into the coming century. Africacontinues to suffer from armed and ethnic conflicts andthe disruption of development efforts. Yet a seriousAfrican policy is being developed to put an end to theseconflicts and to achieve settlements on the basis ofdialogue  national reconciliation and conciliation betweenneighbours. We also note that the African Summit heldlast June in Algiers decided that the countries whose19Governments had taken power by unconstitutional meansmust restore constitutional legitimacy before the conveningof the next African Summit in the year 2000. The FourthExtraordinary Summit of the Organization of African Unity held in Syrte earlier this month  reaffirmed the continent'sresolve to proceed on the path of unity through the speedyimplementation of a treaty establishing the AfricanEconomic Community.On the Asian continent  the situation in the Koreanpeninsula and the question of Kashmir are still sources oftension and confrontation. Afghanistan remains a source ofinstability and tension and a haven for terrorism. Yet theAsian economies are showing signs of recovery and arepreparing to compensate for the sacrifices that were madeand the development efforts that were lost as a result of thefinancial crisis of 1997.As for East Timor  the popular consultation held lastAugust reflected  in the words of the Secretary General  thewill of the people of East Timor for self-determinationwithout representing victory or defeat for any of the parties.This process could not have been successful without thebold initiative of President Habibie. While calling for apeaceful and orderly transition of power  Egypt pays tributeto the wise decision of the Indonesian Government toaccept the deployment of an international force in theterritory. This is a responsible and wise course of actionthat will restore calm and order there.Europe was the origin and theatre of the two WorldWars that were bitterly experienced by humanity in its longhistory. There  the hateful practices of ethnic cleansing areagain looming on the horizon. Yet  we have seen theinternational community take a clear and firm stand againstsuch practices and against attacks on the identity of peoplesand nations. We have also witnessed some progress in theconstitutional dialogue that aims at resolving the questionof Northern Ireland  the oldest contemporary crisis on theEuropean continent.In the Middle East  the peace process is now headingtowards a new and positive stage. It is our hope that thiswill lead to a comprehensive  just  and peaceful settlementthat will establish the Palestinian State  put an end to theoccupation of the Syrian and Lebanese territories andensure security for all. Thus  an end will be put to thisconflict and its files will hopefully be closed.Despite its centrality  the Arab-Israeli conflict is notthe only problem in that vast region. Other problemsinclude that of Western Sahara in northern Africa  theislands of the United Arab Emirates in the Gulf and thequestion of Sudan. The latter is high on the list ofpriorities of Egyptian diplomacy. For two years now  wehave been making intensive efforts and establishingcontacts with both the Sudanese Government and theopposition in order to achieve comprehensive nationalreconciliation and to preserve the unity  identity andterritorial integrity of that brotherly country. We havebeen coordinating with Libya  the members ofIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) andthe forum of the partners of IGAD to ensure that all theefforts undertaken in this regard are made in a concertedmanner.The situation of Iraq raises numerous questions. Thematter does not have a bearing on the Government of Iraqalone. Rather  it pertains to the Iraqi people  their plightand the suffering of their children. An objective andpositive review of the status of this important brotherlycountry has become necessary. This review shouldproceed from the premise that there are no eternalsanctions and that people have the right to resume normallife and to surpass the errors of the past and move to thebright horizons of the future. In so doing  they must fullyabide by the accepted rules of international legality likeall other people.Indeed  Iraqi policy was erroneous in its invasion ofKuwait. A mistake  however  cannot be corrected by apolicy which will lead to the collapse of an entire societyor cause a whole country to implode. Therefore  Egypt isclosely following the current efforts aimed at thesuspension by the Security Council of the sanctionswithin the context of an understanding with the IraqiGovernment and under the Council's supervision. Thisshould be the first step towards the lifting of the sanctionsin accordance with paragraph 22 of resolution 687 (1991) all of whose paragraphs ought to be implemented in full.I stated earlier that despite the high hopes and greatexpectations pinned on the new century  this historicaljuncture does not in and of itself bring the existingproblems to an end. I am duty-bound to put before youEgypt's belief that certain major questions must be giventop priority on the world agenda. These are: internationalpeace and security  the question of the elimination ofweapons of mass destruction  particularly nuclearweapons  eradication of poverty  integration of thedeveloping countries into the world economy on anequitable basis  dialogue between and complementarity ofcivilizations  and the question of terrorism. Thesequestions transcend time and space in our contemporary20world. Their agreed solutions must be the result of ourcollective thinking and collective action.If democracy has become a necessary pillar in theformation of the political framework of the societies of thefuture  it must equally constitute the framework ofinternational relations. Thus  it is necessary that the futureworld order be based on consensus  on the convergence ofinterests  on the acceptance of the right of others to makeinitiatives  and on appreciation for the premises from whichthey proceed. All this must be debated in a democraticspirit here in the General Assembly  within its new andevolving role.What is indeed necessary is for us to arrive at aconsensus on the regulation of international life. Thisdesired consensus must respect the values  norms andprinciples that are deeply rooted in humanity's conscience.This consensus must achieve the necessary harmonybetween individual freedoms  on the one hand  and thecollective rights to security  stability and development  onthe other hand. It must foster a creative dialogue and apositive interaction between policies  cultures andcivilizations  as it must refute the theory of “The Clash ofCivilizations” and minimize the possibility of the clash ofinterests.We believe that the world  particularly at thispromising stage  can ill afford a new conflict or a new coldwar. Those who propagate the theory that Islam couldbecome the main threat to the West following the collapseof Communism ignore the fact that Islam is a philosophyand a way of life. It is not an artificial concoction thatcarries within it the seeds of its demise  as Communismdid. They wilfully disregard history's greatest lesson:interaction among diverse cultures enriches all cultures elevates all civilizations and adds to their vitality andprosperity.It is only logical for most societies in our world todaynot to accept the imposition of a single view on worldproblems. It is also logical for them to reject the view thatthe interests of a sole society should be given precedenceover all others or that the considerations  capabilities andinterests of a certain civilization should be forced on allother world civilizations. Therefore  Egypt supports theresolution adopted by the General Assembly last year  atIran's initiative  proclaiming the year 2001 the UnitedNations Year of Dialogue among Civilizations. Egypt alsowelcomes the Secretary-General's appointment of a specialrepresentative for this important subject.Addressing the question of dialogue amongcivilizations is not separate from addressing the questionof terrorism. Some thinkers have attempted to brand acertain civilization and culture with that affront.The phenomenon of international terrorism is notlinked to any particular civilization  culture or religion. Itrecognizes no boundaries and threatens all societiesequally. It has become a grave danger that we musturgently combat and eradicate. We have seen acts ofterrorism in all parts of the world with diverse culturesand civilizations  but the challenge is one and the same.The United Nations and many States have gone quitefar in facing this phenomenon. However  the fewscattered and isolated international conventions andresolutions that deal with it need an integrated frameworkto turn them into a binding legal code. This code shouldreflect the concerted efforts of the internationalcommunity to combat and contain terrorism and todeprive it of any haven or financing.In this regard  Egypt renews the call of PresidentHosni Mubarak to convene an international summit underUnited Nations auspices. The summit  whose objectiveframework and timing must be agreed upon by consensus would be mandated to codify the collective and organizedwill of the international community in dealing withterrorism and in providing the necessary action to combatand deter it.I would like to move to other  equally important issues  among which are disarmament and themaintenance of international peace and security. In doingso  I must recall the need to observe the prioritiesestablished by the international community in 1978.Foremost among these priorities are nuclear disarmamentand the elimination of other weapons of mass destruction.In this regard  there is a clear need to accelerate theprocess of nuclear disarmament at the unilateral andbilateral levels as well as within the Conference onDisarmament. There is also a need to speedily achieve theuniversality of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons (NPT).These considerations impelled the States of theAlliance of the New Agenda: South Africa  Brazil Mexico  Ireland  Sweden  New Zealand and my country Egypt  to adopt a joint declaration in June 1998. TheAlliance tabled a resolution  which was adopted by theGeneral Assembly last year by a large majority  callingfor the adoption of serious and concrete steps in this21regard. The members of the Alliance will continue theirefforts during this session.On the regional level  I have repeatedly stated that theelimination of weapons of mass destruction  which is theoptimum way to ensure the security of the Middle Eastregion as a whole  can be achieved only within acomprehensive framework applicable to all withoutexception. Peace cannot endure with an imbalance of poweror a discrepancy in rights and obligations in matterspertaining to national security.In this regard  all the States of the Middle East  withthe sole exception of Israel  have acceded to the NPT andthe international regime for the inspection of nuclearfacilities. This constitutes a source of constant tension. Itnegates to a large extent the effectiveness of theinternational instruments on non-proliferation and armscontrol. It will lead to an arms race. It is illogical to givea special privilege or a certain exception to only one Statein as vast and sensitive a region as the Middle East  andunder unacceptable pretexts.Sound logic necessitates an end to this exception andcalls firmly for Israel's accession to the NPT. This subjectwill force itself on the 2000 NPT Review Conference. TheStates parties to the Treaty agreed in 1995 on an integratedand comprehensive package to enhance the non-proliferation regime and achieve its universality. Theextension of the Treaty was but one of the elements of thatpackage. I would like to stress here the importance ofgiving top priority at the next Review Conference tocrystallizing the serious steps for achieving the universalityof the Treaty. The States parties to the Treaty must honourall the obligations and commitments made in 1995 withoutselectivity or discrimination. Egypt and many other Statesinsist on that. Otherwise  we will reach a state  which hasactually begun  of suspicion and lack of confidence.This will have a grave effect on the credibility of theNPT regime. It will weaken that regime considerably making it possible to deviate from its provisions or makethem subject to exceptions.Talking of regional security in the Middle East leadsme to address the peace process. Egypt maintains  as italways has  that a comprehensive peace based on justice isthe only durable and stable peace. This means Israel’swithdrawal from all Arab territories occupied in 1967  theestablishment of a State of Palestine with Jerusalem as itscapital  restoring the legitimate human and national rightsof the Palestinian people and the achievement of securityfor all. The peace process must deal with all the problemsin good faith and with courage. It must not postponedealing with or negotiating any item or problem. Thepostponement or abandonment of problems is apostponement and abandonment of peace. This isdangerous and unacceptable and runs counter to theframework and spirit of peace. It might even postpone theestablishment of normal relations between the Arab Statesand Israel.We had hoped that the Arab-Israeli conflict wouldcome to an end before the end of the twentieth century.This hope is still alive  since the year 2000 is the lastyear of this century.This year we witnessed a human tragedy  the likesof which we thought was impossible given the progressthat mankind has achieved before the advent of thetwenty-first century. Here I refer to the tragedy ofKosovo. While welcoming the adoption by the SecurityCouncil of a resolution on the establishment of aTransitional Administration in Kosovo  we stress the needfor learning from this tragedy so that succeedinggenerations will never witness its likes again.Allow me to address one aspect of thisproblem which pertains to our present discussion — thedegree to which the rules of international legality  asrepresented by the United Nations  were observed in asituation that pertains to the maintenance of internationalpeace and security. Here we find that the question ofKosovo was a unique case of international consensus anddisagreement at one and the same time. There was aconsensus on the need for immediate action to stop thegrave crime of ethnic cleansing. At the same time therewas disagreement on who had the right to act. There weredifferent approaches  among which is the one we believein — namely  that any international action must stemfrom the Security Council as the competent organprimarily responsible for the maintenance of internationalpeace and security. If the Council were unable to do so then the General Assembly would be the organ that mustdeal with any threats to international peace and security as it represents the common interest of all its members.Our insistence  and that of many others on theessential role of the United Nations  has been reflected inthe following significant message; that regardless of howthe international order is described  as old or new international participation in it must take place throughthe United Nations  particularly when the matter concernsthe maintenance of international peace and security.22In this context  I would like to refer to the Secretary-General’s report on the work of the Organization and to hisstatement made last Monday  in which he reaffirmed theimportance of strengthening the collective security systemin a manner that would enable the international communityto deal with crises before they spin out of control  and theprimary role of the Security Council in this regard. TheSecretary-General has put forward a number of innovativeconcepts to develop a “culture of prevention” of crises among which is the concept of preventive diplomacy. Thusfar  no agreement has been reached on the scope of theapplication of this concept since it was first dealt with in1992 in “An Agenda for Peace”. They also include theconcept of the preventive deployment of forces  which willraise numerous questions in view of its connection to thesovereignty of States. Also included is the call forhumanitarian intervention and its scope  a suggested role fortransnational corporations and the concept of the assessmentof the security impact of development policies  which couldopen the door for new conditionalities if these ideas are notdeveloped democratically  objectively and non-selectively.These ideas and suggestions deal with concepts that are notyet established. This makes it necessary to debate them inan international format characterized by the highest degreeof openness and transparency. Their formulation and termsshould be agreed upon by all. We propose officially – andwe call upon the President of the General Assembly and theSecretary-General to take the necessary actions in thisregard – to have the General Assembly  or a committee ofthe whole within it  debate these ideas and give themsubstance. They must be adopted by a consensus of allStates  and the Secretary-General would be asked to presenta report on the results of this debate to the GeneralAssembly at its next session  in the light of which theAssembly would take a decision on his suggestions.The World Summit for Social Development held inCopenhagen made the eradication of poverty a top priorityfor international action  because it pertains to the stabilityof the international order and its credibility. Yet theincreasing marginalization of the developing countries particularly that of the least developed countries  most ofwhich are in Africa  threatens to create new lines ofconfrontation between the North and the South. Thisconfrontation would be fuelled by unjust economic  socialand development considerations and standards  and it couldnegatively affect international stability.Egypt  the current Chair of the Group of 15  presenteda paper to the eighty-seventh session of the InternationalLabour Organization reflecting the views of the Groupregarding the negative effects of globalization  the crisis ofinternational markets and the concomitant increase inunemployment. All these matters must be taken intoaccount in the implementation of the CopenhagenProgramme of Action and the programmes of action ofother major conferences.We also note that some developed countries haveadopted protectionist measures under the pretext ofprotection of the environment  respect for human rightsand labour standards. These policies deepen theimbalances in the international trading system. Here Imust reaffirm the need for the developed countries tohonour all their obligations under the Uruguay Round andthe full implementation of the agreements and resolutionsof that Round before engaging in any new negotiations tofurther liberalize international trade.I further reaffirm the importance of strengthening therole of the United Nations Conference on Trade andDevelopment (UNCTAD) at its tenth session  to be heldin Bangkok  to achieve a balance between the interests ofthe developed and the developing countries. Here I mustrefer to the role of the international financial institutions.This question needs a conscientious review in the light ofthe current changes in the international economic arena.The review should make these institutions moreresponsive to the needs of comprehensive development.It should ensure the full participation of the developingcountries in the making of decisions on the reform of theinternational financial system.In conclusion  we look forward to the new centurywith hope; yet the questions surrounding it abound foremost of which is that two thirds of the people of theworld live in a state of underdevelopment and suffering.How could we face the challenges of the wars thatcontinue to rage  the continued flows of refugees  warcrimes that continue to be perpetrated and the direpoverty of those who cannot have their daily bread orafford a school to educate their children or a hospital totreat them? Any talk about globalization must take all thatinto account.These were the challenges of the past. They are alsothe challenges of the present  and will be the challengesof the future. We will be able to face them only with astronger will and a stronger commitment  with a moreobjective way of thinking and more effective mechanismsfor action. In this way we will arrive at a new socialcontract  usher in a new economic era and forge a newsecurity consensus for the world of tomorrow.23"
"51",2171,"ERI",54,1999,"Allow me at the outset tojoin with others who have spoken before me incongratulating you  Sir  on your election as President of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-fourth session. I am certainthat your experience and skills  as well as your dedicationto freedom and justice  make you qualified to lead theUnited Nations as it searches for peace in Africa andelsewhere in the coming year.I also take this opportunity to pay tribute to yourpredecessor  Mr. Didier Opertti  for the effective manner inwhich he guided the work of the previous session. I extendmy gratitude to the Secretary-General for his dedicated andexemplary contributions to the cause of peace.Permit me also to welcome the Republic of Kiribati the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga as newMembers of our Organization.It is a matter of deep concern that this year iswitnessing the continuation of conflicts and the emergenceof new sources of conflict. In particular  it is disturbing tonote the growing tendency to resort to the use or threat offorce. This has become a grave danger to the independenceand unity of States as well as to regional and internationalpeace and security. This year has recorded some of thebloodiest inter-State and intra-State conflicts  in Africa Asia and Europe.Sub-Saharan African has been the part of the worldthat has suffered most from those conflicts. Sub-SaharanAfrica’s economic performance and political stability have in fact  taken a turn for the worse in 1999. About onethird of the 52 members of the Organization of AfricanUnity (OAU)  all of them in sub-Saharan Africa  havebeen worse off economically in 1999 than they were inthe previous year. Almost 20 countries have been afflictedby armed civil conflict or inter-State war. It is notsurprising that almost all of the countries that havesuffered economic relapse are the ones that are embroiledin conflict.Among those 20  the worst are to be found in theHorn of Africa. More than two thirds of their people areliving in abject misery. Most have little or no food. Theyare ridden with disease. The economies of most of thosecountries are in shambles. The region is politicallyunstable and racked by conflict. It is no surprise therefore  that some donor States and internationalfinancial institutions have rightly denounced the state ofaffairs and have informed a few of those States that theywould be better advised to feed their hungry millions andbetter manage their economies than squander countlessmillions to finance ill-advised military adventures.In his report on Africa  Secretary-General KofiAnnan made it amply clear that economic stagnation andpoverty are a direct function of conflict. However  this isas evident elsewhere as it is in Africa. Thus  the situationsin East Timor  Afghanistan  Kosovo or Bosnia andHerzegovina are no different from those in the Horn ofAfrica  Sierra Leone  the Democratic Republic of theCongo or Angola. In all those cases  conflicts have causedserious setbacks in development plans and negativelyimpacted on the living conditions of the people. In almostall cases  conflict has been the intrinsic cause of famineand serious violations of human rights and otherhumanitarian crises. The international community cannotafford complacency in the face of such threats tointernational peace and security  if it is to be believed thatpeace is indivisible and that what happens in one regionwill have an impact on others.Various reasons  including ethnic and religioushatred  economic and political grievances andunemployment  have been advanced as the root causes ofconflict. While these are valid factors  it must never beforgotten that territorial expansionism  both within andoutside the State  and the determination to achieve it bythe use or threat of military force and by political andeconomic coercion against the territorial integrity andindependence of neighbouring countries  has been themajor cause of conflict and the disturbance of peace in29the Horn of Africa. Eritrea  the victim of Ethiopia’sterritorial ambitions and its policy of aggression  is oneexample of this.It has now been 16 months since the eruption of theconflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia  the root cause ofwhich is Ethiopia’s avowedly ethnic-based policy ofterritorial aggrandizement and its systematic annexation oflarge areas of Eritrean territory. From the beginning of theconflict  Eritrea has consistently pursued a policy ofpeaceful resolution of the border problem even in the faceof provocation  creeping annexation of its territory andoutright aggression. To that end  it had attempted  beforethe eruption of the conflict  to engage the EthiopianGovernment in peaceful dialogue to amicably resolve allexisting problems and controversies related to theircommon border. Even after the start of the conflict  Eritreaon several occasions requested the Ethiopian side to agreeto accept bilateral negotiations. When this was rejected byEthiopia  Eritrea unilaterally issued a proposal whichcontained detailed modalities for the peaceful resolution ofthe conflict. That too was rejected by the Ethiopian regime.After the Organization of African Unity (OAU) wasseized of the matter  Eritrea accepted  despite its gravereservations  the Framework Agreement submitted to bothparties following the Ouagadougou summit of June 1998 after it had received the clarifications it had sought onseveral critical issues. Eritrea also readily and unequivocallyaccepted  at the Algiers OAU summit in July 1999  themodalities for the implementation of the FrameworkAgreement. The modalities were in fact drawn up to satisfythe unjust  unfair and unwarranted new preconditions madeby Ethiopia on the basis of its own unilateral interpretationof the Framework Agreement. Eritrea declared that it wasaccepting the modalities only in the interests of peace andof the good of both the Ethiopian and the Eritrean peoples.Finally  Eritrea also accepted without any delay thetechnical arrangements for the implementation of theFramework Agreement and modalities which weresubmitted to both parties on 23 August 1999.Implementation of the provisions of the FrameworkAgreement would entail  inter alia  the following: it wouldrequire a cessation of hostilities  the redeployment of thetroops of both sides from disputed territories and thedeployment of peacekeeping forces in those areas. Eritreais fully committed to this. It would require investigation ofthe sequence of events to determine the origins of theconflict. Eritrea welcomes this since it would conclusivelyidentify the real aggressor. The Framework Agreementenvisages the investigation of human rights abuses. Eritreaawaits the results eagerly. Implementation woulddetermine the exact borders between the two countries.Eritrea is enthusiastic about this. Eritrea is certain that theinternational community too is just as eager andenthusiastic about finding the final truth on all these andother related matters.On the other hand  the Ethiopian Government wasdetermined to achieve its territorial ambitions by allmeans  fair or foul. To this end  in 1997 and 1998 members of the armed forces and militia of the EthiopianGovernment systematically used brute force to expelEritreans from Eritrean lands and to incorporate southernand south-eastern Eritrean territories into Ethiopia. ThatGovernment then rejected all Eritrean overtures on directpeace talks and continued feverishly to prepare for newaggression even as it paid lip service to the FrameworkAgreement. On 6 February 1999  it launched an invasionalong several sectors of our common boundary  evenwhile peace facilitators from the United Nations and theUnited States were engaged in shuttle diplomacy to bringthe conflict to an end. Sadly  tens of thousands ofEthiopians and many Eritreans perished or were woundedduring that aggression.When Eritrea accepted the Framework Agreement Ethiopia came out with new preconditions based solely onits own interpretation of the Agreement  rather thanjoining Eritrea in the implementation of the peace plan.Yet Ethiopia was to accept the modalities — which wereactually formulated to satisfy its unfair  unjust andunwarranted demands — only after much prevaricationand procrastination. Finally  Ethiopia issued a statementon 4 September 1999 which was tantamount to a rejectionof the technical arrangements  which are only a procedurefor implementing the Framework Agreement and themodalities  on the untenable grounds that it containedelements which were not part of the previous twodocuments. One week later  on the eve of the Ethiopiannew year  in a reiteration of Ethiopia’s previousdeclaration of war  its President publicly announced thatEthiopia would use force to impose its will over disputedterritory. That was a blatant repudiation of the OAUeffort  all of whose documents had been endorsed by theUnited Nations and other concerned organizations andGovernments.The OAU has given Ethiopia clear and unambiguousclarifications in response to its queries and concerns. It isalso to be recalled that the OAU had decided  and bothparties had accepted  that any interpretation of thedocuments would be made solely by the OAU and its30current Chairman. The OAU and the United Nations havealso agreed to become guarantors of the scrupulousimplementation of all the provisions of the OAU peacepackage. Ethiopia’s latest threat of war and its consequentrepudiation of its commitment to the OAU peace process which is inflexible about the peaceful resolution of theconflict  are thus in contempt of the OAU  the UnitedNations and the international community. Ethiopia’s refusalto accept the technical arrangements until its new set ofpreconditions are met is holding the peace process hostagein spite of the clamour of the international community forthe acceptance and quick implementation of the peace plan.However quixotic and unjustifiable it may be  theEthiopian Government has declared that it will not acceptthe technical arrangements until it receives from the OAUa firm assurance of Ethiopian sovereignty over the disputedareas. Obviously  this is a direct contradiction of  and afrontal assault on  the Framework Agreement  whoseprovisions clearly declare that the“redeployment will not prejudge the final status of thearea concerned  which will be determined at the endof the delimitation and demarcation of the border and if need be  through an appropriate mechanism ofarbitration”. (S/1998/1223  annex  p. 25)Surely  the proposition that a State must a priori beawarded full sovereignty over contested territory before thedetermination of ownership must distort the norms ofinternational law and international relations. Ethiopia hasalso claimed that its decision to use force to controlcontested areas was taken in self-defence. Such a notionrelegates the concept of self-defence to the realm of self-help.It is not difficult to conclude which party to theEritrean-Ethiopian conflict has undertaken to fulfil in goodfaith its obligations under the OAU peace package andwhich party is determined to undermine  by direct orindirect aggression  the Charters of the United Nations andthe OAU  thereby endangering peace  security  stability andpeaceful development in our region. It is not difficult todetermine which of the parties is resolved to bring aboutterritorial changes  in clear violation of the OAU andUnited Nations Charters  by aggression  coercion infiltration and subterfuge. A perfunctory analysis of themedia — particularly the broadcast media — of bothcountries will also reveal which of the parties is fanning theflames of ethnic hatred and is actively engaged inpropaganda and in preparation for a new war  therebycommitting a crime against peace. In short  it is very easyto identify which of the parties is committed to peace andwhich is committed to war and aggression.Once again  war clouds are looming ominously overour region. It is now self-evident that the EthiopianGovernment is still determined to pursue a policypredicated on violent aggression. By its shrill warhysteria  the Government of Ethiopia is making it clearthat it is poised to invade our country yet again. It is notour wish to fight. The bitter experience of a long war ofindependence has taught us to dread war. We seek noterritorial expansion  and we have no plan to commitaggression against any other State. We seek to live inpeaceful cooperation with all our neighbours. Yet if waris imposed on us we must — and will — fight tosafeguard the sovereignty of our country and to preserveour dignity as a people. In this connection  Eritreasolemnly declares in this Assembly that the responsibilityfor any new military engagement will lie with the AddisAbaba regime.We have exercised prudence and patience in the faceof aggression  provocation and crimes committed by theGovernment of Ethiopia against our nationals in Ethiopiaand Eritrea. A State has the duty to protect its nationalsfrom injury caused by the Government of any State. YetEritrea has hitherto preferred to react with equanimity tothe gross and violent violations of the human rights ofEritreans and Ethiopians of Eritrean origin in the hope ofsecuring a peaceful resolution of the conflict.However  there are limits to the misdoings that anyrespectable State must tolerate. It would be unacceptablefor any Government worthy of the trust of its people notto defend the State and the people it represents againstaggression. It would be an unthinkable calamity for apeople which had fought for so long  enduredunimaginable hardship and won its independence againstall odds to lose its rights as a people and a nation to anaggressor.It is incumbent on those who love freedom andjustice and respect the equality of peoples  who arecommitted to peace and cherish the norms and principlesof the United Nations  to ensure that law and moralprinciples prevail against international lawlessness andimmorality.Ethiopia’s threatened aggression must be a source ofdeep concern to the international community andparticularly to the OAU and the United Nations whichhave consistently urged both parties to restrain themselves31from the use or threat of force and to solve the conflict bypeaceful means.To this end  the international community must insistthat both parties recognize and respect each other’s right tolive in peace within secure and recognized borders. It is forthis reason that Eritrea believes that this Assembly has theduty to uphold the decision of the OAU  which has alreadybeen endorsed by the United Nations Security Council  andcalls upon the Assembly to denounce Ethiopia’s renewedpreparation for war against Eritrea and to demand that itaccept and implement the OAU peace package. Surely  ifthere is any lesson that must have been learned in the last16 months  it is that nothing can be gained  and everythingmay be lost  by continued warfare.Therefore  the Government of Eritrea calls upon theUnited Nations and the international community to: first condemn Ethiopia’s commitment to the use and threat offorce; secondly  establish a short time-frame within whichEthiopia must definitively respond to the peace package;thirdly  take timely and appropriate measures for theimmediate and unconditional implementation of the OAUpeace plan in its entirety; and  fourthly  immediately deployan observer mission to identify the aggression in the eventof renewed conflict."
"52",2217,"ESP",54,1999,"I sincerelycongratulate Mr. Gurirab on his election as President ofthe General Assembly at this session  the last to be held37before the start of the new millennium  and I wish himgreat success in the performance of his duties. At the sametime I wish to thank his predecessor  Mr. Didier Opertti  forthe effective way in which he presided over the previousAssembly.Spain subscribes fully to the statement made by theMinister for Foreign Affairs of Finland on behalf of theStates members of the European Union and should like tocontribute to this general debate by presenting mydelegation’s point of view with regard to the complexproblems facing the United Nations at this time.I should also like to welcome the Republic of Kiribati the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga. Spainoffers them its full cooperation in the tasks that await themas new Members of the Organization.This has  indeed  been a difficult year for theOrganization. Serious crises have arisen in different parts ofthe world and  at times  the role played in them by theUnited Nations has been questioned. We are all aware ofthe efforts made by the Secretary-General to enable theOrganization fully to play the role for which it was foundedin 1945. However  in certain sectors of international publicopinion the idea has taken hold that the United Nations hasbeen incapable of assuming its central and proper role insuch situations.Like any human institution  the United Nations hashad its successes and its failures. Nevertheless  it has beena key factor in international relations throughout the secondhalf of the twentieth century and it continues to be so onthe threshold of the twenty-first. It fulfils an essentialfunction  which will have to be progressively strengthenedas the phenomenon of globalization develops. It is indeeda unique instrument for the international relations we aresharing for the twenty-first century.It is obvious that  while acknowledging the uniquevalue of the United Nations  we must revise some aspectsof the way in which it operates. That is why the process ofreform undertaken by the Secretary-General is so important.We must continue to make further progress in thatdirection.I should like to stress that Spain does not think of thereform of the United Nations as an exercise whose sole andessential objective is to save money. Rather  we considersuch reform to be a way of enabling it successfully to meetthe challenges of the new century.A key aspect of this process is the reform of theSecurity Council. Spain believes that such reform mustpursue three basic goals. First  there must be greatertransparency in its working methods  with an increase inthe number and the quality of the consultations  bothbetween the countries that make up the Council andbetween those countries and other Member States.Secondly  it should be more efficient  for which purposeit would be advisable to limit the exercise of the right ofveto. There are instances in which the exercise of thisright  or even the more or less veiled threat to exercise it has blocked the functioning of the Security Council andprevented the adoption of essential decisions that enjoyeda broad consensus within the international community. Toa large extent  that has promoted the image of the UnitedNations as inefficient and impotent in the eyes of somesectors of public opinion. Thirdly  it should be made moredemocratic  which would mean adapting the Council’scomposition to recent developments in the internationalcommunity. In current circumstances  and given the splitbetween Member States  it seems possible to reach asufficient consensus only with regard to the idea ofincreasing the number of non-permanent members. Spainis in favour of increasing the representation on theSecurity Council of all regional groups.Delays in the payment of contributions by someStates are unjustifiable and endanger the very operation ofthe Organization at the very time when it is called uponto carry out increasingly complex tasks. It is not possibleto tolerate the current level of non-payment and at thesame time require the United Nations to set up the UnitedNations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo  toorganize the transition to independence in East Timor  toestablish international criminal courts  to deal with theplight of refugees  to send peacekeeping forces to variousparts of the world  and to allocate sufficient resources toits numerous development programmes.I would like my Government’s position on thissubject to be properly understood. Spain is the eighth-largest contributor to the Organization’s regular budget and as such has a very direct interest in matters such asbudgetary discipline and the effective use of resources.Moreover  Spain considers that all matters of concern toMember States on this issue can and must be thoroughlydiscussed. What is not acceptable  however  is for anyoneto make payment conditional on the granting of unilateraldemands.The coming Millennium Assembly will provide agood opportunity to reflect on all these issues  as well as38on the role of the United Nations in the twenty-firstcentury. That Assembly  in the preparation of which civilsociety will participate  must likewise encourage vigorousdebate yielding concrete results. That debate must  in myopinion  focus on two main issues: the elimination ofpoverty and the consequences of globalization.A policy to eliminate poverty involves  inter alia  astrategy of conflict prevention  sustainable developmentpolicies  good governance and the regular provision offunds for development financing. All these mean thatefforts must be pooled and responsibilities shared bydeveloped and developing States alike.Globalization is a phenomenon that involves risks  butthat also creates opportunities. The risk is that the weakestcountries and the most defenceless sectors of the populationwill be marginalized from its benefits. Clearly  decisiveaction by Governments is needed  along with internationalcooperation. Threats to cultural and linguistic pluralitylikewise require decisive defensive measures.At the same time  globalization also generatesopportunities and benefits: economic growth  bettercommunications and greater access to information  as wellas possibilities for bringing different peoples and culturescloser together. It is especially here that the unique value ofthe United Nations is most striking. In the face of all thesenew global problems  which go far beyond the capacity ofStates for individual action  only a multilateral responsewill suffice  the result of dialogue and internationalcooperation. The United Nations is the most appropriateforum for this.With regard to peacekeeping operations  only theUnited Nations  in the final analysis  has the legitimacynecessary to authorize them. This year Spain has doubledthe number of troops that it contributes to these operations;they are currently deployed in United Nations missions inGuatemala  Kosovo  Bosnia and Herzegovina and EastTimor. To this should be added the large number of troopsthat my country has placed at the service of missionsauthorized by Security Council resolutions  such as theStabilization Force (SFOR) and KFOR. Spain participatedin the United Nations Observer Mission in Angola(MONUA) until its recent termination  and is nowcooperating with the project to strengthen Africancapabilities for peacekeeping operations.As a reflection of my country’s commitment  Spainwill in the next few weeks sign a memorandum ofunderstanding on placing a rapidly deployablepeacekeeping force at the disposal of the United Nations.On the eve of the twenty-first century  it is no longertolerable to mankind’s ethical conscience that atrocitiesand war crimes should go unpunished. But until recentlythe international community had not channeled thesegeneralized feelings into a course of concrete action. Yetagain  it was the United Nations that did this  byconvening the Rome Conference at which the Statute ofthe International Criminal Court was adopted. Spainsigned the Statute  and the ratification process is now atan advanced stage. Moreover  Spain has taken initiativesto promote the signing and ratification of the treaty inorder that it may enter into force as soon as possible.The United Nations has made a vital contribution tothe universalization of human rights. Having been electeda member of the Commission on Human Rights for athree-year period  Spain will continue to cooperate withthe United Nations in the defence of these rights in linewith one of the basic tenets of its foreign policy.Closely related to this issue is the concept of humansecurity. At a previous session of the General Assembly Spain took the initiative to propose a draft resolution onthe safety and security of international humanitarianpersonnel  which was ultimately adopted as resolution52/167. The activity of the Special Committee onChildren and Armed Conflict is especially important atthis time  as is the significant work of the Secretary-General’s Special Representative on this matter  Mr. OlaraOtunnu. The recent Security Council resolution 1261(1999) is a major step forward in the approach to thisproblem.Development cooperation is undoubtedly one of themain global issues on the United Nations agenda. Thespecial meeting on development financing planned for2001 must be properly prepared  and the follow-up of themajor conferences must continue.Spain attaches special importance to the HeavilyIndebted Poor Countries Debt (HIPC) Initiative  whosescope and depth must be enhanced. In the wake ofhurricane Mitch  Spain initiated debt-cancellationprogrammes for the most harshly affected countries of theCentral American region.My country has made a substantial effort in recentyears in respect of its development cooperationprogrammes. Not many years ago Spain was an aid39recipient  while it now stands above the Organization forEconomic Cooperation and Development average in thepercentage of its gross domestic product devoted todevelopment. In 1998  official development assistance fundsgrew by 14 per cent  placing Spain among the threedeveloped countries which had most increased these fundsduring the year.With regard to disarmament  the United Nations andthe Conference on Disarmament will continue to preparefor a conference on small arms to be held in 2001  and willattempt to offset recent reversals in the non-proliferationregime. It is essential that the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty should speedily enter into force  and thatdifficulties in the preparation of the next review conferenceof the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weaponsbe overcome.It is also necessary to conclude negotiations on averification protocol to the Convention on the Prohibitionof the Development  Production and Stockpiling ofBacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and onTheir Destruction  and to address the issue of fissilematerials.There are many other global issues on which theUnited Nations plays a vital role  such as the fight againstterrorism  drugs and organized crime. However  I shouldlike to dwell for a moment on another matter to which myGovernment attaches great importance: problems of ageingand of older people. Spain wishes to contribute to thedebate on an international strategy on older people based onthe existing model in my country. Spain has also submittedits candidacy as the venue for the second World Assemblyon Ageing  which could be convened in 2002.Finally  allow me to refer to the problem ofdecolonization. At the conclusion of this Decade for theEradication of Colonization  my country continues toendure the presence of a colonial enclave on its territory.Gibraltar was occupied by British troops in 1704  duringone of the European wars of succession. The Territory wasturned into a military base and the Spanish population wasexpelled. Until very recently Spanish citizens in Gibraltarsuffered grave discrimination in the exercise of their rights.General Assembly resolution 2353 (XXII) backed theSpanish views on the decolonization of the Territory recognizing that Gibraltar’s colonial situation should besettled not through self-determination  but  rather  throughthe restoration of Spanish territorial integrity. Unfortunately its terms have been ignored by the colonial Power. Spainand Great Britain began a process of negotiation on allthe issues  including sovereignty  based on the 1984Brussels Declaration  but no significant progress has beenmade. Spain has made a proposal to the United Kingdomthat takes into account the interests of the inhabitants ofthe colony and would allow for the recovery ofsovereignty over the Territory after a lengthy period  sofar without reply. My Government will continue both itsdialogue with the United Kingdom and cooperation withthe decolonization Committee in following up on thisissue.From the crises the world has lived through thisyear  we must learn certain lessons. One is without doubtthat the political resolution of the crisis in Kosovo hasonly been possible thanks to the United Nations  whichfaced an urgent challenge  and on the success or failureof its response depends to a large extent the public imageof our Organization.In the Western Sahara Spain has supported withconcrete measures the action of the United NationsMission for the Referendum in Western Sahara(MINURSO)  and also the Secretary-General’s settlementplan. It is willing to increase this support if asked to doso by the Organization and if the parties directly involvedagree.The new possibilities in the Middle East after thesigning of the Sharm-el Sheikh Memorandum are seen bymy country with great hope  and we are firmly committedto continue cooperating with all sides so that the processbegun in Madrid continues on track.Other regions of the world have suffered particularlyduring this past year. Unfortunately  this is especially trueof Africa  and therefore I wish to emphasize my country’ssupport for the integrated approach taken by theSecretary-General in treating the causes of the conflictsand promoting peace on that continent.Finally  the most recent challenge to the UnitedNations is the situation in East Timor. Spain welcomedthe adoption of Security Council resolution 1264 (1999) and is willing to contribute to the multinational force toguarantee security in the Territory. My country  likewise has announced a special contribution to the fundestablished by the Office of the United Nations HighCommissioner for Refugees(UNHCR) to deal urgentlywith the acute humanitarian situation and the refugeeproblems on the island.40The Organization’s undertakings are sometimesvisible  at other times hidden  but they are alwaysindispensable. The citizens of our countries must valuethem so that the United Nations may enjoy the backing thatit needs in order to perform its important duties effectively.On the threshold of the twenty-first century  Spainreiterates yet again its firm commitment to the Organizationand its willingness to put its capacity for external action atthe service of the purposes and principles enumerated in theCharter."
"53",2243,"EST",54,1999,"Let me begin by congratulatingMr. Theo-Ben Gurirab on his election as President of thisfifty-fourth session of the General Assembly. I wish him allthe best in carrying out his duties.As the General Assembly convenes for the last timebefore the Millennium Assembly  I believe that it isappropriate to consider the United Nations future and howwe can prepare our Organization for the twenty-firstcentury.Fifty-four years after its founding  the United Nationsremains the largest multi-purpose intergovernmentalOrganization in the world. Indeed  with 188 Members  theUnited Nations has become truly global. I would like totake this opportunity to welcome Kiribati  Nauru and Tongato the United Nations family.The United Nations faces a vastly different set ofinternational issues from those of fifty-four years ago when the Organization was founded. Most threats tointernational security and stability are no longerState-driven but rather derive from the malfunction ordysfunction of States. The consequences of these threats however  are just as severe as the erstwhile threats byStates. Terrorism  corruption  economic collapse  nuclearmeltdowns  mass migration and ethnic strife are but a fewof the challenges that the world has had to face in recentyears. The violent conflict in East Timor  “ethniccleansing” in Kosovo  and the recent re-escalation ofviolence in Chechnya are but a few vivid examples of thenew kinds of threats that we face today.The United Nations has a crucial role to play incombating these and other international threats. But beforeit can start to play a more active role in the post-cold-warinternational order  serious structural reforms are needed.Estonia believes that reforms should focus above allon the Security Council. Formally  the Council  originallyintended to be the cornerstone of collective security  isvested with strong executive authority. Yet in practice itsauthority is challenged. Because of a recurring failure orinability to take action  countries in crisis situations lookless and less to the Council. In order for the UnitedNations to avoid relegation to the status of a body thatcreates norms but cannot ensure their implementation voting procedures and mechanisms in the United Nationsmost powerful body should be reformed.The key issue is voting practice  not the shopwornissue of non-permanent membership. The oftenirresponsible exercise of the veto  or even more often thethreat of the veto  has paralysed the Security Council andundermined its legitimacy. More and more often we witnesssome permanent members taking actions to meet theirdomestic interests and foreign policy goals in areasirrelevant to the issue at hand. We as Member States havegiven the mandate to the Council. Even before we are ableto carry out the reforms  we must entrust the permanentmembers to use the veto with utmost responsibility.As we look around this Hall  or at the globe  we canall observe that the world today is not what it was half acentury ago — thank God. The United Nations was createdto maintain peace in the wake of the turmoil of the SecondWorld War. Today we are already into the second decadeof the post-cold-war order  two generations removed fromthe problems faced by our grandfathers. Why  then  shouldwe be constrained by obsolescent structures still based onthe power relationships of 1945? The guarantors of andgreatest contributors to stability in the world have changedfundamentally in the course of half a century. We need notfear opening a discussion on whether the moral and legalreasoning underlying Security Council membership in thewake of the Second World War is still appropriate for thepost-cold-war era.Following from this  another area where Estoniabelieves reforms are vitally needed is that of the informalregional groups that provide the basis for electionprocedures. Many of these groups are based on a nowirrelevant cold war ideological and geopolitical alignment.A decade after the end of the cold war the East-West dividehas disappeared  and regional groups  such as the EasternEuropean Group  which were a product of that divide simply no longer make sense. In order to make UnitedNations structures correspond to today’s realities  thoseregional groups should become truly geographic.Allow me now to turn to economic and socialdevelopment. We can all agree that over the years theUnited Nations has been most successful in that area. TheUnited Nations system has devoted more attention andresources to development than to any other internationalassistance effort. Although these non-political activitieshave received less attention than efforts in the field ofpeacekeeping and diplomacy  they are no less important.Many countries  including mine  have benefited fromUnited Nations assistance. We believe  however  that it istime to start to pay back.Providing development and humanitarian assistanceis a logical and moral consequence of our membership ofthe international community. It should be the goal ofevery country. In this regard  I would like to observe thatmost United Nations activities  whether in the field ofpeacekeeping or economic assistance  almost invariablybecome permanent. Permanence  however  is not a sign ofsuccess; it is a sign of failure. The United Nations shouldtherefore concentrate more on preventive actions and onimplementing well-planned  well-targeted and timelyprogrammes with a clear exit strategy. That  in turn  willencourage success and positive development  notdependency.Estonia values the United Nations function as anormative Organization that sets international standardsand universal principles for its Members. The grossviolations of human rights witnessed this year  includingkillings and mass deportations reminiscent of thoseexperienced by my country 50 years ago  show that it ismore important than ever that countries adhere tocommon international norms and standards in the field ofhuman rights. As the only truly global Organization  theUnited Nations should play a greater role in making surethat universal principles  enshrined in the United NationsCharter  are fairly and fully applied. To pursue this goalI call upon all countries to support wholeheartedly theactivities of the United Nations High Commissioner forHuman Rights.Every year hundreds and thousands of innocentpeople perish as a result of brutal terrorist actions. TheGeneral Assembly has passed a number of resolutions onthe fight against terrorism  and currently no fewer than 11anti-terrorism conventions have been adopted. In the lightof the recent terrorist attacks in Russia  we believe thatthe fight against terrorism should be pursued with evengreater zeal. Terrorism of all kinds should be globallycondemned and eradicated. At the same time  however the fight against terrorism should not serve as a pretextfor equally gross violations of human rights  forcibledetention and the deportation of tens of thousands ofinnocent people all over a country without due process simply because of the colour of their skin or their ethnicbackground.Allow me to conclude by saying a few words on theissue of financing. If the United Nations is to enter thetwenty-first century as a serious and effectiveOrganization  we must commit ourselves to economicrealities. This means administrative reform  zero budget2growth and fiscal responsibility  combined with a firmcommitment by all countries to pay their share.The gist of Estonia’s message is that the world haschanged dramatically in the past half century. Let us adaptthe Organization to reflect the realities of today. Let usmake the United Nations an Organization that will continueto play a vital and prominent role far into the newmillennium."
"54",2289,"ETH",54,1999,"On behalf of my delegationand on my own behalf  it is with great satisfaction that Iwish to extend to you  Sir  our congratulations on yourwell-deserved election to preside over the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-fourth session  which is coincidingwith the end of a momentous century. It is indeed asource of immense pleasure and pride to my delegationand myself to see you presiding over this forum whereyou  as the representative here of the South West AfricaPeople’s Organization for many years  waged anunrelenting struggle for the independence of your country Namibia  which was crowned with success in 1990. Yourassumption of this high office is a fitting tribute to thestruggle of the many sons and daughters of Africa overthe years for the total emancipation of Africa fromcolonial rule. I wish to assure you of the fullestcooperation of my delegation in the discharge of theheavy responsibilities entrusted to you. I wish also toseize this opportunity to convey to your predecessor  Mr.Didier Opertti  our appreciation for a job well done  andwe salute him for all the efforts he has made.23I should also like to welcome the new Members of ourOrganization: the Republic of Nauru  the Kingdom ofTonga and the Republic of Kiribati.To our Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for whommy country has great esteem  I wish to renew ourfriendship and to reiterate how much we have alwaysappreciated his wisdom and his vision. His being at thehelm of the world body is indeed one of the fewconsolations for Africa  a continent which otherwise haslittle voice within the Organization.This annual occasion  here at this forum  affords us aunique opportunity to express our views as Member Stateson issues that are of concern to us as members of thehuman family  as part of specific regions of the world andin our capacity as nations. The 170 items on theAssembly’s agenda at this session are clear testimony to therange of issues confronting the international community aswe approach the coming millennium. It is not  however always easy to separate these various levels of concern.They are obviously interconnected  and all the more so forcountries such as Ethiopia  whose fates are affected positively or negatively  by what takes place internationallyand by what the United Nations does and does not do.It goes without saying that developing countries ingeneral  and the least developed countries in particular  asa group  face the most serious problems in all areas ofinternational life. Problems of poverty  underdevelopmentand the debt burden are among the multifarious problemsthe developing countries are grappling with today. As aleast developed country  Ethiopia has its own share of theseproblems  the magnitude of which is all too obvious  evenas we are making a determined effort to overcome them.In this statement I will not try to go into all theproblems facing developing countries today. Instead  Ishould like to focus on one issue: collective security especially in relation to its impact on developing countries those in Africa in particular  and how the United Nationshas failed them in this critical area. For Ethiopia this is allthe more justified and timely inasmuch as we have been thevictim of aggression — not for the first time in ourhistory — for over a year now.The United Nations has been important to us  and thepromise contained in its Charter to be our collectiveinstrument for international peace and security and a vehiclefor international cooperation in all areas of humanendeavour has been a source of hope. But we in Ethiopiaare not so sure that the hope we have is always justified both as Africans and as Ethiopians.From the vantage point of Africa  it is indeeddifficult to assert with confidence that the Organization isalso ours. This must also apply to the rest of thedeveloping world. But the African case is unique.Whether it is in the area of economic cooperation or withrespect to peace and security  our continent continues tobe a region of the world which is the least favoured foreffective and meaningful cooperation. The “We thepeoples of the United Nations” mentioned in the Preambleto the Charter and the lofty aspirations contained thereincontinue to be distant dreams for Africa.This might be regarded by some as an exaggeratedclaim and an attempt to shift the blame for a predicamentwhich is of Africa’s own making and therefore a harshjudgment on the performance of the United Nations. Wein Ethiopia would be the first to acknowledge the criticalvalue for us of the very many types of cooperation wehave with the United Nations and its various agencies some of which have indeed been very effective. It wouldbe unfair to the Organization and to many of its dedicatedstaff for us to fail to acknowledge this.In this regard  a balanced evaluation of theperformance of the United Nations cannot fail to takenote of the good work being done by the Organization inthe economic  social and humanitarian areas. This is apartfrom the indispensable role that the United Nations andits various agencies  most particularly its specializedagencies  play in harmonizing the activities of nations invarious critical spheres.It is also true that Africa and  in particular  some ofits individual countries  appear to have a unique way ofensuring that available opportunities are missed formaking progress for peace and development. But still theAfrican condition can hardly be explained only in termsof omission or commission by the people of the continent.It would suffice to refer to the cold war and to thesuper-Power rivalry spawned by that episode and to thehavoc wrought by it in Africa to be reminded thatAfrica’s pains are not always of its own making.Whatever the causes for Africa’s predicament however  the spirit of common destiny  interdependenceand the ideals of the Charter of the United Nations shouldhave obliged the international community to be moreforthcoming in rendering effective cooperation to regions24such as Africa so that they can overcome the obstacles todevelopment faced by their peoples.The fact that there is no international cooperation atpresent in the spirit of the United Nations Charter isnowhere more evident than in the circumstancessurrounding the debt burden  which continues to remain themost critical factor hindering development and thealleviation of poverty. There have so far been no effectivesteps taken internationally to alleviate this scourge  andthere is no visible remedy on the horizon. This is a tellingtestimony to how much the promise contained in theCharter about international cooperation has remained anempty slogan. If our vision for the United Nations for thecentury we are entering does not incorporate a remedy tothis danger  then for the bulk of humanity the Organizationis bound to be more irrelevant than it is today.It is not only that the United Nations is about to enterthe next century with little to show in bringing aboutgenuine international cooperation for combating poverty.Even more worrying is that it is going to do so with itscredibility very much in tatters with regard to its collectivesecurity system  which at present commands little trust asa collective instrument of the international community forworld peace and security.Whether during the cold war or since it  in this areathe United Nations  more often than not  has remained acustodian not of the collective security interests of thepeople of the world  but of the special security interests ofthose who count. Here is where double standards abound even with respect to the defense of some sacrosanctprinciples of international law.Africa can hardly be proud of the way it has handledeven the very little opportunity it has had for establishingdurable peace and security in the continent. Even afterhaving granted that the difficult socio-economic conditionsof the region have been the major causes for the Africandilemma in this area  the fact still remains that badgovernance  mismanagement of resources  lack of tolerancefor diversity and human rights violations have indeedfuelled some of the conflicts in our continent. Therefore wecannot absolve ourselves fully from taking part of theblame. In the final analysis  we have to find our ownsolution to these problems.But  on the other hand  the fact remains that Africahas received little effective international cooperation  inparticular from the United Nations  for sorting out itsdifficulties in the area of peace and security. Conflicts inAfrica have had the fate of either being neglected or when not neglected  being judged and handled bydifferent standards. Let me give a couple of illustrations.The genocide in Rwanda is a source of shame forAfrica  but it was also a reminder of the double standardsto which Africa has been subjected. The fact that Somaliaand its people have been left to their own devices regardless of the consequences for the people of Somaliaand for the peace and stability of their neighbours  is yetanother indication of the types of conflicts which elicit  orfail to elicit  the serious concern of those who count forgalvanizing the efforts of the United Nations for action todischarge its responsibilities for collective security. Whyshould it matter to those who set the agenda for what theSecurity Council does if the chaos in Somalia becomes abreeding ground for terrorism  as long as the threat islimited only to those who have little voice in the SecurityCouncil?The conflict in Somalia is indeed complex  but it isno more complex than other conflicts in other parts of theworld. Somalia is in turmoil and has been for the lastnine years  not because the crisis is intractable  butbecause Somalia is neglected. That country has failed tobe on the top of the United Nations agenda  not becauseit has no legitimate claim to be a priority for the UnitedNations collective security system  but because theinterests of those who count are not affected. This alsoapplies more or less to Angola and Sierra Leone  andearlier to Liberia.In short  the United Nations has failed Africa  andnow stands  one foot into the next century  with thisrecord. In connection with Somalia  I should like to statethat Ethiopia  the country mandated by the Organizationof African Unity (OAU) to follow up and assist inresolving the crisis in Somalia  fully supports theinitiatives expounded by Mr. Ismail Omar Guelleh President of the Republic of Djibouti from this rostrumlast week in his capacity as current Chairman of the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD).The experience of my own country over the last yearand a half and more speaks volumes about how theUnited Nations can fail an African country deemed tohave no option other than submit to unjust decisions bythe powerful. In effect  what the United Nations said toEthiopia was that Article 51 of the Charter  whichprovides for the inherent right of sovereign nations toself-defence  did not apply to poor nations such asEthiopia. That has been our experience in our attempts to25ensure the peaceful resolution of the Ethiopian-Eritreancrisis caused by the unprovoked Eritrean aggression againstus.Until May 1998  Ethiopia was nurturing the peace thatit had finally achieved after decades of turmoil. TheEritrean problem — one of the sources of instability forEthiopia — was settled  with Ethiopia leading the way inrecognizing the new nation of Eritrea. Ethiopia became abulwark of peace in our subregion — a fact which wasrecognized by many. By demobilizing half a million troopsand allocating the barest minimum from its budget — lessthan 2 per cent of its gross domestic product — to defence the country was making it clear in its actions that poornations have time to wage war only against their principalenemy  poverty — poverty and backwardness.The new orientation of the country did producedividends  most of all in terms of economic growth:average GDP growth of over 7 per cent per year wasachieved  after a difficult period of transition. But then tragedy struck and we fell victim to Eritrean aggression.The unprovoked aggression against us by Eritrea in May1998 taught us the lesson that peace is not always achievedby the unilateral decision of nations so long as there arerogue States that worship the gun and with leaders whohave no domestic limitations on the power they exercise oron the decisions they make.Eritrea has become a source of tragedy not only forEthiopia but also for its own people and for the countriesof the subregion. No sooner had it achieved formalindependence  in 1993  than it provoked a fight with theSudan  to be followed by an unprovoked onslaught onYemen in November 1995. Continuing the same pattern oflawlessness  in 1996 Eritrea again went ahead and claimed by use of force  part of Djibouti’s territory — a recklessattempt which was defused in time  thanks also to effortsby Ethiopia.The Eritrean aggression against Ethiopia in May 1998was therefore part of the same vivid pattern of behaviour asbefore  behaviour which has now made the country a majorsource of instability for our subregion  particularly inSomalia  where Eritrea’s destructive activities have causedeven more havoc in a nation with no functioning State atall. Thus  consistent with its ignoble motive of exploitingthe anarchy and lawlessness in Somalia to advance itsirresponsible policy of destabilizing the countries in theHorn of Africa  Eritrea is actively collaborating with thewarlords in Somalia by arming and training them andfinancing their fratricidal conflict  thereby exacerbating thealready volatile and unclear state of affairs in the countrywith all the attendant adverse consequences for peace andstability in our subregion.Ever since the onset of the Eritrean aggressionagainst Ethiopia  people have been asking how one of theyoungest and poorest nations on earth  whose people havebarely emerged from the trauma of a protracted liberationstruggle  can have the capacity to embark upon one of themost destructive campaigns of destabilization the entireHorn of Africa subregion — or even the whole of Africafor that matter — has ever seen. Over and above thequestion of Eritrea’s capacity  people have beenwondering what the motive can be that is driving suchacts on the part of a new Member of the family ofnations  acts with serious implications for peace andsecurity in our region.The answer to these questions is not difficult to find.To be a destructive force among nations does not requireany special capacity or resources. Small States can createhavoc and make life difficult for the internationalcommunity just as large States can. In fact  an extremistgroup on the fringes of international life  with noelaborate organizational structure  can without much effortsucceed in destabilizing an entire region let alone avulnerable subregion like ours. In effect  it does not seemas if it requires any special capacity to be a rogue State.Rogue States as such are not born  they become so oftheir own volition.That is what we see in Eritrea today: the EritreanGovernment is now working hand in glove not only withdisgruntled groups in our subregion but also withinternational terrorists  training  financing and giving themall-round support in their ultimate objective ofdestabilizing the States of the subregion. We do notbelieve the source of this Eritrean behaviour is external.It is internal: it emanates from the nature of the domesticpolitical structure in that country. If the domestic politicalprocess in a country has no constraining factors to speakof on its leadership  this  sooner or later  is bound to havea negative impact on the peace and security of the Statesof that subregion.In Eritrea this phenomenon is clearly visible today.A total absence of domestic institutions necessary for anormal State; the lack of accountability on the part of theleadership; the non-existence of even a semblance ofchecks and balances — in effect the absence of aconstitutional order — are the distinguishing features ofEritrea today. Pluralism; freedom of association and26expression; the right to express dissent — are unknown inEritrea. Democratic elections are  of course  unheard ofthere. In fact  Eritrea has nothing to do with theinternational community in terms of observance offundamental human rights and freedoms and goodgovernance since it is  for all practical purposes  ruled bythe whims of one man. The net effect of these domesticpolitical characteristics and their impact on peace andsecurity in our subregion is that more than any other peopleit is  in the final analysis  the Eritrean people that aresuffering most  bearing the brunt of the hardship resultingfrom their Government’s destabilizing policies and activitiesin the Horn of Africa.No one who has closely followed this tragedy visitedon Ethiopia by the Eritrean leadership can be unaware ofhow much effort Ethiopia has made  for over nine months to ensure the reversal of the Eritrean aggression throughpeaceful means. But it was to no avail. And  mostregrettably  the United Nations failed us. In contrast  Ishould like to express my Government’s admiration andgratitude for the commendable stand taken by OAU andAfrica throughout the crisis in defence of the principles onwhich this Organization was founded.However  despite the efforts of the OAU  Eritrea didnot listen. The United Nations pretended  even though itknew better  that there had been no aggression. TheSecurity Council went even further  as did some in theinternational community  in a coordinated effort to punishthe victim of aggression  without so much as a word aboutthe aggression or about the gross violations of internationallaw committed by a country known to have developed thehabit of acting in a lawless manner.The members of the Security Council knew full wellright from the outset that Eritrea had committed a nakedand unprovoked act of aggression against Ethiopia. Yet theychose to characterize a blatant violation of a fundamentalprinciple of international law as a mere border dispute.This  to say the least  is an evasion of the primaryresponsibility of the Security Council for the maintenanceof international peace and security. It clearly signified afailure on the part of the Council to uphold the mosthallowed principle of international law  namely  theprohibition of the use of force in international relations except in self-defence. It is a negation of the very conceptof collective security in which all States  big and small placed their confidence when they subscribed to the Charterof the United Nations.As if to underscore its failure to uphold theinternational rule of law  the Security Council  in its veryfirst resolution on the Ethiopian-Eritrean conflict  adoptedon 26 June 1998  demanded an immediate ceasefire  ineffect rewarding aggression. What better demonstrationcould there be of the Council’s failure to take adetermined stand against aggression by demanding that itbe reversed before calling for a ceasefire? What betterincentive could there be for aggressors like Eritrea tocontinue with their aggression and reap even more fruitsfrom their wanton acts?Even more disheartening and gratuitous was thestatement issued on 23 June 1999 by the Security Councilreminding us of “our primary responsibility to feed ourpeoples”  as if poor nations did not have the right todefend their sovereignty. Or was it meant to imply thatthe very notion of sovereignty is of no consequence at allfor a poor country like Ethiopia? That  history will recall was what the League of Nations told us  if not in somany words  more than 60 years ago. But this was notwhat we expected from the United Nations today.To make matters worse  the Security Council chose on 10 February 1999  through resolution 1227 (1999)  tourge States to end sales of arms both to the aggressor andto the victim  while at the same time continuing todeliberate on how the peace proposal submitted by theOrganization of African Unity  and already accepted byEthiopia  could be modified to make it acceptable to theaggressor at the expense of the victim.This was again the essence of the informaldeliberations by the Security Council on 24 February1999. The aggressor country was in effect told to waituntil the victim of aggression gave in to pressure.The refusal by a poor nation to accept insult  anation which happened to be the victim of aggression obviously entails certain consequences. The punishmentmeted out has had almost no limits. It has includedfinancial institutions changing the rules of the game inmidstream. In the case of Ethiopia  they saw fit toabrogate ongoing programmes based on non-technicalconsiderations that had absolutely nothing to do with theresults of actual performance evaluations. That has beenthe experience of Ethiopia with the InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF)  which suspended its cooperationwith Ethiopia on political grounds  although it knew fullwell that it had absolutely no cause for that action on thebasis of the relevant criteria.27Once the tone was set by the Security Council  othersfound it easy to overlook the injustice involved and addedtheir weight to a stance which made a mockery ofelementary justice. The European Union and otherinstitutions and countries jumped on the bandwagon making it clear to Ethiopia that a poor nation is not entitledto defend itself and that not heeding this warning wouldhave its consequences. And it did. Ethiopia’s fault was oneand only one  and that was its insistence that aggressioncannot and must not be rewarded through the use ofwhatever pretext  including calls for an unconditionalceasefire  which was demanded by the aggressor andthought to be in accord with the interests of those whocount. The sovereign rights of the victim did not count.That was the implication for our whole region of thelawless Eritrean philosophy of grabbing land first and theninviting the victims for talks.I should not  however  give the impression thateverybody has been inconsiderate to my country in its hourof need. Indeed  there are countries and institutions thatduly value partnership in development which stood by us realizing that discontinuing development assistance to thevictim of aggression would be tantamount to rewarding thataggression. Those countries have not only continued theirassistance but also  in some cases  increased it. On behalfof the people of Ethiopia  I should like to express our deepgratitude to those countries and institutions  whosedemonstration of solidarity we will always cherish.In the light of this experience  it is indeed difficult tokeep intact our trust in the United Nations and ininternational cooperation. It is also difficult to have faith inthe efficacy of the United Nations collective securitysystem.The United Nations cannot avoid sharing the blame forthe bloodshed and destruction that followed the nine-monthEritrean intransigence. The Ethiopian-Eritrean crisiseventually led to major fighting  not only because theaggressor was intransigent and refused to give peace achance  but also because the United Nations failed to speakin defence of principles of international law.With respect to the aggression against Ethiopia byEritrea  it is the justified feeling of the Ethiopian peoplethat the failure of the United Nations to stand up for itsprinciples is indeed comparable to the injustice done to mycountry by the League of Nations in 1936.But this episode has wider implications over andabove Ethiopia. It raises a fundamental question with regardto the ability of the United Nations to be a guardian ofthe principles of international law — a guardianshipwhich would have no financial implications when limitedto a mere affirmation of principles. The United Nationshas shown us that it cannot even do this. Why this shouldbe so calls for a response  which  if given with candour should invite drastic measures so that we can have aUnited Nations which provides a home to all in equalmeasure.As for Ethiopia’s commitment to peace  that cannotbe questioned  as has been made clear consistently sinceEritrea’s aggression. Ethiopia’s position has always beenconsistent. Aggression  we have said  cannot be rewarded.Peace requires its reversal. That is what every nationwould have demanded if it had found itself in Ethiopia’sposition. Ethiopia has asked for nothing more.Eritrea now says it is prepared to do what it couldhave done a year and half ago — something that theUnited Nations never dared to ask it to do. While this initself is Ethiopia’s vindication  experience has nonethelesstaught us a lesson: we must ensure that there are noloopholes in any agreement reached on the withdrawal ofEritrean troops from Ethiopian territory occupied byforce. This is the nature of the ongoing dialogue we arenow engaged in with the OAU. There is absolutely noreason why it should be difficult to address the legitimateconcerns of the victim of aggression with regard to theclarity of the commitments undertaken by the aggressorcountry.Indeed  the principles involved should be protectedin the interests not only of Ethiopia but also of oursubregion and beyond. The lawlessness and contempt forthe principles of international law demonstrated byEritrea  which have now poisoned the whole region  mustbe contained. This can be done at the minimum bysending a clear message to its leadership that enough isenough and that aggression should not pay. This is all themore necessary with respect to those who  in the absenceof even a semblance of institutions of governance in thecountry  are above the law and have little accountability.That is why we have insisted  and continue to insist  thatEritrea must be allowed to gain nothing from itslawlessness. That is why we have insisted  and continueto insist — not without sacrifice — that there should beno loopholes in agreements concluded so that theprinciple that aggression should not be rewarded isunderlined clearly and with no ambiguity. We thus remainhopeful — hoping against hope — that Ethiopia’sconcerns will be addressed adequately  thereby making it28easier to put behind us the nightmare created by theEritrean aggression.The United Nations is at a crossroads. It cannot limpalong and enter the next century with all its weaknessesunattended. Reforms are necessary. The Security Councilcannot remain as it is  unrepresentative and unresponsive tothe interests of the majority. It is still not too late to restoreconfidence in the collective security system envisioned inthe Charter of our Organization more than half a centuryago. The credibility of the United Nations needs to berevived. How can the United Nations command the trust ofall Member States and their peoples? That is one of thequestions with which the United Nations will have tograpple as we enter the twenty-first century."
"55",2335,"FIN",54,1999,"I have the honour to speakon behalf of the European Union.Mr. President  I would like to congratulate you uponyour election as President of the General Assembly. TheEuropean Union gives you its full support andcooperation throughout this session. Your predecessor Minister Opertti  also deserves our appreciation. I wouldalso commend the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  forthe skill with which he has steered this Organization. TheEuropean Union pledges its support also to him  as wellas its full commitment to the United Nations.20I should like to welcome the three new members ofthe United Nations  the Republics of Kiribati and Nauruand the Kingdom of Tonga  into our global family.In overall terms substantial progress has been made inhuman development. However  its speed and extent havebeen uneven. The United Nations has a primary role in theadvancement of human development. Implementation canbe carried out only through close cooperation amongdifferent actors: the United Nations  its Member States  itsspecialized agencies  international financial institutions regional organizations and civil society.We need an efficient and effective United Nationswhich has a stable financial basis and a full commitmentfrom all its Member States. This also means the full prompt and unconditional payment of contributions to theUnited Nations by all. Unilateral decisions and actions tothe contrary are not allowed.The globalization of the world economy is anunavoidable process. We see the need to put theglobalization process and macroeconomic policies in closertouch with the lives of ordinary people. We consider this tobe one of the challenges facing the world community on thethreshold of the new millennium. The United Nations isuniquely positioned to provide intellectual leadership toensure that the advantages of economic globalization areequally shared by the world’s population. Increasinginterdependence must work for people.The nature of crises has also changed. Most of today’sconflicts take place within and not between States. We facesituations where there are serious democracy deficienciesand where human rights are strongly violated  in particularthe rights of the minorities. In the worst cases  States withtheir traditional institutions have ceased to exist  asSecretary-General Kofi Annan described so well in hisopening statement.At the threshold of a new millennium  we shouldintensify our efforts to prevent these situations. We shouldstart to consider how to elaborate some criteria and rulesaimed at the prevention of humanitarian catastrophes oralleviation of profound human suffering.The international community needs to developsolutions and responses to these new and unexpectedchallenges. The international community must play aproactive role in conflict prevention. There are severalforms of action that have a useful effect in preventingconflicts. These include strengthening democracy andrespect for human rights  as well as progress in economicand social development through good governance. Themost important factor in conflict prevention is  however a democratic society which is on a steady foundation andwhich guarantees human security in its widest possiblesense. Democratic societies do not go to war with eachother  and they are also internally more stable.Every human being is entitled to enjoy his or herhuman rights and fundamental freedoms. Human rightsare essential in the maintenance of international peace andsecurity  economic development and social equality. TheUnited Nations has a primary role in the promotion ofuniversal respect for human rights. These must be furtherintegrated in all United Nations activities. The promotionof universal respect for human rights and fundamentalfreedoms is central also to the activities of the EuropeanUnion.The tenth anniversary of the adoption of theConvention on the Rights of the Child reminds us of theneed to advance the rights of the most vulnerable:children. The European Union welcomes the recentadoption of the International Labour Organization (ILO)Convention on the prohibition and elimination of theworst forms of child labour. All States should ratify theConvention as soon as possible and implement iteffectively. The protection of children affected by armedconflicts also requires constant attention. It is imperativeto adopt without delay the optional protocol to theConvention on the Rights of the Child  on involvement ofchildren in armed conflict.The European Union is concerned aboutdiscrimination against women. We underline theimportance of the international human rights instrumentsdesigned to protect and promote the human rights andfundamental freedoms of women. The adoption of theoptional protocol to the Convention on the Elimination ofAll Forms of Discrimination against Women will be ahistoric event in this session. The European Union callson all States to give serious consideration to ratifying it.Trafficking in human beings violates many of themost basic human rights. Most victims of this practice arewomen and children. Concerted international action isrequired in the fight against trafficking. The EuropeanUnion supports the work done to develop internationalstandards to prevent these crimes and to punish theperpetrators. Measures must also be taken to help thevictims of this type of exploitation.21Racism is a universal problem. Thus  the eliminationof all forms of racial intolerance should be theresponsibility of every State. We also want to underline theinput by civil society and non-governmental organizationsin this field.The European Union is committed to opposing thedeath penalty. We call on all States that still impose thedeath penalty to progressively restrict the offences forwhich it may be used  and we insist that it be carried outaccording to minimum standards. As a first step  amoratorium on executions should be established. The finalaim must remain the complete abolition of the deathpenalty. The European Union will actively pursue thismatter in this session.No doubt  sustainable development in all areasenhances crisis prevention. People are at the centre of ourconcerns in sustainable development.The Buenos Aires Plan of Action sets out an ambitiousand precise timetable to follow in future negotiations on thethreat of climate change. However  there are still importantoutstanding questions  such as the Kyoto mechanisms andcapacity-building of developing countries  as well as thetransfer of technology. In the Intergovernmental Forum onForests  our common goal is to promote sustainable forestmanagement worldwide. The European Union also notes theneed for international coordination on oceans and seas.The European Union is fully committed to reducingextreme poverty in developing countries. We support themin their efforts to implement the international commitmentsfor sustainable development. International cooperation  aswell as ownership by partner countries  is needed to achievethe common goals.Relieving the unsustainable debt burden of the poorestcountries requires faster relief through the programme forthe Heavily Indebted Poor Countries. The European Unionconfirms its full commitment to the high-level discussionon financing for development. We expect this process toincrease the political will to implement internationallyagreed strategies for sustainable development.The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons (NPT) remains a cornerstone of global security.It is imperative that the four States that have not yet doneso join the NPT. The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-BanTreaty (CTBT) is a key instrument in the field of nucleardisarmament and non-proliferation. As we are approachingthe Conference on the CTBT to be held in October  theEuropean Union calls upon all States to sign and ratifythe Treaty.The European Union welcomes the entry into forceof the Ottawa Convention on the Prohibition of the Use Stockpiling  Production and Transfer of Anti-personnelMines and on Their Destruction. As the internationalcommunity moves towards the total elimination of anti-personnel landmines worldwide  the recent use of theseweapons is highly deplorable. We must voice concernabout the misery that anti-personnel mines continue tocause to the civilian population. The European Unioncontinues to be the main contributor to deminingprogrammes worldwide.We are deeply concerned about the impact accumulation and spread of small arms and lightweapons  and we have intensified our efforts to addressthis problem. The United Nations conference on the illicitarms trade in all its aspects should establish a strongprogramme of action for international cooperation.Terrorism constitutes a threat to internal andinternational security. Therefore  the European Unionreaffirms its unreserved condemnation of terrorism in allits forms and continues to support initiatives to suppressit. We call upon all countries to sign and to ratify theinternational anti-terrorism conventions. We hope that theconventions on the suppression of terrorist financing andon the acts of nuclear terrorism can be adopted by theGeneral Assembly by the end of this year. The EuropeanUnion will look carefully into the proposal of Egypt andothers to develop further the idea of a United Nationsconference on terrorism.As the Secretary-General has said  it would be theultimate crime to miss the chance for peace and condemnpeople to the misery of war. Even the best plans forprevention can fail  and the international community hasto address armed conflicts. These conflicts have human social and environmental consequences which cannot berepaired.The international community has a long tradition ofsolving crises by peacekeeping operations. Now that thenature of crises has changed  additional means are needed.Peacekeeping operations cannot meet all the requirementswithout increased efforts for civilian crisis management.In most crises  societies and their structures arecompletely destroyed.22The international community has called for repair andrehabilitation. Humanitarian assistance alone is not enough.Reconstruction of societies requires the presence of civilianpolice and other administrators from all fields of civilactivity. In most cases it is difficult to find the right toolsto cope with conflicts.The European Union strongly emphasizes civiliancrisis management. We hope that it will be more oftenresorted to as the principal means to manage and solvecrises. We will work actively to develop further thisconcept. The European Union is in the process ofimproving its crisis management capabilities  keeping inmind that the primary responsibility for the maintenance ofinternational peace and security lies with the United Nationsand the Security Council.Regional organizations have a key role in internationalsecurity. For their success  cooperation with the UnitedNations is essential. The European Union thanks theSecretary-General for his efforts to strengthen thiscooperation and urges him to continue this work.The crisis in Kosovo requires concerted efforts. TheEuropean Union supports the full implementation ofSecurity Council resolution 1244 (1999). With the adoptionof this resolution  the United Nations regained its relevanceas far as Kosovo is concerned. We also support the UnitedNations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo(UNMIK) and KFOR in their efforts to ensure peace democracy and security in Kosovo. The United Nationsneeds the means and cooperation of all to fulfil its mandate.At the height of the Kosovo crisis the European Unionlaunched the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe. Itsaim is to address the questions of democracy  human rights economic reconstruction and security in a comprehensiveand durable manner. We would welcome the FederalRepublic of Yugoslavia joining the Stability Pact as a fulland equal participant and beneficiary. The current regimeof Mr. Milosevic is responsible for its present isolation  andwe look forward to welcoming democratic change insideSerbia. Meanwhile  we are searching for ways in whichKosovo and the Republic of Montenegro could be madebeneficiaries of the Pact.In Kosovo there is an urgent need to put an end tohuman suffering. We are concerned about the violencetowards minorities  which has resulted in a large number ofSerbs and Roma people leaving Kosovo. Urgent restorationof the rule of law is extremely important.The Middle East remains a top priority for thecommon foreign and security policy of the EuropeanUnion. We find it encouraging that the Middle East peaceprocess has regained momentum and that the negotiationsbetween Israel and the Palestinians have started again.Negotiations are the only way to find a just and lastingsolution to this conflict. We welcome the signing of thememorandum on the implementation of the Wye RiverAgreement. The European Union has consistently assuredthe parties of its readiness to assist them in their searchfor peace.All tracks of the peace process should now beactivated. We urge the Syrian  Lebanese and IsraeliGovernments to engage in direct talks. The relevantSecurity Council resolutions form an internationallyaccepted basis for peace.It is also important to make progress on themultilateral track. Peace can  and must be  rooted in closeregional cooperation. The multilateral track and theBarcelona process provide good opportunities in thisregard.The European Union warmly welcomes the result ofthe popular consultation of the East Timorese people on30 August 1999. Indonesia’s commitment to the fullimplementation of the relevant Agreements is imperative.We are committed to seeing the people of East Timorenjoy the independence which they have freely chosen.The European Union pays tribute to the United Nationsfor the organization of the popular consultation and laudsthe courage and extraordinary work of the personnel ofthe United Nations Mission in East Timor.We condemn in the strongest terms the atrocities inEast Timor. The Government of Indonesia retains aresponsibility for security in the Territory.We fully support Security Council resolution 1264(1999) and welcome the early deployment of themultinational force. We also welcome the participation ofAsian States in this force. Order  security and the rule oflaw must be restored immediately. The attitude of theEuropean Union towards Indonesia will depend on theimplementation of the undertakings given by the Presidentof Indonesia. They should be implemented without delayand without conditions.We have agreed  for a period of four months  on anembargo on the export of military equipment and otherequipment which might be used for internal repression or23terrorism. The European Union has also suspended itsbilateral military cooperation with Indonesia.The European Union stresses the urgent priority toremedy the grave humanitarian situation. We will providefurther humanitarian assistance to those in need.We also support the call of the United Nations HighCommissioner for Human Rights to convene a specialsession of the Commission on Human Rights. We call foran investigative mission by the Commission.East Timor’s independence must proceed withoutdelay  as provided for in the 5 May Agreements. TheMember States of the European Union look forward torecognizing East Timor once the process towardsindependence is completed.We also emphasize our desire to see a strong democratic and united Indonesia.The European Union continues to fully support theefforts of the Secretary-General towards a negotiatedpolitical settlement of the question of Cyprus. We urge thetwo leaders concerned to accept the invitation tonegotiations under the auspices of the Secretary-General.The Secretary-General has said that the United Nationscannot rest until all of Africa is at peace. One third ofsub-Saharan Africa is presently involved in armed conflicts.The victims of these conflicts are overwhelmingly civilians.The European Union strongly appeals to the parties in theseand other ongoing conflicts to respect human rights and tocooperate with the humanitarian organizations. We willcontinue to make all efforts to provide assistance to thevictims.Concrete measures have been taken to strengthenAfrican ownership and capacity to focus on conflictprevention and resolution. The European Union issupporting  in close cooperation with the United Nations the capacity of African organizations in the field of conflictresolution and peacekeeping.A stable and democratic political environment isindispensable for sustainable development. The EUwelcomes the Secretary-General’s report on the causes ofconflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainabledevelopment in Africa  and we look forward to its effectivefollow-up.The first EU-Africa summit is scheduled to takeplace in April 2000. This summit is a clear signal of theclose cooperation between the EU and the Africancountries aimed at addressing various  even delicate political and socio-economic issues.One of the principal objectives of the AmsterdamTreaty is to strengthen the EU’s Common Foreign andSecurity Policy. To achieve this we have created newunits and instruments to deal with the increasingchallenges in the field of foreign policy. In accordancewith the Amsterdam Treaty  we are going to consistentlyimprove our capacity for conflict prevention and crisismanagement. The EU will increase its ability to contributeto international peace and security  in accordance with theprinciples of the United Nations Charter.Finally  I should like to say a few words about thenext millennium. The Millennium Assembly should givenew direction to the renewal of the United Nations. TheEU supports the overall theme “The United Nations in thetwenty-first century”  proposed by the Secretary-General.In the view of the EU  the focus should be on povertyeradication in the context of globalization.Poverty eradication is a major challenge for theinternational community now that the world’s populationis reaching six billion  with nearly a quarter of thatnumber still living in poverty. It is one of the greatestchallenges left pending at the end of the twentiethcentury.24With the new millennium  we should also recognizethe increased importance of civil society in the search forsolutions. This is one of the cornerstones of the new era ininternational cooperation."
"56",2379,"FJI",54,1999,"It is my honour today toconvey to the Assembly the warm greetings and bestwishes of the Government and people of the friendlyislands of Fiji.On their behalf  I congratulate the President on hiselection. He will be interested to know that his greatcountry  Namibia  is grouped together with my country inthe same pool at the Rugby World Cup  which begins inWales next month. While we are friendly rivals on therugby football field  we are absolutely confident here that with his extensive experience  and impressive credentials we can all look forward to another successful session ofthe General Assembly.We also express our deep appreciation and gratitudeto our outstanding Secretary-General and to the membersof the Security Council for their wise and ablestewardship of the United Nations over the past year.The priority challenge for the internationalcommunity continues to be to help ensure that there is26freedom and justice and peace and prosperity in every partof our common habitat — the good planet Earth.I trust that this session of the General Assembly willfocus particular attention on specific issues that beardirectly on our collective responsibility  as Member Statesof the United Nations  in promoting peace  security anddevelopment to make our good planet Earth a better andsafer place for all its citizens.In this regard  I wish to acknowledge the Governmentof the Republic of Indonesia for its foresight in giving thepeople of East Timor the freedom to choose their politicalfuture. Now that they have freely made their choice  we inFiji join other States Members of the United Nations inappealing to the Government of Indonesia to facilitate thepeaceful and orderly transition of East Timor to fullnationhood and independence.To enable this  it is crucially important that everyeffort is made to restore law and order and ensure theprovision and maintenance of effective security measures toallow the people of East Timor to return to their homes.The tragic situation which has arisen there  with the loss ofhundreds of lives  need not have occurred had theIndonesian Government and the military properly exercisedtheir responsibility to deal decisively with the unlawfularmed elements.As a member of the United Nations family  Fiji standsready to participate alongside other Member States in theUnited Nations peacekeeping force in East Timor in layingthe foundation for lasting peace in that new nation. Also we call on the international community to provide tangibleassistance to enable East Timor to put an effectiveGovernment in place and rebuild its shattered economy.I take this opportunity to reaffirm Fiji’s continuingcommitment to United Nations peacekeeping operations inLebanon  Sinai  Bosnia and Kosovo. Within our ownPacific island region  we remain ready to support and assistPapua New Guinea in bringing permanent peace toBougainville  as part of a South Pacific Forum regionalpeace mission. In the Solomon Islands  we are ready andprepared to cooperate with the Government  at theinvitation and under the aegis of the Commonwealth ofNations  in restoring peace and promoting goodwill andunderstanding among the people of this very importantneighbouring State. In all this  the guiding principle ofFiji’s participation is respect for the sovereign rights of thecountries concerned and maintenance of the democraticrights and freedoms of their peoples.Making sacrifices in serving our common interestsis nothing foreign to us in Fiji  for it is through thewillingness of the various constituent communities in ourmulti-ethnic and multicultural society to make sacrificesin order to safeguard our collective future that we havesucceeded in constructing an agreed constitutionalframework for peace and prosperity in our country. Weunanimously adopted a new Constitution in July 1997 toreplace the racially weighted Constitution imposed on ourpeople following the military coups of 1987. Under thenew Constitution  general elections were held in May thisyear. In those free and democratic elections  myGovernment was elected into office with a clear overwhelming majority. We decisively won the electionsbecause our People’s Coalition Party promised policies ondevelopment that were focused specifically on addressingthe basic needs of the people — the need for regularincome through jobs or business opportunity; the need forbetter education and health services; a safe and cleanwater supply; electricity; good standard of housing ataffordable prices; safe streets and neighbourhoods; and aclean and healthy environment. But above all these wasthe emphasis we placed on the critical need to bring reliefand assistance to the poor  to those on low incomes andto the growing number of those who  through no fault oftheir own  live in dire poverty.Unemployment and poverty can be counteredeffectively only when people have the opportunity through development  to apply their God-given talents andability fully. To promote development we need sustainedeconomic growth  but growth that creates employmentand opportunities for a wide cross-section of society:growth that creates wealth for only a few and does notreach the masses that live in grinding poverty cannot beregarded as being for the national good. We thereforeneed to promote economic growth for humandevelopment: it must be regarded as the right of everycitizen in any society to share in the benefits of growth development and progress — benefits not just in the formof material well-being  but also in the improved quality oflife through self-fulfilment and the contentment thatcomes from service to others and love of one’sneighbours and fellow citizens.And so it is with the global community. Thepromotion of freer international trade for greater growthand prosperity must be pursued with a strong sense ofeconomic and social justice. At international gatheringssuch as this  we hear high-sounding platitudes andpromises of international arrangements that would favourall nations. Such are the kinds of promises about gains27from free trade that we hear from the World TradeOrganization. In reality  however  opportunities are neverthe same  let alone equal  given that conditions andcircumstances are different  varying from country tocountry. It is not surprising  therefore  that internationalagreements genuinely aimed at facilitating freer andincreased mutually beneficial international trade have oftenbeen undermined and frustrated by unilateral decisions andactions taken to protect vested national economic andpolitical interests.Globalization and our growing interdependence mustbe accompanied by a strong and genuine internationalcommitment — especially by those economies thatdominate world trade  international finance  technology andindustrial production — to consider special arrangementsfor the developing economies. The specific aim must be tocreate new opportunities for developing countries to earnhigher incomes through their own efforts as participants inthe global trading system.This is why my country  along with others in thePacific  African and Caribbean regions  are deeply gratefulto the European Union for the special trading and otherarrangements under the Lomé Convention. For us in Fiji 300 000 of our total population of 800 000 are dependentfor their livelihoods  directly and indirectly  on the sugarindustry. But it is the sugar protocol of the LoméConvention with the European Union which is helping tosustain the continuing viability of this very importantindustry  while enabling us to attain the internal efficienciesnecessary to enhance our international competitiveness.Similarly  it is the special South Pacific RegionalTrade and Economic Cooperation Agreement  orSPARTECA  which Australia and New Zealand maintainwith Pacific island nations  that has been a positive factorin increasing Pacific island exports to these two countries.This Agreement has stimulated new industries in themanufacturing sector in our country  has substantiallyincreased our export earnings and has helped create newemployment for thousands of our people.We are  of course  grateful for the developmentassistance we are receiving from both bilateral andmultilateral donors. I recognize in particular our traditionaldonors such as Australia  New Zealand  Japan  the UnitedKingdom  the European Union  the People’s Republic ofChina and many others  along with the various UnitedNations development agencies. This development assistancehas been of immense value both in our economic and inour social development efforts.While we deeply appreciate all this assistance  wealso believe that helping us with increased opportunitiesin trade and investment is the best form of aid — aid toassist us in achieving higher rates of growth and progressthrough our own self-reliant capability. We wouldtherefore welcome increased and stronger United Nationssupport for global policies that contribute specifically toincreased foreign capital investment and assistance todeveloping countries.We have been very disappointed by what weperceive to be the lack of genuine commitment by theinternational community  especially by bilateral andmultilateral donor agencies and the large developedmarkets  to respond positively to the BarbadosProgramme of Action for the Sustainable Development ofSmall Island Developing States. This BarbadosProgramme commitment was made five years ago. I verymuch hope  therefore  that the coming special session onsmall island developing States will readily agree on acommon regime of international support to assist them intheir efforts to achieve sustainable development.In that regard  my Government welcomes the newemphasis by multilateral agencies such as the WorldBank  the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and theAsian Development Bank to assist developing economiesin the eradication of poverty  in enhancing human-resource development through better education and healthfacilities and services and in the improvement andexpansion of infrastructure to support increasedinvestment in the economy by both foreign and localinvestors.May I take this opportunity to congratulate theKingdom of Tonga  the Republic of Nauru and theRepublic of Kiribati on their admission to the UnitedNations. Their membership will no doubt add strength andresonance to the voice of Pacific Island nations in thisvery important international forum. But like them  we inthe Republic of the Fiji Islands recognize that  in theultimate  the United Nations draws its strength from thequality of the commitment of every Member State to itsbasic purpose and mission  as set out in the UnitedNations Charter and other related documents.Article 56 of the Charter reminds us all of ourcollective responsibility. All Member States are to pledgethemselves to take joint and separate actions incooperation with the United Nations for the achievementof its purposes.28Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of HumanRights states that we are all endowed with reason andconscience and should act towards one another in a spirit ofbrotherhood. In my country  the Republic of the FijiIslands  we have  in our new Constitution  adopted anumber of very important fundamental principles as thebasis for consolidating peace  unity and stability in ourmultiethnic and multicultural society. In Fiji we believe inthe kind of multiculturalism that recognizes the value andcontribution of each community and also that culturaldiversity serves to enrich our society. But we temper thisby drawing in and uniting all our citizens through focusingon our common needs as human beings.We believe deeply and sincerely that it is the duty ofgovernment — indeed  of every government — to giveequal care and attention to the development needs andconcerns of all citizens  irrespective of race  religion gender or economic and social status. These principles andthis approach are working for us in Fiji  and I have nodoubt that their universal application will also contribute togreater international peace  goodwill and understanding.Indeed  as we direct our attention to the beginning of thenew millennium  and in particular the proposed millenniumsummit of the General Assembly in September of next year let us look to it both with seriousness of purpose and witha new determination as a unique opportunity to rebuild thefoundation for international cooperation.My delegation fully supports the efforts of ourSecretary-General to reform the Organization. The UnitedNations was established fifty-four years ago. To bemeaningful  this reform must include a revision of theUnited Nations Charter to reflect the realities of today.On the Security Council  this must include an increasein both the permanent and non-permanent membership based on a more equitable representation of the differentgeographical regions. We also urge that the existingregional groupings in the United Nations for the purpose ofrepresentation in the various organs and specializedagencies should be reviewed with a view to reconfiguringthem. This is  again  to ensure fair and equitablerepresentation of the various geographical regions.The countries from the South Pacific region  forexample  are currently split between the Asian Group andthe Western European Group. Australia and New Zealandare part of the Western European Group. On the otherhand  Fiji and other island States from the South Pacific aremembers of the Asian Group. Such a configuration is notonly discriminatory on ethnic lines  it is also  in thesedays  artificial and irrelevant.I believe  therefore  that it is time Member Statesfrom the South Pacific should be allowed to have theirown distinctive regional grouping in the United Nations.In proposing this  we are not asking for something that istotally new. In fact  this is already the acceptedarrangement in such United Nations agencies as theWorld Health Organization and the Food and AgricultureOrganization.With regard to its development agenda  the UnitedNations  we believe  must give greater attention to itsresponsibility  under Article 55 of the United NationsCharter  on the promotion of international cooperation ineconomic and social development  with particularreference to the needs of developing countries.The World Summit for Social Development atCopenhagen in 1995 agreed on 10 main commitments tobe part of an international Programme of Action toenhance social development  including the eradication ofpoverty in the world through decisive national actions andinternational cooperation. We look forward to next year’sreview by the United Nations of this very importantProgramme of Action. As we begin the new millennium let it be a challenge to the United Nations to recommititself to the very important goal of promoting socialjustice and equity as a top priority in economicdevelopment  both within and between nations.It is incumbent on all of us — the Member States multilateral agencies such as the World Bank and theIMF  and the various United Nations developmentagencies — to cooperate in taking all appropriate actionsto create conditions of stability and well-being  which arenecessary for peaceful and friendly relations amongnations.As I have said  our membership of the UnitedNations and our attendance here at this session of theGeneral Assembly reflect our commitment to the UnitedNations Charter on the maintenance of international peaceand security. I urge all Member States to work togetherto encourage the resolution of disputes and conflictsthrough dialogue and the pursuit of consensus. And wemust do this always with recognition and respect fornational sovereignty and independence.As men and women of goodwill  we have gatheredhere at the United Nations to reaffirm our common29commitment to promoting a more peaceful world. But letus remind ourselves that peace is more than the absence ofwar or conflict. Peace can be real and enduring only whenwe all cooperate closely to create conditions for life to belived in freedom and security  and with justice and dignity.We must therefore collaborate and cooperate inpromoting international trade in goods and services financial and technology transfers and development thatbenefits all countries  big and small  developed anddeveloping. And let us act in concert  and withresponsibility  in safeguarding and protecting our preciousnational and global environment.In concluding  I pray to the Almighty to bless us all as children of His divine creation  with His wisdom andlove  so that we may live together and relate to each otheras brothers and sisters  bound together by mutual care andconcern for one another."
"57",2426,"FRA",54,1999,"I would likefirst of all to congratulate you  Sir  on your election to thepresidency of the fifty-fourth session of the GeneralAssembly. It attests to the esteem in which theinternational community holds you and your country. Iwould like to include in this tribute the Secretary-General  who bears the weighty responsibility ofpromoting the universality of the Organization and theeffectiveness of its action. Lastly  I wish to congratulatethe three new Members of the United Nations. The greatand fine ideal that the United Nations embodies is verymuch alive — of this I am firmly convinced.The United Nations is undertaking a grand civilizingendeavour  a task that is constantly being challenged butever necessary. To unite peoples to work together forpeace and development  to affirm a body of legal rulesframing relations among States and to achieve commonstandards: that is the goal of the United Nations — acivilizing goal.That goal is achieved first of all through the peacefulsettlement of conflicts. The role of the Security Councilin this mission is more vital than ever  a pre-eminence itderives from the Charter. France will recall thisfundamental rule as often as necessary. To be sure  therehave been circumstances when an urgent humanitariansituation dictated we should act immediately  but such an26approach must remain an exception. We must take care  asin the case of Kosovo  to reintegrate this action into thecontext of the Charter. Our fundamental rule is that it is forthe Security Council to resolve crisis situations. For thatreason  the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s newstrategic concept recalls that the Washington Treatyrecognizes the primary responsibility of the SecurityCouncil in the maintenance of peace.Indeed  the universal nature of the Organization isintangible. The United Nations must strive to respond tocrises  wherever they may occur. While we have nothesitated to do precisely that in recent years and on severalcontinents  I would like to express regret at the relativetimidity of the Organization where Africa is concerned. Theextent of the tragedies on that continent requires us to takemore resolute action.Universality is compatible with complementarity inaction. In the interests of efficiency  the United Nationsmust encourage  in every part of the world  regionalarrangements among States capable of handling crises inthe first instance. Such is the spirit of Chapter VIII of theCharter. Tasks should be realistically shared between theregional organizations and the Security Council withoutweakening the latter’s authority. For instance  my countryhas  through the RECAMP programme  along with others strengthened African peacekeeping capabilities throughassistance provided under United Nations auspices incooperation with the Organization of African Unity.International security also demands continueddisarmament in the context of multilateral and verifiableagreements. This is an ongoing objective for France  whichhopes that the work of the Conference on Disarmament willbe relaunched in the months prior to the ReviewConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. France would like to seethe prompt entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  the start of negotiations on banning theproduction of fissile materials for nuclear-weapon use  andthe conclusion of a verification protocol to the BiologicalWeapons Convention. We would not support anydevelopment that might bring the Anti-Ballistic MissileTreaty into question and upset strategic balances.The United Nations mission is not limited to thesettlement of conflicts between States. With humankind’sgrowing aspirations for greater freedom and responsibility this mission extends to the safeguarding of human dignity within each State and  when necessary — as the Charterallows — against States. State-instigated violence hasspawned serious humanitarian crises over the past fewyears. Civilians have been targeted  whole populationshave been forcibly displaced  and refugee camps are notlonger secure. This is unacceptable. Consequently  wemust uphold the principle of international intervention under United Nations auspices  to assist the victims.Every crisis recalls the need for the foundingprinciple of working for peace and for respect for the lawand the human person. A case in point is the conflict inKosovo. Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)  whichlaid down the foundations of the settlement  illustratesthese principles and this resolve.We have set ourselves ambitious objectives: ensuringsecurity for all  organizing reconstruction  ensuringcoexistence between communities  transferring authorityto local leaders  and promoting democracy and pluralism.The Secretary-General’s Special Representative and theKFOR Commander have done remarkable work. Much however  remains to be done. The atrocities must bestopped  the exodus stemmed and housing built beforewinter. On the political front  preparations must be madefor the future  which will require establishing dialoguebetween the communities. Elections will  I hope  be heldin the year 2000. France has made resolute efforts in thisrespect  alongside its partners in the European Union which is providing half the international financing agreedupon by the conference of donors for Kosovo.In East Timor  another people is asking that itsrights be recognized. Overwhelmingly  it choseindependence through a referendum. Some have tried tooppose that choice with violence. I therefore welcome theadoption  on 15 September  of Security Council resolution1264 (1999). It paves the way for the restoration of peaceand should enable the democratic process to besuccessfully concluded. France is participating in theinternational force established by decision of the SecurityCouncil.Our Organization therefore remains true to thevalues we celebrated last year  on its fiftieth anniversary.But much effort is still needed for these values to berespected everywhere. To achieve this  it is essential tostrengthen international criminal law. France activelysupports the work of the international criminal tribunalsof The Hague and Arusha. The establishment of theInternational Criminal Court will be a new and decisivestep in the progress of law. France hopes that it will beset up quickly; to that end  it has already amended itsown Constitution.27To carry out its mission  the United Nations needsassured means. In order to deal with financial difficultiesand prevent these from becoming a pretext for inaction  allMember States must meet their financial obligationsvis-à-vis the Organization. France does so completely andunreservedly. A responsible attitude on the part ofcontributing States would advance the necessary reform ofthe Organization  including that of its Security Council.I should like to share with the Assembly my secondfirm conviction: that the United Nations is admirably suitedto meeting the challenges of our new world. Indeed  itsmission is strengthened by globalization.Initially  the idea of organizing relations betweenStates at the world level may have seemed utopian to some.It was merely before its time. Indeed  I consider the UnitedNations to be modern for the following reasons. Our globaland unstable world needs organization and the goal of theUnited Nations has always been to seek a betterorganization of the world. The United Nations is in stepwith a networked world. It is itself a network  a rich andunique panoply of specialized but independent andcoordinated agencies. In half a century  the United Nationshas made a tool for action which can be adapted to ourworld. The United Nations has not aged; it has grown withthe world. It must allow us to face the new challengesemerging in today’s world.A contradictory state of affairs has replaced theeuphoric illusion which followed the end of theconfrontation between blocs 10 years ago. Globalization isnot monolithic. While it is unifying  it also divides. Whileit generates remarkable progress  it also leads tounacceptable inequalities. While it opens societies to oneanother  it carries with it the threat of creating uniformity.While it frees up energy  it also releases negative forcesthat must be brought under control. The movement ofpopulations and the clash of cultures are thereforeaccompanied by rising fears as to identity  by religiousintolerance and by xenophobia. France  which has apresence on five continents and is itself a land ofimmigration  has had experience of such confrontations inits history. It knows the risks they entail and the wealththey bring. We will give our full support to the worldconference on racism  to be held in 2001. Preventing theemergence of prejudice  which too often has deadlyconsequences  will prepare the way for peace for futuregenerations.The fruits of globalization are not shared equally. Theopening of economies  the increase in trade and theacceleration of technological progress all fuel growth. Butinequalities are growing between countries and withineach economy. Nearly one in four human beings lives ingreat poverty. We cannot leave matters as they stand. Therapid expansion of communications networks does notbenefit everyone. Yet the multiplication of sources ofinformation  the increased circulation of ideas and theprofusion of new inventions are full of promise. Lowercommunications costs made possible by the Internet canbe an asset for businesses in countries in the South. Butinequalities in education hinder access to thesetechnologies. These impressive instruments for furtheringknowledge may become formidable factors in inequality.Communication is also a right. It is essential that thisright not be threatened by the concentration in just a fewhands of sources of information and the means ofproduction and distribution. France will staunchly defendcultural diversity.Globalization must encourage all of us to takeaccount of the fragility of our world — our Earth and ourcommonweal. Our environment is not a product  a simplestock of raw materials on which we can draw withoutgiving thought to future generations. True development issustainable development. Since the Rio Summit in 1992this realization has been behind the adoption of importantcommitments with regard to the climate  biodiversity anddesertification. The Kyoto Protocol on climate change andthe current negotiations on a protocol on biosafety attestto the importance of the achievements. But the uncertainfuture of climates and the recurrence of naturalcatastrophes urge us to make further efforts.The Earth is fragile  but so  too  is the humanspecies. The spread of new epidemics endangers thehealth of entire populations. Inequalities in developmentexacerbate those scourges. Some 40 million people livewith the AIDS virus today  the majority of them indeveloping countries. The spread of the pandemic inAfrica is a matter of major concern for us. I shall comeback to that issue.Globalization is changing the nature of organizedcrime  an area in which there has been a real explosion.The much greater fluidity in movement allows criminalnetworks to exploit the inconsistencies between onenational law and another and the weaknesses of some ofthem so as to hide from justice. My country is ready tomake every effort to combat this scourge. The Presidentof the French Republic made that clear last year at thespecial session of the General Assembly devoted to thatissue. The United Nations has long been engaged in the28fight against international drug-trafficking  building upexpertise  establishing specialized services and drafting abody of doctrine and a legal framework. These must bestrengthened. But  above all  States must be morecommitted to action. In January negotiations began inVienna on a convention against transnational organizedcrime. We must bring this to a satisfactory conclusion inthe year 2000.Faced with globalization  we have a choice to make.We can either go along with the supposedly universaleconomic laws  and in so doing abdicate our politicalresponsibilities  or we can seek to impose order onglobalization and thereby achieve control of our collectivefuture. For my part  I believe that global problems call forglobal responses and that an unstable world needs to beregulated  requiring what our Anglo-Saxon friends mightcall “rules and regulations”. This world needs rules. Itneeds the United Nations.This choice is also a matter of sovereignty. As theSecretary-General pointed out on 8 December last year inParis  the first words of our Charter  “We the Peoples ofthe United Nations”  make it an expression of popularsovereignty. But in order for the sovereignty of peoples tobe affirmed they must find the means to acquire themechanisms  the means of control and the benefits ofglobalization. That is my third conviction. The more theworld becomes globalized  the more it needs rules. Facedwith the temptation of unilateralism  it is more necessarythan ever to base our action on multilateral rules respectedby all. First of all  these concern the economy. We mustdefine the rules of the game so that everyone can benefitfrom globalization. We must define the rules of the gamebetween the industrial and developing countries andbetween the major economic actors  small and medium-sized business and the citizens of our countries who workand produce.In the financial sphere  we have to strengthen thestability of the monetary and financial system by ensuringthe political legitimacy of the International Monetary Fund(IMF)  involving the developing countries more closely inthe adoption of common rules and making private financialoperators liable for the consequences of their decisions forcountries in crisis. Real progress has been made since thecrises of 1997 and 1998. France contributed to this by itsproposals  especially in regard to hedge funds and fiscalhavens. It will continue to work to this end  as muchremains to be done.These rules of the game have to be based on bettercoordination among international institutions. Since 1945 international cooperation has respected the principle ofspecialization of institutions. In the future  the task is tomake them more complementary. Economic and traderules cannot disregard the most elementary social andenvironmental norms. Accordingly  France supported theadoption by the International Labour Conference a yearago of a declaration on the fundamental principles andrights involved in labour. The International LabourOrganization (ILO) is an irreplaceable forum for dialoguebetween government and social partners and for theformulation of minimal standards. It is desirable that itestablish close relations with other organizations  such asthe World Trade Organization (WTO) and the WorldBank.For these rules of the game to be better respected appropriate cooperation has to be established with thepoorest countries. Their debt burden continues to be theprimary obstacle to development. At their meeting inCologne  the G-7 countries pledged to grant further debtrelief. France contributed to this. Three principles will beapplied: solidarity  which calls for us to grant the poorestcountries the most favourable debt treatment; fairness which requires the rich countries to share the financialeffort in a balanced way; and responsibility  whereby thecountries benefiting from this aid undertake policiesdirected towards sustainable development and the fightagainst poverty. For these countries  official developmentassistance remains indispensable. France will continue toadvocate greater effort on the part of the richest countries.Our action should be increasingly inspired by theaffirmation of common values and rules. Human rightsare central to this approach. I am referring in particular tothe weakest children. The ILO Convention which outlawsthe worst forms of child labour is a new case in point.The United Nations Convention on the Rights of theChild must be supplemented as soon as possible by thetwo protocols now being negotiated  one against therecruitment of children in armed conflicts  the otheragainst the sale of children and child prostitution andpornography.To affirm the rights of women is to recognize theirdecisive role in education  in the production of wealth andin development. But it is also to combat thediscrimination and violence which they suffer. France hasmade equality between women and men one of thecornerstones in the renewal of its public life. Theadditional protocol to the Convention on the Elimination29of All Forms Discrimination against Women  submitted tothe General Assembly for approval  offers women thepossibility to assert their rights in an individual capacity.That is a major step forward. The special session of theGeneral Assembly in June 2000 will highlight the progressthat has been achieved since the 1995 Conference inBeijing.Reaffirming the right of all human beings to healthmeans combating pandemics everywhere. In December1997  in Abidjan  France proposed the establishment of a“therapeutic solidarity fund” to mobilize the internationalcommunity to care for and treat AIDS sufferers. Thecountries of the South and associations involved incombating the disease welcomed the proposal warmly. Butthe impact of AIDS on development remains dramatic. Wemust intensify our efforts to reduce this plague. Only theUnited Nations can give these efforts the necessary breadth.The principle of precaution has to be the basis for ouraction regarding the environment and health safety. TheMontreal Protocol for the protection of the ozone layer based on the principle of differentiated commitmentsbetween the North and South  is an example of well-conceived international action. These efforts must becontinued. We will do so by advocating  with our EuropeanUnion partners  a world convention on forests and byredoubling efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in theatmosphere. Precaution must also be the guiding principlein monitoring food safety. The combination of concern forsustainable agriculture  the quality of products and thepreservation of food traditions in each country explain theintensity of recent reactions. France therefore intends to seethese demands taken into account at the forthcoming WTOnegotiations.In order to address and overcome the world’sproblems  to derive the best from globalization  we neednations to be aware of their responsibilities  and we needalso to have “more” of the United Nations. Through anOrganization strengthened by a renewed sense of mission supported by sovereign States and regional organizations we will be able to further respect for human rights  promotedemocracy  work for sustainable development and help allto achieve their potential."
"58",2451,"FSM",54,1999,"I would like to take thisopportunity to congratulate you  Mr. Gurirab  on yourassumption of the office of President of this body. MyGovernment hails the selection of a distinguished leaderfrom a new developing nation to lead the General Assemblyinto the new millennium. We are also confident that youwill live up to the high standards of your esteemedpredecessor  Mr. Opertti.It is with pride that I congratulate and extend awelcome to our Pacific island neighbours — the Republicof Kiribati  the Republic of Nauru and the great Kingdomof Tonga — on their admission into the United Nationsfamily. This represents a large contribution from our regionto the attainment of a key goal of the United Nationssystem  that of universality.I want to extend the sincere condolences of the peopleof the Federated States of Micronesia for the earthquakesin Turkey  Greece and  more recently  in Taiwan.We are saddened by the violence in East Timor as itspeople seek to exercise their right to self-determination.We also feel deep sympathy for the innocentfamilies in Russia  exposed to merciless bomb attacks and for those people in all regions of the world who aresuffering today from violence  terrorism and violations ofhuman rights.Condolences are also in order on the recent death ofHis Majesty Hassan II of Morocco. His strong personalcontributions to the process of achieving peace in theMiddle East will be remembered.As Chairman of the South Pacific Forum  I amprivileged to deliver the following remarks on behalf ofits 16 member countries.The South Pacific Forum is a unique organizationcentred on the Heads of Government of 16 Pacific nationswhich share a very special part of the world: the vastexpanses of ocean and islands in the central and westernPacific  both north and south of the Equator. Forummember countries vary greatly in land area  ocean area population  resource endowment  economic development social structures  language and culture. However  we allshare a common bond as Forum members and haveestablished consensus positions  which transcend ourdiversity  on a wide range of issues. We have also agreedto work together in pursuit of regional stability andtowards the well-being of our people. Fourteen of theseForum members are small island developing States. Muchwork has been done to assist these smaller members intheir pursuit of sustainable development. Such initiativesare reflected in proposals by the Forum’s Ministers ofeconomics  for extensive economic reforms. Recently Forum trade Ministers made ground-breakingrecommendations on trade initiatives which include theestablishment of a Pacific free trade area consistent withthe rules and standards of the World Trade Organization.These recommendations will be considered by the Forumheads of Government at their annual meeting in Palaunext month.Past practice has been for the formal statement fromeach annual meeting  known as the Forum Communiqué to be offered for inclusion as a document of the GeneralAssembly. As the meeting this year will take place afterthe conclusion of the general debate  a request forinclusion of the Forum Communiqué from the Palaumeeting will be made at a later date.Last year  at their meeting in Pohnpei  FederatedStates of Micronesia  all 16 Forum leaders reaffirmedtheir endorsement of the Barbados Programme of Action14for the Sustainable Development of Small IslandDeveloping States. The leaders saw the Programme ofAction as a comprehensive framework with great potentialfor the region  and commended implementation effortsalready under way at the national and regional levels.In this regard  Forum leaders strongly supported theGeneral Assembly initiative to hold  next week  the specialsession to review progress under the Barbados Programmeof Action. Forum countries have maintained closeinvolvement with the preparatory process for the specialsession  and appreciate the strong focus on the concerns ofsmall island developing States in the work of UnitedNations bodies such as the Commission on SustainableDevelopment. We look forward to outcomes from thespecial session that will bring a new and stronger focus onour needs in the pursuit of sustainable development  andstep up the pace of measures to implement the BarbadosProgramme of Action.The common need for accelerated and sustainableeconomic development remains a major focus among theForum member countries; in fact  the Forum itself has forsome time been implementing what is known as the ForumEconomic Action Plan. The Plan attempts to addressregional concerns  which are echoed in the BarbadosProgramme of Action. Forum members feel that theadvancement of this collective  regional Plan is aconstructive response to the mandate for regional actionexpressed in the Barbados Programme.In the context of overall economic developmentplanning and assistance and of social and ecologicalconcerns  Forum members continue to maintain a keeninterest in having the United Nations adopt a vulnerabilityindex. The existing criteria for determining eligibility forconcessional aid and trade treatment and for criticalclassifications such as least developed country status arepurely macroeconomic  without any consideration of theenvironmental and natural risks we face  as a region  ona daily basis. Regional work has already begun under theSouth Pacific Geoscience Commission on developing anenvironmental vulnerability index. Only by encompassingsocial and environmental factors within its assessmentswill the international community be able to achieve equitywhen addressing the special circumstances and needs ofsmall island developing countries. We appreciate thecontinuing discussion of this matter by the Commissionon Sustainable Development  including at its most recentsession  and call for tangible action by the year 2000.In last year’s general debate  the Forum expressedrenewed hopes for the United Nations process to combatanthropogenic global warming  sea-level rise and otheradverse effects of global climate change. We took ameasure of pride that our group  which includes bothAnnex I and developing countries  found common groundat the political level to call for effective action  despitethe widely differing circumstances of member States. Itseemed that with the successful negotiation of the KyotoProtocol  the world’s nations had finally recognized theneed to begin taking action  on the basis of legallybinding commitments  to achieve specified targets andtimetables. Forum members were also relieved by therecognition that small island developing States haveparticular needs for assistance with adapting to the effectsof climate change. We welcomed the formulation ofspecific tools  such as the Clean DevelopmentMechanism  which promise to be useful in enabling islandcountries to do their part in combating combat climatechange  within the framework and parameters of our ownnational circumstances.There is of course no time to be lost. Peopleeverywhere are experiencing the sometimes disastrouseffects of climate change. From record-setting droughts tokiller floods  hurricanes and typhoons  the effects of sea-level rise are already taking a toll on small island States.Unfortunately  even as scientific evidence of climatechange has become impossible to ignore  the parties tothe Convention have yet to go very far towards gettingthe Kyoto process under way. The political will of theGovernments of the parties simply does not match thetechnical dedication of delegates to pursuing solutions atthe numerous meetings that are taking place on thissubject.15After attending the Conference of the Parties to theConvention last year in Buenos Aires  I came away withthe impression that without a real sense of urgency theConvention might choke on its own complexity  to thedelight of the minority that opposes it. Unless all countriesalign themselves with the Convention’s purposes and takeurgent collective action  we could find ourselves here at theseventy-fifth session of the General Assembly  withoutbeing any closer to meaningful implementation of theConvention. By that time  leaders would be expressingregret over a steadily growing list of climate-relateddisasters and watching the pile of sandbags along the FDRDrive outside as the tidal surges along the East River growstronger. By that time  of course  most island nations in theForum would have disappeared and we would have failedutterly. Discussing emission reductions would be a hollowgesture by then.Even though our spirits are bolstered by theencouragement of our annex I Forum partners Australia andNew Zealand  the 14 Forum small island States grow wearyof calling attention to our special vulnerability to climatechange and to our status on the front line of potentialworldwide catastrophe. I would sincerely hope that by nowa great majority of people  not only in the United Nationssystem but from all across the globe  have a strong mentalpicture of the helpless situation of low-lying islands andcoastlines in the face of rising seas. We are very gratefulfor the considerable extent to which our pleas have beentaken into account  but while we may flatter ourselves thatwe have served  in a way  as a voice of conscience for theFramework Convention on Climate Change  we wish alsoto make positive contributions to its implementation.Thus  the emphasis of all Forum members now is toassure that we do our part to participate in and to advancethe considerable amount of work that must be done. TheSouth Pacific Regional Environmental Programmecontinues to serve our governments as a useful focal pointand to provide valuable expertise. Forum countries havelong been active in working to understand the potential ofthe Clean Development Mechanism for the region. TheRepublic of the Marshall Islands recently hosted animportant workshop on the Clean Development Mechanismthat was attended by more than 40 countries  and in June Australia and the Forum secretariat hosted a workshop inNadi.We are severely hampered  however  by the shortageof personnel and financial resources to maintain continuousparticipation in the host of ongoing activities. The UnitedNations and bilateral donors have been very generous insupporting our attendance at conferences  but the timedemands on our short-staffed officials at home and abroadcan be overwhelming  considering other growing concernssuch as biodiversity  the oceans and coral reefs.I know that this problem is by no means unique toForum island countries  nor even to small developingcountries as a group. But for us  as well as for manyothers  we ask that these limitations should not bedisregarded by larger countries and organizations in themanagement of the international agenda. Once again  weexpress sincere appreciation for the support of donors thathave made our participation possible. In addition  wewould emphasize the importance of applying acoordinated approach to scheduling in order to facilitatethe participation of small delegations that would not wishto be marginalized by overlapping meetings on topics ofcritical concern to us.Finally  another topic of concern for the Forum atthe next annual meeting will be the continuing shipmentby industrialized Powers of plutonium and radioactivewastes through our region. Forum nations haveconsistently expressed their concerns on this issue especially about liability and compensation arrangementsin the event of an accident. From 16 to 17 September thisyear  discussions took place in Suva between the legalexperts of the Forum countries and the representatives ofFrance  Japan and the United Kingdom concerning trans-shipments of nuclear materials through the region. Thismeeting was arranged by the Forum secretariat  in linewith the 1998 Forum Communiqué. We are encouragedby this development and strongly urge the representativesof the three shipping States to demonstrate their readinessto explore innovative ways to address the concerns ofForum members: there is more at stake than the well-being and comfort of the larger populations in the North.Putting this disregard for the sovereign interests ofForum countries to one side for a moment  the PacificOcean is a vital breadbasket for the entire planet: anyaccident will have serious and adverse implications farbeyond our shores for generations to come.Forum countries have derived some encouragementfrom the decision by France  Japan and the UnitedKingdom to consult with Forum members regardingsafety and compensation arrangements for the most recentshipment of mixed oxide fuel from Europe to Japan. Weare further encouraged by the decision of the threeshipping States to provide information on the shippingroutes of the two ships carrying the fuel  consistent with16the rigorous safety and security obligations with which theymust comply under the international conventions governingtransport of nuclear materials  including the Convention onthe Physical Protection of Nuclear Materials.We  the Forum countries  earnestly hope to makesome inroads  not only in the immediate situation but  moreimportantly  in the long run  into the ethical consciences ofthe developed nations. Since time immemorial they haveregarded our region as a convenient area for any kind ofdangerous or undesirable activity that serves their interestsat home. With the welcome admission to this body of threemore of our number  we are now numerous enough in thisforum to assert forcefully that we wish no further invasionto place our peoples at risk  irrespective of the reasonsothers may have for choosing to disregard our concerns.I have by no means touched on every topic of concernthat is to be discussed at the next Forum meeting.Following that meeting  as I stated earlier  the completeCommuniqué will be submitted to this body  and Icommend it to all delegations.The views I have expressed on behalf of the SouthPacific Forum are  of course  fully embraced by mycountry  the Federated States of Micronesia. I would likenow to address other issues  speaking only for my ownsmall island developing State.Since 1991  when the Federated States of Micronesiawas admitted to membership in this body  we haveexperienced — from the viewpoint of a developing countryand particularly as a small island developing State — atruly unique decade in multilateral relations. We emergedon the international scene just in time to become a part ofthe movement that radically changed previous notions aboutdevelopment  namely the Rio process. The timing could nothave been better for us. Just as we took up the task offormulating our own agenda for the future of our islandnation  the world as a whole came to recognize that theissues of environment and development are not opposedbut  rather  are intertwined. We thus incorporated into ourdevelopment planning from the outset a mandate not justfor development  but for sustainable development.We feel fortunate in this regard and in how theprinciple of sustainability is fully integral to our activities for  while we are deeply appreciative of the concerns thatother nations have shown for the difficulties faced by smallisland States like ourselves  and while we remain anxiousfor the further implementation of the Barbados Programmeof Action  we realize that the action referred to must be first and foremost  our own. We ourselves must be veryserious not only in recognizing our special developmentobstacles but in instituting and carrying out programmesto overcome them in a sustainable way. And this must bedone  not as a temporary  short-term or even medium-term proposition  but as a way of life for generations tocome.No amount of outside assistance can providesustainable development. As small-island countries  wemust individually and collectively commit ourselves tostaying the course once we have seen it and possess themeans to navigate it. Without that commitment  our sailswill never fill and we will remain adrift on a journey thatcan only come to a sad end.As a new member of the international community we have been faced with the need to rapidly becomefamiliar with the dynamics of multilateral interactionwithin the United Nations system while at the same timetrying to acquire a practical working knowledge of thevarious simultaneous processes. But there is noapprenticeship here at the United Nations.From the outset  it has been our full responsibility toparticipate  on a basis of equality  in the ongoing work ofnumerous bodies directly integral to the United Nations orrelated to it. It has been  and continues to be  ademanding experience  but inasmuch as we have learnedabout others  we are also learning more about ourselvesand moving towards greater maturity as a nation.We have also developed a deep appreciation for theoften unheralded but vital work of translating globalproblems into solutions that is pursued faithfully by thethousands of administrative and diplomatic members ofthe United Nations family. It is difficult to conceive of afuture in which the nations of our ever-shrinking planetwill not have a forum such as this — the United Nations.Yet one cannot help but be uneasy on hearingwhispers of discouragement as the United Nations ischallenged by issues that seem to grow in number andcomplexity. We sometimes hear that perhaps theOrganization has outlived its usefulness and hasinadequate capacity to deal with global crises in the areasof security  social justice and the environment. Some aresaid to feel that other  more sharply focused bodies wouldbe better suited to dealing with the anticipated crises ofthe new millennium.17Without question  the effective responsiveness of thisOrganization is constantly being challenged. But this is nota sign of failure  nor of a lack of capacity. Neither does itsuggest that we need another instrument. It is  rather  anindication of the growing interconnectedness of the globalcommunity  and of the growing inclination among nationsto find and recognize their common interests and to worktogether to advance global peace and harmony.In order to maintain and improve the responsivenessof the United Nations in a world of increasing demands andchallenges  it is necessary that we continually evolve andadapt effectively in our pursuit of the ideals of the Charterof this Organization. Only in this way can we keep theOrganization on a positive course and faithfully translatethe mandates of the Charter into terms of continuingrelevance. This is the attitude with which we must approachreform. It is not a consequence of inadequacy  which theword “reform” may suggest  but  rather  it is a positive andevolutionary process.This is easily said  but  as we all know  it is verydifficult to put into practice. Even so  we must not allowthat high degree of difficulty to plunge us into frustrationand defeat. The great achievements of those who havecome before us in the last 54 years must be honoured byour unshakable determination to take the United Nationsseriously into the next millennium as the single mosteffective multilateral instrument for the betterment ofhumankind.If the United Nations is to maintain and even improveits capacity to deal with major issues and improve the lotof disadvantaged peoples  I respectfully suggest that thereis a need for broader incorporation of developing countriesin the decision-making process. More and more  it seems a relatively small group of developed countries are seen onthe front lines here and in other related international bodies.There is a perception that  despite the formal application ofthe rules  the substantive participation of developingcountries in dealing with world problems is in realitywaning rather than increasing. This does not bode well forthe future of international relations. As the trend towardsglobalization continues to strengthen  this body as a wholewill need to be more involved in making importantdecisions — not a permanent 5  not a G-7  but a “G-188”.Probably the single most urgently needed reform is theenlargement of the Security Council. Naturally  such animportant step must not be taken in haste  but by this timewe should be closer to finding an acceptable formulation.The plain fact is that the openness of the most powerfulnations to accept rational and realistic change in theSecurity Council is a key indicator of the future of globalmultilateral relations in general  and of this Organizationin particular. The impact of success with this issue wouldbe felt in positive ways throughout the United NationsOrganization  and it would stimulate renewed confidencein the Charter. That result alone is badly needed andshould itself inspire greater effort to overcome thedifficulties ahead.It would be unrealistic to ignore the inevitability ofthe fact that larger  more powerful nations will most oftentake the lead in the United Nations. In fact  they shoulddo so as a matter of responsibility; they possess theresources and the capacity. However  leadership shouldnot become domination  and it should not leave thedeveloping world marginalized. I therefore emphasize theneed for a restructured Security Council. I also visualizea General Assembly that remains in the forefront ofglobal decision-making  for real outcomes on real issues.Being from a Pacific island nation  I naturally haveparticular concerns about our region. Without demeaningin any way the considerable attention that we do receive I must say that the Pacific islands region often takes aback seat in the councils of the greater Powers  which areprone to include only the Pacific rim countries amongtheir primary concerns. This can be understood  given oursmall populations and land masses  which only underscoreour remoteness in the vast Pacific Ocean.But it should not be forgotten that we Pacificislanders are custodians of some of the world's greatestuntapped wealth. In the coming millennium  our region iscertain to play a greater role than ever before in meetingthe needs of the rest of the world for food and mineralresources. If these resources are to be conserved in theproper way and harvested in a sustainable manner  thepeoples of the Pacific islands must be dealt with fairly and on a basis of partnership with the developed world.And the time to start is now.The growing global involvement with and relianceupon the tremendous resource base in our region mustrest on a foundation of regional security. Nowhere isthere a better example of the need for comprehensivesecurity in the modern sense  extending beyond militaryconsiderations and also including economic  social andenvironmental security.This leads me to the present need for properstewardship of the oceans and seas throughout the world.18This subject was recently discussed in depth by theCommission on Sustainable Development  and it is on ouragenda at this session. I want to emphasize that theFederated States of Micronesia solidly supports thepositions expressed by the Alliance of Small Island Stateson this subject. We believe that oceans and seas present aspecial  even crucial  case for international cooperation andcoordination  and that the General Assembly is theappropriate body to provide this oversight. Indeed  it wasmandated to do so by Agenda 21.Furthermore  the United Nations Convention on theLaw of the Sea provides the framework for action in thisarea. We thus have existing structures; there is no need tocreate new institutions. We believe that the size of the taskwill require continuing effort on an annual basis  so that anongoing working-group format within the context ofpreparations for each annual General Assembly will bemore rewarding than a large  one-time conference. Aboveall  the process must seek the widest possible input drawing upon expertise at the regional level  and providingassistance to ensure the participation of developingcountries  especially small island States.In these brief moments it is not possible to express allour views on all the matters we deem important. Ofnecessity  therefore  I must leave much to the work of ourrepresentatives in the Committees here and in other UnitedNations organs throughout the year.I wish  however  to plead with this body for auniversal awakening to the single most important reality ofour lives today. This reality is that all our interests becomemore closely linked with each passing generation. We areall responsible for turning back the consequences of ourpast selfish behaviour. The destruction of war  the improperstewardship of our natural resources and the pollution ofour living space are looming global disasters. Combined they will overwhelm the Earth's population unless we findcommon ground and take action.That common ground exists. It exists here. It does notask us to surrender our nationhood or our cultures. It is theCharter of the United Nations  a visionary document thathas guided our troubled world through the faltering steps ofincreasing multilateral awareness  and today provides aformat for our very survival. God grant that we will havethe political will to sustain it."
"59",2494,"GAB",54,1999,"I am pleased to conveyto the President on behalf of the delegation of Gabon  ourwarmest congratulations on his well-deserved election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourthsession. In addition to the tribute his election pays toNamibia  it is eloquent testimony to both his personal andprofessional qualities. We hardly need to point out that hewas one of the principal architects of Namibia'sindependence. Today  the President has the honour ofpresiding over the last Assembly session of the century andof leading the United Nations towards the new millennium.Allow me through you to assure him of my delegation'scomplete and wholehearted cooperation.To his predecessor  Mr. Didier Opertti  Minister forForeign Affairs of Uruguay  I extend my deepest gratitudefor the work accomplished during his term of office.I congratulate the Secretary-General for his initiativesand actions towards peace and security worldwide.To the three new Member States  the Republic ofKiribati  the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga which have just joined the great United Nations family  Iconvey my warmest congratulations.I am convinced that this session will enable us toshare our thoughts on the increasingly complex challengesthat our Organization must face if it is to create thenecessary conditions for the maintenance of internationalpeace and security and for economic and socialdevelopment.We are entering a major period of transition markedby the end of one century and the beginning of another so it is beyond necessary for the international communityto see to it that the new millennium is spared the scourgesthat sap humankind's strength.During this century that is now coming to its end the world has undergone a rapid acceleration in the paceof history and a thorough transformation as a result ofcombined effects of the explosion in the numbers of newtechnologies  the expansion of trade and the breathtakingincrease in the role played by markets. The scale of thistransformation  which affects all aspects of people's lives is today so great that no nation can escape its influence.Unfortunately  nations are not all in the same boat:some steadily accumulate progress and prosperity whileothers seem destined to a bottomless pit of destitution. Iam thinking here specifically about the African countrieswhich  unlike the rest of the world  have not yet takenadvantage of the profound changes in the world  andwhose access to the so often trumpeted shared prosperityis denied. I am thinking also about one and a half billionmen and women around the world who live on less thana dollar a day  and the billion adults who can neither readnor write. I am thinking too about the 300 millionAfricans who eke out their lives in a state of abjectpoverty on the outer margins of the global village.Add to this bleak picture the heavy burden of debt which is strangling our economies  compromising anyattempt at development and reducing us to the level ofmodern-day slaves at the tender mercy of our creditors.The budgetary resources allocated to service externaldebt overwhelm all efforts to meet the most basic needsof our people. It is therefore crucial that the recurringproblem of debt should be considered not only in termsof socio-economic indicators but also taking into accounta State's efforts to combat poverty.While welcoming the recent initiative undertaken atCologne by the Group of Seven and Russia with a viewto cancelling the debt of the most heavily indebtedcountries  the Government of Gabon is neverthelessdisappointed by the fact that the eligibility criteria forthose countries are so restrictive; for it must be recalledthat debt  like poverty  is a constant threat to the stability22of States. Therefore  the burning question of globalproportions that we must all face is how to take advantage both individually and collectively  of the current prodigiousglobal prosperity and the enormous accumulation of wealthcreated by globalization in order to substantially reduce thepoverty of nations and of their people.As the Minister Fischer of Germany said recently “Africa must not be a loser in globalization. Therich countries of the North have not only a duty  butalso an interest  in assisting their poorest neighboursin the southern hemisphere to seize the opportunitiesthat globalization offers them and to allow them toparticipate more equitably in the global economy”.My country feels that the time has come for theinternational community to seriously tackle the unavoidableproblem of the eradication of poverty  at least in its mostextreme form. We share the firm conviction that ourOrganization must promote  in the words of the Charter “higher standards of living  full employment  andconditions of economic and social progress anddevelopment”.This would be the first step towards eliminating theimbalances that are among the underlying causes of manyconflicts around the world  for a world in which some makeprogress while others fall behind carries within it the seedsof its own instability. Can we therefore move towards anew concept of the idea of security that no longer focuseson the security of nations alone  but that focuses above allon the well-being of peoples? The sine qua non conditionfor sparing future generations from the scourge of war is tomove from a culture of war towards a culture of peace.There are genuine reasons to be concerned about peaceand stability in the world. Maintaining international peaceand security  a task assigned to our Organization  has beenseverely put to the test by the outbreak and persistence ofa number of crises. In this regard  Africa has become themain theatre of these devastating crises  which result incountless victims  refugees and displaced persons.In spite of this regrettable situation  we have seensome encouraging signs concerning the restoration of peacein certain African subregions. The recent signing of thepeace Agreement by all the parties to the conflict in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  including all the rebelmovements  now opens up the way for a lasting settlementof the conflict. We urge all the parties to translate intoaction the will they expressed in signing the LusakaAgreement on 10 July 1999. It is now urgent for theinternational community  and for the Security Council inparticular  to take the necessary steps for the fullimplementation of the Agreement without delay.In the neighbouring Republic of the Congo  theauthorities have again recently expressed their willingnessto engage in dialogue with the opposition. In return  theopposition has also made clear its intention to take part inan inter-Congolese dialogue in order to achieve lastingpeace.The recent Lomé Agreement on Sierra Leone is alsoa positive sign of a return of lasting peace to that country.My country is pleased with the resumption of thepeace process in the Middle East and urges the completeapplication of the Wye Plantation agreements  as well asfull compliance with the agreements signed in the past.Despite all of this progress  we cannot overlook thefact that important efforts still have to made in Angola asa result of UNITA's refusal to implement the Lusakaagreements.Likewise  despite the prospects that are beginning toappear  the border dispute between Ethiopia and Eritreastill remains a burning issue.According to the most recent report of the Secretary-General  Somalia is  unfortunately  still without Stateinstitutions. The time has come to reintegrate that countryinto the concert of nations.Guaranteeing lasting peace and security is today acollective matter. Although the primary responsibility forthe maintenance of peace falls to the Security Council  itis appropriate for the United Nations to encourage thedevelopment of regional peacekeeping and securitymechanisms  in accordance with Chapter VIII of theCharter. Significant progress has been made in CentralAfrica in preventing and managing conflicts within theframework of the United Nations Standing AdvisoryCommittee on Security Questions in Central Africa. Theimplementation of the early-warning mechanism and thecreation of the high council for peace and security inCentral Africa are perfect examples of this.It is also worth mentioning the joint militaryexercises to be held by the member States of theCommittee in Gabon during the first half of the year 200023to simulate peacekeeping operations. Furthermore  inpreparation for the military exercises that will be held inGabon within the framework of strengthening Africanpeacekeeping capabilities  a military-diplomatic seminartook place in Libreville in June 1999  with the participationof 51 countries and international organizations.In the last few weeks  the Security Council has heldpublic debates on such vital topics as children and civiliansin armed conflicts. And five days ago  I had the honour ofparticipating in another public debate of the SecurityCouncil on small weapons. This matter is part of the UnitedNations efforts to work towards complete disarmament.Indeed  the illegal circulation of massive quantities of lightand small-calibre weapons in the world hampersdevelopment and represents a real threat to internationalpeace and security. The nature of these weaponsunfortunately helps fuel the sad and widely condemnedphenomenon of the use of children as combatants in themany conflicts that break out around the world. The sameapplies to large-scale banditry.In any case  we cannot envision a world at peace ifthe international community does not actively mobilize tohelp developing countries emerge from the vicious circle ofunderdevelopment-violence-underdevelopment. If luck hasheretofore spared us from the horrors of war  Gabon is notimmune to the backlash of the armed conflicts that plaguesome of our neighbours. As Security Council resolution1208 (1998) clearly indicates  asylum countries pay a heavyprice for their solidarity with people driven out of theirhomes as a result of combat. The consequences of refugeeflows on the security  environment and economies of hostcountries are sometimes incalculable  especially when thepresence of combatants among the refugees is used as anexcuse for troops to carry out raids in the host country.Even though we live in peace and have neverexperienced a domestic or inter-State war  Gabonnevertheless shoulders its share of the burdens of war. Weare facing massive migratory flows that are leading toserious internal upheavals  and we recently welcomed some50 000 refugees.Given the extent of the situation  for which mycountry was not prepared  the President of the Republic ofGabon organized on 11 August last a mini-summit inLibreville with the participation of a number of his peersfrom the subregion. That summit considered the possibilityof Africans' taking greater control of the question ofrefugees and displaced persons  with the support of theinternational community.On that occasion  President Bongo proposed thecreation of an African agency for emergency humanitarianintervention. I would urgently appeal to the internationalcommunity to provide greater assistance to Africanrefugees. We strongly hope that an emergency programmecan be set up that would relieve their suffering andfacilitate their return to their country of origin. Theinternational community has the means to do so  as it hasproved in other situations.I would like to take advantage of this opportunity topay warm tribute to Mrs. Sadako Ogata  United NationsHigh Commissioner for Refugees  who  during theinternational action taken in favour of Kosovo  heightenedthe international community's awareness of the particularsituation of African refugees.Let me now tackle the question of development fromthe perspective of my country's experience. As in otherAfrican countries  the socio-economic situation of Gabonis precarious. I shall not then resort to clichés such assaying that my country is an “African emirate” because ofour potential in raw materials  to the extent that today weare the only sub-Saharan nation to be classified byinternational financial and monetary institutions as anupper-middle-income country. As a result  we are deniedaccess to flexible conditions for our loans and for ourdebt service.However  the Human Development Index  whichplaces us in 124th place  clearly shows that Gabon is ina very similar situation to that of other African countries.That is why we have undertaken all of the necessarystructural reforms to join the global economy and toparticipate in subregional and regional integration. Wehave liberalized our economy by lifting tariff and non-tariff barriers and restrictions as well as by institutingcustoms and tax reform. We have privatized our principalsemi-public corporations in order to make them moreeffective and competitive. We have created a newjuridical and institutional environment that is stable andwill encourage investment and promote the expansion ofthe private sector. Finally  we have set up effectiveprovisions for cooperation and regional integration in theframework of the Economic and Monetary Community ofCentral Africa and of the Economic Community ofCentral African States.The stage has been set  but the actors — meaningthe investors — have not yet made their entrance. Foreigndirect investment has thus far systematically avoided ourcontinent.24We feel  however  that the world economy stands togain by taking advantage of the immense potential of theAfrican market  which will soon have a billion consumersin a continent that is overflowing with oil  gold  diamondsand other raw materials required by industries of the North.My country's leadership is dedicated to the promotionof democracy and the institutions that guarantee it— henceall of the political changes we have experienced and areexperiencing  which have made Gabon an example of asmooth transition from a single-party regime to politicalpluralism.It is against this backdrop that recently  in thepresence of international observers and for the second timesince the advent of political pluralism  free and fairpresidential elections were held in my country. ThePresident of the Republic  El Hadj Omar Bongo  was re-elected in a peaceful social and political context  aguarantee of democratic legitimacy.Democracy which is accompanied by goodgovernance  the rule of law and respect for human rights isthe most important factor in the transition towards a cultureof peace. For lasting peace is a prerequisite for the exerciseof all the rights and obligations of peoples  and it is theonly soil in which democracy and development can takeroot.It is therefore up to the United Nations system and itsMember States to ensure that these goals and principles  sodear to us  become a reality for all in the new millennium."
"60",2541,"GBR",54,1999,"It is just over half acentury since the then British Prime Minister  ClementAttlee  presented the Charter of the United Nations to ourParliament. He told our Parliament:“We are seeking not merely good relationsbetween nations but between the human beingswithin nations”.The concept he saw expressed in the Charter of the UnitedNations was revolutionary. That responsibility for thesecurity  freedom and development of people does notbelong solely to each State acting individually  but to allnations of the world acting as a united body.Over the past 50 years  the United Nations has donemuch to discharge that responsibility. The United Nationsand its agencies have led programmes around the world thathave released the potential of individual human beings onevery continent. We have helped double the literacy rateamong women in developing countries. We have helpedimmunize 80 per cent of the world's children against someof the most lethal diseases. We have established theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights as the benchmarkfor freedom for individuals. And this General Assemblyplayed a leading role in insisting on equal democraticrights  regardless of race  and in forcing an end toapartheid. Today the United Nations provides shelter andsanctuary to refugees in every corner of the world.As we meet this week  United Nations agenciesprovide homes  food  welfare  health and education to 19million refugees — more than the population of mostMember States. We should take pride in theseachievements  because it will help give us the confidenceto tackle the challenges that remain.But we must also be frank about where we havefailed. We have failed to deliver peace to many of thepeoples of the world. We have not realized the vision ofour founders  of nations and peoples within them livingin peace with each other. We have averted world war. Butwe have not averted a world with too much war.That is why I want to support the excellent openingaddress by our Secretary-General by focusing my remarksalso on what we must do if we are to replace failure tohalt war with success in preventing conflict. Theharrowing scenes we have witnessed this past year fromKosovo  from Sierra Leone  from East Timor and toomany other places underline the urgency of improving ourperformance in preventing conflicts and also in stoppingthem once they have started.I propose five priority areas for action. First  wemust tackle the root causes of conflict  starting with thepoverty that breeds it. War is becoming a poor man'sburden. In the modern world  wealthy nations no longerexperience the trauma of conflict on their soil. Thesoundest basis for peace is prosperity  and the best waywe can prevent conflict is by promoting sustainabledevelopment. The forthcoming Millennium Assemblymust make a reality of the commitment to halving theproportion of people in extreme poverty and reducing thenumber of nations in heavy debt.Secondly  we must promote human rights and goodgovernance. Development of a nation will be more rapidwhere people have the right to develop their full potential.Conflict is more likely where governments rule withoutthe consent of their people.Thirdly  we must curb the supply of weapons thatfuel conflict. For decades  the United Nations  rightly  hasfocused on halting the spread of weapons of massdestruction. Yet in truth  in those same decades  theweapons that have killed masses in conflicts have beenthe most common of small arms. In Friday's debate in theSecurity Council  we will have the opportunity to takeforward action to halt the illegal trade in small arms  topromote regional moratoriums on small arms and to limitarsenals of military firearms to legitimate Governmentagencies.34Fourthly  we must stop the illegal trade in diamondsand other precious commodities which pay for the smallarms — and all too often the mercenaries — which sustainconflict. The markets for these commodities  especially themarket in diamonds  are small and tightly located in a fewcentres. We must encourage cooperation with those whomanage those markets to cut off the supply of funds tothose who are promoting conflict.Lastly  I strongly endorse the view expressed by ourSecretary-General this morning that we must counter theculture of impunity. Those who break internationalhumanitarian law  from Kosovo to East Timor  must knowthat they will be held to account by the internationalcommunity.The international criminal tribunals have shown whatcan be done. We must build on their work by getting apermanent international criminal court up and running withall speed.But we will not always succeed in preventing conflict.We need  therefore  to be better equipped to restore peacewhen war breaks out. As my Prime Minister  Tony Blair said in Chicago earlier this year  working out the conditionsand identifying the circumstances when it is right in themodern world to intervene is the most pressing problem inforeign policy today. His speech demonstrated that Britainis anxious to play its full part in that debate. Our startingpoint is that our common interest in preserving the worldfrom major conflict is greater than our individual interestsas nations.Globalization is the long and rather ugly term whichis used to describe how in today’s world we areinterdependent with each other rather than independent ofeach other. We are bound together by our strengtheninglinks in trade and investment  in travel and communication.What happens in one country can have a direct impact onthe prosperity and the security — even the climate — ofcountries on the other side of the world.And we are also bound together by the consequencesof conflict. In Britain 90 per cent of the heroin on thestreets of our big cities is grown in Afghanistan undercover of the generation-long conflict in that land. In centralAfrica  the upheavals of population sparked by the massgenocide in Rwanda have destabilized the region andcaught up half a dozen countries in the conflicts that haveensued. Across the countries of Europe there are nowseveral hundred thousands of citizens of the formerYugoslavia who have fled to seek sanctuary from therepeated conflicts there. Just as few nations can standalone in the modern world  there are now few majorconflicts which remain only an internal matter with noimpact on the rest of the world.If we are to respond adequately when conflictbreaks out  then the United Nations needs to developthree strengths — credibility  consensus and capacity.If the United Nations is to have the credibility topress the parties to a conflict to a solution  it must bemore representative of the modern world. A smallincrease in the size of the Security Council would be amodest price to pay for the big increase in its credibilitywhich would come from a more representative permanentmembership.But greater credibility would be pointless withoutconsensus on when the authority of the United Nationsshould be invoked. Intervention must always be a lastresort. We can all agree that the first responsibility forreconciling internal conflict rests with the State in whichthat conflict arises. But we also have a sharedresponsibility to act when we are confronted withgenocide  mass displacement of people or major breachesof humanitarian law. To know that such atrocities arebeing committed and not to act against them is to makeus complicit in them. And to be passive in the face ofsuch events is to make it more likely that they will berepeated.Credibility  though  also requires us to demonstratenot just the consensus  but also the capacity  to act. Weoften hear demands that the United Nations should dosomething. Let us be honest — the United Nations isnothing more than the aggregate of its Member States.The United Nations cannot do something except when we its Member States  are prepared to provide the means.We need to ensure that the United Nations has asound financial base  which requires all of us to meet ourassessed contributions in full  on time. But we must alsoensure that when peacekeeping forces are required  theyare made available. Britain has signed a standbyagreement earmarking forces we are prepared in principleto provide for emergency peacekeeping work. Suchagreements enable the United Nations to plan foremergencies with greater confidence that we can rapidlyput in the field the right skills  with the necessaryequipment. A score of other Member States have signedsimilar agreements. The more of us that do so  the greater35will be the capacity of the United Nations in brokering abasis for peacekeeping deployment.But in Kosovo we discovered that it was less difficultto put together an armed force to end the military violencethan to assemble a United Nations police force to keep civilorder. Today  therefore  I can announce that Britain willfollow up our standby agreement with the United Nationson troops with a similar agreement increasing the numberof United Kingdom police officers available for UnitedNations troops. This will include a commitment to a rapidresponse squad  ready for deployment at short notice whenit is urgently needed. We shall also be establishing with theUnited Nations a flagship training course in Britain to trainpolice from around the world to play their part in our jointmissions.I am conscious that the agenda I have set out is anambitious one. But  in all humility  I have to say that it isless ambitious than the visionary programme set out half acentury ago by the founders of the United Nations. As ourSecretary-General said earlier this year  unless we can unitearound the aim of confronting massive human rightsviolations  against crimes against humanity  then we willbetray the very ideals of our founders.In the modern world in which we live — the modernworld of satellite communications — we know instantlywhen such violations are taking place. We have theresources and the mobility to move our assets quickly in anemergency. Modern technology has made all of us eachother’s neighbours. We now need to match that technologywith an international doctrine that also reflects the modernworld. And it must be founded on the clear principle thatthe only war we agree to wage is one in which our nationsare united in combating conflict."
"61",2565,"GEO",54,1999,"I have stoodupon this platform on many occasions  and I wellremember every speech I have given here since 1985.This is perhaps because  first  I cannot conceive of anyloftier rostrum in the world and  secondly  because mypersonal political fate has always brought me here attimes of great change. My most recent appearance beforethe General Assembly was in 1992  when I was alreadyHead of State of my country  Georgia. That  too  was amoment filled with drama — one in which a new independent State was going through a painful birthprocess.Today  I am with the Assembly at the end of astormy century  one which I would call the century offreedom. That is not because freedom has become auniversal norm of life — regrettably  that is not yet thecase — but  rather  because the concept of freedom hasassumed pre-eminence on the scale of political values andalso because it was  indeed  in our century that the worstenemies of freedom and democracy were defeated.Perhaps the most unanticipated and important of theseevents was the demise of the Soviet empire  which19brought about the end of the cold war  the bipolar worldand the post-war world order.The collapse of empires follows a more or less similarpattern. Initially  centrifugal forces triumph  but laterphantom pains for the lost territories begin to be felt in themetropolis and attempts are made to recentralize the formerimperial space.Yet historical experience demonstrates that designs torestore an empire inevitably remain the unfulfilled dream ofimperial reactionaries. History cannot be turned back.However  in the arsenal of today’s reactionaries thereremains still one chance to partially  if not completely return to past ways — by maintaining spheres of influenceover the territories of the former empire. Here I do notmean spheres of interest  including strategic interests.Harmonizing interests in a civilized way is a normalinternational practice. The concept of spheres of influence however  particularly within the context of globalization represents an anachronism.But let me return to the demise of the cold war andthe bipolar world. As someone who happened to participatein this process  I think an explanation is in order sincedebate on how and why it all happened continues to thisday.I do not deny that the reasons for the end of the coldwar were many and complex. Yet I want to especiallystress the role of the new thinking  which was conceivedeven before perestroika. I am certain that no drawn-outeconomic hardships  not even any “Star Wars project” would have compelled the socialist camp to democratizewithin  or to take radical steps in the international arena toovercome the confrontation  if instead of MikhailGorbachev and his team  leaders who possessed the oldmentality had remained at the helm of the Soviet ship ofstate.Since I have mentioned Mikhail Gorbachev  I mustsend to him  a man who is an outstanding figure of ourtime  condolences for the death of his spouse  RaisaGorbachev.The new thinking of that period contained manyelements  but we can generally describe it as a conceptdesigned to make all spheres of political and public lifemore human.In international relations  this implied  first andforemost  replacing the class-based ideological approachwith ethically motivated decisions  in line with universalvalues. Only due to this new approach were the countriesof the Soviet space and Eastern Europe able to make theirdemocratic choices with relatively little pain. Without thenew thinking it would have been difficult to conceive ofthe withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan or thattruly epochal event  the fall of the Berlin Wall  thesubsequent reunification of Germany and the liberation ofEastern Europe.The old found it difficult to come to terms with thenew. The two could not exist harmoniously together.Moreover  not everyone accepted the idea of replacing theclass-based approach with the primacy of universalvalues. I remember that when I first expressed thisconcept to the Soviet diplomatic corps  it spawnedaggressive clashes of opinion and upheaval across theentire Soviet space.But has not this always been the case? Historically changes of this scale were always preceded by paradigmshifts in human thinking — that is  new thinking had tooccur first. This was the case in the sixteenth andseventeenth centuries  when a new world based onscientific thinking was emerging  and also in the epoch ofthe Enlightenment  during which the ideas of equality andhumanism gave birth to the theory and practice of ademocratic state.In the historical literature and memoirs dedicated tothe end of the cold war  one often finds references towinners and losers. It is erroneous to frame this mostcomplex event of global historical significance in suchsimplistic terms. For example  how can Russia beconsidered to have been “defeated” when it set forth theexample to other peoples by creating its own independentState? One might ask the same about other States whichbelonged to the so-called socialist camp and today areindependent democracies.Credit for the victory over the cold war equallybelongs to the representatives of the former opposingcamps who had in common the new thinking and acommitment to the noble idea of saving mankind from anuclear nightmare.If we talk of any loser at all  it was the old  stagnantthinking which was defeated  and a new common senseprevailed. Shifts in thinking should occur at every stageof human development. The end of the cold war is ahighly significant intellectual breakthrough of thetwentieth century.20The process of renovation of ideas is perennial.Stagnation is tantamount to backward motion. At thethreshold of the new millennium  it is necessary that weonce again develop a new thinking — new principles in therelationship between States and a new approach to commonproblems and threats.Today  nearly a decade after the Iron Curtain waslifted and the cold war came to an end  one often hearsscepticism expressed about this great liberal democraticrevolution of the twentieth century. “What has changed after all?” some ask. Indeed  it is high time that wethoroughly assessed what has happened and surveyed themyriad new opportunities that have presented themselves asa result of this tectonic shift  as well as the far-from-simpleproblems that up until now one would hardly ever thinkabout.My ancient country  Georgia  is one of those newlyindependent States which provide a good platform forobserving both the virtues and shortcomings of theprocesses under way in this new  post-bipolar world.Although the history of Georgian statehood stretchesback more than three millennia  the vicissitudes of historycaused us to have to begin building our nation State fromscratch once again in the last decade of this century. Thebeginning proved especially difficult. The utterincompetence and inexperience of its first post-communistleadership threw Georgia into conflict and civil war. Theresult was complete economic collapse and the loss of eventhose token signs of statehood that we had inherited fromthe Soviet system. Georgia in fact found itself isolated fromthe rest of the world. All this was accompanied by anunprecedented criminal rampage the eradication of whichtook several years.Georgia began to work its way out of this isolation inthe spring of 1992 when it became a member of the UnitedNations  the Organization for Security and Cooperation inEurope and the Black Sea Economic Cooperation and beganto actively forge diplomatic relations with its neighboursand more distant nations. In fact  it was during this difficultperiod that our country — its people and leadership —made its choice. Georgia would set forth on the waytowards building a free and democratic society based on asocially oriented market economy. Despite the seriousbarriers that continued to emerge along the way  Georgianever once departed from the course it set for itself.The principles and practice of the construction of ourdemocratic country did not go unnoticed by theinternational community. Under new conditions  when thebipolar confrontation was no more  internationalorganizations were given the opportunity for their actionsto span the entire globe  to help those States in need andto assist in their development. The United Nations  theInternational Monetary Fund  the World Bank  theEuropean Bank for Reconstruction and Development  theEuropean Union and particularly the United States Germany and Holland  as well as others  extended theirhelp to us.The year 1995 was indeed the turning point inGeorgia’s new era. With it came the adoption of a newdemocratic Constitution  as well as the holding of the firstparliamentary and presidential elections. In the same year we achieved financial stability and introduced a newnational currency. At the end of that year  for the firsttime in Georgia’s democratic development  growth ingross domestic product was recorded. Very importantlyalso  law and order prevailed in the country  and therampage of crime was finally curbed.It was in the same year  however  1995  that the firstblast thundered. It was a terrorist act targeting Georgia’shead of State. This barbaric act signalled to the world thatnot everyone found Georgia’s progress towardsdemocracy to their liking  especially if Georgia were tosucceed along the path of her choice.Recent years have demonstrated that the positivetrends in Georgia have become irreversible. From 1996 to1997  the annual economic growth was around 11 percent  the exchange rate was stable and inflation continuedto decline.No less significant was the progress made inbuilding democratic institutions and putting in place andenforcing the legal framework for a civil society. In thisrespect  it is no exaggeration to say that Georgia hastravelled in several short years a distance that oftenrequires decades. I am happy to say that as Georgiacontinues to improve its democratic institutions anddevelop its economy we are becoming a partner to othersrather than merely a recipient of international aid. This islargely made possible through the new function that mycountry has been establishing for itself over the past fewyears.For many decades the fuel-rich countries of theCaspian region and Central Asia were cut off from therest of the world by impermeable walls. Now they havebegun to seek alternative routes to deliver their wealth to21the world market. The south Caucasus  especially Georgia with its outlets to the Black Sea  has a pivotal location onthe route along which cargoes are already being shippedbetween east and west and between north and south. SinceApril this year  oil has been flowing westward across theterritory of Georgia via the new Baku-Supsa pipeline. Inancient times  Georgia was part of the great Silk Road. Thisfunction is reviving along with that vast highway that inancient times traversed the continents  bridging peoples andpromoting the diffusion of cultures and the exchange ofideas. I am referring to the great Eurasian space andrelevant transport routes.International organizations and individual countrieshave shown great interest in the idea of a rebirth of thegreat Silk Road. The European Union initiated theTRACECA and INOGATE projects  under which theconstruction of the transport infrastructure is funded andmultiple alternative networks of oil and gas pipelines arebeing elaborated. The United States Senate recently adoptedthe Silk Road strategy support bill  introduced by SenatorBrownbeck  which envisages providing assistance to thesouth Caucasus and Central Asian States to strengthenindependence and democratic development  as well as tobuild a transport infrastructure that will include multiple oiland gas pipelines. In addition  the Japanese Government hasdeveloped a strategy for the new Silk Road. China andother States are also participating in the realization of thisproject. The countries of south Caucasus — Azerbaijan Armenia and Georgia — signed partnership and cooperationagreements with the European Union that entered into forcein June of this year. As for Georgia’s progress in buildinga democratic society based on the rule of law and respectfor human rights  its accomplishments have been recognizedby the Council of Europe  of which Georgia became a full-fledged member earlier this year.As I said earlier  the modest successes we haveenjoyed on the way towards independent development —that is  our participation in projects of global significanceand our aspiration to integrate with international  regionaland Euro-Atlantic institutions — have irritated and continueto irritate the reactionary forces that are scattered across theentire territory of the former Soviet Union  where they posea serious threat to democratic regimes in the new States including Russia.The terrorist blast of 1995 was not an isolatedincident. It was followed by other provocations and terroristacts  which included another attempt on the President’s life.Will these attempts to force Georgia’s deviation from itschosen path continue? We cannot rule this out  sincegeopolitical shifts of this scale never proceed smoothly.The enemies of our country use the entire arsenal at theirdisposal  including buying politicians and even votes  inattempting to bring to power a regime that is more totheir liking.In the current conditions of globalization andincreased interdependence  no country is immune to thecontagion of economic crisis. Last year independentGeorgia experienced first hand the repercussions of thenegative global economic situation  especially when thefinancial crisis erupted in neighbouring Russia  whichcontinues to play a major part in Georgia’s foreign tradeoperations. Today we can claim with reasonableconfidence that Georgia’s young market economy andbanking system passed this test worthily  and internationalorganizations and friendly countries made majorcontributions to our ability to survive.Unresolved conflicts and our violated territorialintegrity remain Georgia’s most painful problem — inother words  the very problem which is among the seriesof new threats that the international community hasshown itself unprepared to deal with. As a result of thecampaign of genocide and ethnic cleansing conducted byAbkhaz separatists  with external military support  manycivilians of Georgian and other ethnic extractions havebeen killed  and nearly 300 000 people have beendisplaced. Despite the aid that our Government  the Officeof the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugeesand other organizations provide  these innocent victimscontinue to live in conditions of extreme deprivation.These severely traumatized people  who have beensubjected to inhuman brutalities  demand protection oftheir most inalienable right: the right to live in their ownhomes. It is unfortunate that  unlike the confrontation inthe Balkans  the Abkhaz conflict has been given noexposure on world television screens  and therefore theinternational community has little awareness of it. Havingseen with my own eyes the brutalities committed there  Ihave no doubt whatsoever that people infected by thegerm of hatred lose their humanity and behave in thesame barbaric manner  be it in Kosovo  Rwanda orAbkhazia.It is difficult to believe what has happened. With thehelp of foreign regular army units and mercenaries  theAbkhaz  who originally constituted only 17 per cent ofthe population  expelled the majority just because theywere not Abkhaz  but Georgians  Armenians  Jews Russians  Greeks or other ethnicities. This was22accomplished alongside ethnically motivated summaryexecutions and mass killings.The involvement of international entities — the UnitedNations  the Organization for Security and Cooperation inEurope (OSCE)  the Russian Federation and the Group ofFriends of the Secretary-General — has so far failed toproduce tangible results. In my opinion  one of the reasonsfor the failure of all attempts to resolve this conflict is thatwhat has really happened in Abkhazia has not yet beenobjectively assessed at the level of the highest internationalbody — the Security Council  which the Charter mandatesto act as the guarantor of security in the world. Is it not alltoo obvious that it is impossible to fight evil if one does notcall it by its proper name — that is  if one does not assignan appropriate legal assessment to what has happened?The 21 United Nations resolutions on the conflict inAbkhazia  Georgia  do not provide such an unequivocalassessment  despite the fact that the final documents of theOSCE’s Budapest and Lisbon summits qualify the action ofthe leaders of the Abkhaz separatists as ethnic cleansing.Indeed  the sole objective of the separatist leadership encouraged by reactionary external forces  was to changethe demography of this autonomous republic. It is hard toimagine that a regime that has in fact attained its goal canbe convinced through mere request and persuasion to allowthe displaced to return.I do not want to be misunderstood. We do not thirstfor the blood of our Abkhaz brothers  nor do we seekvengeance. No  I am sure that in time Georgians andAbkhaz will dwell together in their historic homeland:Georgia. But in order to speed up the process of theGeorgian-Abkhaz reconciliation  the tragedy must be givenits fair legal assessment.It is no surprise that in a century in which the conceptof freedom has acquired such scope  human rightscommand special attention. Before Georgia was acceptedinto the Council of Europe  rapporteurs scrutinized ourhuman rights profile  examining how free the media were the conditions of prisoners — including the worstoffenders — and many other aspects of human rights. Weare grateful to the Council of Europe and other internationalbodies and non-governmental organizations for theirundiminished attention to this critical aspect of life in ourcountry  and for their unbiased assessments andrecommendations.Especially against the backdrop of such keen attentionto matters of human rights  I find it hard to understand theindifference of the international community to the fate ofthe 300 000 people currently displaced from Abkhazia andto the flagrant violation of their basic right to live in theirown homes. The matter is not whether or not help isbeing extended to these people. Of course  they wouldhave been in far more difficult straits had the UnitedNations and individual countries not provided relief. Butin terms of human rights the only response proportionateto their situation would be to assist them in restoring theirinalienable rights — that is  allowing them to return totheir homes and holding those who have violated theirrights responsible  if only by giving an appropriateassessment of the acts of the perpetrators of ethniccleansing. Unfortunately  little has been done to this end.Although expressing personal feelings is perhaps notappropriate from this podium  I find it difficult to repressmy emotions when talking of completely innocent peopleexpelled from their homes by brutal force fuelled bysimple hatred. My heart is heavy. I was involved in thecomplex processes that brought an end to the Cold War.I believed  as did my co-thinkers  that the future worldorder  liberated from the confrontations between camps would not permit injustice; that under the new conditions the United Nations and the Security Council  at thepinnacle of our world’s hierarchy  would be able toprevent individual assaults against civilized norms ofexistence.The Assembly can imagine how disillusioned I waswhen ethnic purging of the Georgian population occurred and  by the way  remaining unpunished within my owncountry. I addressed the Security Council twice with adetailed account and explanation of what happened  butno substantial progress has yet been made  even in theformulation of its resolutions. Having experienced thisdisappointment  I believe it should have come as nosurprise that I firmly supported the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization (NATO) operation in Kosovo  aimed atputting an end to ethnic cleansing  since I viewed thatoperation as the long-awaited manifestation of a firmstand against evil. At the same time  however  the actionin Kosovo must not be interpreted by anyone as evenindirect support of aggressive separatism. By no means.I have always believed that aggressive separatism andattempts to manipulate evolving democratic orders by useof force is one of the worst and most dangerous maladiesof modern times.Since the end of the cold war  during which thethreat of nuclear war hung over our heads like the swordof Damocles  while local conflicts  despite their true23causes  inevitably acquired an ideological tint  politicalanalysts have made extensive efforts to determine thenature of the virus causing today’s aggression and thecauses of possible future clashes. The theories areextremely interesting  and the debates as to how well theycorrespond to reality will doubtless continue for years tocome.On the other hand  from even a brief glance at today’sconflicts it is clear that virtually all of them are linked to anerroneous interpretation by ethnic minorities of the principleof self-determination  and to a likewise erroneousunderstanding by titular nations and their central authoritiesof minorities’ rights with respect to that principle. In otherwords  either aggressive separatism or no less aggressiveviolation of the rights of ethnic minorities  and in somecases both  underlie these conflicts.During such confrontations  a certain segment of thepopulation becomes undesirable to a group of politicaladventurists. This “foreign body” is then removed throughthe policy of “ethnic cleansing” and genocide. Today thereare hundreds of places in the world where some groups ofindividuals may come to entertain an ambition towards thismanner of self- determination and apply the well tried —and  regrettably  in many cases successful — method which I would call the method of demographic engineering.It is not difficult to foresee how chaotic our world canbecome and what torment millions of innocent people willsuffer just because they are found to be ethnicallyinappropriate  so to speak.Today  when the epoch of colonial empires has beenrelegated to the past  the issue of the integrity of the Stateand the self-determination of peoples demands new  clearerformulations to ensure that each side in a potential conflictfully realizes the limits of international legitimacy of itsclaims. In democratic States  with Governments equallyrepresenting the interests of all its citizens  self-determination must be regarded as the right to expressoneself in a very broad sense  but only within theboundaries of a State which  on its part  respects theserights. There should be no talk of separation by the use offorce and violation of territorial integrity.Let me also add that the rationale provided byopposing sides to justify forcible redrawing of bordersalways centres around an alleged necessity to restorehistorical justice. History  which is hardly an exact science is interpreted according to the respective interests of thesides involved. I believe that new thinking should have asay with regard to this matter as well. In internationalrelations  perhaps  one must not overemphasize  or  to bemore precise  blow out of proportion the role of historicalprecedence. That was precisely the intent of the HelsinkiAccords  regarding norms for the inviolability of existingborders.At the same time  there is nothing more fundamentalto the formation of a national consciousness than thecitizens’ knowledge of their own history. And thisacquires special significance in the present era of vigorousglobalization. The efforts of individual peoples particularly small ones  will not be enough to sustainworld diversity.The contribution of each nation  large or small  tothe development of world civilization and culture isunique and special. So is that of my small country. Theculture of every nationality is a singular phenomenon.Although the economy  the environment  the eliminationof poverty  the management of demographic processesand sustainable development are the main challenges forus all  the time is also ripe to protect and preserve thenational cultural heritage  which remains an ever presentfountain to enrich and ennoble the human spirit.The Georgians say “Let us save culture  and culturewill save us”. Universal homogenization  which endangersthe identity of small nations  should be entered in theregister of modern threats. I suggest that we develop acollective mechanism for their cultural protection.Developments in recent years have clearly shownthat the existing system of collective responsibility forglobal security is still far from perfect. Certainly  sincebipolarity has been overcome we have significantlyimproved the prospects for the successful activities ofinternational organizations  especially the United Nations whose decisions were often not enforced because of therivalry between the two ideological blocs. Yet they arenot always able to effectively address new perils. Ordercannot be ensured unless negative sanctions are applied and this is exactly what the United Nations is avoiding inevery way. Although the United Nations Charter doesprovide for fairly strong mechanisms for ensuringsecurity  such awesome word combinations as ChapterVII and the Military Staff Committee exist most oftenmerely on paper. Surely the founders of the UnitedNations deserve praise for their wisdom and vision  butwe should not forget that the mechanism they created forour collective responsibility for the world’s fate wasframed for a different time.24It must be admitted that  despite attempts to establishorder in the world  the planet continues to live in a state ofanarchy. On the other hand  the need for a tougher andmore just order becomes increasingly more obvious. Mostof today’s threats go way beyond the scope of thecompetence of the nation-State. They are global in nature.No individual country can cope with them alone. Much asis the case within individual nations  the internationalcommunity primarily needs the unanimity of its subjects interms of their commitment to a set of fundamentalprinciples. This seems to be expressed in many charters andconventions. In reality  however  it is not the case. Theattitude towards terrorism can be cited as an example.Despite public statements condemning terrorism  it appearsthat many still allow it as an acceptable means forachieving political and other ends. How else can oneexplain that terrorists whose identities are known to all arenot hiding in the woods  but  rather  are able to find shelterin different States?Of course  it is true that the world does respond tosome extent to threats as they occur. Individual States andalliances of States do make serious efforts to fight globalailments. Sometimes  as has just happened in Kosovo  theyundertake such tasks as a coercion to peace. It is myposition that no one has a moral right to denounce NATOfor that operation  particularly those who  through theirinaction  play into the hands of those who disturb the peace.Yet this is not precisely what one would call ademonstration of collective responsibility. In such a caseseveral democratic and developed — and thereforepowerful — States undertake the stewardship of the rest ofthe world. Of course  we can only thank them for this. Butit would be better for all if those who have undertakenresponsibility for the fate of the world carried out theirmission within the framework of a mechanism establishedby the international organizations. We have alreadyproposed to expand the membership of the Security Counciland address the issue of veto rights in order to adapt it topresent-day requirements. In my view  the almost automaticuse of the veto is unacceptable. In the bipolar world thispractice largely cancelled out the possibility of conductingpeace enforcement operations  because in those years anyforce represented  to some extent  one pole or the other.With the end of the cold war  the possibility of usingcollective decisions to bring about peace reappeared. Thedecision taken against the aggression in Kuwait gave manythe hope that from then on the Security Council would bebound by shared principles and that an ethical approachwould prevail. There were other encouraging episodes aswell. But in the case of Kosovo  a new cold breezeseemed to have begun to blow from the Security Council.Despite its humane motivations  the operation carried outby NATO — like any ethical action today — alsocontained a pragmatic component. Had NATO notintervened in Kosovo  the influx of refugees wouldinevitably have upset the fragile balance in that extremelyimportant part of Europe. Perhaps a number of Stateswould have been drawn into the conflict. We might evenhave witnessed a big Balkan war.In today’s world an ethical approach in internationalpolitics is justified from a pragmatic standpoint as well.It is from a position of morality that we should act if wewant to do good for mankind. Morality should be thebasis of our policy  and it should become the pillar of thenew thinking of the twenty-first century.We are encouraged by the Secretary-General’sstatement that measures to reform the Security Councilwill be taking place shortly and that the reform willenable us to act in accordance with the norms ofinternational law when addressing regional conflicts in thefuture.Regardless of the serious threats existing today  itwould not be an overstatement to say that mankind hasnever in the course of history had a more singularopportunity to create a just world order and a moreharmonious community of nations. True  occasionallyconfrontational rhetoric can still be heard  but I amconvinced that today’s controversies between East andWest are ghosts of the past  artificially grafted onto thepresent. One may argue that this is done mostly tocamouflage the acute internal problems of individualStates. The generation that ended the cold war  the mostdangerous conflict in the history of mankind  withoutspilling blood  can find a common language betweencontinents  States and individual people and  throughcivilized dialogue  shorten the route leading to theresolution of global problems today and in the future.Now that we have overcome the dividing lines of theideological confrontation  we must learn how to eraseother lines that divide the peoples of our world into richand poor  educated and uneducated. In this process too  anew approach and new thinking are critical. Those whospoke before me have already mentioned thatglobalization should not mean only access to markets free trade across borders  free movement of capital andfinancial interdependence. All this should be paralleled bythe globalization of responsibility for the fate of the25planet and the realization that today’s world is too small toallow for the painless coexistence of affluence and poverty.We must find ways to alleviate the burden of debt on thepoorest developing States. Otherwise  the perpetual pressureof a shortage in financial resources will render them unableto emerge from poverty and  certainly  unequipped to builda free society.Assisting them in building free societies is a pragmaticobjective  not merely an ethical cause. In today’sinterdependent world the poverty of States will produceechoes of terrorism  drugs and crime in others. In order tobe secure  the future world must consist of at leastmoderately well-off  free nations that will pursuetransparent and predictable domestic and foreign policies.I recall appeals made by the leaders of many developedStates at different international forums  including PresidentClinton’s reassuring remarks at the annual meeting of theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank where he underlined the critical importance of relieving thedebt burden on poor nations.There are also appeals to the effect that we shouldenter the twenty-first century with developing andeconomically weak nations freed of the heavy burden ofdebt. We could  in fact  think of a 10-year programmedesigned to resolve the problem of debts right at the outsetof the twenty-first century. This would be a most fairdecision which  at the threshold of a new century and anew millennium  would become a kind of beacon guidingmany a nation to a brighter future.I have said many times that I am generally optimisticabout the future of mankind. This optimism is grounded inthe belief that we are slowly acquiring experience; we canlearn and we can be transformed. The Marshall Plan andpost-war Europe  which have vanquished the chimera ofantagonisms and showed new ways of integration  are goodexamples of this.In 1985  when many from this platform spoke of “starwars” and the end of humanity  I declared that the newthinking offered to the world not “star wars”  but a “starpeace”. I thank God that this declaration did not remainsimply a dream  and that mankind is gradually emergingfrom the nightmare of nuclear war  both on the ground andin the sky. This gives me reason to hope that humankind equipped with the capacity for constant intellectual renewal will live its next century with a single mind which willmake it an epoch of peace and freedom  justice anduniversal harmony."
"62",2612,"GHA",54,1999,"Mr. President  I am pleased tojoin previous speakers in congratulating you and the othermembers of the Bureau on your election to guide thework of the fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly.Given your vast diplomatic experience and personalattachment to the principles of the Charter  I have everyhope that our deliberations under your guidance will beable to determine the necessary mechanisms for dealingwith the numerous challenges facing our Organization aswe move into the next century.I also wish to express the deep sense of gratitude ofmy delegation to your predecessor  His Excellency DidierOpertti  who served with great distinction in the yearwhich marked the implementation of reforms instituted bythe Secretary-General  Kofi Annan  to mould theOrganization into a tool that can better fulfil the needs ofMember States.As we enter a new century  our Organization mustmake a realistic assessment of developments in the16out-going century  especially in this last decade. Such anassessment will indicate that while global peace andsecurity have been pursued relentlessly  they have not beeneasily nor fully achieved. The reasons are not hard to find.The situation is aggravated by the multiplicity ofconflicts that pervades the world  especially in Africa.Intrastate conflicts  rooted in ethnic  racial and religiousintolerance  pose a threat to the security and stability ofmany States and regions. While we welcome theagreements to end the conflict in Sierra Leone and theDemocratic Republic of Congo  the prolonged hostilities inAngola  Somalia  and lately in Kosovo  demonstrate that theinternational community is still grappling with seriouschallenges to peace and security.In spite of such setbacks and disappointments  wemust continue to maintain trust and confidence in theUnited Nations ability to achieve sustainablesocio-economic development for Member States. But thatconfidence will be sustained only when the Organization isseen to be truly seeking the interest of all Member States without exception. In this regard  Member States must giveimpetus to the reform process that we initiated a decadeago and maintain its dynamism. We also must accept thatthe core of the reform touches on the Security Council whose decisions bind all Members of the Organization.The Security Council must therefore not be allowed tobecome irrelevant. It should be reformed to ensure that itcan undertake its responsibilities more effectively under theCharter. And this reform must be guided by the principlesof democracy  sovereign equality of States and equitablegeographical representation. In this connection  we whollysubscribe to the Non-Aligned Movement’s statement on allaspects of the question of increase in the membership of theSecurity Council  complemented by the African position asexpressed in the Harare declaration of June 1997. Africa’sclaim to at least two permanent seats should be adequatelyaddressed  since Africa is the largest regional group in theOrganization.We would also like to reiterate the proposal of theNon-Aligned Movement that a periodic review of thestructure and functioning of the Security Council isnecessary in order to ensure at all times that it respondsmore effectively to new challenges in internationalrelations  especially in the maintenance of internationalpeace and security.It is only through a restructuring of the Council onthese lines that this body can avoid selectivity in dealingwith issues of international peace and security andsustainable development. The present unequal handling ofthe causes and management of conflicts is unacceptablesince it indirectly allows some conflicts to drag on.My delegation believes that we can succeed in ourcollective effort to achieve peace and prosperity in thenext century if we begin to speak out boldly against someof the injustices on the international scene. We thereforereiterate our concern over the continued non-compliancewith key United Nations resolutions that call for an endto the commercial and financial embargo against Cuba. Itis our sincere conviction that the economic blockade ofmore than three decades’ vintage against Cuba and theHelms-Burton and D’Amato legislation are a breach ofinternational law and a violation of the principles of theUnited Nations Charter.Particularly  Ghana considers the extraterritorialeffect of the Helms-Burton and D’Amato legislation aninfringement on the territorial integrity of States and animpediment to international navigation and free trade. Inthis regard  we are concerned that the economic blockadecontinues to severely aggravate the plight of Cubans especially the vulnerable groups such as women  childrenand the elderly.Given the United States Government’s recentsensitivity to the concerns of the international community Ghana would like to urge it to seriously consider theresumption of indirect relations with Cuba. We areconvinced that such contacts will yield desired results especially if they take place in the context of constructivedialogue with the Cuban Government.Another area of concern to the internationalcommunity has been the lingering disagreements with thegreat Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. My delegation welcomesthe positive events of 5 April 1999  by which the twoLibyan nationals arrived in the Netherlands for trial by aScottish court  in connection with the Lockerbie incident.We therefore can do no less than to reiterate the positionof the Group of African States at the United Nations  theNon-Aligned Movement  and the Council of the Leagueof Arab States that  as a matter of urgency  the SecurityCouncil should move beyond a mere suspension to acomplete lifting of the sanctions imposed against theLibyan Arab Jamahiriya  since Libya has cooperated fullyand fulfilled all the requirements of the relevantresolutions.17No issue in recent memory has frustrated theinternational community more than the Middle East peaceprocess. Last year  as the world marked the fiftiethanniversary of the forcible dispossession of the Palestinianpeople of their lands  homes and property  the Wye RiverMemorandum was agreed  offering a fresh impetus andhope for progress. However  subsequent events —characterized by prevarications  recriminations and badfaith — inhibited full implementation of the Memorandum.Even more painful has been the seeming helplessness of theinternational community in the face of such obviousinjustice.Ghana reiterates its unwavering support for theinalienable right of the Palestinian people to theestablishment of an independent sovereign State withJerusalem as its capital. Happily  recent changes in thepolitical landscape of Israel offer grounds for renewedoptimism. We thus share the conviction of the Palestinianleader  Chairman Yasser Arafat  that Mr. Ehud Barak’svictory has raised hopes for peace throughout the region.We commend the bold initiative taken by the Israeli leader soon after assuming office  to resume dialogue and reach ameeting of minds with the Palestinians. The challengeahead is enormous but not insurmountable; it will requirepainful compromises on sensitive issues. We urge all partiesto negotiate in good faith towards a comprehensive  justand lasting peace in the Middle East.Ghana is proud of its participation and record in thepeacekeeping efforts of the Organization in all regions ofthe world. The sacrifices in material resources and the costsin human terms have not been in vain  since themaintenance of peace and security and post-conflict peace-building have been critical in assuring all of us of theglobal tranquillity necessary for sustained development.My delegation believes therefore that the time hascome for the international community to do in Africa asmuch as it has done in other areas  particularly the Balkans to guarantee peace. We have seen in the past few monthsthe kind of resources that the world has been willing andable to mobilize in the Balkans on short notice. We do notsee the same response to the tragedies of Africa. AfricanMember States feel discriminated against when the responseof the international community to conflicts on the continentcontinues to be muted or lukewarm.Nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation of weaponsof mass destruction are indispensable for the preservationof world peace. Yet the lack of commitment and politicalwill of the nuclear weapon countries continues to impedethe process of nuclear disarmament. This is demonstratedby the failure of the three Preparatory Committee sessionsfor the 2000 Review Conference for the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).Against this background  my delegation reiterates thewarning that the parties and non-parties to the NPT alikewill not continue indefinitely to abide by the Treaty whilethe nuclear-weapon countries continue to ignore the callsof the international community to abide by their NPTcommitments and pursue negotiations in good faith oneffective measures relating to the cessation of the nucleararms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmamentunder strict and effective international control.The proliferation of conventional weapons  notablysmall and light weapons  is equally of concern  since theyare the tools of violence and conflict in Africa. Mydelegation commends all the efforts aimed at securinginternational cooperation and coordination in the struggleagainst the accumulation  proliferation and widespread useof small arms. Naturally  we welcome the recent decisiontaken on small arms and light weapons by the heads ofState of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) at theirrecent summit in Algiers which  among others  called onOAU member States to adopt a coordinated approach tothe problems posed by the illicit trafficking  circulationand proliferation of these arms.We also urge all friends of Africa to support theimplementation of the moratorium on the import  exportand manufacture of small arms and light weapons in WestAfrica  which aims at stemming the illicit traffic in theseweapons in our subregion. My Government  inrecognition of the need to address this problem and therelated issue of the forced participation of children inarmed conflicts  intends to jointly host with theGovernment of Canada a workshop aimed at building onthe Mali moratorium and establishing a framework forkeeping children out of conflicts. It is our hope that thesupport of the international community will beforthcoming when the time comes.We are at the dawn of the new millennium concluding a period in which the decolonizationmovement has brought about one of the century’s signaltransformations: that of more than 80 nations fromcolonial status to self-rule and membership of thisOrganization. This is a commendable achievement.Nevertheless  the goal of the Plan of Action for theInternational Decade for the Eradication of Colonialismhas not been realized  since 17 Non-Self-Governing18Territories remain on the agenda of this Assembly. Wereiterate our continued belief in the right of all peoples toself-determination in accordance with General Assemblyresolution 1514 (XV) and call on the administering occupying or colonial Powers to cooperate with the relevantinstitutions of the United Nations for the speedydetermination of self-rule.While we congratulate the United Nations andourselves for the commendable record in bringing coloniesto self-rule  we cannot hide our deep disappointment at therecent turn of events in East Timor. Since a significantnumber of States Members of the United Nations are theproduct of self-determination  our Organization has a moraland political obligation to bring East Timor to self-rule.We call on both the United Nations and the administeringPower  therefore  to take all measures necessary to restorepeace and tranquility so that the true wishes of the people as clearly expressed in the recent referendum  can berespected without further delay.If we are concerned about subjugated territories  thenwe cannot remain silent over the continued plight ofWestern Sahara. The people of that territory must exercisetrue self-determination and we believe that  since thePolisario Front and Morocco have accepted the Secretary-General’s programme on implementation of the SettlementPlan for the referendum in the territory  then the promisedreferendum should be held without further delay. We callon all stakeholders to demonstrate good will and fairness byensuring a free and fair referendum.The phenomenon of extreme and widespread povertyin the midst of plenty in the world is a serious indictmentof the conscience and political will of the internationalcommunity. Compared to the social situation at the onset ofthis century  the next century begins with an even bleakeroutlook. More and more people are living at or below thepoverty line  while individual security and well-beingcontinue to face disruptions from civil conflict and disease.Malnutrition  malaria  AIDS  diarrheal and communicablediseases continue to kill millions of people  stifling theeconomic potential of large segments of populations.HIV/AIDS alone has killed in the last decade moreAfricans than have all the conflicts and other diseases. It isa frightening thought that millions of Africa’s young andproductive populations will be killed by this pandemic inthe next few years. What development and progress are wetalking about  then  if we will have no human resource toimplement them?The continued deterioration of economic conditionsin Africa poses a challenge to all of us  especially as allstatistics show that the world’s poor continue to wallowin abject poverty with only a dim hope of improvementin their living standards. One of the main requirements ofour current session of the General Assembly is thereforeto select for implementation those measures that willenable developing countries to grow out of poverty in asustainable environment.My delegation continues to be concerned about thedeterioration of official development assistance  eventhough we note with gratitude the decision by threeindustrialized countries to increase their gross nationalproduct allocation to aid  and the steadfastness ofDenmark  the Netherlands  Norway and Sweden  whichare providing more than 0.7 per cent of their grossnational product. Official development assistanceresources need to be increased to levels which  combinedwith the commitment of developing countries todeepening economic reforms  lead to early achievementof sustainability in growth  poverty reduction andmacroeconomic stability.If we must break the cycle of crises  poverty andinstability  particularly in Africa  and if we must createthe conditions for sustainable debt management on thecontinent  the creditor countries and institutions must beprepared to wipe out the debts of the countries involvedin the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt (HIPC)Initiative and begin the new millennium on a clean slate.In this connection  we note with appreciation therecently announced decision and support of the G-7countries in broadening  deepening and accelerating theHIPC Initiative. While we express our satisfaction  let mehasten to urge that care be taken to avoid the impositionof additional difficulties on HIPC countries in the process such as are likely to befall HIPC gold-producing countriesif the proposal to sell off some of the gold reserves of theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) to meet part of thecost of the expanded HIPC Initiative is followed through.Similarly  we pray all creditor countries not to presentdebt relief in conditionalities that would compel debtorcountries to give up the relief option.In these days of globalization and tradeliberalization  the developed countries must also opentheir markets to goods from developing countries including providing greater access for the latter’sagricultural produce and services. The developed countriesmust  in addition  implement their trade obligations in the19spirit that all must benefit from the trade rules. In thisregard  the twin concepts of liberalization and globalizationmust afford developing countries economic justice in termsof markets and activities. They should not turn developingcountries into perpetual consumers because of limitedvolume of goods and market access.As we approach the next century  we know we cannotbuild the kind of future we desire without the fullparticipation of women. Although much has been achievedin advancing the status of women through theimplementation of the Beijing Platform for Action  a lotstill remains to be done. Discrimination  denial and violenceagainst women and girls persist  embedded in cultural traditional and religious practices around the world  despitethe increasing public debate on gender issues.Gender mainstreaming into national  regional andinternational policies and programmes  as well as theprovision of adequate resources for implementation as speltout in the Beijing Platform for Action  represents one of thecrucial strategies for attaining gender equity and equality.But in the final analysis  the critical step in protectingwomen’s rights is to empower women through educationand increased awareness of their rights. In this connection let me express my delegation’s appreciation for theadoption of an optional protocol to the Convention on theElimination of All Forms of Discrimination AgainstWomen (CEDAW) which  among others  recognizes thecompetence of CEDAW to receive and considercommunications submitted by or on behalf of individuals orgroups of individuals  under the jurisdiction of a StateParty  claiming to be victims of a violation of any of therights set forth in the Convention by the State Party. Weare happy that after so many years  women now have aneffective instrument in their hands to fight discrimination and we urge the adoption of the draft optional protocol tothe Convention.This year  we also commemorate the tenth anniversaryof the adoption by this Assembly of the Convention on theRights of the Child  by which all Member States pledged topromote and protect the rights of children. Despite theConvention  however  the rights of children continue to beviolated through child labour  commercial sex  exploitation early marriage and the use of children in armed conflicts.This situation indicates that mere ratification of theConvention is not enough. Children would be protected andtheir rights promoted only by a conscious effort on the partof Governments to effectively implement the provisions ofthe Convention.The United Nations and other internationalorganizations are justifiably preoccupied with governancebecause it is the basis of all progress. The United Nationsmust therefore play a fundamental and central role in there-design of global governance and in global governanceitself. It cannot do so  however  when it is constantlyrequested to do more for all people while it is being givenless and less resources. It will certainly lack theinstitutional framework for global leadership whennational leaders fail to stand up for it or its enduringvalues. Given the onerous responsibilities of theOrganization and the expectations of the Member States the timely  full and unconditional payment of assessedcontributions would be an expression of our commitmentand support as the Organization prepares to meet theemerging challenges of the twenty-first century.In this connection  it is our firm conviction that theregular and peacekeeping budgets of the Organizationshould be determined solely by the General Assembly inaccordance with each country’s ability to pay  amongother factors  as objectively evaluated within theOrganization. Unilateral decisions that worsen thefinancial situation of the United Nations must be avoided.We have an opportunity to draw lessons from ourimmediate past history and to shape a new millennium inour best image  just as the great statesmen of this centurydid in the aftermath of the Second World War. We wouldnot be true to ourselves if we sought refuge in halfmeasures. We must use our best endeavours to build anew world for a new millennium we can be proud of. Ourcollective wisdom demands this. Our civilized valuesinsist on this. We can do no less."
"63",2658,"GIN",54,1999,"I should like totake this opportunity to congratulate you  Sir  on your well-deserved election to the presidency of the fifty-fourthsession of the General Assembly and to convey to you  onbehalf of the people and Government of Guinea  mywarmest congratulations. I am convinced that our Assemblystands to gain a great deal from your leadership and fromyour wealth of experience.I would like also to pay tribute to your predecessor Mr. Didier Opertti of Uruguay  for his commendable effortsto advance the process of the reform of our Organization.Finally  allow me to convey my sincerecongratulations and words of encouragement to Mr. KofiAnnan  who  since taking the helm of our Organization  hasworked tirelessly to make of it a catalyst and a uniqueframework for nations to work together. We share thatconviction and would like to assure him of our unflaggingsupport in that respect.The present-day world is characterized by a rapidevolution that has taken the form of profound political economic and social changes. Those changes have had animpact on peace  international security and development.The quest for peace and for a new and moreequitable international order has become the majorconcern of our age. The United Nations cannot insulateitself from these changes. Its effectiveness will depend onits ability to re-adapt itself to today's realities.The reform of the United Nations  the maintenanceof international peace and security  disarmament  the fightagainst poverty and the strengthening of internationalcooperation — all of these matters will require ourattention and energy in the third millennium.I am certain  therefore  that the Assembly will agreethat the events taking place today clearly show the needto reform the United Nations.All the arguments favour such a change as a meansof strengthening the United Nations system anddemocratizing its main bodies  particular the SecurityCouncil  to make it into an authentic tool in the servicepeace and development for all. Our position on theseissues is in accordance with that of the African Group asset forth at the thirty-fifth summit of the Organization ofAfrican Unity (OAU) in Algiers. The new make-up of theSecurity Council must fully reflect present-day realitiesthrough the equitable geographic representation of everyregion of the world.The increasing number of conflicts is undermining thefoundations of international peace and security anddangerously compromising the development efforts of ourStates. In this respect  I am sure the Assembly agrees thatthere can be no development without a consistent politicalcommitment on the part of our States to peace anddisarmament. That is why my delegation believes that anysign of indifference or silence on the part of theinternational community when confronted with the spectreof violence and the use of weapons of mass destruction canprove fatal for international peace and security.As in the past  the Republic of Guinea can neitherremain silent nor conceal its concern with regard to theincreasing number of areas of tension and conflictthroughout the world  particularly in Africa. Indeed  morethan two thirds of the items currently on the agenda of theSecurity Council relate to critical situations in Africa.However  despite these difficult circumstances  ourcontinent has courageously taken its destiny into its ownhands by creating  under the auspices of the OAU  aMechanism for Conflict Prevention  Management andResolution. With the assistance of the United Nations  thismechanism should be able to play a major role inmaintaining peace on the continent.Africa needs international cooperation if it is to makethis instrument fully effective  given the breadth andcomplexity of the task that it must undertake. For some 10years  West Africa has been particularly tested by thefratricidal wars in Liberia  Sierra Leone and Guinea-Bissau.They have had very serious consequences for thosecountries  which have become fields of desolation andwhose reconstruction will require the assistance of theinternational community for a long time to come.In this context  particular attention should be paid tothe unfortunate young people in those countries. Tens ofthousands of adolescents have been dragged into thosewars  and now they are skilled only at fighting. It isessential to provide for and ensure their economic andsocial integration so as to prevent them from becomingeasy prey to the warlords who are laying waste to theregion.The consequences of the conflicts and tensions in theneighbouring countries of Liberia  Sierra Leone andGuinea-Bissau have affected Guinea in many ways andsignificantly impeded the achievement of its developmenttargets. My country has provided asylum to severalhundred thousands of refugees  whose presence in ourland has had a very serious impact on its economy environment and security. The impact of the refugees andthe burden they represent for the country in general  andfor the host populations in particular  have beenenormous  making Guinea one of the leading countries ofasylum in the world  since the high proportion of refugeesmakes up more than one tenth of its population.This situation has affected the ability of theGovernment to achieve its priority development objectivesbecause of the tremendous unforeseen expenses thatGuinea has had to bear and will continue to have to bearin order to restore peace  security and stability in thesubregion  together with the other States members of theEconomic Community of West African States(ECOWAS).Despite the support of the international communityin the face of these crises and conflicts that areconvulsing our continent  it is regrettable to note thediscriminatory way in which Africa is treated in dealingwith the refugee problem. We should like here towelcome the gratifying initiative of the United Nations tomake the Republic of Guinea the focal point of stabilityin the subregion.In this connection  a solidarity conference tostrengthen Guinea's stability and efforts for sustainabledevelopment will soon be held in Brussels. My country which has high expectations of that meeting  would liketo appeal to all donors to increase their support for theefforts of the Government of Guinea to deal with thesocio-economic consequences of the massive presence ofrefugees in our territory.I should like to reiterate to the Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  the sincere gratitude of the people ofGuinea for his recent visit to our country  and I ampleased to be able solemnly to pay tribute to his personalaction to mobilize the international community for thebenefit of Guinea.The subregion of West Africa is not the only onethat has suffered from war. We remain deeply concernedby the fratricidal struggles that are convulsing CentralAfrica  particularly in the Democratic Republic of theCongo and Angola; those conflicts continue to be at theforefront of the international political scene. Whiledeploring the situation  which is a threat to the stability ofour continent  I should like here to call on all the partiesconcerned to give a chance to the negotiation and mediationefforts under way in various places so that those crises canbe overcome. I congratulate the United Nations and theOrganization of African Unity and encourage them topursue their initiatives and concrete actions aimed atrestoring peace in those countries.Today more than ever  the Middle East needs peaceand security. Such a peace can be built only with mutualconfidence and the desire to live together  with respect forthe rights and the dignity of all the peoples of the region.That is why we welcome the recent developments in theMiddle East  particularly in Israel. The hopes that havebeen raised should not be dashed.In Yugoslavia  the advent of peace requires toleranceand respect for the territorial integrity and the right tocoexistence of all the various parts of that nation. Theestablishment of a true State based on the rule of law is theonly way of guaranteeing the reconstruction of the country with the assistance of the international community.Another subject of major concern to Africa is that ofeconomic matters and international cooperation. Here wemust acknowledge that efforts to date have not yielded theresults we had hoped for in meeting the needs andaspirations of our peoples. An in-depth  comprehensive proactive approach to development problems  as defined atthe Second Tokyo International Conference on AfricanDevelopment  deserves the support and assistance of theinternational community. Unfortunately  one of the essentialelements of such cooperation — the North-South dialogueso eagerly sought by our countries — remains at animpasse. All the while  disparities between the richcountries of the North and the underdeveloped countries ofthe South have grown. The arbitrary fixing of prices forcommodities and manufactured goods by the North reducesto the point of futility the measures that have been proposedto alleviate the burden of external-debt servicing.The system of trade too is based on discrimination.Under the banner of liberalization and free competition globalization has had the effect of eroding or eveneliminating preferences providing our commodities withaccess to the markets of the North. It is vital to establishtimetables for adaptation and for the provision of alternativecompensation so that our countries can maximize theirpotential as participants in world trade. Further  because ofthe importance of the fight against poverty in developingcountries  we call upon donor countries to redouble theirefforts to reach the target of 0.7 per cent of gross nationalproduct for official development assistance.Turning to the crucial question of debt  it is now ourfirm conviction that no economic-recovery programmecan have the hoped-for results without a favourableapproach to the backlog of debt burdening Africancountries  particularly the most heavily indebted amongthem. While my delegation welcomes the recent decisionstaken by the Group of Eight at Cologne  we arenonetheless concerned that efforts need to be made toproduce a lasting resolution of the debt question. Debtcontinues to swallow up the bulk of the resources of poorcountries  particularly those in Africa  whose earnings arediminishing daily in spite of the great sacrifices made byour peoples with the adoption of structural adjustmentmeasures.We therefore call for the convening of aninternational conference on the external debt of Africawith a view to finding a final solution to this problem;this would revitalize our ever more fragile economies. Iwish in that connection to say that my country is nowengaged in ongoing dialogue with the Paris Club ofIndustrial Country Creditors  the relevant ConsultativeGroup  and the donor community with a view tosignificant rescheduling of our external debt.Turning to the question of human rights anddemocracy  my Government believes that the eradicationof poverty  social inequality and ignorance is aprerequisite for the promotion of human rights. Eventhough we are living through a difficult situation  mycountry remains deeply committed to democratic valuesand fundamental freedoms and has created all thenecessary institutions for a State based on law; the properfunctioning of these will contribute to our politicalstability.We have been witness to the gradual emergence ofa sense of hope  common destiny and a new partnershipamong nations. Such a world vision  however  should notto cloak our profound concern at a time when humanityis preparing to cross the threshold of the thirdmillennium. The international community must doeverything in its power to bring about the triumph ofhope  even if threats to the very existence of the worldpersist. If it is to shoulder these responsibilities to the full the international community has no choice but to help theUnited Nations adapt to the major changes under way in3the world and must play its proper role in that world. Morethan ever before  mankind must understand that it bearsresponsibility for its own future.In the name of human solidarity  the very fabric ofinternational cooperation  I call upon all members of thisgreat world family to make the United Nations a centre forharmonizing the efforts of the nations of the world  unitedin defence of our common destiny: a house in which all ourwills converge resolutely  looking towards the future  andin which humanity can flourish and be united on the basisof freedom  justice  peace and prosperity. Long live theUnited Nations."
"64",2697,"GMB",54,1999,"Let me first of all congratulateyou  Mr. President  on your unanimous election to presideover the fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly. Onlya few years ago  the United Nations was actively involvedin the decolonization of then South West Africa  nowNamibia. Today  it is with a great sense of pride  therefore that we see not only an old freedom fighter but also aconsummate diplomat from Namibia presiding over the lastsession of the General Assembly of the second millenniumand ushering in the beginning of the third. I have no doubtwhatsoever that with your vast experience you will steerthis historic session to a successful conclusion. You can restassured of the full support and cooperation of the Gambiandelegation in carrying out your important assignments.May I also take this opportunity to pay tribute to theoutgoing President  Mr. Didier Opertti of Uruguay  for thebusiness like manner in which he conducted the fifty-thirdsession  an eventful period indeed  characterized by far-reaching decisions in areas of common concern to theinternational community.In the same vein  I would like to commend ourSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for the exemplaryway in which he has been handling the affairs of ourOrganization.Today  the membership of our Organization standsat the impressive figure of 188. In this connection  Iwould like  on behalf of the Government and the peopleof the Gambia  and indeed on my own behalf  tocongratulate the Republic of Nauru  the Republic ofKiribati and the Kingdom of Tonga on their admission tomembership in the United Nations. We are confident thatthese new Member States will bring with them all thecharm and wisdom of island nations to enrich the work ofthe United Nations.All nations  big or small  have something to offer.This is particularly true of small States that have nospheres of influence to preserve  but the honest desire toparticipate in and contribute to the betterment of ourworld. Small States have the advantage of coming upwith refreshing ideas and offering new perspectives in thesearch for solutions to problems of common concern.Making this world a better place for the human raceto live in is the collective responsibility of all of us. AllStates  big or small  should contribute to the collectiveendeavour to rid this world of wars  hunger  destitution disease  suffering  homelessness  despair  terror  tyrannyand economic backwardness.Making this world a better place to live is not a far-fetched dream. It is a goal we can achieve if all nations collectively as well as individually  sincerely committhemselves to working towards achieving this goal. Ourvery survival as the human race in the new millenniumdepends on the achievement of this noble objective.How do we achieve this noble objective? First of all we must commit ourselves to living and working forpeace on earth. We must respect the sovereign rights ofnations  big or small  rich or poor  to exist without fear ofbeing marginalized  suppressed or intimidated by larger richer or more populous nations. This is why  quite apartfrom the principle of universality  my Government4sincerely believes that this body should seriously reconsiderits position on the readmission of the Republic of China onTaiwan to the United Nations. With a population of almost22 million and the nineteenth-largest economy in the world and being the fifteenth-largest trading nation  the Republicof China — a highly responsible member of theinternational community  a free and democratic country thathas always promoted world trade and socio-economicdevelopment around the world and at the same time hascontributed to the eradication of poverty — has a lot tooffer if readmitted to the United Nations. By allowing the22 million people in Taiwan to be represented in the UnitedNations  we would be enforcing the principles enshrined inthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights  as well ascontributing to the promotion of international peace andsecurity.Where this Assembly has recognized the thenexistence of two Germanies and the present existence of thetwo Koreas  the logic of the readmission of the Republic ofChina into this Assembly of nations is a matter of justiceand equity. How can the United Nations sideline such animportant country as if we were still living in the past?For reasons that we all know too well  in 1971  theGeneral Assembly adopted resolution 2758 (XXVI)  bywhich it conferred membership upon the People's Republicof China. But the same resolution failed miserably toaddress the issue of representation in the United Nations forthe people of the Republic of China on Taiwan. The coldwar is over. The time has now come to correct this sadmistake  and there could not be a better time than now when we are at the threshold of the twenty-first century  torecognize the Republic of China and  by extension  thevoice of its 22 million people.Having said that  I would now like to focus attentioncloser to home for a few minutes. Five years ago  when Iled the Gambia National Army to take over the reigns ofpower in the Gambia  I was motivated by the sole desire torescue my people from the abyss of despair and destructionafter 30 years of rampant corruption and nepotism  to saythe least. There was a general laissez-faire attitude that wasrapidly assuming alarming proportions and that could havespelt disaster for the country had we not stepped in to putto an end the excesses of a rotten and morally bankruptregime. It would be hard for anyone to imagine that aGovernment elected by the people would deprive itscitizens of their basic needs for 30 long years. Not a singleschool  not a single hospital was built by that Government.That was why during the two-year transition toconstitutional democratic rule  my Government immediatelyembarked on an intensive socio-economic developmentprogramme  building schools  hospitals  roads and bridgesand carrying out other infrastructural developmentprojects  such as building a new airport terminal and theextension of the port of Banjul.It is now a thing of the past for any child to worryabout trekking miles and miles to school. There areenough schools in all the administrative areas in thecountry  including high schools  for our children especially the girls  to stay close to their homes andfamilies. In this way we encourage parents to send theirgirls to school.In addition to encouraging and increasing access tobasic education for all Gambian children  my Governmenthas identified a need to provide tertiary education and hasestablished a university. The first batch of students willenrol in the University of The Gambia in October 1999.Similarly  in the area of health  we have so far builttwo major hospitals  and a number of health centresaround the country. Obviously we could not put right allthe neglect of 30 years in just two years  but thedifference is clear. Naturally the people of the Gambiawanted more progress. I was therefore persuaded bypeople across the country to resign from the army and runfor office in a free and fair election under internationalsupervision. I accepted the challenge  strengthened in myconviction that a direct mandate from the people wouldenable me to work harder for them. We have since beenmaking greater strides in the uphill task of nation-building.The very survival of the Gambia in this ever-changing world is an issue of major concern as we stepinto the next century  which will be fraught with manydaunting challenges. The Gambia  like many otherdeveloping countries  has been forced to rethink itsdevelopment agenda while looking for a more meaningfulliving environment for its people.The desire of both Government and people for adeveloped nation is clearly expressed in the country'sdevelopment blueprint  “Vision 2020  The GambiaIncorporated”. Our macroeconomic policies and strategiescontinue to be spearheaded by Vision 2020  with anoverall goal of achieving sustainable growth anderadicating poverty.My Government is working very closely with theWorld Bank  the European Union  the United Nations5Development Programme and all the specialized agenciesof the United Nations system in their fields of competencein order to eradicate poverty  illiteracy and disease so thatas a healthy nation founded on solid  democratic principlesof good governance  we can stride ahead to build a nationwith a strong economy in an atmosphere of social justiceand political stability.Recognizing that improving the governanceenvironment is a sine qua non for sustainable development the Government of the Gambia has incorporated good-governance strategies in all national development initiativesand plans. The Gambia National Governance Programme which was recently launched  was developed through anextensive process of consultation and consensus-building.In our bid to create an atmosphere of dignity andrespect for our citizenry we are fully committed todemocratic constitutionality. We consider this the onlyfeasible political framework for good governance  which isan essential prerequisite for sustainable development. Wealso believe that democracy cannot exist in a situation ofabject poverty. Our national governance programmeincludes provisions for constitutional review and reform ofthe electoral system and process; reform of parliamentarystructures and processes; civic education; reform of thelegal and judicial process; public-sector management andadministrative reform; and decentralization and localgovernment reform.Given the complexity and scope of the governancepolicy framework  its effective implementation will requirecareful planning and mobilization of resources. A round-table conference  to be organized very soon  will seek tomobilize further support to cover part of the funding gap.It is our hope that our partners in development willcontinue to support us in this endeavour.We are mindful that meaningful socio-economicdevelopment can be brought about and be sustained only inan atmosphere of stability and security — not only in ourown country  but also in its neighbouring countries. Withthe world becoming more globalized  lack of security andpeace in any one part of the world affects the rest ofmankind  especially those of us in the developing countries.We place a high premium on the maintenance of peace andstability both at home and abroad.This is why  in our sister republic of Guinea-Bissau we all worked hard  encouraged by the rest of theinternational community  to put a definitive end to theconflict there. In our efforts to achieve this objective  we together with other West African countries  participatedin the Economic Community of West African StatesMonitoring Group (ECOMOG) peacekeeping operationsin Guinea-Bissau  even though the whole mission itselfwas short-lived. Now that peace and stability have beenreturned to that country  we encourage the internationalcommunity to contribute to the country's reconciliationand reconstruction effort.The Gambia  as coordinator of the work of the groupof friends of Guinea-Bissau at the United Nations  willcontinue to play a leading role in this endeavour. In thesame vein  in our continuing search for peace andstability in our subregion we in the Gambia havespearheaded efforts to mediate in the Casamance questionthrough dialogue. As a result  in June of this year wegathered together in Banjul all the stakeholders in theCasamance issue with a view to providing a forum for theMovement of Democratic Forces of Casamance (MFDC)factions to articulate a common position for theirimpending dialogue with the Government of Senegal. Thishas been yielding positive results as it has already led toa cessation of hostilities in the Casamance region ofSenegal. The cessation of hostilities  which is aconsequence of the Banjul encounters  has been soencouraging that refugees have started to return homeeven before a final settlement is reached. At last we cansee light at the end of the tunnel.The momentum created by the Banjul meetingsamong the MFDC factions should be maintained. A finalMFDC meeting will soon be convened and is expected toherald formal consultations between the Government ofSenegal and the MFDC. These  we hope  will lead to alasting settlement that will put an end to the devastationand its attendant human suffering.Meanwhile  in our sister Republic of Sierra Leone it is gratifying to note that a peace agreement has nowbeen signed between the Government and theRevolutionary United Front after almost nine years of oneof the most devastating  fratricidal and brutal wars of ourtime  a war characterized by outrageous atrocitiescommitted by the rebels. We commend the efforts of theEconomic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)leaders  ECOMOG  the Special Representative of theSecretary-General for Sierra Leone and all those whocontributed in one way or another to bringing about thispeaceful resolution of the conflict.The Lomé Peace Agreement is not the ideal peaceagreement  but most peace agreements come with a price.6The Sierra Leonean people paid dearly. We hope that despite all the shortcomings of the Agreement  it will createhope and opportunity for the people of Sierra Leone andfree them from terror  violence  killings  amputations andthe many other atrocities that characterized this war.The people of Sierra Leone have also welcomed thischance to make a fresh start. They should not be abandonedto fate. The international community has an obligation tocome in rapidly  and in a big way  to help in theimplementation of the Agreement.It would be an understatement to say that Africa ismaking great strides in the peaceful resolution of conflictsthere. A good example is the complex conflict in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo: we are encouraged bythe signing of a Ceasefire Agreement in Lusaka. On behalfof the Government and people of the Gambia  I thankPresident Chiluba of Zambia and all other leaders in Africawho contributed to finding a political settlement to thiscomplex conflict.We note that the Security Council has deployedmilitary liaison officers to the relevant States to lay thegroundwork for the deployment of military observers. Weappreciate this move by the United Nations. We must however  sound a note of caution: the situation is extremelyvolatile. We must therefore move swiftly  before there is arelapse into fighting. We must not let this opportunity slipaway.Likewise  in the Ethiopia-Eritrea conflict  we welcomethe calm that has prevailed for a while. Most importantly we welcome the agreement of the parties to theOrganization of African Unity (OAU) FrameworkAgreement. We commend the leadership role of the OAUin its efforts to resolve this fratricidal conflict. We must however  say that we are yet to see a ceasefire agreement.The parties must therefore be encouraged to translate theirpronouncements into action by signing a ceasefireagreement immediately. We must emphasize that the UnitedNations should be ready to come in as soon as it ispropitious to contribute to the implementation of theagreement.After a long and difficult period of negotiations  somegood news is coming out of Western Sahara. We note withappreciation that the identification process has progressedconsiderably. Plans for the repatriation of the refugees havealso advanced. Finally  we are coming close to thereferendum. We praise the Kingdom of Morocco for itsflexibility  understanding  cooperation and couragethroughout this period.Elsewhere on the continent  the political landscapeis still hazy.In Angola  the peace process has broken downcompletely due to UNITA's intransigence and flat refusalto implement in good faith the Lusaka Protocol. It is veryclear to all of us that there is no military solution to thatconflict. After about 30 years of war  the people ofAngola have suffered enormously  especially the womenand children. The future of a whole generation has beencompromised. We urge the international community totake decisive action to ensure a peaceful and speedyresolution of that conflict. To this end  we welcome therecent re-establishment of a United Nations presence inAngola. Such a presence is vital  but clearly it must bebuttressed by a resolute commitment of the SecurityCouncil to producing the much-needed peace in Angolaas soon as possible.In the case of Somalia  it is a completely differentscenario. The warlords are holding the internationalcommunity hostage because of their own insatiableappetite to assume power at all costs. We note that theIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) isdoing all it can to resolve this long and complex conflict but without much success. If a resolution to this conflictis to be found  we should shake off the Somalia syndromeand re-engage the issue. The international communityshould recommit itself to the resolution of the Somalicrisis by developing a strategy that would send clearsignals to the warlords that their behaviour and attitudecan no longer be tolerated by civilized society.In the case of the Sudan  my delegation welcomeswholeheartedly the peace overtures of the Government.We believe that they are a first step in the right direction.We encourage the other side to respond  and to respondpositively. The international community should alsosupport the parties in finding a lasting solution.This brief survey of the theatres of conflict in Africareveals once again that our continent unfortunatelycontinues to claim the lion's share of trials andtribulations. This is as embarrassing as it is unacceptableand we must redouble our efforts to reverse the situation.Away from the African continent  there are otherconflict situations that continue to pose serious threats to7international peace and security and  therefore  are ofserious concern to my delegation.With regard to the Arab-Israeli conflict  myGovernment  whilst reiterating its full support for theinalienable rights of the Palestinian people and the principleof land for peace  leading to an independent Palestinianhomeland  also supports fully the Middle East peaceprocess and the remarkable leadership role that the UnitedStates is playing to move the process forward. The solutionto the problem lies both with Israel and in Palestine  as wellas with the international community. This is why webelieve that the implementation of the Wye Riveragreement  in letter and spirit  would usher in a new era ofhope for the entire Middle East region.Elsewhere in the Middle East  my delegation continuesto follow very closely the consequences of the Iraqiinvasion of Kuwait — in particular  the unresolvedproblems of the Kuwaiti prisoners of war  missing persons the Kuwaiti archives and stolen property. There is nothingmore painful than the mental torture that the families of theprisoners of war and missing persons have been goingthrough all these years. To treat this matter lightly would betantamount to adding insult to injury. We can imagine thepain  the anguish  the uncertainty and the endlessnightmares of over 600 Kuwaiti families still hoping to hearfrom their loved ones. This is why my Government willnever allow this aspect of the problem between Iraq andKuwait to be swept under the carpet. It is a humanitarianproblem that must not be politicized and must be given allthe attention that it deserves.In the same vein  the restitution of the Kuwaitiarchives and other property is something that cannot berelegated to the category of secondary issues. Depriving anation of its archives is like robbing it of its nationalidentity.As for the question of the disarmament of Iraq  wedeplore the current stalemate. The status quo isunacceptable  yet the Security Council appears to bedivided on how to move forward. The Council should showunity and remain steadfast; otherwise it would be sendingthe wrong signal: that any country can dictate the terms ofits compliance with the wishes of the internationalcommunity and get away with it. If that is allowed tohappen  we would be setting a very dangerous precedent.Council members must make an effort to draw a linebetween their narrow national interests and the collectiveinterests of humankind.Just as we are unequivocal with regard to thedisarmament of Iraq  we are equally uncompromisingwhen it comes to the alleviation of the unwarrantedsuffering of the ordinary Iraqi people who  unfortunately have to bear the brunt of any sanctions. The oil-for-foodprogramme is a laudable effort to mitigate the impact ofsanctions  but that is just about it. We want to see theremoval  destruction or rendering harmless of all Iraqiweapons of mass destruction  but we do not subscribe tothe destruction of Iraq under any pretext whatsoever. It isdisheartening to see what sanctions have done to theinnocent women  children and elderly people of Iraq.This  too  is unacceptable and was not the objective of thesanctions. A net distinction must henceforth be madebetween the regime and the people. As with all otherexisting and future sanctions  they must be clearlytargeted at those responsible in order to avoid inflictingundue pain and suffering on innocent people.Still on the thorny issue of sanctions  myGovernment is pleased that sanctions imposed on theLibyan Arab Jamahiriya have been suspended  but wecannot wait to see them lifted completely because Libyahas fulfilled all its international obligations under therelevant Security Council resolutions. We call for theimmediate and complete lifting of all the sanctionsimposed on the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya.Cuba  too  has been reeling under unjust sanctionsfor 38 years now. These sanctions should be scrappedbecause they are counterproductive and inhumane. We areof the opinion that the new millennium should usher in anera devoid of avoidable and man-made disasters andconflicts that wreak untold suffering on the innocent.Today  at the threshold of the new millennium  we shouldforgive and forget the past and reconcile in order to makethis world a better place for mankind. We thereforereiterate our call for the immediate lifting of the economicand financial blockade imposed on Cuba.Whilst it is important to uphold the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of States  when a Stateexceeds all bounds and engages in the heinous policy ofethnic cleansing  as in Kosovo  the rest of theinternational community cannot remain silent. The timelyadoption of Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)marked a watershed in the history of the conflict  the fullimplementation of which  we hope  will bring lastingpeace to Kosovo.On the issue of East Timor  I would like tocongratulate the East Timorese on the successful conduct8of the historic ballot. Nothing would have been possible though  without the courageous first step that was taken bythe Indonesian Government leading to the 5 MayAgreement  which in turn set the whole process in motion.However  we are greatly appalled at and shocked by thelevel of violence that ensued immediately after the verdictof the East Timorese people was made known to theinternational community. In this context  we welcome thedeployment of the multinational force.While we rejoice with the people of Kosovo and EastTimor for the timely international efforts to restore peace we cannot but express despair at the slow or sometimeslack of response to African conflicts. We insist that one lifein Angola or elsewhere in Africa is no less important thanone life in Kosovo or East Timor. The Security Councilmust therefore be evenhanded and establish principledcriteria for humanitarian intervention.In the wake of the many conflicts the world over there should be a concerted international effort to addressthe issue of impunity. We share the philosophy that therecan be no peace without justice  no justice without law andno meaningful law without a court to decide what is justand lawful under any given circumstances.Because of this conviction  we support internationalefforts to establish an International Criminal Court (ICC)which would have jurisdiction over war crimes  genocideand crimes against humanity. We encourage all States toconsider ratifying the Statute of the ICC. The Gambia hasalready signed the Statute and has since set the process inmotion for its ratification.There is a phenomenon  though  that constitutes acause for greater concern to my delegation  and that is therecruitment and conscription of children as soldiers. Thisconstitutes a total breakdown of our fundamental valuesystems. It must be stopped  as it is a blatant violation ofinternational law and all norms of civilized behaviour.The issue of the child soldier is a moral one  and it isthe collective responsibility of the international communityto fight against a situation where the leaders of tomorroware exposed to a life of violence  vengeance and hate  asituation which breeds in their minds the dangerous notionthat he who wields the gun demands and deserves respect.The plight of the children in the refugee camps does notaugur well for a brighter future as they invariably grow upwith vengeful hearts towards those they deem to beresponsible for their plight. In a nutshell  an end to allconflicts is the only means to arrest this tragic trend.Another social malaise of a deadlier threat to allsocieties  rich and poor alike  is the drug menace. Thisscourge threatens the very fabric of society and indeed thefixture of mankind  as it respects no national boundary. Itis also a major cause of most crimes and violence in oururban centres  and it has grown to such proportions thatit is beyond the capacity of any single State to eradicateit. Thus  we applaud the timely initiative of PresidentErnesto Zedillo of Mexico for convening a special sessiondevoted to the drug problem. This special session nodoubt rekindled the interest that we all share in the fightagainst drugs. We all crave for a drug-free world. Adaunting task though it may be  we must take up thechallenge because the stakes are so high that we cannotafford to be complacent.The issue of small arms and landmines is also aperennial problem which continues to fuel and exacerbateconflicts in Africa and elsewhere with devastatingconsequences. We oppose the proliferation of small armsand the laying of landmines and call for internationalpartnership to address this concern. In this context  weurge arms manufacturing countries to exercise restraint intheir transfer of arms to regions of conflict. In thiscontext  we welcome the entry into force of theConvention on the Prohibition of the Use  Stockpiling Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and onTheir Destruction.Equally worrisome is the illicit trafficking in smallarms and sensitive technologies. On the wider question ofdisarmament  whilst we recognize the efforts being madetowards the achievement of a fissile material cut-off treatyand the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  wecontinue to add our voice to the campaign for the totalelimination of all nuclear weapons. Meanwhile  we lookforward to the Preparatory Committee for the 2000Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.Before closing the chapter on the review of theinternational political scene  I would like to thank all thepeople and organizations  as well as members of theinternational community  who have been workingrelentlessly to devise peaceful and negotiated solutions tothe problems besetting mankind today. We  the youngergeneration  would want to live in a conflict-free andcrisis-free world in the third millennium. We would wantto bequeath to the next generation a world devoid ofwars  poverty  hunger  racism and deprivation; a worldwhere the whole of humankind would live like a singlefamily; a world where meaningful socio-economic9development would be the collective responsibility of allthe world's citizens; a world where peace  love  mutualrespect and collective security would be the order of theday.It has since become an established fact that poverty isthe root cause of many conflicts in the world  particularlyin Africa.It is gratifying to note that following the social summita number of poverty eradication strategies have beenelaborated  and it is our fervent hope that the specialsession of the General Assembly devoted to theimplementation of the outcome of the World Summit forSocial Development and further initiatives will give freshimpetus to the campaign for the eradication of poverty. Oneeffective way of eradicating poverty in Africa would be thetotal cancellation of all of the continent's external debts.The debt burden is the cause of untold suffering to themasses of Africa's women  children and the elderly.Regarding the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries DebtInitiative (HIPC)  much as it could be characterized aslaudable  it must be recognized that the eligibility criteriafor accessing HIPC assistance are very restrictive andpenalize those countries that really need assistance. Forexample  the Gambia  with a high debt service ratio of 33per cent of the gross domestic product  although meetingthe other two criteria — first  establishing a track record ofgood performance and  secondly  eligibility under theEnhanced Structural Adjustment Facility and InternationalDevelopment Association-sponsored programmes — hasbeen excluded.My delegation strongly appeals for an across-the-boardcancellation of all Africa's debts so as to give us a newlease on life in the coming millennium.Talk about poverty eradication would be incompletewithout mention of the United Nations System-wide SpecialInitiative on Africa. I have no doubt whatsoever that if theresources required are made available to fund all thecomponents of the Initiative within a reasonable time-frame we could already claim victory in the battle against poverty.In this regard  we note with satisfaction  the Economic andSocial Council meeting held in Geneva during the month ofJuly and the attention given to the segment on thedevelopment of Africa.All said and done  in this era of globalization andliberalization  our salvation lies in regional integration andcooperation if we are to achieve economies of scale andcollective self-reliance. This is why we in the Gambiaattach a lot of importance to Economic Community ofWest African States (ECOWAS) as one of the buildingblocks of the African Economic Community. For usAfricans  the Lagos Plan of Action and indeed the FinalAct of Lagos constitute the blue print for the economicdevelopment of Africa. It is even more relevant todaythan ever before.At the continental level  we the African leadersdecided at the recently concluded OAU extraordinarysummit in Sirte  Libya  to form a Union of African Stateswhich would put us in a better position to tackle thecontinent's economic and political crises that have plaguedus throughout this century. However  I want to emphasizethat the objective of this African continental union is notto form a military bloc  but an economic and political onecapable of resolving Africa's numerous crises andconflicts  with the ultimate objective of eradicatingpoverty in Africa.Today  as we speak  the gap between rich and poorhas widened threefold. The 1999 Human DevelopmentReport has made stunning revelations  raised importantissues and made a series of recommendations. Thechallenges are daunting  but with the necessary politicalwill poverty can be eradicated  and  as stated in thatreport the challenge is “to ensure that globalization worksfor people — not just for profits”. In this endeavour  thereshould be greater cooperation between North and South.I would like at this juncture to salute President BillClinton's bold initiative to visit the African continent  thesecond by a sitting American President in peacetime. Thisvisit is very important as it gives the United StatesAdministration first-hand knowledge of the numerousproblems and challenges facing our continent. It alsostrengthens the historic bonds linking the United Statesand Africa. This is a positive development that should benurtured  as the United States will continue to play apivotal role in Africa's socio-economic development. Themassive financial and economic assistance given to someAfrican countries as a result of the visit could go a longway towards improving the living conditions of thepeople in those countries  as well as ensuring a brightfuture for the African continent as a whole.Thus  I cannot but express my sincere appreciationand gratitude  on behalf of the youth of Africa  for thisbold and laudable initiative taken by President Clinton and I hope that it will be emulated by future UnitedStates Administrations.10It is our fervent hope  therefore  that as we approachthe threshold of the new millennium  we will drawinspiration from the Charter of the United Nations bygiving concrete expression to the pledge made therein “toemploy international machinery for the promotion of theeconomic and social advancement of all peoples”.We anxiously look forward to the MillenniumAssembly  which  beyond its symbolism  could provide aunique opportunity to renew our commitment andrededicate our efforts to the attainment of this goal. Itwould be inexcusable if we were not strengthened in ourresolve to eradicate poverty in the next millennium. Withall the global conferences since the beginning of the decadeon almost all issues of common concern  a solid foundationhas thus been laid. All we have to do is build upon it.It is against this background that we are poised toembrace the third millennium and all that it has in store forus. Caught between the spectre of nuclear holocaust and theoverpowering and irrepressible phenomenon ofglobalization  our only hope for survival depends on howfar we are committed to putting our collective securitybefore our narrow  individual national interests. This in turnis only possible through multilateralism  and the latter hasproved its worth through the United Nations.Having learned numerous bitter lessons  including thefact of two world wars in this century  the compelling needto create the United Nations to save succeeding generationsfrom the scourge of war is more valid now than everbefore  taking into account the rapid advances in militarytechnology and the devastating effects of modern weaponry.Our Organization has withstood the test of time  and aslong as we continue individually and collectively to makeevery effort to uphold the lofty ideals enshrined in theCharter  we can together make this world a better place forall mankind.The United Nations is certainly not irreproachable  butit is definitely irreplaceable and indispensable. It is theembodiment of our hopes and aspirations. This is why weare emboldened in our conviction that  despite some acerbiccriticism  we envisage an even greater role for the UnitedNations in the twenty-first century. It was therefore verytimely to adopt the Declaration and Programme of Actionon a Culture of Peace shortly before the beginning of thissession.In this connection  it is important to carry out reformswhen and where necessary to address the Organization'sshortcomings. The organ that needs serious and urgentreform more than any other is the Security Council. Theimportance of this body cannot be over-emphasized  butits present composition  especially at the level ofpermanent membership  is unacceptable  to say the least.Its composition should reflect the realities of the day andmust be democratic and transparent in its workingmethods.To begin with  it is a fact that Africa  the secondlargest continent  is not represented at the permanentmember level. This anomaly should be rectifiedimmediately; then we can take it from there. Also notacceptable is the veto power wielded by the fivepermanent members  a practice that is diametricallyopposed to the principles of democracy and human rights.I propose that the veto power be abolished during thecourse of the United Nations reform process.As my country's term on the Security Council drawsto an end  I would like to seize this opportunity on behalfof the Government and people of the Gambia  and indeedon my own behalf  to express our sincere gratitude to theentire membership of the United Nations for theconfidence reposed in us to represent you. We also thankMembers most sincerely for the partnership andcooperation  the advice and support  without which itwould not have been possible to carry out the mandateentrusted to us. As a small country  our contributionmight have been modest  but it was sincere  in ourcollective endeavour to make this world a better place forhumankind. This noble goal  in my view  is what theUnited Nations stands for."
"65",2737,"GNB",54,1999,"Guinea-Bissau is gratified Sir  at your assumption of the presidency of the fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly. The unanimouselection of a distinguished African diplomat such asyourself to this post is evidence of the conviction of theMember States of the Organization that  under your clear-sighted leadership  our work is certain to be successful.Your election is also a concrete expression of Secretary-General Kofi Annan's dedication to the cause of peace  aswell as a recognition of Namibia's significant contributionto international peace-building. We pay tribute also toyour predecessor  Mr. Didier Opertti  for the greatsensitivity and skill he displayed in fulfilling his dutiesduring the fifty-third session.We would like also to express  on behalf of thepeople of Guinea-Bissau and on my own behalf  ourgratitude to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  forhis efforts towards international peace and security.8Guinea-Bissau also welcomes the new States Membersof the United Nations — Kiribati  Nauru and Tonga —with which we intend to maintain relations of friendshipand cooperation.On the eve of the new millennium  Africa isexperiencing an increase in armed conflict that threatensregional peace and stability. Regrettably  West Africa hasnot been spared this scourge. From the Liberian crisis tothat of Sierra Leone  not to mention Guinea-Bissau  ourregion has been racked by periods of fratricidal violencewhose causes are manifold.In the case of our country  the root causes of thepolitical and military crisis include a lack of effectivenessand a loss of authority on the part of the State; poormanagement; human rights violations; non-compliance withthe principle of the separation of power between sovereignbodies; corruption and deteriorating living conditions; andtotal frustration and despair on the part of those who foughtfor freedom and their homeland.The events of 7 June 1998 were a direct result ofthese problems. Unfortunately  as is the case in everyconflict  the crisis also resulted in a tragic situation for thepopulation that included the loss of life  a massive flow ofrefugees to neighbouring countries and large numbers ofdisplaced persons  not to mention the devastation of theeconomic and social infrastructure of the country.Having experienced the horrors of war  the people ofGuinea-Bissau today more than ever strongly aspire to livein peace and security  with hope for the future and in thefull enjoyment of their fundamental rights. Guinea-Bissaualso wishes to consolidate its unity and to promote a cultureof peace and national reconciliation that is based on apluralist democracy with sound governance and on the ruleof law.We are determined to promote and protect the dignityof human beings and to enable their harmoniousdevelopment. In this regard  we are pleased to note that aconference was convened recently in Guinea-Bissau for thereconciliation and unity of the people of our country. Thatevent of rare scope raised the awareness of our fellowcitizens and mobilized them with respect to national peaceand reconciliation  which is a prerequisite for domesticsecurity and socio-economic progress.The conference also received direct support from among others  Sweden  the Netherlands and therepresentative of the United Nations Secretary-General. Allof Guinea-Bissau's vital elements participated  includingpolitical parties  non-governmental organizations  theGovernment  the military junta and our nationals livingabroad.We take this opportunity to affirm that we will spareno effort in working to consolidate the emergingdemocracy in Guinea-Bissau  basing ourselves on thesocial and cultural values of our people and on theprinciples of good relations as set out in the Charter ofthe United Nations and that of the Organization ofAfrican Unity  in order to bring about a lasting peace inour country.In this context  we will be holding legislative andpresidential elections on 28 November  preceded by acensus and the registration of electoral candidates. Wewould like to reaffirm before the Assembly ourdetermination to hold the elections as scheduled  despitethe slow response time of some of our partners indevelopment with respect to the commitments entered intoat the round table held in Geneva on 4 and 5 May.We would like also express our heartfelt thanks toSweden  Portugal and the Netherlands for fulfilling theircommitments in a timely manner.We take this opportunity to launch an urgent appealto the international community to support Guinea-Bissauin its efforts to return to constitutional order  which is aprerequisite for restoring normal relations of cooperationwith its development partners.It is also important to underscore our very positiverelations with the peoples of the subregion  in particularwith Senegal  and our desire to renew our fraternal ties ofcooperation with the Republic of Guinea in order to helpconsolidate peace and stability in the subregion.Despite the progress we have made in the strugglefor human dignity and freedom  the vast majority ofhumankind lives in degrading conditions that areunacceptable to the collective conscience. This situationis the result of selfish interests that go against the moraland political values of the United Nations. The exampleof East Timor is a case in point.With regard to East Timor  we are deeply concernedby the fact that after the popular consultation  whoseoutcome was favourable to the Maubere people  wewitnessed very violent acts which were completely atodds with the agreement of 5 May between Indonesia 9Portugal and the United Nations. We express our fraternalsolidarity with the heroic people of East Timor in the faceof the genocide carried out by Indonesian militias. Wecondemn those acts and demand respect for the desire forself-determination expressed in the popular consultation of30 August last. We welcome the strong — albeit late —reaction of the international community aimed at restoringpeace and security in that territory. We appeal for efforts tobe intensified and call for technical  material and financialaid for the rebuilding of East Timor  which has beenbrutally destroyed.Guinea-Bissau supports the international community the United Nations and the Organization of African Unityin their ceaseless search for a peaceful solution to theproblems affecting our continent. In this context  thesituation in Angola is of great concern for our country. Thecivil war has imposed great suffering on the majority of thepopulation of Angola  especially those in the mostvulnerable sectors. This situation requires vigorous actionon the part of the international community to restore lastingpeace in that neighbouring country. Guinea-Bissau demandsthat UNITA unconditionally abide by the Lusaka Protocolso as to put an end to this long and painful conflict in thatfraternal country.In the Middle East  the peace process between Israeland Palestine deserves our utmost attention. In this regard we note with satisfaction the positive development inrelations between Israel and Palestine under the impetusprovided by the President of the Palestinian Authority Yasser Arafat  and the Israeli Prime Minister  Ehud Barak.In Latin America  we hope that the economic andtrade embargo against Cuba will soon be lifted. We believethat the realism of the international community must prevailso as to spare the Cuban people the suffering that theycontinue to endure.While it is true that peace and security are anindispensable condition for social and economicdevelopment  it is no less true that improving people'sliving conditions is one of the foundations of social andpolitical stability. However  one of the obstacles to pursuingthose objectives is our country's external debt. That is whythe external debt burden is a matter of constant concern forGuinea-Bissau. In this context  we welcome the HeavilyIndebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt Initiative. We alsowelcome the decisions taken at the G-7 summit recentlyheld in Cologne.We take this opportunity to pay a warm tribute to allthe organizations in the United Nations system working inour country for their substantial contribution not only toconsolidating national peace and reconciliation but toalleviating the suffering of our people. We also welcomethe decision to appoint Mr. Samuel Nana-Sinkam asSpecial Representative of the Secretary-General to headthe United Nations Peace-building Support Office inGuinea-Bissau  whose activities are greatly appreciated byour people.We believe that we have made sufficiently clear ourdetermination to hold elections on the scheduled date  28November 1999. However  we know that democracy doesnot end with elections. Support for the special emergencyprogramme for Guinea-Bissau is therefore absolutelynecessary in order to ensure that the democratic gains areirreversible and to give sustained development in ourcountry a chance. That is why we take this opportunity toappeal once more to the international community not onlyto take an interest in the elections but also to support thedetermined efforts of Guinea-Bissau to build its future."
"66",2776,"GNQ",54,1999,"At the outset  we would like to congratulate you Mr. President  on your outstanding election to guide ourwork during the fifty-fourth session of the United NationsGeneral Assembly and  through you  to pay a well-deservedtribute to your country  the Republic of Namibia. Mycountry subscribes to the generally held view that yourwell-known diplomatic skills and broad experience willcontribute to the success of our work.We also warmly congratulate the new Member States Kiribati  Nauru and Tonga  on their admission to the greatfamily of the United Nations. This is a great victory for theprinciples of free expression and self-determination ofpeoples and nations. That is the only way to enrich thedemocratic nature of the United Nations with the diversityand universality of mankind.It is with optimism and hope that we participate inthis session of the General Assembly. We reaffirm ourfull commitment to the purposes and principles that werethe basis for the establishment of the world Organization.We believe that its more than 50 years of existence which have made their mark on the twentieth century andhave helped bring about great social  political  economicand technological changes  constitute a positive legacy forthe future of mankind.We have high hopes for this session because thoselong years of experience and the fact that we are about toenter the third millennium mean that we can talk of aUnited Nations jubilee for the new era  in which mankindshould fully benefit from our achievement of the goalsand ideals of a world of peace  free from war andconflict. We want all men and women to be able to enjoytheir most inalienable rights — to freedom  dignity andequality — and we want all the world's nations andpeoples to live in justice and equity. Ultimately  we wantall human beings  without distinction and withoutdiscrimination  to enjoy the benefits of economic  socialand cultural progress.But in spite of these long years of history  the endof the cold war  our long experience and the many eventsthat have taken place in this half-century process —advances in the new technologies of space exploration atomic science  remote sensing and other progress that is ofincalculable value for the future of mankind — we notewith concern that we have yet to guarantee peace andsecurity for all nations.That is why we must adopt strategies and measuresthat will enable developing countries to take advantage oftheir opportunities for progress and that will make itpossible for all people to enjoy the best possible livingconditions on this  our home planet. We must make surethat  as our common heritage  education  science andtechnology reach all people so that human development canenable them to enjoy their rights to dignity andresponsibility. We must examine our consciences andunderstand that it is we ourselves who are slowing theadvance of human progress.The desire for power and world hegemony exacerbated by extremism  ethnic and racial discriminationand intolerance and fanaticism born of political beliefs andtheories  has created a climate of war  terror and insecurityin many parts of the world and could unleash a new worldconfrontation. The most striking examples of this may beseen in the situations in the Persian Gulf  the Balkans  theMiddle East  Africa and Latin America  as well as in therecent escalation of violence in South-East Asia.Moreover  despite the demands of third-worldcountries and the attempts to establish a new worldeconomic order that would be more just and equitable forall  the present unjust economic system continues to prevail impeding trade between the North and the South. We mustrealize that the economic situation is an irreplaceableelement of the balance of domestic and international peaceand security: peace does not mean the mere absence ofhostilities; it is a state of perfect harmony in human life inthe economic  social  cultural and moral spheres. For Africaand for the Africans  political idealism can flourish only ifit is attended by concrete action that will guarantee humansurvival and justify the aims of that idealism. Let us notforget that political idealism of any kind is based on aculture appropriate to the population in question. Here human beings are the raw material  and the properconditions must be present for the success of that kind ofideal political system. Hence  so long as the peoples ofAfrica suffer from hunger  poverty  war and pandemicdisease  and so long as they are overwhelmed by culturaldeficiencies  ignorance and illiteracy  efforts to democratizetheir States and ensure peace will always fail.It is said that an empty sack cannot stand by itself.Africa needs economic inputs  technology transfer fordevelopment  and recognition of its cultural and moralvalues  so that internecine struggle will cease and so thatdemocracy and political theories will be employed in themost objective way.That is why Central African heads of Statesmembers of the Economic Commission of Central AfricanStates and of the Central African Economic and MonetaryCommission  meeting at Malabo  Equatorial Guinea  from23 to 26 June 1999  carefully studied all these factors andadopted  inter alia  strategies to prevent conflict in theregion. They decided to establish a subregionalparliament  a peacekeeping force and an institute for thepromotion and defence of human rights. We hope that theUnited Nations will support these decisions.The reality is that in Africa there is strong pressurefrom underdevelopment  poverty  unemployment andilliteracy which justifies the flight of intellectuals and thecurrent exodus of Africans to developed countries insearch of a livelihood. Accordingly  we call for UnitedNations support for the decision adopted in Algeria by theheads of State of Africa to increase humanitarian supportfor the millions of African refugees  to amountscomparable to those given other regions.This is also for me a favourable opportunity toreaffirm our solidarity with the political will and thedetermination of the African States to speed up themechanisms for integration and unity  to meet thechallenges of globalization in order to ensure globaldevelopment for mankind. In order for political anddemocratic systems to succeed in Africa  the economyand economic culture should have a key role among theelements that go along with them  for otherwise theywould develop without any objective basis.Unfortunately  we find that currently there is no firmpolitical will for cooperation between the North andSouth  as there was in the past. In fact  now there is justa clash of various selfish interests in which the strongestor the richest always win.At this time we recall the great projects of economiccooperation in post-war Europe which enlivened Europe South-East Asia  Latin America and the Middle East.Attempts of the same kind have been sought for Africawith the construction of considerable infrastructure to helpthe peoples of this continent: for example  the Aswandam in Egypt  hydroelectric power stations on the Volta2River in Ghana  in Inga in the Democratic Republic of theCongo and in Mombasa in Tanzania. Unfortunately  thispolitical will to aid the development of the continent hasnot continued.This  then  is the high price for the independence ofAfrican nations. The political development of the continentis now confronted with a number of difficulties andchallenges.First is the need to establish sincere industrialcooperation with developed countries  instead of the presentmerciless extraction of natural resources and theirexportation as raw materials  with no compensatoryexchange for technologies to process them.Secondly  there is need to achieve fair prices in theexchange of natural resources for manufactured goods  asprices have not gone up more than 25 per cent sinceindependence.A third challenge is that credit is given underconditions that do not allow the population to satisfy itsneeds nor to profit from corresponding investments  thedebt for which is mortgaging the economy.Fourth  conditions are imposed on cooperation usingpolitical criteria that do not take into account the reality ofAfrican societies  as well as another series of conditionsthat funnel the benefits of the current internationaleconomic system to a powerful few.Nonetheless  we recognize and are grateful for thedecision by the seven major industrialized countries to retirethe debt of developing countries. We cherish the hope thispolitical will may spread to all donor countries and that itsapplication will not be according to selective andexclusionary criteria.Praiseworthy in the same way is the initiative by theAdministration of the President of the United States ofAmerica to increase American investment in Africa  aninitiative which we hope will be a second Marshall Plan forthe African continent.Certainly  the consequences of selfishness and ofunfair distribution of available resources have created  inthe developed as much as in the developing countries frustrated groups of people who today are a cause ofpolitical and social instability in many parts of the world.With respect to human resources  we must analyzein depth the causes of the current juvenile delinquency organized crime  rape  kidnappings and indiscriminatekillings  drug addiction and drug trafficking  alcoholism prostitution  money laundering  counterfeiting  terrorismand corruption which exist at all social levels everywhere.All these practices challenge us and compromise thefuture of humanity.Our concern is that these behaviours make up ourlegacy for the generations of the third millennium. Doesthe new epoch to which we aspire beginning in the year2000 presuppose the rise of some and the regression topoverty and misery of others? Can international peace andsecurity guarantee protection only for some  denying it toothers?Equatorial Guinea does not aspire to hegemony orpower  yet we speak here with the conviction of theobligation that falls to us as a member of this democraticinternational community to ask for what is best formankind.Socio-political development and technologicaladvances tell us that we are in a different galaxy fromthat of earlier times. The United Nations is the onlyOrganization that has exercised leadership in the processof the world's development. Yet after 54 years  we mustrealize that the terms of reference of the world's currentsocio-political reality are not those in effect in 1945. It isclear that the United Nations is similarly undergoingchanges which correspond to this moment in history  insocial philosophy  mechanisms  structure and action.Today we talk of democracy as the only way topromote the development of peoples  ensure peace andguarantee respect for human dignity. Today we talk ofglobalizing world politics and policies and of thegovernance of States because the concept of socialdevelopment finds its justification only in the values ofthe individual. The United Nations should therefore takeno action that is not in keeping with those values and isnot a faithful expression of this interdependent  unipolarworld that calls for unified criteria. We must make aspecial effort to help young people so that they can carryon the positive values of humankind for the sake of amore integrated  more developed  more just and moreequitable world.The ideal of any governments must be to seek peace progress and prosperity for its peoples. In this connection the efforts of the countries that are fighting to3democratize their societies be properly appreciated andsupported by countries with longer democratic experience.It has been proved that penalizing governments and peoplesis counterproductive and makes them unable to promotenational development however much they want to. TheUnited Nations ought to assist these countries closely intheir economic  social  technical and cultural advancement in keeping with the spirit of globalization and the actualsituation in each country.We believe that the current United Nations system isobsolete in terms both of decision-making and of theeffectiveness of its actions when it comes to dealingproperly with the difficulties and challenges facing itsmembers. Indeed  the proliferation of peacekeepingoperations in various parts of the world is proof that thecurrent conflict-prevention system is obsolete.As an organization founded on democracy  the UnitedNations must establish the principle across the board that allparties must be given a hearing in all bodies  including theSecurity Council  that take decisions affecting its Members.Moreover  the most sophisticated nuclear technology shouldbe employed exclusively as a common shared possession tobe used for the benefit of all humankind rather than asprivate property that benefits some to the detriment ofothers.We believe that in globalizing world politics andpolicies  which is positive in theory in that it unifies socio-political criteria  States should nevertheless implement thephilosophy by adopting specific measures that are inkeeping with the specific characteristics of each country. Inthis connection  Equatorial Guinea has particular experiencein implementing its programme of transition to a multi-party system by applying the theory of the democratic test a way to involve the people in taking all the politicaldecisions that affect them. As a result  our transition hasbeen peaceful  orderly and calm because our peoplethemselves  no one else  are responsible for the measuresadopted  which all political actors must respect.A progressive and continuous process of adaptation bythe authorities and by the people themselves is needed sothat they acquire the right sort of culture in which humanrights and democracy can be respected. In that connection we welcome the efforts by the Commission on HumanRights to adopt a special assistance programme forEquatorial Guinea to promote and ensure respect for humanrights there.We are party to all the human rights treaties andconventions and have adopted a wide-ranging frameworkof laws and regulations to protect human rights. However the lack of infrastructure makes it difficult for the peopleto enjoy in full the various services to which they areentitled.I would conclude by making clear our politicalresolve to contribute to the maintenance of internationalpeace and security  promote close friendship and mutuallybeneficial cooperation between all States and promoteeconomic  scientific and technological developmentthroughout the world. The Republic of Equatorial Guineastands open to the world as a peaceful State that putsdialogue and negotiation first  rejecting force of any kindas a means of resolving conflicts.We hope that the year 2000  which is almost on us will become a milestone in establishing a world trulycommitted to peace  progress and prosperity forhumankind."
"67",2822,"GRC",54,1999,"I should like to expressmy most sincere congratulations to Mr. Gurirab on hiselection to the presidency of the General Assembly at thissession. It is significant that his country  which gainedindependence as a result of the struggle of its people andthe successful efforts of this Organization  will bepresiding today over this Assembly and will  I am certain bring its work to a successful conclusion. I extend mycongratulations to his predecessor for the commitmentwith which he conducted his duties. I express ourwarmest support to the Secretary-General  Mr. KofiAnnan  for his tireless efforts. He has used his competentpolitical skill  his moral authority and his deep knowledgeof the opportunities and limitations of his office to pursuedaunting tasks  often working against all odds.My Government fully subscribes to the statementdelivered by Ms. Halonen  the Foreign Minister ofFinland  on behalf of the European Union  and to thememorandum circulated by the Union.Globalization in the field of information  ideas  theeconomy  democracy and human rights has been thedominant feature of the last years of our century. Somepeople fear it; some try to ignore it; a few try to fight it;others try to avoid it. Many welcome it as a creativechallenge. We Greeks are among the last category: wethrive on openness  freedom of exchange  freedom ofthought  expression and inquiry. We speak the languageof dialogue  the language of ideas. That is our tradition.We are proud of that tradition which sparked off theRenaissance and supported the Enlightenment  whoseessence was captured by Immanuel Kant's motto sapereaude: dare to think. Globalization challenges us to dare tothink the unthinkable in terms of sovereignty international relations and human rights. But that is notenough: we know we must go beyond it; we must dare tostate a vision for our world; we must dare to hope.We take heart that at the end of our centurydemocracy is being celebrated as the universal system ofpolitical rule  the only secure basis for legitimacy in themodern world. Experience teaches us that democracy notonly institutionalizes freedom but also brings prosperity.Celebrated economist Amartya Sen has conclusivelyproved that a democratic system of Government is noobstacle to the creation of wealth: development does not32require an authoritarian ruler. Sen has observed that nosubstantial famine has ever occurred in any country with ademocratic form of government and a relatively free press.We take heart from the fact that more States claim tobe democratic now than ever before in human history  andwe are firmly committed to seeing this trend expand.Slowly but surely  we are observing the globalization ofdemocracy  and we dare to hope.Nevertheless  our challenges and political dilemmasare formidable. We need to globalize peace. We watch inawe as Israelis and Palestinians shake hands once again.The peace might be local  but our pride is international.Equally  when watching India and Pakistan  we dare tohope for non-proliferation. We cringe as pictures of warcome out of Africa. We cannot hope for peace yet shut oureyes to war.We need to globalize human rights. Do we apply thesame standards everywhere  from Kosovo and East Timorto Cyprus and Rwanda? We need to globalize our conceptof rights pertaining to human beings. We understandmultinationals that support human rights to protect theirinvestments  but who will protect individuals who seekprotection from the indignities of the world market?We need to globalize ethics. From Kosovo to EastTimor we have bowed our heads  for we are still ill-equipped to deal with global ethical dilemmas such as thosementioned by the Secretary-General. Can human sufferingbe subordinated to sovereignty? Can we afford to beinconsistent in the application of military intervention? Is itright to impose trade sanctions on Governments that violateinternational rules  at the expense of their innocentpopulations?We seek to globalize values. Technological innovationis calling into question some of our most deeply felt beliefs.From cloning to brain transplants  scientists now facedilemmas that have global implications. We must make surethat fear does not inhibit scientific development  but alsothat curiosity does not inhibit civility.We need to globalize wealth. The growing gapbetween rich and poor countries has marginalized a largesegment of the world's population and led to dangeroussocial problems  from illegal immigration to drugtrafficking  terrorism  child labour and sexual exploitation.In an effort to contribute what little we can  Greece decidedto increase its official development assistance by an annualaverage of 27 per cent over a five-year plan  targeting inparticular sub-Saharan Africa.How can we hope to face these challenges if thepeople of this world do not share a basic education anddo not enjoy basic health? While the electronic mediahave minimized the restrictions of borders in the transferof resources  wealth and information  democraticinstitutions and social policies remain confined within theborders of nations. We cannot wait for democracy tospread at this pace: we need a faster cure. We need toconfront this global democratic deficit by supportingglobal democratic institutions.Beyond the globalization of democracy  I call for thedemocratization of globalism. This is a vision worthy ofthe United Nations. We seek a United Nations that is anactive centre for peace and justice  a centre for theimprovement of the life of each individual on this Earth.We expect a United Nations to respond to our needs forglobal ethics and global values. We believe in a strongUnited Nations that will act swiftly and effectively againstthose who wage war  harbour terrorism and destroy ourplanet. We aspire to a United Nations which will becomethe centre for democratic thinking and democratic practicethroughout our world.May these United Nations  on our behalf  develop aculture of dialogue and a dialogue of cultures. For this isthe essence of democratic politics: not a clash of differentcivilizations  but an educative dialogue that allows all totake part. We must educate each other to find peacefuland democratic ways to confront our challenges.This is a task for the United Nations. We yield to itsauthority as the only forum able to democratize theglobalization process. We call for all Member States toprovide the United Nations with the authority and themeans to perform its duties. Greece will do so. As ourGhanaian colleague said yesterday  we continue to askmore of the United Nations  and yet we continue toendow it with fewer resources. We feel that following theimportant reforms of the Secretariat  the time has come toexpand this Organization's authority  responsibility andbudget. Do we dare allow this Organization to hope? InGreece we do.My country believes in strengthening the UnitedNations  but it also believes in doing its own work  on theground  in the region. Uri Savir  the Israeli negotiator inOslo  has said that peacemaking is a gradual revolutionthat moves from hostility to a desired conciliation  a33collection of moments in which a new trend is set inmotion.Together with the International Olympic Committee Greece has proposed the creation of such a moment — aglobal moment: we would like to see the revival of theancient Greek tradition of the Olympic truce. We hope thatthis Assembly  which has unanimously endorsed thatproject  will give its full support to the observance of theOlympic truce during the games of the year 2000 inSydney  Australia  in Athens in 2004 and at all futureOlympics  so that the event may become a momentousfestival of excellence  cross-cultural dialogue and peace inour global village.From Cyprus to Bosnia  a “collection of moments” isproviding a ray of hope that  one day  a united Balkans andSouth-Eastern Europe will belong to a united Europe: afamily of nations  a bouquet of cultures  a kaleidoscope ofethnicities  where diversity is our strength and whereborders are so profoundly respected that they cease to exist.Can we dare see that far? Do we dare not to? We dare tohope.Turning first to Cyprus: following the declaration onCyprus by the leaders of the Group of Eight and SecurityCouncil resolutions 1250 (1999) and 1251 (1999) of lastJune  there is hope that a new initiative may break thedeadlock. Just as we envision a multicultural Balkans  weare striving to see Cyprus as a federal State with a singlesovereignty and a single citizenship  a united  demilitarized independent country with its territorial integrity safe fromencroachments and with no foreign troops on its soil. Theaccession of Cyprus to the European Union would certainlybenefit both communities living on the island. We invite theTurkish Cypriots  in the spirit of a newfound friendshipbetween Greeks and Turks  to grab this historicalopportunity. Let us break down the last “Berlin wall” which artificially divides those two peoples. Let us showthe world and our children that  yes  we can live togetherin peace and harmony with respect for human rights anddemocratic principles  within a wider European family.The tragic events in Kosovo will be remembered foracts of brutal ethnic cleansing and a military interventionthat ensued without the authorization of the SecurityCouncil. Today  I encounter individuals who  underpressure to “close the case of the Balkans”  opt to redrawthe maps  believing that ethnic isolation  constructing newwalls and barriers between our peoples of the region  willsolve our problems. But it can only compound ourproblems.I assure the Assembly that there is no short path  nolazy road if you will  to lasting peace in the Balkans.Consistent with our policy in our region is our belief thatborders are sacrosanct. But within them we must do ourutmost to protect minorities  democratic procedures andhuman rights. We must strive to develop the three pillarsof the Stability Pact for South-eastern Europe: democracy security and reconstruction. We need to build democraticinstitutions  judicial and financial systems  competitivebusiness and free media  things we often take for granted.We need to be aggressive in ensuring that all forms oflikely threat to security within and among our countriesare dealt with directly  openly and with vigour. Theprotection of minorities is of fundamental importance. Weneed  as the Secretary-General has said  a newcommitment to the prevention of conflict. We need toprovide basic economic help that will fight against thepoverty and degradation that lead to ethnic and religiousfanaticism.But more important  we need a total Balkanapproach. When I say “total”  I mean a coherent andconsistent approach by the international community. TheBalkans are badly served by mixed signals.Greece has drawn for itself a creative and effectiverole in the region. Greece supports all efforts to deependemocracy in the region. A total Balkan approach todemocracy  security and reconstruction will pave the wayfor our neighbours to enter the European Union.Yugoslavia  of course  is also an integral part of this totalBalkan approach. So too are Greece's bilateral andtrilateral contacts of very close cooperation with Albania the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  Bulgariaand Romania. We worked closely together during therecent Kosovo crisis for stability in the region and inproviding humanitarian aid to Kosovo refugees.We believe that in our region there are no good orbad people  just good and bad practices. We havedelivered and continue to deliver humanitarian assistance as major humanitarian problems remain in many parts ofYugoslavia  and peacekeeping forces. We have conductedmultilateral diplomacy  and we have promoted everyeffort that adheres to principles I have just stated withoutdiscrimination. Yes  in the total Balkan approach there isroom for both the Albanian and the Serbian people. Weask them to dare to have a vision  the same vision: that one by one  each Balkan country will become part of aunited democratic Europe.34If the road to peace is indeed made up of a collectionof moments  then I also dare hope for our relations withTurkey. My Turkish counterpart  Ismail Cem  and I havebeen engaged in careful diplomacy for many months. Werecently inaugurated discussion committees to address anumber of bilateral concerns  including trade  tourism  theenvironment and security  where we feel our two countrieshave much to gain from mutual cooperation.Peoples' aspirations for the principles of democracy security and prosperity can overcome historical strife. Inthis democratic spirit  we believe that our security is boundby the stability in the region; that our neighbours' strengthis our own strength. From the outset  therefore  Greeceshared with Turkey the vision that one day Turkey wouldbecome a worthy member of a united Europe. But werecognize today that our role needs to be to lead theprocess.The terrible earthquakes that shook both our countrieshave accelerated that process. Spontaneous and dramaticacts of fraternity and solidarity between our citizens short-circuited elaborate diplomatic strategies and exertedpowerful pressure on our Governments to move aheadboldly. I for one shall never forget the sweat  the tears andthe genuine expressions of solidarity and friendship sharedby so many non-governmental organizations  andparticularly by Greek and Turkish rescue workers from theDisaster Management Special Unit (EMAK) and theTurkish Search and Rescue Team (AKUT)  sifting throughthe rubble of buildings destroyed by the earthquakes looking for survivors. These people did not wait for us toact. Their actions globalize democracy  human solidarityand peace.That is one more lesson for democracy. Internationalrelations  humanitarianism  peace and cooperation havemuch to gain if we allow for citizens' diplomacy and giveour full support to constructive roles for non-governmentalorganizations.Building on this unique experience  in our first jointact as members of this Organization  I join hands todaywith my Turkish counterpart  Ismail Cem. I join hands withhim to announce to the Assembly the establishment of ajoint stand-by disaster response unit composed ofcontingents drawn from governmental and non-governmental agencies of both countries  Greece andTurkey  to reinforce the United Nations capacity in thisfield.Let me take this opportunity to extend my heartfeltcondolences to the victims of the recent disastrousearthquake in Taiwan  and to their families.A comprehensive and methodical approach todealing with natural disasters is in line with the recentstatement by the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  thatsome major risk reduction and disaster preventionprogrammes require levels of funding that many poorcountries simply cannot afford.In this Assembly  great visions founded on a strongsense of realism have helped to make the world moredemocratic  safer  and a little less painful for those inneed. In Greece and south-east Europe  similar visions arehelping to build democratic institutions  cement peace andpave the way to prosperity. There simply is no truth inthe saying that we in the Balkans are trapped  that wehave produced more history than we can consume andthat we are prisoners of past conflicts and hatreds. Historyis not duress unless one makes it so. The challenge toevery new generation of Greeks  and the challenge to ourneighbours  is to learn from our history  and not tobecome slaves to it. We are building a new collectivevision for the region  slowly but surely. We look forwardto the day when Belgrade and Pristina will be an easy busride away  when Jerusalem and Damascus  Athens andAnkara and  of course  the two parts of divided Nicosia will no longer be separated by fear and suspicion  but willbe joined in peace. Perhaps that day is still far away but as a Chinese proverb has it  a journey of a thousand milesbegins with one small step.History is not compulsion unless one makes it so.The challenge to every new generation of Greeks  thechallenge to our neighbours  is to learn from our historyrather than become slaves to it. We are building a newcollective vision for the region  slowly but surely.We look forward to the day when Belgrade andPristina will be an easy bus ride away from each other when Jerusalem and Damascus  Athens and Ankara and of course  the two parts of divided Nicosia  will no longerbe separated by fear and suspicion  but be joined inpeace. Perhaps that day is still far away  but as a Chineseproverb has it  a journey of a thousand miles begins withone small step.This step we dared take this year. We dared toimagine the world at the end of a thousand miles. RigasFereos  a prominent Greek revolutionary  wrote in aconstitution for the Balkans more than two centuries ago 35“All should be equal with equal rights withoutprejudice in the Balkans: Christian  Muslim and Jew Albanian  Slav  Romanian  Bulgarian  Greek  Turk Armenian  from Bosnia to Arabia.”Today  100 days before the next millennium  wecommit ourselves to keep walking in this direction of a newhope and vision for our world. As they say in LatinAmerica  se hace camino al andar."
"68",2863,"GRD",54,1999,"My delegation is delighted tocongratulate the President on his election. My delegation'shearty congratulations are made even warmer as he has theprivilege and the honour to take the fifty-fourth session  asPresident of the General Assembly  from the twentieth intothe twenty-first century. A similar unique place in historywill not be observed for another hundred years. We areconfident  in view of his past heroic leadership of the SouthWest Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  and now asthe Foreign Minister of Namibia  he will conduct ourdeliberations with vision and dynamism.My delegation also wishes to express our gratefulappreciation to Mr. Didier Opertti of Uruguay for his skilfuland productive conduct of the proceedings of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-third session.My delegation welcomes to the family of nations theRepublic of Kiribati  the Republic of Nauru and theKingdom of Tonga and offers hearty congratulations.As the curtain makes its slow descent upon thetwentieth century  bringing it to its inevitable close  there isa prevailing mood of reflection and anticipation. Rightly so as a connection between past  present and future is beingmade  for we cannot appreciate the present withoutknowledge of the past if we hope to ensure the future. Andindeed  historically speaking  the past is never past  forwhat is past is prologue.In retrospect  for some developing countries the periodof the 1980s was considered a lost decade because of theheavy burden of debt servicing  falling commodity prices negative economic growth  unemployment and structuraladjustment. In the 1990s  the catchwords seemed to be“sustainable development”  “environmentally friendly” “good governance”  “globalization”  and “povertyalleviation”. These phrases seem to be the legacy of thecluster of United Nations summits of the 1990s: theConference on Environment and Development in 1992  onHuman Rights in 1993  on Small Island Developing Statesin 1994  on Population and Development in 1994  on SocialDevelopment in 1995  on Women in 1995  on HumanSettlements in 1996 and on Food Security in 1996. In allthese high-level meetings  the centrality of the humanperson in sustainable social  economic  and culturaldevelopment was emphasized.Grenada believes that the concept of sustainabledevelopment is shared responsibility on the part ofdeveloped and developing countries. Its global charactermust be recognized so that there can be more sharing ofknowledge  ideas  information and resources.Consequently  the region from which I come  theCaribbean  strongly urges our more developed partnersurgently to make available new and additional sources offunding and technological transfer to enable us to complywith the obligations the international Conventions demandof us. In short  the concepts of the global village andglobalization should be premised on giving  caring andsharing.Sustainable development is not possible withoutrespect for the whole range of human rights — economic social  cultural  civil and political. Indeed  human rightsare meaningless in an environment of poverty anddeprivation. The United Nations High Commissioner forHuman Rights  Mrs. Mary Robinson  has said  aptly  thatperhaps the largest scale of human rights violations todayis the fact that one fifth of humanity lives in absolutepoverty. World Bank estimates reveal that over 35 percent of people in the Caribbean basin live below thepoverty line. This situation threatens the very existence ofcivil societies there.Moreover  the plight of certain small CaribbeanStates is further compounded by the World TradeOrganization's inhumane rulings over the European Unionbanana regime. We are still baffled over the attitude ofour traditional ally and certain friendly Latin Americancountries over the modified version of the banana regime.We are hopeful  though  that a satisfactory compromisewill be arrived at soon. If so  the economies of the small banana-producing countries would be saved from theshocks of a banana industry become non-existent.I stress that there is an urgent need to unite ourefforts in a common framework to alleviate the problemsassociated with critical poverty in order to restore someform of human dignity in our countries.To the observer with no inside knowledge of theworking of the United Nations and its specializedagencies  the series of meetings to review what hasalready been reviewed  and perhaps in some cases alreadyimplemented  seem as complex as quantum physics andexercises in repetitive and confusing rhetoric.Nevertheless  since the conceptual and structuralframework of sustainable development is sharedresponsibility  my delegation is hopeful that the recently-24ended special session to review the implementation of the1994 Barbados Programme of Action for the SustainableDevelopment of Small Island Developing States has givensome impetus to the creation of this global partnership weall desire. We are equally hopeful that the project proposalssubmitted by Grenada will be favourably considered andappropriate funding made available to execute them.The Caribbean Sea is a unique body of waterbordering a large number of States  with overlappingexclusive economic zones  vulnerable to the elements ofnature and also to man-made disasters. The Caribbean Seais indisputably the lifeblood of the countries of theCaribbean Community — one half of whose populationlives on the coastline  where 20 per cent of the regionalgross domestic product is produced — and providesemployment for more than 25 per cent of the labour forcein tourism and the fishing industry. Sustainablemanagement and development of the Caribbean Sea and itsresources would benefit not only the Caribbean people butalso the international community as a whole.Moreover  recognition of the Caribbean Sea as aspecial area within the context of sustainable developmentwould provide the jurisdictional authority necessary tocontrol the passage of ships carrying toxic and hazardouswastes and chemical and radioactive materials in Caribbeanwaters. My delegation urges this special recognition of theCaribbean Sea for all of the reasons I have stated.We are mindful that we do not own the Earth; we aresimply holding it in trust for succeeding generations. Weare admonished not to treat the land with contempt andremember that from it we came and to it we shall return.Grenada is absolutely clear about its commitment tothe principles of the United Nations and therefore reveresthe ideals which informed those principles. Grenada thusplaces a premium on fairness and justice in the conduct ofinternational affairs. It is in this context that theGovernment of Grenada wishes to request that a fresh lookbe taken at United Nations General Assembly resolution2758 (XXVI) of 1971  as a matter of simple justice andfairness to the people of the Republic of China. Thishumanitarian-minded and democratically inclined countryhas used its hard-earned resources to help developingcountries to help themselves  by providing training expertise and capital for developmental projects and otherforms of technical assistance in several critical areas. Thenoble efforts of the Republic of China reminds one of thegreat Chinese philosopher  Confucius  and his thoughts ongiving a man a fish and teaching a man to fish  Grenadaapplauds the sacrifices of the Republic of China in thisregard.Indeed  the Republic of China has wrought aneconomic miracle  to the point where it is the fourteenthmost important trading country and its foreign reservesrank among the top in the world.The international community cannot simply ignorethe aspirations of such a dynamic and generous people and should thus ensure that the fundamental right of the22 million people of the Republic of China on Taiwan toparticipate in the activities of the United Nations be fullyrespected.Equally  in the name of humanity and justice Grenada calls for the lifting of the economic embargoagainst the Republic of Cuba. World opinion is definitelyswayed towards this  and consequently overwhelmingsupport is given year after year to the relevant resolutionsat the United Nations on this issue. Sadly  though enforcement is still outstanding. As we are about to closeanother chapter in the history of mankind  we appeal tothe Government of the United States of America to oncemore take the lead in showing its humane qualities andease the pain and suffering of ordinary Cubans. It shouldtherefore suspend all sanctions unconditionally.As we look to the new century we must urge thatthere be a Middle East of peaceful coexistence particularly between Israel and the Palestinians.We certainly hope that past events in the Balkans —particularly in Yugoslavia — will not be repeated; andthat the principle of self-determination will be respectedglobally  the situation in East Timor being a case in point;that the various pockets of conflict around the world willbe resolved amicably; and that any changes contemplatedwithin the United Nations system will take into accountthe concerns and aspirations of smaller nations.Grenada believes that  with the collective efforts ofall States and the purposeful involvement of the UnitedNations  democracy  social justice  good governance solidarity and the economic prosperity of all our Memberscould be achieved.25Finally  my country extends its concern and sympathyto the victims of the earthquake in Turkey and  morerecently  to our friends in the Republic of China on Taiwan a country so helpful to us in the promotion of sustainabledevelopment.We are also mindful of the situation in East Timor andhope that as soon as order and security are restored independence  for which the majority voted  will take root."
"69",2910,"GTM",54,1999,"Iwish first of all to express our satisfaction at your election which has accorded you the privilege of conducting thedebate at this fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly.I wish also to express our conviction that your recognizeddiplomatic and political experience will lead to creativeresults.I should also like to pay a tribute to the ForeignMinister of the Eastern Republic of Uruguay  Mr. DidierOpertti  whose diligence at the helm of the Assembly lastsession not only bore witness to his professional abilities but also confirmed the commitment of that Americannation to the principles on which the United Nations isbased.Exactly three years ago  on first taking the floorhere  I began by announcing that we were very close toachieving peace in my country. Today I return to thisAssembly four months before my term of office expiresto summarize all that has transpired during the past threeyears of changes  many of which Guatemalans could notimagine when we signed the peace accords on 29December 1996.The first and most fundamental change that hastaken place has been in the hearts and minds ofGuatemalans  as can be seen in the way that the formerguerrillas have been brought back in from the cold andare no longer outlaws  and in the return of the refugees.After over three decades of an internal armedconflict marked by extreme cruelty  a conflict which was among other things  an expression of profound and deep-rooted political and ideological intolerance  all theindications were that reintegrating the former guerrillaswas going to be a complicated and dangerous process.Nevertheless  against all expectations  from the momentthe ceasefire took hold until the former guerrillas tookpart in the electoral process  reintegration has taken placein an atmosphere not only of security but also ofopenness and tolerance on the part of all sectors ofsociety. I should also like to highlight here the attitude ofthe Guatemalan army  which involved itself fully in thenegotiating process and made fundamental contributionsto it and then  once the peace accords had been signed not only complied fully with their provisions but was alsopositive in its attitude towards them. By acting inaccordance with the spirit of the accords and not just theletter  it encouraged reconciliation and peacefulcoexistence with its former adversaries.At the local level  both the refugees and the formerguerrillas have returned to their towns and villages andtoday  in many of those places  development committeeshave been set up composed of returnees  formerguerrillas  former members of the civil patrols and formermembers of the armed forces  all of them workingtogether to improve the lot of their communities bystriking at the roots of their problems.9Also  at the public policy level  peace has meant socialinvestment on a scale and of a quality unprecedented in ourcountry’s history. That investment has been effected inaccordance with the social ethic and the development logicof the peace accords  and have also met the specific targetsset in those accords.Thus we have gone farther than anyone has before.We have gone as far as the most remote villages andhamlets and brought them education  health services  roads electricity and water  though we know that much remainsto be done. What we have achieved so far has alreadyshown that if we can consolidate the opening to progresswhich our country has made  we can quickly remedy theeffects of so very many years of backwardness.We are also investing in the infrastructure andfacilities needed for production in order to improve thecountry’s competitive position in the globalized world oftoday. I would say that these two fundamental aspects Ihave mentioned  the reintegration of the former guerrillaforces into society and social investment  contain thefundamental elements on which a new Guatemala will bebased.Inherent to the processes through which the formerguerrillas have been reintegrated and the refugees havebeen repatriated are reconciliation  tolerance  respect fordiversity and legal or otherwise agreed solutions toconflicts.The main thrust of public investment embodies asocial ethic based on the common good and a tangibleeffort to improve access to opportunities for the leastregarded sectors. Thus both processes form the foundationsfor maintaining and strengthening peaceful coexistencebetween Guatemalans  which has been the most significantqualitative result of the peace accords of December 1996:on the one hand  a peaceful settlement to the conflicts and on the other  increasing efforts to redress the most seriousinjustices and opportunities for development for all.Nevertheless  our internal endeavours have taken placein an adverse world economic context. As in almost everyother Latin American country  the economy in Guatemalais experiencing a slowdown and a financial squeeze.Together with the effects of the crises in various regionsand the persistent financial speculation that is constantlychipping away at productive  job-creating investment  theprices of our main export products have plummeted whilethe cost of our imports  particularly oil  have gone upsubstantially.The negative impact of this situation particularlyaffected the strata of our society who are least capable offending for themselves. This trend which is mainly causedby external factors  has been compounded by the directand indirect effects of hurricane Mitch  which struck oursister countries of Honduras and Nicaragua particularlyhard but also brought serious destruction to our owncountry and seriously affected trade within the CentralAmerican region  on which we are highly dependent.As a result  the State’s efforts to boost developmentcannot be as successful as they might otherwise be particularly when compared with our people’sexpectations. We have created investment incentives beginning with political stability  and going on toeducation and training  creation of infrastructure andprovision of basic services. What has been accomplishedin the way of public works and public services hasgenerated tens of thousands of jobs. The work done onthe roads and highways and on the electrical grid andtelecommunications has significantly expanded the mainbases of our economy. As a result of all these and otherendeavours  the effects in our country of the negativeeconomic developments taking place abroad have beenless severe than in our sister countries that have stoppedgrowing or have experienced negative economic growth.We have created a foundation that will have apositive impact on the standard of living of the people and especially of the neediest. These beneficial resultswill continue if we stay the course.For even if we must continue to swim against thecurrent of the world economy  which is temporarilyimpoverishing us  we have available internal resourcesand can count on ongoing processes that are likely toproduce structural change  provided that the efforts madeover the past four years are consolidated  sustained andcontinued.The Peace Agreements are  for Guatemala  thestrategic elements of a profound  comprehensive and all-embracing effort to change our country. They representthe basic guidelines for the fundamental transformationsnecessary to build a different Guatemala  one that isprofoundly democratic and committed to the integral andsustainable development of its people.The peace agenda is equivalent to thedemocratization of the country  which is conceived as afunctional and participatory democracy encompassing thepolitical and cultural domains. A functioning democracy10involves reform of the State  and its participatory characteris what enables it to become a social democracy  which inturn strengthens its functionality.In this respect  I cannot fail to mention the substantialincrease in opportunities for popular participation that hasresulted from the establishment  as mandated in the peaceagreements  of over 15 multi-sectoral commissions  as wellas the measures taken to extend and complement structuresfor the elaboration and adoption of public policy.Also noteworthy are the efforts that have been madeto decentralize the State and strengthen local institutionswith a view to a rapprochement between the Governmentand the people and to giving them a greater say in publicaffairs.Another fundamental process consists in the effortsbeing made to build a multicultural  plurilingual and multi-ethnic nation. This involves extremely complex work to rollback centuries of exclusion  discrimination and racism  andit presupposes profound cultural changes towards thetolerance and respect necessary for our cultural diversity toblossom and make the many contributions it can to ournational development without putting the unity of thecountry at risk.It has also been essential to redefine national securityand defence. This has involved re-examining principles andrethinking the public security  national defence andintelligence apparatuses. We have made progress in theestablishment of a new national civil police. This is aprofessional body that is trained to focus on the protectionand defence of the individual and collective rights ofcitizens and is sensitive to  and respectful of  ethnic cultural and linguistic diversities.We have also further reduced our military forces cutting back the budget and dismantling bases and otherimportant elements of the military infrastructure  asprovided for in the Peace Agreements  with the fullconcurrence and participation of the army.The progress made in various areas is a source oflegitimate pride for all Guatemalans as well as for theStates that  as the Group of Friends  have supported us  andin particular for the Organization  whose role as our partnerhas enabled us to maintain optimism and hope in thedifficult task of building peace and development.Guatemala has been able to benefit from the essenceof what the Organization does best: make available its goodoffices and serve as a facilitator in the various phases ofthe management of a conflict  act as an impartialverifying agency  provide unconditional cooperation andact as a trusted partner in assisting Member States toresolve problems.I wish to stress the paramount importance of the rolethat has been played in Guatemala by the United NationsVerification Mission in Guatemala  with a view toensuring progress in the implementation of the PeaceAgreements. The United Nations presence in our countryand the exercise of its advisory and verification functionswith impartiality and wisdom have contributedsignificantly to the implementation of the various phasesof the commitments in the Peace Agreements.Our Government attaches similar importance to otherinitiatives that the United Nations has undertaken insupport of Guatemala’s society. Our country is a testingground for a new assistance framework that aims  amongother things  to impart greater consistency to the work ofthe various agencies of the Organization. Our ownevaluation of the assistance we have received is highlypositive.The number of activities the Organization is carryingout in Guatemala is quite high and increasing. It istherefore only fair to emphasize that the various agencieshave been able to mobilize a considerable amount ofadditional resources from external sources.Another positive contribution of the cooperation inquestion is the tangible impact it has had  through both itsdirect effects and its catalytic function in respect of publicexpenditure and the policies carried out by theGovernment.I therefore wish to convey our deep appreciation tothe States Members of the United Nations  which have atall times supported the efforts of the various sectors ofGuatemalan society to restore peace. Their politicalbacking has been fundamental to the success of thoseefforts. I also extend my gratitude to the Secretariat  andin particular to Mr. Kofi Annan  as well as to theexecutive organs of the various agencies of the UnitedNations system  which have interpreted the mandates ofthe Organization and have demonstrated efficiency intheir execution.Finally  we fully appreciate the value of the work ofother multilateral bodies such as the World Bank  theInternational Monetary Fund  the Organization ofAmerican States  and in particular the Inter-AmericanDevelopment Bank  which has played a dual role as directsource of financial assistance and organizer of theConsultative Group for Guatemala.The success achieved by intergovernmental bodies inconnection with the Guatemalan peace process is our basicreason for reiterating our conviction that cooperationbetween nations is indispensable in order to achieve peaceand development for our peoples. That is why Guatemalaremains firmly committed to the promotion of various kindsof multicultural and multi-ethnic undertakings  not only inthe framework of the United Nations but also with respectto various endeavours at the regional and hemisphericlevels.One of the boldest and most challenging initiatives isthe one being undertaken by Central America to achieve theeconomic and political integration of the region. Like theother States that compose the Central American IntegrationSystem  Guatemala is convinced that this strategicassociation strengthens the region in its relations with anincreasingly competitive world  and it reiterates itscommitment to continue promoting actions to enhance theeffectiveness of Central American integration.For those same reasons  Guatemala wishes to expressits unreserved support for the strengthening of ourOrganization. We are firmly convinced that the UnitedNations must be the principal forum responsible formaintaining world peace. That is why we welcome theSecurity Council’s prompt response to the crisis in EastTimor. We believe that United Nations involvement in suchsituations confirms its functions as the sole organcompetent to decide on the action to be taken in caseswhere the principle of non-intervention needs to beinterpreted with due regard to the existence of violations ofinternational humanitarian law.In order that such functions be performed adequately we need an Organization that is strong and flexible  withmechanisms and procedures that are capable of respondingto the challenges of new world realities. We mustaccordingly reflect more deeply on the ideal designstructure of an Organization that must compensate for theregional imbalances of power that have arisen in the post-cold-war world. This also means that we should pursue thereform of the Secretariat and of the intergovernmentalbodies of the United Nations  including the SecurityCouncil.We believe also that the United Nations shouldcontinue to deal with the greatest unfinished task of thetwentieth century: wiping out world poverty. Togetherwith the multilateral financial agencies  our Organizationshould play an indispensable role in ensuring that thebenefits of globalization are distributed on a democraticbasis  and that if we must all be exposed to the risks  weshould all be entitled to enjoy the benefits.Guatemala appreciates the Organization’scontributions to promoting an international climateenabling disputes between and within States to be settledpeacefully. As a State Member of the United Nations Guatemala has always resolved all its internationaldisputes in a peaceful manner and in accordance withinternational law.We wish to reiterate to the Assembly our concernabout the situation of the 22 million inhabitants of theRepublic of China in Taiwan whose aspirations forrepresentation in international organizations have not beensatisfied.We welcome the new impetus that has been seen inthe Middle East peace negotiations and we trust that theywill lead to a comprehensive resolution of all theoutstanding issues there. After so many years of conflict the countries of the region  including a future PalestinianState  deserve to live in peace  security  harmony andprosperity.This is the last statement that I will make to theGeneral Assembly as the representative of my country and I should like to conclude by reiterating my people’sgratitude for the solidarity shown to us in our effortstowards peace and development. The support which thepeoples and Governments represented here have bestowedupon us  together with the strenuous work of the UnitedNations and its agencies  make us feel honoured  indebtedand motivated.The fruit that our peace process has manifestly bornein such a short time provides clear evidence of thevalidity and relevance of the system and of thefundamental  indispensable and inestimable importance ofthe efforts of the Guatemalan people within the countryand of the unquestionable effectiveness of internationalfriendship in the form of respectful  timely and effectivecooperation in building a more democratic country and amore equitable and united world.12"
"70",2953,"GUY",54,1999,"I am pleased to have thisopportunity  the first since my assumption of the presidencyof Guyana  to share with the Assembly some issues ofinterest and concern to the Group of 77  which Guyana nowhas the honour to chair.A mere three months remain before mankind enters anew millennium filled with great hopes. Whether thosehopes are realized will depend largely on the decisions wetake  as an organization of united peoples  on how wecollectively face the future. This fifty-fourth session of theGeneral Assembly therefore represents a crucial turningpoint where we can follow either the high road toenlightened multilateralism or the low road leading tonarrow self-interest.I am confident that the Assembly will not fail to takethe right direction. As the Foreign Minister of Namibia  Mr.President  you have given long and distinguished service toyour country  which  after a bitter struggle against apartheidrule  stands as an independent and proud member of thefamily of nations. On behalf of the Group of 77  I saluteNamibia and offer to you personally our warmestcongratulations and good wishes for a successful Assembly.To your predecessor  Mr. Didier Opertti of Uruguay we offer our sincere appreciation for the guidance providedto the Assembly over the past year.A warm welcome is also extended to the three newmembers of the United Nations — the Republic of Kiribati the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga.And to our Secretary-General I wish to convey ourgratitude for his sustained stewardship of the Secretariat and more particularly for his report on the Organization'swork.The challenges we must address this year areformidable. Our world continues to be plagued by amultiplicity of conflicts  both old and new  inter-State andintra-State  that have not only imperilled global peace andsecurity but also sap our economic and social vitality.Whether in Afghanistan  Kosovo  the Middle East or theGreat Lakes region of Africa — to name just a few conflictzones — a heavy toll is being exacted on human life anddevelopment. Equally disturbing is the apparent inabilityof the world community to contain this increase intensions and conflicts.The world Organization is continuously challengedby the outbreak of internecine strife in one country afteranother. Without a clear strategy  the United Nations cando no more than muddle through these crises in the hopethat the warring factions will eventually see the virtues ofpeace. In these distressing circumstances  it is not onlythe parties to the conflict that are losers but also theinternational community. As a result of the increasingclaims for peacemaking and peacekeeping operations developing countries are deprived of much neededdevelopment resources and are politically weakened.Gradually the United Nations must move forward into thearea of peace-building to obviate recidivism and toreconstruct shattered societies. By helping to strengthendemocracy  government institutions and the rule of law as well as rebuilding the foundations for long-termdevelopment  the Organization can help post-conflictStates to rebuild themselves.The time may have come to revisit the UnitedNations Agenda for Peace  as well as its Agenda forDevelopment  to see where deficiencies lie and whatcould be done to remedy them.The time has also come to strengthen the SecurityCouncil  the organ primarily responsible for themaintenance of international peace and security  so that itmay become more democratic  representative andcredible. Of course  the United Nations cannot do whatthe parties to conflict are not prepared to do. Without atrue commitment to peace by all involved there can bescant prospect of any lasting settlement. As we have seenfrom recent developments in the Middle East  the partiesinvolved must show a strong will to resolve the conflictthrough peaceful means. Only then can the UnitedNations  using the instruments provided by its Charter serve to facilitate negotiations for a satisfactory outcome.Accompanying these threats to international securityand stability are strong economic and social forces whichimpact negatively on our countries. While globalizationand trade liberalization have benefited strong economies they have also exposed weaker States to marginalizationfrom the world economy. By opening the floodgates oftrade and finance  globalization has invariably wroughthavoc on small and weak economies  which can doprecious little to withstand its impact. Economic andsocial misery have followed in its wake  exposing the12particular vulnerabilities of small developing countries many of which are dependent on a single agricultural crop— like bananas or sugar — for the livelihood of theirpeoples.At the regional meetings which have been held thusfar in preparation for the tenth session of the UnitedNations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTADX) caution has been sounded against the worst excesses oftrade liberalization. Having benefited from the Tokyo andUruguay Rounds  the industrialized countries are anxious tohold further negotiations — the mother of all rounds — forfree trade in the next millennium. Theoretically  developingcountries can also gain from increased liberalization.However  since they are for the most part too weak to takeadvantage of the new opportunities  they run the risk ofgreater marginalization and  indeed  elimination from themarket place.Fear of this eventuality is based not on uninformedspeculation  but on the harsh reality of experience. Pastnegotiating rounds have yielded significant concessions todeveloped economies  while offering relatively little todeveloping countries in terms of opening up markets fortheir own products. At bottom  the problem is one of animbalance in negotiating strength of its contracting parties resulting in more favourable outcomes for the strongest. Yetthe developing countries are being urged to enter into a newround of negotiations  the millennium round  the result ofwhich is likely to be no different from that of the pastunless its agenda is balanced by issues of concern to thedeveloping countries.To be able to enter the global marketplace  developingcountries should be assisted in the strengthening of theirproductive capacities and in widening their access to exportmarkets. They need to be assured of stabilization in theinternational financial and monetary system in order toavoid the hazards of currency fluctuations. Equallyimportant  given the vast disparity which exists in theeconomic capacities of countries  special and differentialtreatment should be granted to developing countries inaccordance with the principles outlined in part IV of theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and theGATT legislative clause of 1971.Special consideration will have to be given to Africa the least developed countries and structurally weakeconomies  in particular the small island developing States which are seriously disadvantaged in the area of trade. Thespecial session to review the Programme of Action withregard to the sustainable development of small islanddeveloping States  which will be held here in just a matterof days  and the summit of the least developed countriesscheduled for the year 2001 should serve to generate newinitiatives to help these vulnerable States.However  to benefit from the international tradingsystem developing countries must receive significant debtrelief and the necessary official development assistance toboost the overall productive capability. Consequently  inthe face of rampant globalization  it is imperative that theinternational community should come together to createa modern development vision and strategy aimed atbridging the dangerous division which now separates theprosperous from the poor nations. This new approachshould be based on an international consensus ondevelopment and on the rights and obligations of thepartners.As the preparations undertaken this year for thereview of the summits held in Beijing  Cairo andCopenhagen have shown  there is an increasing numberof people  the majority of them women and children living under adverse conditions caused by poverty.Despite great strides in the fields of health and educationin the developed world  many developing countriescontinue to be plagued by unequal and inadequate accessto education and health care  high infant and maternalmortality  as well as lack of access to safe drinking waterand proper sanitation. Indeed  low levels of health haveinhibited the achievement of socially and economicallyproductive lives  not to mention the devastating social andeconomic impact of the HIV/AIDS pandemic  as well asmalaria  on a number of developing countries  particularlyin Africa.The Cologne initiative to expand the scope andprovision of relief for the heavily indebted poor countrieswas a welcome step forward. Unfortunately  however  itdoes not go far enough to alleviate the debt burden whichthe developing countries still bear. Nothing short of thecancellation of some of these countries' debts will besufficient to improve their circumstances to the pointwhere they can be active participants in the worldeconomy. The situation of many low-income countrieshas been made even more acute by the rapid decline ofofficial development assistance in the wake ofglobalization's spread and over reliance on the market topromote development.The financing of development must therefore beplaced on a more sound and predictable basis. The Groupof 77 therefore attaches the greatest importance to the13holding of a high-level conference by the year 2001 toaddress this pressing issue. We believe that if MemberStates can address all aspects of the problem — particularlythose identified in the Secretary-General's report onfinancing for development — we may yet find solutionsthat are acceptable and effective. Crucial to the successfuloutcome of the conference  however  is a generalacceptance of a more enlightened approach to internationaldevelopment cooperation based on a genuine concept ofinterdependence and partnership.Indeed  there is an acute need for a new global agendawith the objective of putting a human face on themarketplace. Policies aimed merely at creatingunsustainable social safety nets are hardly lasting solutions.The root causes of the structural and endemic problems ofthe developing countries  which ultimately lead to globalinstability  must be addressed.For their part  the developing countries whichconstitute the Group of 77 are committed to the search forways and means by which we can accelerate thedevelopment process. Even before the conference onfinancing for development  we shall meet in Havana  Cuba next year for the first ever South summit. The Summit is along-cherished idea whose time has finally come. It willallow the South a special opportunity to examine the impactwhich globalization continues to have on developingcountries  as well as the policies and strategies needed toharness the process and make it more amenable to control.In this context  North-South relations must be reviewed tosee how they may be enhanced and put on a new basis formutual trust and advantage.Understandably  the central focus of the South Summitmust be the strengthening of the unity and solidarity of theGroup of 77 and the identification of concrete initiatives topromote practical cooperation between members. We havealso agreed to devote our attention to the promulgation ofknowledge and technology in order  hopefully  to achievea quantum leap towards our development. This  after all  isan area in which the South can boast of remarkableadvances and of many centres of excellence that can beutilized for the dissemination of skills and technologyamong the countries of the Group of 77. The North can  ofcourse  do much to facilitate these exchanges by providingrequisite financing and supplying appropriate technologyand knowledge that would make the developing countriesmore self-reliant and at the same time more competitive inthe world economy.Coming  as it does  in the early months of the newmillennium  the South summit will certainly provide anindication of the direction for the future. In Havana wehope to have in attendance our developed partners  whichsignificantly  are usually present at all of our importantdeliberations as observers. Also expected to participate inthe event are other key players in the developmentprocess  such as our non-governmental organizations andrepresentatives of the private sector. Together  through aninteractive dialogue  we hope to forge a programme ofaction which will serve as a catalyst for the developmentof our countries and our peoples. Indeed  if given thechance  the South summit  I dare say  will prove to be aninspiration for the Millennium Assembly and for a newcompact on human development for the twenty-firstcentury.Speaking for Guyana  I wish to reaffirm ourGovernment's intention to continue working for thecreation of a new global human order aimed at theeradication of poverty and the establishment of a just andmore humane system of international relations. Conceivedby our late President Cheddi Jagan  whose entire life wasdedicated to empowering the poor and the weak — notonly in his native Guyana  but throughout the world —the outlines of this new order have been presented atmajor international forums  including the World Summitfor Social Development  which was held in 1995 inDenmark. All 14 heads of Government of the CaribbeanCommunity (CARICOM)  along with other world leadersand eminent personalities  have declared their full supportfor the proposal and their commitment to its widestpromulgation. We will therefore seek at this session toadvance it for further consideration.Although much is being made of the dawning of themillennium  it is obviously too much to expect that it willbring solutions to all of the world's problems. It canprovide  however  an auspicious opportunity for theinternational community to reflect upon the pastachievements  its present challenges and futureaspirations. With a firm sense of purpose and resolve  letus use this occasion to create a brave new world in whichall our peoples may hope to live in peace — free fromfear  poverty and want."
"71",2999,"HND",54,1999,"I wish toexpress my pleasure at your recent election  Mr. President.I also wish to acknowledge the work of your illustriouspredecessor  Mr. Didier Opertti. The Secretary-General  Mr.Kofi Annan  also deserves acknowledgement for hisuntiring efforts to ensure that peace and security governinternational relations in this turbulent world in which welive  always showing sensitivity and a very special concernfor those who suffer the most  have the least  and thereforeneed the greatest care.Almost a year ago  Central America was tragicallystruck by one of the most terrible hurricanes of the century.Our country  Honduras  was the most severely damaged with billions of dollars in losses resulting from thedestruction of more than 70 per cent of its infrastructureand economy. More than 15 000 people were killed injured or went missing and more than 1.5 millionsuffered losses  either directly or indirectly  a highpercentage of whom lost their homes  belongings andbusinesses in their entirety.Those unfortunate circumstances through which wehad to live  the consequences of which we have only justbegun to recover from  have been aggravated in recentweeks by the severity of the winter and high levels ofprecipitation. Once again  the banks of our country’s mainrivers have overflowed  as it was not possible to dredgethem because of lack of time and resources. This is againjeopardizing the safety of numerous population centresand cities  causing more flooding and mudslides andblocking the country’s main transportation arteries. Thishas brought further insecurity and anguish to ourpopulation  adding new losses and difficulties to thealready grave state of affairs we have faced since lastOctober.Hurricane Mitch and other natural phenomena ofuncommon violence lay bare the physical vulnerability ofour countries and highlight the absolute necessity of earlyand organized preventive measures. Such preventivemeasures can be achieved at the national  regional continental and  indeed  global levels only throughcombined  joint efforts and resources. No country  muchless a country that is poor in material resources  is up tothe task of bearing the massive destructive power of thesephenomena alone. This is a huge new challenge for theUnited Nations  whose diligent attention to this matter wetake this opportunity to request  knowing that it stands tosave thousands upon thousands of lives  spare us enormousdamage  and deflect immense ills.We  the Honduran people  have always valued theworld’s solidarity  for which we are most grateful  and havealso learned that brotherhood among men and amongnations is a value that we must not lose. On the contrary we must revitalize  strengthen and disseminate it  especiallynow that globalization and high-speed communications aredrawing States and continents closer together  making itpossible for one nation instantly to feel the pain that afflictsanother as if it affected us all directly.More than neighbours  we must be brethren. Beyondcooperation  we must sow the seeds of brotherhood.Solidarity is a fine thing  but brotherhood is stronger andmore human  because it breathes from the depth of ourhearts that divine  universal breath of life with which Godendows each and every one of his creatures so that weshould be equal and enjoy the planet’s wealth as equals.Since its founding in 1945  the United Nations hasplayed a preeminent role in the life of our planet. The 50nations that met at San Francisco  California  among whichthe Honduran people were honoured to count ourselves  andthat signed the United Nations Charter  have increased innumber over the years. Some have changed  while othershave disappeared as multinational or federated structures.Therefore  the challenges that the next century will placebefore the United Nations are new  even greater challenges and most likely will be even more difficult and will ariseever more frequently.The growing victories of human rights; the acceleratedexpansion of democracy as a system of governance andcoexistence among peoples; the rights of women andchildren  and the imperative to protect both against abuse discrimination and violence: these are matters that challengethe creative imagination of the world’s peoples andGovernments. They are paradigms for a new millennium whose portals we approach with a watchful mind and ahopeful heart.Peace; the environment; population growth; theabandonment of the fields and the forced  chaoticurbanization of our cities — which have thus becomeruralized; issues of food; the vast differences between asmall cluster of rich nations and an immense universe ofnations that are in a permanent process of pauperization;and the eradication of weapons of mass destruction: theseare but a few of the topics that transcend the boundariesof the centuries. These issues demand new approachesand solutions formulated in the light of the experiencesthat this waning century leaves us.Now  when the end of the twentieth century enablesus to be exceptionally privileged witnesses to a change ofmillennium  is a time for reflection  so that we mayharvest the century’s finest fruits and bear them across thebridge between the centuries. However  we must not carryto the other frontier of time those things that in thiscentury have produced the great disasters of war andagonizing tensions on the international scene; nor mustwe hold on to those that have segregated peoples anddismembered entire States or that have spawned themarginalization and exclusion that still torment a largepart of humanity.It is of the utmost necessity  then  that fraternityshould return to its rightful place in the triangle of liberalprinciples  the very ideals that gave birth to the rule oflaw and the concept of constitutionality  to harmony andequality among individuals and among nations  thusshaping democratic States and the paradigm of humanfreedom as the basis of the existence of humankind  itsvery raison d’être on this planet.We say that the elder siblings among the communityof nations must adopt the concept of fraternity as aprinciple and a guiding ethic for international coexistencewith their brethren  so that together — without exclusion without the yawning chasms that separate the great fromthe small  the wealthy from the impoverished — we mayall cross to the other side of the millennium with a newoutlook of justice  opportunity and hope  for the sake ofall that we are as the human race  and for the sake of allthe efforts  sacrifices and suffering expended in ourattempts to dodge the blows of economic disparity andunjust treatment in finance and markets. Yet we haveremained steadfast  and continue to do so through titanicefforts and countless sacrifices  to avoid being left behindby development  cultural trends and the scientific andtechnological benefits of transportation andcommunications. We have struggled for all of this whilegiving our heroes and martyrs to the cause of freedom;we stretch as far as we can to develop democratic rule inour States. We struggle each and every day to makedemocratic rule able to govern  credible  hope-inspiringand trustworthy in the eyes and hearts of the many whodo not always have the patience to wait until the benefits2of the system materialize  who despair and grow weary ofdreaming dreams that are difficult to attain.For democracy to survive the times and to justify thehigh price that we have paid for it  it must respond to theconcerns and aspirations of peoples. Protecting againstregression in what so many have paid dearly to achieve;preserving the advances we have made; and finding a wayto ensure that there will respond in a positive way for thebenefit of peoples: these are the greatest challenges that wecarry with us as we meet the coming millennium.Central Americans have learned  through bitterexperience and a painful toll of blood and sacrifice  thatfraternity is a higher value than mere neighbourliness  thatcooperation and understanding yield better fruit for us thanpast rivalries and local nationalisms and that there is nodifference  however serious it may appear  that we cannotresolve in a peaceful  harmonious and civilized manner.A few days ago the presidents of El Salvador andHonduras set a beautiful example for the continent and theworld when they ratified the Convention on Nationality andAcquired Rights which covers the inhabitants of the areasdelimited by the Judgment of 11 September 1992 of theInternational Court of Justice in the land  island andmaritime frontier dispute between El Salvador andHonduras. With this action  we have resolved  definitivelyand in perpetuity  the frontier dispute which for many yearscast a pall over our fraternal relations.The Central American bloc is today working towardsaccess to the United States market under conditions asadvantageous as those already enjoyed by other partners toour north; also  as a region we are seeking to open up thefield for ourselves in trade throughout the continent throughagreements with other existing blocs and with individualnations  including Mexico and countries of South America.Central America is preparing to cross the bridgebetween the millennia with all its republics more integratedwith each other than ever before  identifying with eachother in the common ideal of keeping ourselves united sothat we are stronger  of playing a stellar role in theAmerican continent  of turning the isthmus into a point ofstrategic convergence for world trade  and of writingourselves into a success story that will serve as an exampleand touchstone to the world community.The globalization process  which has accelerated overthe last decade  will continue to expand  creating challengesand chances  problems and opportunities. The dizzyingflows of capital which in a single day can wreakcatastrophic collapse on the economies of entire countriesand regions must surely merit special attention from thisOrganization. Our peoples fail to understand why theyshould be affected by breakdowns in the financial systemarising out of risk-taking and speculative flows in regionsof the world that are remote  alien and even unknown tothem. We are affected by them although we play no partin them and are not to blame for them  yet they raise theprices of our staples  rob us of development opportunities impoverish us even further and make life harder for us.Globalization ought to be an experience that generatesbroader possibilities and greater opportunities for allcountries and for all people  not greater imbalances andinequalities.In stark contrast to the elimination of customs andborder posts and to equal access to markets stands theneed to reinforce the identity of ethnic groups  nations countries and regions. Cultural diversity is a source oflegitimate pride  and of wealth  creativity and globalcomplementarity. Automation of mass production cannotand should not make human behaviour  the most preciousresource on our planet  automatic. Homogenizing theworld’s cultural diversity  by whatever means  would beas serious and unthinkable as eliminating the planet’sbiodiversity.The world’s age-old desire for a new world orderbased on peace  cooperation and fraternity between allcountries rather than on a balance of arms betweenpowerful and hegemonic States has already come to pass.Although there are still some local problems  andalthough some old nationalisms are once again raising theflag  the world is generally a much more peaceful andstable place than it was 100 years ago. Although smallgroups of terrorists are still rattling various countries inthe old world and the new  the truth is that  broadlyspeaking  we live in a world which is more peaceful —thank God — than the one our forebears knew. That iswhy we must indeed acknowledge that  despite all itsimperfections  the world has brought in a new worldorder at the end of this century and the dawn of the new an order led by the United Nations.In this new world order which we are seeing at theend of the second millennium  there is no more room forthe struggle left us by the Cold War  much less forEurope’s various hegemonies of the past three centuries.Nor is there any possibility that one State alone candominate the rest  as neither the human capacity nor thematerial resources exist to do so. Rather than the balance3of compulsion upon which the politics of coexistencebetween the world’s strongest States was based  whatpredominates now is multiple independence complementarity between States and internationalcooperation and  of course  teamwork as much in the questfor peace as in coping with civilian crises and naturaldisasters.Even a superficial look at events north and south  eastand west gives us an inkling that peace  international tradeand the fact that States now have no choice but tocooperate with each other have levelled the playing field ininternational relations: on the world stage  it is now not somuch a State’s economic clout or military capability thatdetermine whether its voice is heard in the debate but ratherits moral force  and especially its democratic values and itsideals in terms of protecting human rights. In our specificcontext here  there are no more big States and small States just members of the world community whether committedor not to the common task of making Planet Earth a realand effective place for human happiness for everyonewithout exception.With this in mind Honduras  together with the otherrepresentatives of this great community  the United Nations celebrates the new world order in which all of us areneeded and are even indispensable to maintaining anddeveloping it. A crisis between one State and another  orany internal difficulties arising out of conflicts rooted ininequity or because of nationalist  racial or religiousdemands  are no longer matters to be shrugged off.On the contrary  today  with the globalized view of theEarth  each State assumes responsibility for its ownprotection  not merely for its own sake  but because in thatway it guarantees the life and happiness of humankind forcenturies to come.Difficulties such as those in East Timor  the crisis inKosovo  the increasing nuclearization of the Indiansubcontinent or the rise in terrorism in Colombia andRussia are issues that concern us all. Although not allcountries participate in each peacekeeping and humanitarianmission  there is a disposition and openness in each andevery one of their inhabitants to respond to the calls forinternational solidarity  whose strongest voice is that of theUnited Nations  and especially that of its Secretary-General.In the Sahara  for several years now Honduran soldiershave participated in peacekeeping missions under UnitedNations command. We are sure that  like us  no othercountry skimps when it comes to offering cooperation andmaking sacrifices.Both the intervention of the Security Council in theKosovo conflict just recently and the organization of aninternational peacekeeping force for East Timor illustratethe efficacy of this system  which makes all of usbrethren  neighbours  friends and partners.It is undeniable that  even as the world has changedand with obvious respect among all States  the UnitedNations still operates using the mechanisms that wereestablished at its founding in 1945. The limited numberof Member States on the Security Council leaves outother States that  because of their contribution to thedevelopment of the world  should participate in the high-level decisions of that important organism of ourOrganization.Likewise  we believe it is time to providealternatives so that the veto power enjoyed by certainStates is limited to certain matters and certaincircumstances  and so that the mere protection of privateinterests does not have excessive influence or providejustification for aggressions directed at the rest of theworld community. To end the practice whereby the vetoserves as the Organization's last word should be a goal towhich all of the States represented here dedicate ampletime and consideration.The incorporation of three new Members into thisOrganization fills us with joy and hope  while inspiringconfidence that the Organization will treat the Republic ofChina in the same manner — that  as Taiwan expects  thenew world order will be reflected in greater respect forthe rights and values of Taiwan's inhabitants  includingrenewed respect for its aspirations to participate fully inthe greatest human organization on Earth. I do not wishto miss this opportunity to express the solidarity of thepeople of Honduras and of all Central America with thepeople of Taiwan as they suffer the terrible misfortunethat is afflicting that sister region of the world.To summarize  with regard to the new world order which we hope will prevail in this global forum Honduras supports broader representation of the peoplesand the nations of the world  and a more just andbalanced representation in the discussions and decisionsof the United Nations.Almost a year ago  my country was lashed by themost fearsome and destructive hurricane in history. Alongwith causing suffering among a noble and stoical people the tragedy made evident the sensitivity and diligence ofinternational cooperation and fraternity. Marked by4authentic sincerity and dedication to the highest values ofbrotherhood  in which we profoundly believe  messages ofconcern poured in from all over the world  along withassistance  which continues to flow  enabling the people andGovernment to reconstruct what the hurricane wrecked.Thanks to that fraternity  we have moved forward inthe process of rehabilitation and reconstruction and createda foundation for the transformation of Honduras — and thesame applies to Central America. I hereby declare that we the people of Honduras — with the tears from this recentand painful event still fresh  and while facing a new roundof anguish — are back on our feet  brimming with thevibrant spirit of utmost hope  ready to become a successstory in this world  to convert tragedy into opportunity.Regarding the cooperation that most of the countriespresent here have offered and continue to offer us  we takethis occasion  on behalf of the Honduran people and theGovernment over which I preside by the sovereign will ofits citizens  to extend our most heartfelt gratitude to all  andlikewise to confirm before the Assembly Honduras's desireto reciprocate — in a way that is commensurate with thegreatness of its heart and the legitimacy of its democraticinstitutions — for all that the world has with such deepaffection provided us in our time of trouble.All I would add is our most respectful request thatcooperating institutions and nations expedite the resourcesand projects that they have committed to Honduras'sreconstruction  which we urgently require now more thanever.On this occasion our country  never forgetting that itis a founding Member of the United Nations  calls for areform of our Organization so that a new order  based onworldwide cooperation and fraternity  can guarantee for allof us that the Earth was created not for the strongest andthe most powerful  but for all human beings.May God bless all nations. May God illuminate us all."
"72",3023,"HRV",54,1999,"Let me first extend sincerecongratulations to you  Sir  as the new President of theGeneral Assembly. I am confident that your richdiplomatic experience and the reputation you enjoy willplay an important role in leading the Assembly’s work.I would also like to give credit to Mr. Didier Operttiof Uruguay for the great skill and persistence he showedin presiding over the work of the fifty-third session of theGeneral Assembly.May I also welcome the three new Member States ofour Organization  Kiribati  Nauru and Tonga. The UnitedNations is richer for their membership.We are only one year away from the MillenniumAssembly  an event whose symbolism should inspire usto strive harder to achieve all the goals of theOrganization. In looking forward to the challenges of thefuture  our countries also realize that the world continuesto hold many dangers. It has been rightly said thatglobalization has two faces. While accounting for anincreasingly complex web of linkages across the fullspectrum of human endeavour  it has also led to increasedalienation and  in some cases  disparity. Quite clearly  theUnited Nations is at the forefront of efforts to address andreconcile these complex processes. The struggle to raiseand improve the quality of life of the hundreds ofmillions who continue to suffer the anguish of poverty the protection of our precious environment  thestrengthening of democracy and the protection of humanrights  responding effectively to natural disasters  further13progress in disarmament and dealing properly with securitycrises as they arise all continue to occupy us.Having mentioned the issue of security  allow me toobserve that the situation in South-Eastern Europe has comefull circle with the return of the epicentre of the crisis tothe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Kosovo  where itstarted more than a decade ago. The military interventionof the international community  supported by all thecountries of the region  including Croatia  must now befollowed up with an appropriate political response. Just aswe joined the international community in condemningviolations of human rights  it is clear that energies mustnow be concentrated on building a lasting and just peace.With regard to the security issue of Prevlaka  as withother matters resulting from the aggression and territorialpretensions of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  bilateralnegotiations have been unsuccessful. The simple reason isthat the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia does not wish toaccept Croatia's internationally recognized borders. Onlywhen the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia accepts Prevlakaas a purely security-related issue instead of considering ita territorial dispute  and refrains from abusing this issue ininternal Serbian-Montenegrin relations  will a solution be athand. The opening of border crossings with the Republic ofMontenegro has  by allowing for the freedom of movementof people and goods  significantly contributed to regionalstability and helped the democratic transformation ofMontenegro.Croatia has proposed the establishment of a bilateralsecurity regime as a follow-up to the present oneadministered by the United Nations Mission of Observersin Prevlaka (UNMOP). Whether as a result of successfulbilateral negotiations with the Federal Republic ofYugoslavia  of a Security Council resolution or even ofunilateral action consistent with the rights and duties ofCroatia under international law  the UNMOP mandateshould be terminated soon. Further prolongation of themandate will only serve those who wish to stallnegotiations indefinitely  which is contrary to good-neighbourly relations and the interests of stability in thewider region.The key legal issue arising from the disintegration ofthe former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslaviaremains that of succession. As long as this matter isunresolved  the prospects for lasting normalization in theregion will be hampered for all the successor States.Responsibility for this state of affairs lies squarely with theFederal Republic of Yugoslavia  which keeps rejecting theconclusions of the United Nations/European UnionConference on the Former Yugoslavia  as well as therelevant resolutions of the Security Council and theGeneral Assembly. Only if rooted in this existing body ofinternational law and authority can the question ofsuccession be resolved. Pending a full resolution of thisissue  the normal economic processes that mightotherwise promote stability and cooperation cannot havea positive effect  either on the region or on bilateralrelations.Over the past year  Croatia has persevered in itsdetermination to enlarge and enrich the content and scopeof its special bilateral relations with Bosnia andHerzegovina. I am particularly pleased to be able toinform the Assembly that we have recently resolved oneof the hitherto open questions in our relations with Bosniaand Herzegovina: an agreement has been signed settlingthe issue of our common border.Croatia will continue both to support theimplementation of the Dayton agreements regardingBosnia and Herzegovina and to maintain its commitmentto ensuring the rights of the Croats  as the least numerousof its three constituent peoples.Following a slow initial response  there has been aproliferation of both national and multinational initiativesthroughout the second half of the 1990s aimed at ensuringlong-term stability in South-Eastern Europe. The newStability Pact for South-Eastern Europe builds upon thesound foundation provided by the prospect of theinclusion of the States of the region in the Euro-Atlanticintegration processes. However  its success will dependupon an individual evaluation of the progress being madeby the respective States  an evaluation which should bebased upon simple  clear and transparent criteria.My country has welcomed the Pact as an importantdevelopment involving all the relevant international actorsand seeking a comprehensive solution. In the view ofCroatia  the strengths of the Pact — provided that it isimplemented to the letter — are  first  itscomprehensiveness and  secondly  its vision of integratingthe participating States into the Euro-Atlantic structures.In this way  we hope that it will marshal the hithertodispersed energies of the international community. Croatialends its full support to the process related to the Pact andreiterates its determination to continue to take an activerole in its implementation.14The joint success of the United Nations and theCroatian Government in peacefully reintegrating thepreviously occupied part of eastern Croatia early last yearhas been followed by the gradual return of displacedpersons to their homes  not only in that region  but also toother areas of Croatia. It is a complex process involving thereturn of Croats to their homes in the previously occupiedareas  and the return of Croatian Serbs to their homes fromother countries and from eastern Croatia to other parts ofthe country.While the difficult economic circumstances particularly in the areas of return  are certainly not helpingthe process  they are affecting all citizens equally. In spiteof these objective circumstances  the national Programmefor the Return and Accommodation of Displaced Persons Refugees and Exiled Persons is being successfullyimplemented and has resulted in the return of 65 000Croatian Serbs.Croatia maintains intensive relations with theInternational war crimes Tribunal for the formerYugoslavia. It has taken numerous steps  from providingdocumentation and access to alleged crime sites to assistingin the voluntary surrender of indicted persons to theTribunal. Whenever a legal dispute has arisen  Croatia hassought ways of resolving it through proceedings within theTribunal Chamber itself. However  while it has lent its fullsupport and cooperation to the Tribunal  Croatia is not fullysatisfied with the results to date. Indictments issued so fardo not adequately reflect the true nature and scope of thewar crimes committed by different sides in the conflict. Theunusual delay in bringing persons in custody before thecourt — in some cases more than two years  despite theinitial assurances of speedy trials — has not strengthenedthe Tribunal's credibility.No one has been charged for the crimes committedagainst Bosnian Croats — despite assurances given as longago as the Dayton negotiations — and no one has beensentenced for crimes committed during the aggressionagainst Croatia  despite ample evidence and 14 000 deaths.Allow me to repeat what I have said on previousoccasions in this forum. The Federal Republic ofYugoslavia continues to harbour the notorious war criminalMile Martic and the perpetrators of the most heinous warcrimes committed in Vukovar — Mrksic  Sljivancanin andRadic. Its stance overtly defies the will of the SecurityCouncil  the international community and justice in general.It also poses a big obstacle to the reconciliation process.We have witnessed tremendous advances during thetwentieth century. However  many challenges remain particularly if we are to eradicate poverty  protect ourenvironment  and promote and achieve sustained socialdevelopment and economic growth.The recent important deliberations and work of theEconomic and Social Council have confirmed that theCouncil is an important forum for addressing the manifoldissues arising from globalization. Croatia believes thatimplementation of the negotiated outcomes in the broadsubject areas of sustainable development is the key topromoting the global agenda of leaving a healthy planetEarth for future generations to enjoy. The system ofinternational conferences  now undergoing their five-yearreviews  and the United Nations system as a whole  havea leading role to play in this regard. It is with all thesefactors in mind that Croatia has chosen the Economic andSocial Council as the first principal body to which topresent its candidature.Our hopes and goals for the future notwithstanding the world is still encumbered with the legacies of thetwentieth century. The scourge of war and all that violentconflicts bring with them are still a clear and ever-presentconcern. The United Nations must be ready to cope withthese challenges. This inevitably requires reform of theOrganization. There is  of course  a broad consensusabout the need for reform  but as always  the devil is inthe details. The United Nations needs to have mechanismsat its disposal to address the issues arising from the newinternational order in a timely and efficient manner. Thereforms within the competency of the Secretary-Generalare moving ahead. The Member States should now graspthe symbolism of the new millennium in order toconclude the reform process.The reform of the Security Council remains stalled.The primary task of the Council  the maintenance ofinternational peace and security  makes its representationand transparency  and hence its reform  highly important.Questions related to mine clearance and to thedestruction of anti-personnel and other types of mines area matter of special concern to Croatia. In spite of the factthat much work is being done to alleviate this problem hundreds of thousands of mines still lie scattered over6 000 square kilometres of Croatia's territory. Havingratified the Ottawa Convention last year  Croatia waspleased to host a regional conference on anti-personnelmines in Zagreb in July this year and thus share its15experience and expertise directed at ridding the world ofthese terrible weapons.The United Nations is best known for its peacekeepingrole around the world. Croatia  which has hosted fiveseparate peacekeeping operations on its territory  has inrecent weeks taken on the role of a contributor ofpeacekeepers. As we have announced in the past  throughits participation in the United Nations mission in SierraLeone Croatia will now be able to repay in kind the gooddeeds previously bestowed on it. The Croatian Governmentis honoured by this responsibility and is confident that itssoldiers will be exemplary members of the United Nationsforce. Additionally  we welcome the evolutionarydevelopments in the area of peacekeeping  from the use ofcivilian police and preventive forces to the “WhiteHelmets” proposal.The promotion and protection of human rights requiresconstant vigilance and effort by all responsibleGovernments. The Croatian Government  through itsNational Committee for Human Rights Education  incooperation with the United Nations Educational  Scientificand Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and experts from theCouncil of Europe  is preparing a national programme onhuman rights education targeting schoolchildren at theprimary and secondary levels.Croatia continues to follow closely the progress beingmade towards establishing an International Criminal Court.The establishment of an efficient  permanent InternationalCriminal Court will be a milestone in the march towardsthe universal protection of human rights and the rule oflaw. Croatia has signed the Statute of the Court and looksforward to other States doing so  too  so that this greatachievement of the international community can commenceits operation as soon as possible.The present session of the General Assembly will bevital in preparing for the coming Millennium Assembly. Itis important that this Assembly be well prepared so that itis an event of substance rather than of ceremonial character.Croatia hopes that it will be a real crossroads and that itwill succeed in providing guidelines for a better and moretolerant world in the coming millennium.Allow me to conclude by noting that Croatia islooking forward to the work of the fifty-fourth session hopeful that it will bring further progress in addressing thechallenges and grasping the opportunities of our times."
"73",3068,"HTI",54,1999,"TheRepublic of Haiti finds it a source of genuine satisfactionthat the fifty-fourth regular session of the GeneralAssembly is being presided over by Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab a man for whom we have a great deal of admiration. Withpositive results  he has competently and responsibly servedhis country  Namibia  which is quite rightly considered oneof the symbols of the success of our Organization. We takethis opportunity to wish him every success in thetremendous and noble task he has undertaken.We pay tribute to Mr. Didier Opertti  Foreign Ministerof Uruguay  who so effectively conducted the proceedingsof the fifty-third session.We also take this opportunity to convey our mostsincere greetings to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan who  at a time when our world is facing many challenges has known how to use his intelligence and the wisdom ofhis great experience to help the community of nations faceup to the inevitable changes of the twenty-first century.We also welcome  with great satisfaction  theadmission of the Republic of Kiribati  the Republic ofNauru and the Kingdom of Tanga as full-fledged Membersof our Organization. They will strengthen the universalnature of the Organization and enrich its diversity of pointsof view.We take the floor this 1 October  one day after theanniversary of the bloody coup d’état of 1991  a genuineact of assassination of democracy and of the dream of anentire people. Without the determined action of the UnitedNations and its Members  contemplating this sad anddeadly event would have been even more painful for thepeople of Haiti today. We would therefore like to expressonce again our gratitude to the international communityfor having ensured the restoration of democraticconstitutional order in Haiti.Since that restoration of democracy  the Governmentand the people of Haiti  helped by the internationalcommunity  have worked zealously to ensure anenvironment favourable to the blossoming of democracyand economic progress. This effort has not yet yielded theresults we had hoped for  because over the last five yearsthe Republic of Haiti has had to confront problems arisingfrom the complexity of its situation. But through the willof our people and its Government  the Haitian dream ofdemocracy will become a reality.Above all  the Government of the Republic is stillconvinced of the critical importance of the renewal of itsinstitutions  in particular of the Parliament  most of whosemembers had their term of office expire on 11 January1999. To this end  fair  honest  democratic elections willbe organized in the next few months. The head of State Mr. René Préval  has repeatedly and solemnly affirmedhis determination to create the conditions to make itpossible for the elections to be organized by theProvisional Electoral Council. Of course  as guarantor ofthe functioning of the institutions  the President of theRepublic has considered that the most important thing isthe establishment of the physical conditions necessary forwell-organized elections  rather than hasty elections theresults of which might be called into question because oforganizational shortcomings. For President Préval  theholding of the elections must lead to a solution to ourcrisis and not its perpetuation  or even the creation of yetanother crisis.In order to work to consolidate its achievements  theGovernment hopes that a consensus will be found tocontinue technical assistance for professionalizing theNational Police  in strict compliance with Haitian law.The Government of the Republic wants to avoid anyinterruption of the effort to thoroughly reform the judicialsystem and to promote full respect for all dimensions ofhuman rights.18The fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly isundoubtedly a highly symbolic moment. As the last sessionof this century  it ought to come up with a vision thatwould make our Organization an essential and efficientinstrument for meeting the challenges that await us in thetwenty-first century. We know the contours of this vision as they were sketched after the Stockholm Conference onthe Human Environment  the World Summit for SocialDevelopment in Copenhagen and the Rio Earth Summit.The sketch is filled in by the ideal of the peoples of thewhole world  as expressed in our Charter: to save futuregenerations from the scourge of war  to ensure respect forfundamental human rights  to promote social progress andto establish better conditions of living in greater freedom.Thus  our task at this fifty-fourth session should be to fullywork out  by means of our discussions and the work of thevarious committees  the concept and ways of implementingthis vision.The fifty-fourth session will also be an opportunity forthe United Nations to give deeper thought to its mission ofensuring international peace and security and of promotingeconomic and social development. In this regard  theRepublic of Haiti is happy to note that the situation in EastTimor is improving following the actions of theinternational community and its cooperation with theIndonesian authorities. We hope that the presence of themultinational peace force will help bring the country out ofthe chaos into which it has been plunged. We urge theIndonesian Government and its allies in East Timor to fullyrespect the decision of the ballot box and to take measuresto ensure East Timor’s peaceful transition to independenceand democracy.The Republic of Haiti also welcomes the end of thestate of war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. TheAgreement signed in Lusaka  under the aegis of PresidentFrederick Chiluba  between the protagonists in this conflictis clear evidence that Africa is in the process of providingitself with the means to become master of its diplomaticand geographical destiny.The Republic of Haiti calls upon India and Pakistan todo everything possible to find a permanent solution to theKashmir conflict and to put an end to their nuclear armsrace  which is indeed a frightening process that divertstremendous financial resources and brainpower todestruction when they could be put at the service ofsurvival and development.Once again the Haitian Government reiterates itscondemnation of all forms of terrorist activities that mightcause material and human damage. We reaffirm our faithin the fundamental rights of man and in the generalprinciples of international law as the basis of norms thatgovern the relations among States.In the face of the conflicts that threaten internationalpeace and security  it is reassuring that the Director-General of the United Nations Educational  Scientific andCultural Organization  Mr. Federico Mayor  has had theidea of promoting throughout the world the culture ofpeace  which is so vital to good relations within andbetween nations. The promotion of a genuine culture ofpeace is inseparable from the democratization of theinternational order. One of the fundamental aspects of thisdemocratization lies in the solution to the question ofequitable representation in the Security Council. It is timefor this Assembly to reach a consensus on this subject ofsuch crucial importance for the future of ourOrganization.An equally important point for establishing agenuine culture of peace is the implementation of UnitedNations resolutions in the realm of international security.Many resolutions have not been implemented when theirimplementation would be decisive  not only in the contextof North-South relations  but also in the context of theindispensable relationships to be developed betweenStates  international institutions and non-governmentalorganizations.Over the last two months  the Government and thepeople of Haiti have observed with sadness andhelplessness the destruction wreaked and the terrible tolltaken by the natural disasters that have struck Turkey Taiwan  Greece  the Bahamas and the United States. Wewish to reiterate to the people of these countries that weshare their pain and offer our heartfelt solidarity  havingourselves  unfortunately  experienced such disasters.We take this opportunity to repeat that the HaitianGovernment is following attentively the evolution ofrelations between the two countries on the Taiwan Strait.Our Government notes with satisfaction that the two sidesare undertaking measures to establish a climate ofconfidence  respect and prosperity  which will be of theutmost benefit to the peoples who live there.At the dawn of the new millennium  the fight for theelimination of poverty remains one of the most nobletasks of the United Nations system  in order to establish as we are bidden by our Charter  better living conditionsfor the human beings living on this earth.19President Gurirab recently echoed the feelings of thevast majority of developing countries when he noted thatglobalization might open the floodgates of competition insuch a way that certain States would be wiped off the map.Therefore it is up to the United Nations and to each countryto examine attentively the means of remedying the illeffects of globalization on the social and economicstructures of every country — and particularly its effects onsmall developing countries. Certainly globalization has itspositive side  bringing human communities closer togetherpolitically  socially and culturally. But it must not be usedas a pretext for a standardization that might neutralize thediversity that is the very strength of humanity.On the eve of the third millennium what should uniteus more than ever  beyond our differences and often highlydivergent interests  is the laying down of foundations tobring about the security of all and the elimination ofpoverty as the initial phase of a planetary process of truesustainable development."
"74",3114,"HUN",54,1999,"Allowme first to congratulate the President most sincerely onhis election to the presidency of the fifty—fourth sessionof the General Assembly. I take this opportunity to assurehim of the full support of the Hungarian delegation in theexercise of his responsibilities as the head of ourAssembly.Humanity has reached the threshold of thetwenty—first century. Therefore  no Member State canremain indifferent to the way in which we discharge ourtasks at this session  held as the twentieth century ends.One of the most urgent tasks of States andinternational organizations at the turn of the century is toend the ever—growing disparities between the variousregions of the world. In this regard  special attention27should be paid to the African continent  which is fraughtwith various crises and conflicts.The persistence of poverty  still one of our majorchallenges  is exacerbated by the process of globalization.Inequality is a major source of the emergence andproliferation of all kinds of extremism and of intolerance with its concomitant violence  which threaten the veryfoundations of contemporary civilization.At the dawn of this new century  we are called uponto exploit further the advantages of globalization  a salientfeature of our era  while being aware of the attendant risks.All of us in the international community must becomeaware of the paramount importance of dealing adequatelywith global problems  such as the growing gap between thelevels of economic development; environmentaldegradation; the dangers posed by organized crime;uncontrolled migration; disease and so on.In this context  we must take note of the relationshipbetween globalization and regional integration. Integrationcan adjust itself to the process of globalization  draw thelessons of the process's inevitable consequences  absorb itsrelated risks and assist the struggle against transboundaryscourges  thereby becoming the engine of the universalsystem of economic cooperation.Most conflicts today are not between States  but withinStates  essentially as major ethnic or religiousconfrontations that too often lead to humanitarian crises ofunprecedented dimensions. Entire ethnic groups andcommunities and national and linguistic minorities arefalling victim to “ethnic cleansing”. Dictatorial regimes donot hesitate to resort to nationalist extremism andxenophobia  and to unspeakable violence  exterminatinghundreds of thousands of people  terrorizing others in theirancestral lands and expelling millions of people from theirhomes. We cannot remain indifferent to such acts.A great debate is therefore going on in theinternational arena  as demonstrated in this very Hall  abouthow the world should react to tragic situations involvingmassive and flagrant violations of human rights at a timewhen  for all kinds of reasons  our world Organization findsitself paralysed. We are convinced that  given the terribleupheavals we are witnessing throughout the world  theinternational community cannot fail to respond effectivelyto this major present-day challenge.The traditional concept of the principle of nationalsovereignty is undergoing a progressive evolution in inter-State relations and within multilateral organizations.Because of developments in the area of international law national sovereignty is becoming less acceptable as ajustification for Governments in cases of seriousviolations within their countries of universally recognizedinternational legal standards. As the Secretary-Generalrightly said  in our era of globalization the collectiveinterest represents national interests. Fortunately  todaythe principles of good governance are prevailing andflourishing in an ever-growing number of countries.In the immediate vicinity of my country  a regimebased on extreme nationalism has sparked four wars inthe last decade. The international community  albeit afterhesitation and delay  took the necessary measures. In thecase of Kosovo  it did so with great resolve andconsistency. In the wake of the action undertaken todefend universally recognized values  and thanks to thepresence of international military forces and the UnitedNations mission  a fragile peace reigns today in thatmartyred region  and considerable  increasingly effectiveefforts are being deployed there with a view to establishpeace and stability.In the light of the events of the past decade in thispart of Europe  let us state clearly and unambiguouslythat it would be pointless to expect democratization in theFederal Republic of Yugoslavia if things remainunchanged in Belgrade. However  a new Serbia  emergingfrom tragedy and destruction  free of the burdens of thepast  would no doubt be able to rely on the understandingand effective assistance of the international community.In this context  we would underscore the importance ofthe implementation of the judgments of the InternationalTribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. The Stability Pact devised with a view to responding to the needs of thecountries of South-Eastern Europe  will play a primaryrole in the rehabilitation and development of the region.It will also contribute to promoting respect for democraticstandards and human rights by proposing  inter alia institutional arrangements aimed at improving relationsbetween majority and minority communities within theregion.The international community is again being put tothe test in the case of East Timor. Hungary shares theprofound concerns of all nations in the wake of recentevents  which represent a brutal violation of the right ofthe people of that country to self-determination. Theatrocities committed against the civilian population ofEast Timor represent a serious blow to human rights.Those responsible for these acts will be brought to justice.28We welcome the decision of the Security Councilauthorizing the deployment to East Timor of a multinationalforce to restore peace and security on the island as well asthe enactment of all necessary measures for theimplementation of that force's mandate.The tragic events in Kosovo and East Timor onlyconfirm the universality of human rights and the importanceof a timely resolution of conflict by appropriate means.They also demonstrate the value of harmonious cooperationbetween the United Nations  regional organizations andparticular groups of States  a cooperation that is becomingincreasingly important in dealing with the diverse andvaried conflicts that are erupting — and  unfortunately  willcontinue to erupt — throughout the world. Hungary isprepared  with its own means  to take part in this greatenterprise of safeguarding and restoring international peaceand security.Among the phenomena that threaten peace andsecurity throughout the world  the question of theproliferation of weapons of mass destruction will requiresustained attention in future. Regional conflicts havingnuclear ramifications only aggravate the destabilizing effectof certain crisis areas.Against this backdrop  the pillars of the global non-proliferation system — such as the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  whose ReviewConference will be one of the major events on next year'sdiplomatic calendar  or the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) — take on additional significance. Weregret that the CTBT has not yet been able to exert itsfavourable influence on the process of nuclear disarmamentand non-proliferation. We would like here to underscore theresponsibility of the 44 States whose ratification is neededfor this key instrument to enter into force. My country  asone of the States in question  has already ratified the Treatyand thereby discharged its obligations. The internationalconference to be convened next October in Vienna is likelyto play an important role in speeding up the process leadingto the entry into force of this instrument. We would begratified if those States that have not yet acceded to theTreaty participated in that conference and decided  in thenear future  to sign and ratify the Treaty.We would underscore also the need to commence  assoon as possible  negotiations on a fissile material cut-offtreaty. The entry into force of the Ottawa Convention onanti-personnel mines could contribute tangibly to resolvingthe humanitarian  economic and social problems stemmingfrom the massive and irresponsible use of these mines. Inthat connection  we note with satisfaction the outcome ofthe Maputo meeting. Hungary was one of the firstcountries to join the Ottawa process and recentlycompleted the destruction of its stocks of anti-personnelmines. We hope that other countries in the region willfollow our example  as this could contribute to theelimination of all of these lethal devices in the crisis areaalong our southern border.We would also note the importance of speeding upnegotiations to conclude a verification protocol annexedto the Biological Weapons Convention. We believe thatthese negotiations could be completed sometime betweennow and next summer. As Chairman of the ad hoc Groupmandated to draft a verification protocol  Hungary isprepared to contribute to any political initiative that couldpromote its implementation.I cannot fail to mention the establishment of anInternational Criminal Court — a deeply significantundertaking. In our view  the Court is an indispensableinstitution if we are to take action against crimes againsthumanity and war crimes. The Court will not only bringto justice people who have been accused of seriouscrimes  but will also act as a deterrent  therebycontributing to the maintenance of regional andinternational peace and security. We hope that the numberof signatures and ratifications of the Rome Statute willcontinue to grow and that disputed questions relating tothe universal acceptance of the Court will be resolved assoon as possible.Acts of terrorism in recent weeks sadly remind us ofthe great challenge involved in combating thisphenomenon. They underscore the importance of makingnew efforts and the imperative need for concertedinternational action in this area. We hope that at thissession of the General Assembly we will be able to gobeyond the universal introduction and completeimplementation of international agreements relating toterrorism that are already in force  and move forward thework of finalizing international agreements relating tonuclear terrorism and the prevention of financing forterrorism.The authority and prestige of the United Nationsdepend to a large extent on the capacity of its MemberStates to reform the Organization. In the light of theexperience of recent years  it is very clear that reform isa long-term process and will be probably consist ofvarious interconnected stages. The achievements thus far though insufficient in themselves  are valuable elements29that must be built upon if we are to go further along thislong road leading to the transformation and revitalization ofthe world Organization  including the reform of the SecurityCouncil. What is certain is that if we are to succeed  allMember States  without exception  will have to get to workwith a greater sense of commitment. We expect themillennium summit  to be held next year  to give thenecessary impetus to the dynamic continuation of UnitedNations reform.As has been repeated on many occasions  ourparamount task today is to make this unique Organization the United Nations  capable of preserving the values of ourcivilization in a twenty-first century that promises to beturbulent. At the dawn of the year 2000  which also marksthe thousandth anniversary of the foundation of our State it is up to all of us — Governments  the business world andcivil society — to make our planet a decent and habitableplace for future generations."
"75",3161,"IDN",54,1999,"On behalf of the Indonesiandelegation  I should first like to congratulate my colleagueand good friend Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  Foreign Minister ofNamibia  on his election as President of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-fourth session. We are confident thatunder his leadership we will achieve substantial progress inour work.To his predecessor  Mr. Didier Opertti  I convey oursincere appreciation for his able guidance of our workduring the last session.I join other members in paying a tribute to ourSecretary-General for his untiring pursuit of the objectivesof the United Nations Charter.On behalf of the Government and people of Indonesia I extend a warm welcome to Kiribati  Nauru and Tonga ontheir accession to membership of the United Nations. Mydelegation looks forward to working closely with them.Every year at this time  for more than a decade now I have tried from this rostrum to present Indonesia's viewson the state of world affairs and international relations.Today  I could deliver last year's statement  or even that ofthree years ago  and it would not make much differencebecause there really has been no significant change.It is true that there are always a number of positivedevelopments. This year they include the Sharm el-SheikhMemorandum signed by Palestinian President Yasser Arafatand Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak  which raises ourhopes for the resumption of the derailed Middle East peaceprocess. They include also the Lomé Peace Agreement onSierra Leone; the Framework Agreement on the conflictbetween Eritrea and Ethiopia  the Ceasefire Agreement onthe Democratic Republic of the Congo  some progress inthe rehabilitation of Bosnia and Herzegovina  and theresolution of the stalemate over the Lockerbie incident.Closer to home  there have been the signing of the 5 May1999 Agreements reached in New York and theimplementation of the historic popular consultation inEast Timor which — although  most unfortunately  itsaftermath was marred by violence — remains animportant  positive development. These are allencouraging steps in a long journey towards just anddurable solutions.In the economic field  investor confidence isbeginning to trickle back into the Asian economiesseverely hit by the financial and economic crisis. Thisreturn of confidence and the positive signs in the affectedeconomies — such as stability of currencies and lowerinterest rates — could be the first firm indications of arecovery. Recently the G-8 decided to ease the debtburden of the poorest countries by expanding the HeavilyIndebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative. This will help thepoorest countries get back on the road of development.But ours is still an essentially brutal world. In manyplaces  wanton violence and armed conflicts persist  oftenbringing about humanitarian disaster. In spite of thepresence of a United Nations peacekeeping force  Serbsand Albanian Kosovars are still shooting each other inKosovo. In Afghanistan  dialogue has been abandonedand once more the warring factions have taken to thebattlefield. In South Asia  an uneasy ceasefire reigns overthe line of control between two neighbouring States withnuclear-weapon capability. Meanwhile  in the backwatersand slums of the developing world  in the ghettos of theindustrialized countries  hundreds of millions fight adesperate war against poverty  ignorance and disease.There has as yet been no fulfilment of a hope we allshare  a hope to which we have clung for nigh on acentury.A hundred years ago  electricity was just beginningto light up the cities of the world  the commercialmanufacture of horseless carriages had just begun and thepioneers of air travel were taking off in crude flyingmachines. But it was beyond question even then thatenormous power called science and technology had beenplaced in the hands of humankind. It was clear even thenthat the prudent use of such power could solve theproblem of poverty that for millenniums people acceptedand suffered as an inevitable part of the human condition.Since then  unfortunately  that power has been usedinstead to enlarge humankind's capacity to kill anddestroy. That terrible capacity was amply demonstrated intwo world wars that levelled cities and decimatedpopulations in Europe and Asia. In time of peace  science34and technology have made it possible for one part ofhumanity to adopt an irresponsible lifestyle and patterns ofproduction and consumption that ravage the fragile ecologyof this planet while teeming millions  in the squalor ofpoverty  driven by the pangs of hunger  are tearing theirenvironment apart in a desperate bid to survive.Five decades ago  the human race teetered on thebrink of a nuclear holocaust  but we were able to postponethe effective end of history because between us and theprecipice stood the one shining achievement of humanity ina violent century  the United Nations. Founded in the wakeof the Second World War as a forum for maintainingsecurity  resolving conflicts and serving development  theUnited Nations is  whatever its flaws  a masterpiece ofhuman reason.It has not achieved its finest promise of global peace nor has it significantly curbed poverty. Still  it has managedto save us from the horrors of yet another world war  onefought with nuclear weapons. And together with itsspecialized agencies and related institutions  it is carryingout an immense array of activities in support of economicdevelopment and social progress; these are touching everyaspect of people's lives all over the world  and thus at leastkeep hopes alive.But even the very instrument of our salvation is notspared our recklessness: the United Nations has beenallowed to go bankrupt at a time when so much more isdemanded of it as the central mechanism and catalyst formultilateral cooperation. Its organs should be working inharmony and complementing one another: instead  we havethe spectacle of a Security Council — when not paralysedby the veto of a permanent member — venturing to takeover the work of other United Nations organs in such fieldsas human rights  democracy and humanitarian aid. Theunhappy truth is that the inequities  imbalances anddiscrimination in international relations that the UnitedNations was supposed to cure have infected its own vitalorgans and processes.This is true not only of the United Nations itself butalso of related multilateral institutions. This is why it hasbeen so difficult to reform  democratize and empower theUnited Nations  and so difficult to make the membership ofthe Security Council truly reflect the political  economicand demographic realities of the world today.Although the work of the Council is focused onconflict situations that are mostly in the developing world developing countries are woefully under-represented onthe Council.For the same reason  nuclear disarmament hasachieved no substantial progress in recent years. In fact the nuclear arms race has surged along as countries seekto join and enjoy the dubious privileges of being nuclear-weapon States. The world thus remains in danger ofnuclear self-destruction.The same situation obtains in multilateral economicforums. They  too  have become afflicted with theinequities and imbalances they are meant to rectify. Theintroduction of irrelevant social issues and undueemphasis on unfettered markets in these forums havebrought about the neglect of core development issues such as international cooperation for development  theneed for non-commercial financial flows and the necessityof differential treatment for developing countries.Thus  the international agenda has been steered bythe desire of developed countries to open doors for theirforeign investments  private capital flows and exports.This has led to the eclipse of development as a commongoal and a common responsibility of developed anddeveloping nations. It has engendered a tendency to forgetcommitments reached at global conferences onenvironment and development  social development population and development  women and development habitat and food.Just over a decade ago  with the barriers of the coldwar broken down  science and technology unlocked theawesome force of globalization. This blind force couldhave served as the chief instrument of a unitedhumankind in a decisive assault against the globalproblems of poverty and underdevelopment. We couldhave enlisted it to empower people everywhere and thusbroaden participation in governance and productiveinitiatives. We could have built a more equitablepartnership between the developed and the developingworld. But at best  the weaker economies were left to thetender mercies of the market. At worst  globalization hasbeen used by the strong to press their advantage over theweak  widening the chasm between rich and poor.After all this  what can we say to sum up thepassing of 100 years? If progress means going to themoon and exploring outer space; if it means the rapidmovement of money  goods and people from onecontinent to another and the delegation of personalinitiative to clever machines  then we have made some35progress. But if it means the conquest of poverty  thetaming of the human penchant for conflict and violence and ensuring the long-term sustainability of human life  Iam afraid that we may be entering the new millennium notreally much better off than we were a century ago.Our tragedy is not in our ignorance  but in the wasteof our wisdom. The truth is that we know the solutions toour problems. We know what kind of global partnership itwould take to tackle the problems of poverty andunderdevelopment. We have spelled out the globalmeasures to initiate in order to prevent the irreversibledecay of our environment. And we are aware of what itwould take to move the disarmament agenda forward; whatkind of representation on the Security Council would makeit a true instrument of the whole international community.But we do not make the necessary decisive movesbecause these require change — profound and radicalchange. There must be change not only in our methods  butin the way we look at the world  the way we regard oneanother and ourselves. That kind of change brings nocomfort and poses the deepest challenge to our faith andour courage. Hence  we hesitate. The protracted debates inthis Assembly  in the Economic and Social Council  in theConference on Disarmament and in many other forums arein reality just one long hesitation.We in Indonesia know how difficult that kind ofchange can be. In response to the Asian financial andeconomic crisis  as well as to its social and political impact we have begun to reform our social  economic and politicalinstitutions. New laws are being passed  new ways arebeing tried to give our people the widest opportunity toparticipate in the making of decisions that affect their lives to level the economic playing fields and to earn theconfidence of our foreign partners.The Government has taken a long  hard look at itselfand its responsibilities today. In the case of East Timor  ourresponsibility has changed. Twenty-four years ago  it wasour responsibility to accept the Territory as a province ofour Republic in order to stop ongoing fratricidal carnageafter a disastrously bungled decolonization process; toaccommodate the desire of the majority of East Timoreseat that time to seek freedom and sanctuary throughintegration with our Republic; and to contribute to thesecurity and stability of the Asia-Pacific region. Weaccepted that responsibility and additional burden  althoughwe had never laid claim to that half-island  as it was not apart of the Dutch East Indies out of which the Indonesiannation evolved. Today our responsibility and ourcommitment are to help make possible the fulfilment ofthe newly expressed will of the majority of East Timoreseto seek a new destiny outside the Indonesian Republic.We will abide by that responsibility and commitment andat the same time ensure that the parting of ways willproceed honourably  peacefully and amicably.In this process of change  not only in East Timor butalso throughout our national life and in our relations withour friends  we have not had an easy time. We have hadmore than our share of setbacks  frustrations andmistakes. In the depths of every disappointment  we havehad to summon the courage to persevere  to start all overagain whenever necessary  because there is no alternativeacceptable to our people. We do pray for the courage tochange  but not for ourselves alone.For the solutions to the global problems of our timedemand a fortitude on the part of nations that is strongenough to break the doubts  the prejudices  the sophistryand the apathy that have hardened with the passing ofdecades. That means the courage to take action where wehave only paid lip-service. It also means the courage torecognize that many of our problems are complex anddemand more creativity from us than we have so fardemonstrated.For instance  we fully agree that massive andsystematic violations of human rights  wherever they takeplace  should not be tolerated or condoned. But we cannotagree that this problem can be solved only by sacrificingthe principle of national sovereignty and sovereignequality among nations. There must be a solution thatdoes not threaten to demolish a principle on which theUnited Nations itself was founded. Let us have theintellectual courage to look for that solution and bewilling to make any sacrifice to attain it  except thesacrifice of our principles.If many of us have grown cynical  I believe that itis not out of arrogance  but out of fear of theconsequences of change  the loss of some privilege oradvantage over another  or out of fear of futility andfailure. We can overcome these fears because they are butshadows on the wall; they have no substance. There willbe failures and there will be setbacks  but if what we setout to do is worthwhile  and nothing is more worthwhilethan the perpetuation of humankind  we will succeed.Let us now all act in consonance with ourcommitments to the United Nations Charter; to the Treatyon the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT); to36Agenda 21; to the Uruguay Round and the World TradeOrganization (WTO); to all agreements on internationalfinancial flows for development; on cooperation on humanrights; on the eradication of all forms of discrimination. Wecannot bring all of these to fruition in a single day  andsome of them not even in a full decade  but if we all dothat today  it will be enough to start with.If we keep building on that to achieve somethingsignificant  we engender encouragement. We add to thefund of courage that the world needs to become a betterone. And that fund of courage is all it will take forhumanity to make an auspicious entry into the nextmillennium."
"76",3208,"IND",54,1999,"It is a particular pleasure to seeMr. Gurirab presiding over the last session of the GeneralAssembly of the twentieth century. I consider myselfsingularly fortunate and greatly honoured to be representingmy country  India  on this occasion. I do believe that  in themany years that he spent here pursuing the dream ofindependence for his people — which  happily  is now areality — he  more perhaps than others  has seen the UnitedNations at its best. That is why the perspective that hebrings to the office of the President  enriched as it is byliving through the very articles of faith of the UnitedNations  is near unique. I am sure we will all profit from it.I take this opportunity also to warmly welcome threenew Members to the United Nations: Kiribati  Nauru andTonga. I have no doubt their presence shall enrich ourdeliberations.Even as I address this Assembly  the century draws toa close and the world prepares to meet the year 2000. It isonly appropriate and instructive  therefore  to look back andto reflect upon the journey that humanity set out upon 100years ago. Where did we think we were then headed andwhere have we actually reached? Could any then foreseewhat 1999 would bring? Thus  are there  in the passage ofthe years that have gone by  any landmarks that couldindicate a path for our future? For that  we need to assessthe twentieth century  and there is but one yardstick bywhich we can judge: the criteria of the stated objectivesof the United Nations.Indisputably  the twentieth has been the bloodiest ofall centuries. But  in contradistinction  it has also been acentury of the most profound transformations and of themost significant social  political and technologicaladvancements. This  above all  has been the century ofthe ascendancy of the individual and of democracy. It isthat period in which dynasties vanished and revolutionsswept empires off the face of ancient lands. Centuries-oldcolonialism became history against the irresistible heaveof the colonized to reclaim their lands  their souls  so thatoppressed humanity could regain a voice  a say in its ownpolitical and economic destiny. It is the century in whichwe plumbed the depths of the oceans and soared into theinfinities of space; when man first set foot on the moon reached Mars and even deeper into the recesses of theunknown. In a wired-up world  the computer has todaybecome what the fountain pen was in the early years ofthe twentieth century. The revolution of the digital hasarrived.Humanity today is healthier  better fed and moresheltered than our forefathers were. But want and hunger disease and deprivation are still widespread  including indeveloped societies. We have at our command moreinformation than ever before  but are we that much wiser?Literacy has spread  but is mankind better educated? Weare more connected globally  but are we as humankind?Have this linkage and interconnection reduced conflictand animosity? And thus  the tabulation of our assets andliabilities of this century flows.As we have improved upon and added to almosteverything that we inherited in 1900  so most sadly havewe to violence  too. This century has been the mostbloodthirsty  perhaps because it is in these last 100 yearsthat humanity has employed science to perfect means ofkilling as never before. Our passage has seen us movefrom the Gatling gun to a world menaced today byMIRVs. That early machine gun  the then-great mowerdown of the early 1900s  seems today almost a toy bycomparison. We have split the atom  but employ thereleased energy less for peace and more for weapons ofunimaginable destruction. Chemical defoliants andsophisticated biological weapons are also this century'scontribution.The century that passes experienced not two  butthree great wars. Each was a cataclysm  fought globallyand at enormous cost. When the first ended  the survivors39emerged from the trenches  searching for a better world sothat war would not recur. In response  we created theLeague of Nations. But war  regrettably  was not avoided.The League failed because we failed the League. And thusfollowed the second great war  at the end of which theworld emerged armed with weapons that could destroy allthat human genius and ingenuity had created and everyvestige of life. But  from the ruins and devastation of thesecond also emerged the United Nations  with mandates ofbroader powers and responsibilities. The third great conflictwas the cold war. This deeply affected  shaped andinfluenced the development of the United Nations. Thiswar  too  extracted a heavy price  directly and throughproxy conflicts  as well as political and social upheavals but then these became its epilogue. What significance liesin the observation that no global peace conference has takenplace to mark the end of this last war?The United Nations could have been cast anew  madecontemporary and democratized  drawing upon ourcollective experience to tackle new challenges with greaterresponsiveness. Can we  even now  do something at thislast session of the General Assembly of this millennium tocorrect this? Can we pledge afresh to invest this institutionwith faith  commitment  political will and the resources thatit needs to make it the vehicle capable of realizing theaspirations of all humanity  an instrument that will steerplanet Earth into the next century?We do not enjoy an abundance of options. Thesapping of the vitality or the diminishing of the centralityof the United Nations must not be permitted. We have butone Earth  and there is but one United Nations.Another development of this century  of crucialsignificance  is the transformation that we have experiencedin the role of the State. From an agency that controlled andregulated all spheres of human activity  we move into aphase wherein the State must become more supportive caring and encouraging of the citizen's individual andcollective endeavours; it must release  not contain  theenergies and genius of its people.It would be an error  however  to assume that the daysof the State are over. The State continues to have a crucialrole and relevance; also  therefore  do nationalsovereignties. The United Nations was not conceived as asuper-State. It will not ever become so  principally becausethere is no viable substitute for the sovereign State. Evenglobalization can work only through State intermediaries.To diminish  marginalize or ignore the State would also bebad practice  because the weaker the State is rendered  theless it shall be able to promote the interests of its citizens.The State needs to be strengthened functionally  notweakened. Besides  it is axiomatic that a United Nationsof weak nations can only be a weak United Nations.Globalization is an idea that has re-emerged  but alsoits reverse: fragmentation. The first is politico-economic the second entirely political. Let us dwell a bit on this.Obviously  the technology that is driving this process cannow scarcely be unlearned; the speed of travel and ofcommunications will only increase; the age of the digital as I said  has dawned. However  though globalization mayapparently be driven by impersonal market forces  it is inreality impelled by power seeking political and financialadvantage. It is  in essence  a political process  and ifhistory teaches us anything  it is that such processes arenot linear. Simply in terms of economic indicators  theworld was as globalized at the turn of the century as it isnow. A backlash followed: barriers went up  confrontationreplaced cooperation and the world jostled into thetensions that led to the first great war. Are we  for thesake of temporary gain  perhaps even unwittingly repeating yesterday's mistakes? Political hindsight tells usthat globalization has to be politically directed forcreating equal economic opportunity  both within Statesand among States.In India  we cherish the creative genius of thepeople. We believe that Indian excellence lies in thefreedom of the individual. We do not subscribe toconstricting choice through State impositions. But can freemarkets offer true freedom of choice to those that are noteven a part of the market? That is why the Statecontinues to have the responsibility to protect the needy to strengthen the weak. That is a part of our democraticcreed  too.We note that human rights have been made a cross-cutting theme of the work of the United Nations. That isimportant. The flowering  however  of human rightsrequires economic development and growth because manyof the deprivations faced by individuals  whether in thedeveloped or in the developing world  are rooted inmarginalization created by poverty. We believe  therefore that development should be the cross-cutting theme of theUnited Nations and that the multilateral developmentsystem  which has been one of its successes  must bestrengthened  its focus narrowed to the core challenges ofeconomic growth with social justice  and it must be giventhe resources it requires to respond to the needs of thedeveloping countries. The international community willfind that no investment yields better returns.40I have the honour to address the Assembly as arepresentative of the largest democracy in the world. Evennow  as I share these thoughts  an electorate of about 600million  matching the combined populations of the UnitedStates  Canada and Western Europe  is going through theexciting process of democratically electing its nextGovernment in my country. It is an awe-inspiring spectacle this unstoppable flow of the great Ganga of Indiandemocracy. It is a democracy whose economy grew bymore than 6 per cent last year  even in the aftermath of themajor shocks to the international economy brought about bywhat was described as the East Asian meltdown of the mid-1990s.We move with the challenges posed by globalization without either retreating into a “fortress India” orabandoning our social objectives. We have worked out ourown answers and devised our own policies to meet thesenew challenges because we hold that the sheer diversity ofmankind dictates differences in approach  in human beings'respective search for relevant alternatives. This is a truthborne out by the fact that the twentieth century has beenwitness to the detritus of many false certainties.Today  when capital moves without almost anyconstraint  it is virtually impossible for developing countriesto resist either its demands or manage the consequences ofits sudden departure. Let us reflect upon the absence oforder  system or any global oversight of currency flows particularly short-term flows  even as we attempt to bringorder and equity to trade in goods  services andcommodities. But how are we to address the problem whencurrency  instead of being a vehicle of trade  has in itselfbecome a commodity of trade  when the volume of trade incurrency daily has outstripped global trade in goods andservices or even global gross national product manifold?If globalization is to benefit all  and as we simplycannot accept that wheels of progress should grind downthe common man  then surely some new internationalregulation  some order  is needed here. Let the UnitedNations take the initiative to hold an urgent internationalconference on financing for development.In the political domain  too  managing changedemands openness and reasoned discourse  an essentialingredient of which is abjuring violence. That is whyterrorism is the very antithesis of all that the UnitedNations represents and stands for. Terrorism is the greatglobal menace of our age. In this age of democracy  it is aviolation of the very basic precepts of it. Because itsprincipal targets become the innocent  it is a crime againsthumanity  a violation of basic human rights. It is alsonow a grave threat to international peace and security.That is why I urge that we strengthen the internationalconsensus against terrorism. India has called for acomprehensive international convention against terrorism.We hope to make progress on the issue in this session ofthe General Assembly.We also know how terrorism uses the internationalfinancial system  how it exploits the breakdown ofcountries and societies  and how it has preyed on thenexus between drugs and the proliferation of small arms.Thus  today  we witness a scimitar of narco-terrorismcutting across the Caucasus to the South Asiansubcontinent. Two of the world’s largest sources of illicitdrugs flank us. Terrorism financed by drugs has for yearsbeen the deadly export of our neighbours.Here the crippling intermixing of cause and effect iscruelly exemplified in Afghanistan. The world has beenwitness to the decades-old distress of the innocent men women and children of that country. The disorders ofAfghanistan  and the near anarchy into which that countryhas been pushed  are a consequence  chiefly  of the playof external forces and of a reversion to medievalfundamentalism of the most obscurantist variety. Thisdisorder now overspills; it is also exported. It is not thathuman rights  particularly of women and children  areroutinely violated there; they simply do not exist.Our relationships with this neighbour are ancient androoted in a past that we share. That is why we urge thisAssembly to be seized of the enormous human sufferingof the Afghans  and to encourage and support the earlyformation of a Government truly representative of allsections of that society and country.Terrorism is a menace to which open societies arevulnerable; it becomes particularly difficult fordemocracies to counter when terrorists are armed financed and backed by Governments or their agencies and benefit from the protection of State power. Cross-border terrorism  sponsored from across our borders  hastaken the lives of thousands of our citizens and ruinedthose of countless others. We will counter it  as we havedone over the past decades  using the methods availableto a democracy. India will defeat such forces. That is bothour duty and our obligation to our citizens.Earlier this year India was subjected  yet again  to anact of premeditated aggression. In February this year hoping yet again to set aside the sterility of relations of41the past half century to set the South Asian subcontinent onthe path of development  with a view to addressing the realadversaries of our region — poverty  want and hunger —Prime Minister Vajpayee extended a hand of peace  amityand cooperation to neighbouring Pakistan. The pathbreakingbus journey from Delhi to Lahore followed. In Lahore weconcluded a triad of agreements  among which was theLahore Declaration. It was the route chart of movingtowards lasting amity and peace.This act of faith was betrayed. Premeditatedaggression by regular forces was committed against India.Not simply was the Lahore Declaration violated  but so wasthe Simla Agreement  which had prevented conflict formore than a quarter of a century. In self-defence  yet withthe utmost restraint  India took all necessary andappropriate steps to evict the aggressor forces from itsterritory. Most regrettably  this aggression has set back theLahore process of peace that we had initiated. For whereasaggression over territory can more easily be vacated  thatterritory of trust which has been transgressed is infinitelymore difficult to restore.Permit me  Sir  to draw attention to the fact that thisaggression upon India in Kargil was a demonstration ofwanting to hold to ransom the world  through an act ofaggression. It was also a manifestation of the largerdisorders that the world has been witnessing in Afghanistan.There is an aspect that I stress. It was a gross violationof the Geneva Conventions when Indian soldiers takenprisoner were tortured  subjected to inhuman treatment andkilled in captivity. These violations took place at a timewhen the international community has repeatedly beentrying to establish the rule of law  stripping away the layersof impunity that have protected those who give the ordersthat lead to violations of international humanitarian law.And it is thus that I find it necessary to reiterate someessential verities of Indian nationhood. From the earliestdays of our struggle against imperialism and colonial ruleit has been an unquestionable article of faith with us thatIndia is one nation: a nation of many faiths  a diversity ofbeliefs  a cultural harmony arranged through the interplayof myriad forms and manifestations  but a unity strengthened by its pluralism  that is beyond question. Andof this is born India’s democratic vitality  too. Also of thisoneness and unity  the Indian State of Jammu and Kashmiris an integral part  and shall remain so. Because this is notany territorial dispute; it is the assertion of two antipodalapproaches to national identity. India has never representeddenominational nationhood; it is civic nationalism to whichwe subscribe. That is why Jammu and Kashmir is not aso-called core issue. It is at the very core of Indiannationhood.Yet the path of the India-Pakistan compositedialogue process is open. No preconditions attend it. Theonly essential ingredient that remains is an abjuring ofviolence and cross-border terrorism  principles that areintegral to both the Simla Agreement and the LahoreDeclaration — indeed  the very process of peace itself.This process needs to be resumed.We have been greatly disappointed by thiscompulsive hostility of Pakistan  because it is anaberration in our region today  where all the other SouthAsian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC)countries are at peace with each other  and are trying bilaterally and through the SAARC mechanisms  to tackletogether the great challenge of development. But weremain unshaken in our vision of cooperation and sharedprosperity of the South Asian region  as embedded in theCharter of SAARC  as well as in our faith in the ability talent and will of the people of the region to take theirrightful place in the world community. The destiny of allour peoples is linked. It is a region with a collectivehistory reaching back to the beginnings of human historyand of the highest civilizational accomplishments. Instriving to attain the promise of the future in our region we also see the recovery of a great past.This is perhaps the right juncture at which to say afew words about pluralism in an age of globalization.Though we find sterile the debate over universal andregional values  extreme positions are still taken on bothsides. In a spirit of engagement  we would urge ourpartners in the West to be a bit more tolerant  and a bitmore introspective. While all democratic Governments tryto promote good governance  human rights and socialresponsibility  the perspective they approach them from and their ability to implement them  vary. Rigidlyapplying  as a universal paradigm  value systems thatreflect the state of western economies and societies in thelate twentieth century  produces an inevitable reaction which does not make either for dialogue or constructivedecisions.Globalization has also influenced our thinking onsecurity issues by generating a greater awareness aboutnew security concerns. Equally important  with the end ofthe cold war there is a growing realization that peacecannot be maintained through balance of power orhegemonic order. To maintain global peace and security 42to deal with threats of a global nature  the internationalcommunity has to accept the concept of collective security.The United Nations provides a framework for such acontract among nations. With the cold war behind us  theGeneral Assembly should reactivate this framework.Global nuclear disarmament was the objective set outby the 1946 General Assembly in the first resolution that itadopted. That objective still beckons us.I say this as the representative of a country that hasbeen obliged to acquire nuclear weapons because of thefailure of the existing non-proliferation regime to addressour primary security concerns. Yet let me also state withfull conviction that India’s commitment to global nucleardisarmament stands undiluted. India is the only nuclear-weapon State ready to negotiate a nuclear weaponsconvention that will prohibit for ever the development production  stockpiling  use and threat of use of nuclearweapons and provide for the elimination of all existingweapons under international verification.If this can only be a step-by-step process  the first stepat a technical level is for all countries possessing nuclearweapons to take measures that will reduce the dangers of and provide added safeguards against  any unintended oraccidental use. Coupled with this is the political step ofreorienting nuclear doctrines  towards no-first-use  and thennon-use  thus delegitimizing nuclear weapons globally.Independent expert opinion across the globe has spokenstrongly in favour of such measures. In fact  every singlestudy that has been published since the end of the cold waron the measures to achieve a nuclear-weapon-free worldhas highlighted the need for shifting to doctrines based onno-first-use and non-use  and technical measures towardsde-alerting  as the inevitable first steps in the process. Wehave taken initiatives to urge the international communityforward on both counts  and hope that in this GeneralAssembly session the Indian initiatives will receive theunanimous support that they merit.Last year my Prime Minister declared in thisAssembly that India was engaged in discussions on a rangeof issues  including the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-BanTreaty (CTBT). These discussions are in process and willbe resumed by the newly- elected Government of mycountry. Our position remains consistent. We remain readyto bring these discussions to a successful conclusion.Naturally  this requires the creation of a positiveenvironment as we work towards creating the widestpossible consensus domestically. We also expect that othercountries will adhere to this Treaty without any conditions.Notwithstanding India’s readiness to engage inconstructive negotiations on a treaty to prohibit the futureproduction of fissile materials for nuclear weapons andnuclear explosive devices  the Conference onDisarmament in Geneva has so far  sadly  been unable toregister any forward movement. This  too  is something toponder over  for we all know that a fissile material cut-offtreaty (FMCT) can only contribute to our shared objectiveas part of a step-by-step process. Let us then overcomethis reluctance and agree to look beyond the FMCT.So  at the end of this centennial audit  what is it thatwe would want the United Nations to do in the first fewyears? It is clear that there are two major problems facingthe United Nations as an institution: Security Councilreform and the United Nations financial crisis. These needto be addressed. The Security Council must be mademore representative  with developing countries inductedas permanent members  to reflect the changes in theUnited Nations membership and today’s political realities.As we said earlier  on any objective criteria  India’scredentials for permanent membership are persuasive.Sustainable and environmentally sound developmentis a goal to which India continues to attach the utmostimportance. In 2002 we will complete a decade ofAgenda 21  adopted at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992. Itrust that the current session of the General Assembly willput in place a preparatory process for the “Rio + 10”review. This will enable the Member States to take stockof the implementation of the commitments undertaken bythe Member States in Agenda 21 over the past decade.Such a process is vital for attaining our common goal ofsustainable and environmentally sound development.This century has shown us that our challenges arecommon; they are intertwined. Problems flow acrossboundaries  they batten on each other. Political  security economic and social challenges are braided around eachother; when they form a knot  that has to be cut by all ofus together. Here  and nowhere else  can we do this. It isconvenient to look at security issues in the FirstCommittee  at economic issues in the Second  at humanrights and social issues in the Third  and so on  but weoften do not see them together  and so fail to use theUnited Nations as we should.May I  in conclusion  therefore  propose that in thenext decade the United Nations endeavour to address themost urgent problems that face us today. We have to dothis as a unity of nations  as also of issues  for it isevident that solutions in one field will depend on  or be43facilitated by  progress in another. Without tackling themtogether we will fail to address them at all. Therefore  mayI urge the Assembly to consider the following areas foraction in the opening years of the next decade: aninternational conference on financing for development;binding  irreversible steps to reduce the dangers of use ofnuclear weapons; reform and expansion of the SecurityCouncil; a comprehensive convention against terrorism; andstrengthening of the United Nations development system inthis era of globalization.I leave you with a sloka from the Rigveda. Thoughwritten 5 000 years ago  it reaches across time to us as atthis session of the General Assembly  in the last year of thetwentieth century. In translation  it reads “Be of one heart  one mind and free of hate.Let your aim be common  your assembly common United your mind and thoughts;May you make your resolutions with one mind Perform your duties righteously.Let our hearts be together”."
"77",3254,"IRL",54,1999,"Mr. President  I congratulateyou  the Foreign Minister of Namibia  on your election asPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourthsession. Your experience as the Namibian people's chiefrepresentative in New York during your country's strugglefor independence and your role in guiding Namibia into thefamily of nations will serve you well in directing theimportant work of this session.Our thanks are also due to Foreign Minister Opertti ofUruguay for his dedicated efforts in leading the Assemblyover the past 12 months. I  too  would like to warmlywelcome our three new Members to the United Nations  theRepublic of Kiribati  the Republic of Nauru and theKingdom of Tonga.In January of this year  my Government had theprivilege of hosting a visit by Secretary-General Annan. Asthe first United Nations Secretary-General to emerge fromwithin the international civil service  his personalcommitment to the United Nations and its foundingprinciples is evidenced in his efforts to steer theOrganization into the new millennium.My colleague Foreign Minister Halonen of Finlandset out the views of the European Union on the mainchallenges facing the international community today  and of course  Ireland fully associates itself with our respectedFinnish Presidency's remarks.The responsibility of the United Nations to maintaininternational peace and security has been severely testedthis year. In Africa  in the Balkans and  most recently  inEast Timor  we have seen bloody and vicious outbreaksof violence which could have been avoided. At the sametime  the incidence and scale of natural disasters hasincreased  adding to the pressures facing the alreadyoverstretched relief agencies. We need to take up thechallenge which the Secretary-General set out in histhought-provoking address earlier this week — to thinkanew about how the United Nations and the MemberStates respond to the political  human rights andhumanitarian crises affecting so much of the world. Weare all haunted by the collective failure to preventhumanitarian disasters — including genocide — as wellas the outbreak of conflict in many regions.The case for better prevention strategies isoverwhelming. Even the costliest policy of prevention isfar cheaper  in lives and resources  than the leastexpensive use of armed force. It is simply unacceptablethat the United Nations should be starved of the resourcesthat are vital to this conflict prevention. Where conflictprevention fails  more fundamental questions relating tocapabilities for crisis management arise. How is itpossible  for example  that the international communityfinds itself repeatedly incapable of taking effective action?How has it come to pass that questions are being raisedabout the adequacy of the Charter itself? Or that theconstraints impairing the effectiveness of the Organizationhave led to searching elsewhere for effective response? Itis indeed a paradox that  in a world of unprecedentedinterdependence and technological capabilities  we shouldbe confronted by such a dilemma.The Charter  I think  has been fairly described as a“living document”. I believe that this provides the key toresolving our dilemma. We have not used sufficiently thepossibilities that already exist under the Charter  not onlyin the area of peace and security  but also in the socialand economic fields. I would suggest that we shouldscrutinize its provisions and use them imaginatively. Thatcould make possible a reinvigoration of the United25Nations  injecting a new sense of purpose and a newdynamic.I believe we should similarly look to see how we cansupport the Secretary-General in his immense labours. Hisreport on the work of the Organization has diagnosedaccurately the challenges that exist and has genuinelypointed out what needs to be done. He has powers underthe Charter  and he should be encouraged to use them tothe full. Greater empowerment of the Secretary-General isone practical step that we  the Member States  should take.We should seize the opportunity provided by theMillennium Assembly next year to reaffirm ourcommitment to the goals and principles set out in theCharter  in a pragmatic  action-oriented and forward-lookingmanner.We can learn  as has been said by previous speakers from the crisis in East Timor. As the PersonalRepresentative of the European Union Presidency  Iwitnessed at first hand the consultation process on 30August. I wish particularly to pay tribute to the outstandingwork of the United Nations Mission in East Timor(UNAMET). It has received criticism  and I reject thatcriticism. I saw the work at first hand. They were anunarmed force — a group of very brave men and women.Men and women of my own country were among that verybrave group of people  and I salute them.Ireland  together with our European Union partners  isfully committed to seeing that the people of East Timorenjoy the independence which they have freely chosen. Thepoll itself took place peacefully in a fair and freemanner — we witnessed it first hand — and reflected  asI understand it  the views of the people. It was  however followed by systematic and ruthless attacks on thepopulation. We have condemned these atrocities in thestrongest terms. The perpetrators of crimes againsthumanity must be brought to justice. The United NationsHigh Commissioner for Human Rights  Mrs. MaryRobinson  has called for an international commission ofinquiry  and  of course  we all fully support this  as Iunderstand it.Had those seeking to frustrate and overturn the processinitiated by President Habibie last January succeeded  theywould have denied the democratic rights of the people ofEast Timor  posing a very serious challenge to thecredibility and authority of the United Nations. I welcomethe decisive action taken by the Security Council which ledto the adoption of its resolution 1264 (1999)  although Iregret that this action could not have been taken morespeedily. I pay sincere tribute to all involved  and inparticular to the members of the Security Council missionwho went to Jakarta and Dili in very very difficultcircumstances. I pay sincere tribute to all involved. All ofthe provisions of Security Council resolution 1264 (1999)must now be fully implemented in all respects  as it says and as is required by it.We fully support the deployment of the internationalforce for East Timor under the leadership of Australia.Ireland is among the contributors to this force.We are facing a humanitarian disaster in both Eastand West Timor. All East Timorese refugees  whereverthey are  must be allowed to return to their homes. Theresponse that is now being made will go some way torestoring the credibility and authority of this Organizationat a time when the restoration of that credibility andauthority is so urgently required. In Ireland we will becontinuing to support  in every way we can  the work ofthe United Nations and  of course  the internationalhumanitarian agencies in East Timor.The dilemma which I earlier described is alsoillustrated clearly by the response to crises in many partsof Africa  as has been outlined by so many otherspeakers  and by the previous speaker in particular  mycolleague Foreign Minister Godana of Kenya. Thisresponse has in the past been totally inadequate  leadingin turn to further conflict  human suffering and neglect onan even greater scale.I welcome the steps recently taken towards nationalreconciliation in a number of the African countries including  as was mentioned by the previous speaker Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.The patient diplomacy and determination of individualAfrican leaders has laid the groundwork for the resolutionof a number of recent conflicts. We received a timelyreminder of these efforts a few days ago from PresidentChiluba of Zambia in his excellent address to the SecurityCouncil. But these efforts deserve and require the supportand commitment of the international community. TheSecretary-General's report on conflict prevention in Africahas set out clear goals and proposals on the promotion ofdurable peace and sustainable development in Africa  andwe must all ensure that real progress is achieved on theseissues.Countries emerging from conflict situations  inparticular  face the need to rebuild lives and livelihoods.26Many of these are among the poorest Member States. Inthat context  I wish to highlight the extent of the debtburden on developing countries  particularly on the heavilyindebted poor countries — the so-called HIPC countries.Servicing this debt deprives many of these nations of scarceresources  resources which are required to meet the mostbasic human needs  and some of the debt repayments basedon the moneys given to some of these countries are nothingshort of disgraceful.The launch of the joint World Bank/InternationalMonetary Fund Heavily Indebted Poor Country Initiativetwo years ago gave hope that substantive action would atlast be taken to relieve the debt crisis  particularly the largeand growing burden of multilateral debt. Some progress hasbeen made  but  unfortunately again  in the nature of thoseinstitutions — and I do not say it by way of great criticism— there is a slowness in their movement. That is why theInitiative has benefited so few of the countries to which itis directed. We need to extend it to more countries  with agreater degree of flexibility  and maybe a little bit ofimagination.Ireland wishes to see the strongest possible linkbetween debt relief and poverty alleviation. It is the poorestand most marginalized who have borne much of the burden.I saw this in recent visits to a number of these countries inAfrica. We recognize the strength of international concernabout the debt of poor countries  including the urgentdemands for debt forgiveness. The Irish Governmentdecided last year to direct resources to both bilateral andmultilateral debt relief  and also to make it integral toIreland's overall development cooperation strategy. The goalof poverty reduction  the primary focus of this strategy cannot be met without concerted international action tostem the haemorrhage of resources caused by this burden.Ireland regrets the decline in flows of officialdevelopment assistance to what can only be described ashistoric lows. This situation must be reversed. Developingcountries  especially the poorest among them  needinternational solidarity now more than ever.The forthcoming special session on small islanddeveloping States is an important opportunity to focusinternational attention on countries with which Ireland hasa natural affinity. Remote from major markets andecologically fragile  they face the twin challenges ofglobalization and climate change. Ireland recognizes theirunique situation and supports further work on an indexwhich would reflect their vulnerability.The special session should give a renewed impetusto the Barbados Programme of Action — a Programmethat I salute. The small island States  particularly thepoorest  must not be further marginalized. For our part we have placed a new emphasis on small islanddeveloping States in our multilateral aid programme. Weare also working with our partners in the European Unionand the African  Caribbean and Pacific countries towardsa successful conclusion — a just and equitable conclusion— of the post-Lomé negotiations.The scourge of drug trafficking is a global problemwhich affects us all. Ireland is fully committed to thefight against drugs and to supporting the efforts of thosecountries which are already very much affected by thisheinous traffic.Full respect for human rights is of fundamentalimportance to the achievement of all our other goals. Asthis millennium draws to a close  a series of the mostbarbaric violations of human rights imaginable in Bosnia Rwanda  Kosovo and now in East Timor are testamentsto our inhumanity to one another.The Secretary-General has produced a compellingreport (S/1999/957) to the Security Council on theprotection of civilians in armed conflict. We mustaddress  with the utmost speed and seriousness  theSecretary-General's recommendations which are aimed atcreating  in his words  a “climate of compliance” withinternational human rights and humanitarian standards  asset out. The Secretary-General has rightly placed greatstress on the necessity to enhance efforts aimed at conflictprevention. His recommendations offer us an opportunityto redeem the pledges we made last year on the occasionof the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration ofHuman Rights.It is imperative that the Statute of the InternationalCriminal Court enter into force as soon as possible. Aglobal enforcement mechanism which addresses impunitycould also serve as a deterrent to genocide and crimesagainst humanity  some of which I have just articulated.Ireland will shortly assume the chairmanship of theCommittee of Ministers of the Council of Europe  animportant political forum for enhancing democratic valuesand stability throughout the continent of Europe. We willseek to promote further cooperation between the Councilof Europe and the United Nations in areas of commoninterest.27The shadow of nuclear weapons hangs over us all aswe enter the new millennium. We can no longer remaincomplacent at the absence of progress towards the earlyelimination of nuclear arsenals. The limited steps that havebeen taken to date — which we welcome — do not amountto a determined process of elimination.Intent on securing a new consensus on the wayforward  I and my colleagues from Brazil  Egypt  Mexico New Zealand  Slovenia  South Africa and Sweden last yearlaunched an initiative called “Towards a nuclear-weapon-free world: the need for a new agenda”.With the adoption of a resolution on the new agendain the General Assembly  the international community hasdemanded a clear perspective for the closure of the nuclear-weapons era.The approach of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferationof Nuclear Weapons (NPT) 2000 Review Conferenceunderlines the imperatives of a fundamental change inapproach. We require a new commitment on the part of thenuclear-weapon States. This would make the elimination ofthese weapons an immediate objective rather than anultimate goal.Earlier this year I had the honour of participating inthe first meeting of the States Parties to the OttawaConvention  held in Maputo. The conclusion of the globalban on landmines is  of course  one of the strikingachievements of our time. In this I salute the leadership ofCanada  working with determined Governments  includingmy own  and in cooperation with the non-governmentalcommunity. It is the clearest demonstration of what can beachieved when the political will exists.The spread of small arms and the consequences forcivilian populations in armed conflict must be confrontednow. This traffic in arms is an obscenity and  in manycases  totally and absolutely irresponsible; its brokers knowno morality. We must redouble our efforts to address boththe supply and demand sides of a threat to the security ofcivilians that has reached epidemic proportions.We in Ireland are proud of our contribution to worldpeace through peacekeeping. Just under a year ago Irelandbecame a full participant in the United Nations standbyarrangements system. We currently contribute to eightpeacekeeping operations  with over 700 personnel in thefield. Our largest commitment is to the United NationsInterim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) in southern Lebanon.Our service has not  of course  been without cost. To date78 Irish peacekeepers have paid the highest price in theservice of the United Nations.The changing and more complex nature ofpeacekeeping involves additional tasks  such ashumanitarian assistance  the protection of human rightsand civilian police work. Through our participation in themultinational forces operating under United Nationsauthorization in Kosovo  and soon in East Timor  Irelandis already playing its part in these new arrangements. Ourcommitment to United Nations peacekeeping remains  asever  strong  steadfast and loyal.I will conclude by giving a short resume of thesituation in Northern Ireland. A number of speakers havereferred to the peace process in Northern Ireland duringthe course of their contributions to this session of theGeneral Assembly  and I very deeply appreciate theirremarks in that regard. Their support and  indeed  all thesupport of all the nations in the United Nations is verydeeply appreciated.I will now turn to the evolving situation in that partof my benighted land  Northern Ireland. When I spokehere last year  I was honoured to be the first Minister tobe able to report that a comprehensive and broadly basedpolitical accommodation had been reached  that is  theGood Friday Agreement of April 1998. The Agreementwas reached by the British and Irish Governments and byeight political parties in Northern Ireland following almosttwo years of intensive negotiations. It was subsequentlyendorsed by the people of the island with decisivemajorities in referendums held in both the north andsouth  an average between the two parts of the island inthe nature of 72 per cent for a permanent peace on theisland of Ireland and in favour of the Good FridayAgreement. As I say  it was subsequently endorsed by thepeople of the island with a decisive majority in acombined context  which I have just spoken about namely  referendums in the north and south. TheAgreement covers not just constitutional issues andpolitical institutions  but a wide range of other mattersessential to conflict resolution and the promotion of a fairand just society.All of us gathered here know  often from directexperience  that  though it can be hard to reach anagreement  it is often harder still to implement it. I doubtvery much if anyone in Ireland expected the path aheadto be smooth and straight. While very substantial progresshas been made  there continue to be frustrations and  ofcourse  difficulties  and I would not seek to minimize the28problems we face. But there is still much that is valuableand encouraging.It is true that the peace we have remains imperfect and there can be no tolerable or acceptable level ofviolence. In places  tensions between the two communitiesare worryingly high. But  overall  Northern Ireland is morepeaceful than it has been at any time for a generation.Relationships between the two parts of Ireland  and betweenBritain and Ireland  are closer and more relaxed than theyhave ever been. And the longer it continues  it is peacewhich becomes the norm. The people were always entitledto peace. My belief is that now they are coming to expectit. I am confident that no attempt to return to the full-scaleviolence of the past would win any meaningful support orcould be sustained for long. We have turned the corner andthere can be no going back.During the past year  much good work has been doneto carry the Agreement forward. For instance  its humanrights and equality provisions are being given concreteeffect  as are measures to promote cultural equality andreconciliation and to assist the victims of violence. Theindependent commission established under the Agreementto make recommendations on a new beginning to policingin Northern Ireland has recently produced an excellent andthorough report on this very sensitive and important issue.The Irish Government looks forward to playing our part inits implementation.Moreover  the Governments and the parties in thenorth have completed all of the preparatory technical worknecessary to establish the new political institutionsenvisaged by the Agreement. You can understand therefore  the disappointment we feel that it has not yetproved possible actually to establish those politicalinstitutions. While there is disagreement among somepolitical parties on the precise relationship between theformation of an inclusive executive within Northern Irelandand the decommissioning of paramilitary weapons  there isno difference of view on the desirability of both objectives.However  there is a persistent mutual distrust and lack ofconfidence  with doubts about future intentions continuingto linger.Under the dedicated and committed leadership of theTaoiseach — my Prime Minister  Mr. Bertie Ahern — andthe British Prime Minister  Mr. Blair  the Irish and BritishGovernments and all the parties have devoted enormousenergy to the task of seeking to find a generally acceptableway forward. But so far  despite some progress  we havenot succeeded in bridging that particular gap. For thatreason  we have invited Senator George Mitchell of theUnited States  who chaired with such skill and judgementthe talks which led to the Good Friday Agreement itself to act as a facilitator of a review. That review is nowunder way. There is no good reason why it should fail. Icannot believe that is in the interests of anyone that itshould fail.The institutional blueprint sketched out in theAgreement and endorsed by the people offers the onlyrational basis for a lasting peace and for reconciliationthrough practical partnership and common action. Noother conceivable course of action represents a remotelysatisfactory alternative. Whatever the short-termdifficulties  the Irish Government  in continuedcooperation with the British Government  will not ceaseto work for its implementation.It is not surprising that the stalemate of the pastmonths has led to some doubt and  indeed disillusionment. But I am convinced that there remains ahuge reservoir of support for the Agreement within boththe unionist and nationalist communities  provided eachcan be confident that all aspects will be implemented infull. People are open to persuasion if a reasonableaccommodation is on offer. There is therefore an onus onall political representatives to be generous and creativeand to be prepared to offer leadership to their ownconstituencies while reaching out to others — notrecklessly  but courageously and honourably.I am convinced that there will be no return to ouroften bitter past. But it will be possible to realize the fullpotential of the future only when the Good FridayAgreement is implemented as a totality. The Agreementoffers a bold and generous vision of tolerance andpartnership between those who together share the islandof Ireland. Moreover  it offers a framework within whichprofound differences can be accommodated withoutcoercion and on the basis of consent. Those of us fromwithin the Irish nationalist tradition value the unionisttradition. We have come to understand  to cherish and torespect its authenticity and  of course  its validity. It is avital and irreplaceable strand of that diversity of culturesand identities which makes up Ireland as it really is.All over the world  we can see the tragicconsequences of policies of domination and exclusion.The future of Ireland can be  should be and  I believe will be radically different. That is why the task ofimplementing the Agreement should be completed now and not left to another generation.29In conclusion  as we go forward we know that weretain the support and solidarity of the internationalcommunity. In this regard I would like to pay particulartribute to the role of the United States and  of course  ofPresident Bill Clinton  who has stood steadfastly beside usthroughout the historic process in which we have beenengaged. As always  we are deeply grateful for theencouragement of all of our friends  which is and willcontinue to be hugely important to us.As we benefit from the support of the internationalcommunity  I wish in turn to pledge Ireland's continuingcommitment to the fulfilment of the aims and principles ofthe Charter of the United Nations."
"78",3301,"IRN",54,1999,"I wish to extend to you  Sir my sincere congratulations on your well-deserved electionto the presidency of the General Assembly and to assureyou of the full support and cooperation of the delegationof the Islamic Republic of Iran in the discharge of yourresponsibilities. I should also like to thank yourpredecessor for his tireless efforts during his tenure.May I also express the profound gratitude of myGovernment to our Secretary-General  who  withunsurpassed wisdom and sagacity  has played an immenserole in advancing the objectives of the United Nations.The twentieth century we are leaving behind hasbeen one of invaluable experiences  both positive andnegative. On the positive side  the rejection of force as aninstrument of policy has emerged as a fundamentalprinciple of international behaviour; the promotion andprotection of human rights as universal concepts haveattained priority on the global agenda; astonishingprogress in science and technology has broughtunprecedented welfare to humanity; knowledge hasbecome the common heritage of humanity; previouslycolonized countries have been empowered to determinetheir own destiny; dictatorship and despotism have beenseriously challenged by the universal demand forparticipation; and the technological revolution in the field10of communications has fundamentally changed humaninteraction.Alongside these positive developments  the twentiethcentury has also witnessed various negative phenomena andtrends. The totalitarian mentality continues to prevail at thedomestic and international levels; poverty persists in itsmaterial  spiritual and cultural manifestations; the gapbetween rich and poor has widened; the world has neverfreed itself from conflict and bloodshed; the destructiveterritorial wars of the past have turned into tragic ethnic racial and sectarian rivalries; extremism survives in itsvarious forms and manifestations  causing irreparabledamage; and terrorism continues to challenge humanity withits ruthless recurrence in various parts of the world.A hallmark of the twentieth century has been theworldwide emergence of demands for individual andcollective participation  defying totalitarianism andauthoritarian rule everywhere. Decision-making is no longeran autocratic or even elitist enterprise. It is a participatoryprocess demanding collective contribution. Totalitariantendencies and ideologies in various countries and at theinternational level are finally learning that their time is longpassed.The global surge of democracy and popularparticipation as the sole guarantors of stability and thelitmus tests of good-governance is indeed a development ofhistoric proportions. Self-determination  collectiveparticipation and consent of the governed represent valuableand time-tested rational alternatives.In this century  Iran has undergone fundamentalchanges in the pursuit of independence  liberty  justice participation and good governance. Since time immemorialand throughout its tumultuous history  Iran has been thelocus of innovation. It has proudly preserved its genuinenational and religious heritage  and yet  in keeping with thebest traditions of that very culture  it has never failed toembrace modernity  new ideas and new ways.In today's Islamic Republic  the democratizationprocess is marching forward on the solid foundation ofdemocratic Islamic principles. The Government is resolutelydetermined vigorously to pursue the implementation andconsolidation of its reform programmes. The cornerstonesof these reform policies are the promotion and protection ofconstitutional liberties; upholding the rule of law;strengthening democratic norms and institutions; theinstitutionalization of the culture of participation; theenhancement of the role of people in government; the fullaccountability of public officials; increasing transparency;strengthening the institutions of civil society; thepromotion of tolerance  a pluralistic society of multiplevoices and domestic trends  coupled with confidence-building and the breaking of old barriers in foreignrelations.Undoubtedly  open  dynamic and democraticsocieties are by definition susceptible to dissension andeven rivalries. This has historically accompanied theprocess of reform  constituting an inescapable ingredientof this path. The sound and successful approach ofPresident Khatami's Administration in dealing with thesesocial and political challenges  which has enjoyed the fullsupport of the leadership  has been to promote and protectfundamental democratic values and ensure the rule of lawand due process  as well as security and stability  whichtogether form the foundations of a flourishing and opensociety.Collective participation extends beyond local anddomestic decision-making  and is becoming increasinglya global requirement for an effective presence ininternational decision-making. The full participation of allStates is a necessary but not sufficient response to thisneed. It requires the effective contribution of civil societyorganizations in all aspects of the global decision-makingprocess.During this century  exclusion often surfaced as aparadigm of global interaction  in which the world isviewed in terms of modes of loyalty  countries are viewedas belonging to coalitions or not and are divided rewarded and blamed accordingly. Today  the utility ofthis paradigm is being seriously questioned  as is thevalidity of some of our basic assumptions.The cold war was the last episode of exclusion. Ithas undoubtedly left its negative imprint on internationalaffairs  but more regrettably it has permanently scarredthe mentality of global actors and international relationstheory.One of the most horrifying manifestations ofexclusion has been the global arms race. It literally aimsat marginalizing others through the accumulation ofconventional and mass-destruction agents of death  theformation of rival military blocs and the unbridled race toexpand spheres of influence and domination.The persistence of this paradigm is largelyresponsible for the most serious threat to the Middle Eastregion. Exploiting this mode of global interaction  Israel with impunity  has trampled the most fundamental rights ofthe Palestinian people  including their right to self-determination  has driven millions of people into diaspora has illegally occupied territories of others in the SyrianGolan and southern Lebanon and has even gone as far as tocommit extortion for partial fulfilment of its obligations.This has impeded the realization of the legitimate right ofthe Palestinian people  and indeed the entire Islamic world to establish an independent Palestinian State in the occupiedterritories  with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital. The sameregime has posed a grave threat to regional and globalpeace and security through the acquisition of nuclearweapons and other weapons of mass destruction and therejection of universal non-proliferation regimes.The global culture of violence and exclusion  whichpartially emanated from justification of violence as anacceptable means to achieve coalition objectives  hasunwittingly nurtured global menaces ranging from ethnicsuppression to terrorism.Two decades of fratricide and devastation inAfghanistan has been the fruit of an illusion of totaldomination of one group or ethnicity at the expense of theexclusion of others. This has stalled the constructive andtireless efforts of the Secretary-General and his SpecialEnvoy  Ambassador Brahimi  to bring about a peacefulsolution through the establishment of a broad-basedGovernment. Thus  today peace and stability in Afghanistanand respect for the most fundamental rights of Afghanwomen  men and children in Taliban-controlled areas haveall but become distant dreams  turning Afghanistan  with itsproud and rich heritage  into a bastion of narcotics terrorism and regional instability.Allow me to refer to terrorism  which has become aserious menace and a global challenge. It  of course victimizes innocent human beings. But its real targets arethe rule of law  popular participation and institutions ofcivil society. In fact  to have fertile ground  terrorists needand seek to cultivate and entrench a culture of violence. Itis for this very reason that  as the Iranian people andGovernment have forged a national consensus toinstitutionalize the rule of law and participation  knownterrorist groups have significantly intensified their campaignof terror against them. It is even more regrettable that theystill find foreign benefactors and sanctuaries. The peopleand the Government of Iran have no doubt that the aim ofthis treacherous terrorist campaign is to undermine thenational determination to reject violence in all its forms and we are all determined to prove the terrorists wrong.Terrorism can and will be contained and eradicatedif we all join hands with firm and resolute determination.But we need to recognize that the application of doublestandards seriously undermines such a global campaign.Acquiescence to terrorists of whatever stripe impedes theemergence of a unified  transparent and non-discriminatory universal machinery to combat and rootout all forms of terrorism. Iran  while condemningterrorism in all its forms and manifestations  is fullyprepared to engage actively in such global cooperation.It is thus necessary to work collectively today to laythe foundations of a new paradigm of inclusion anddialogue on participation  tolerance  understanding andcollective cooperation. The initiative of a dialogue amongcivilizations  presented last year by President Khatami  isa proposal to move away from a world driven byexclusion and monologue and to begin the newmillennium with a gentler  more civilized approach for abetter tomorrow. The overwhelming reception by theinternational community and the designation of the year2001 as the United Nations Year of Dialogue amongCivilizations indicate a common longing of humanity fora different approach to interactions in the next century.In our view  the designation of the Year of Dialogueamong Civilizations is not a mere recognition of the self-evident necessity for dialogue at the global level. It is infact a declaration of readiness to try a new model ofinteraction. The fundamental assumption of this proposalis that the prosperity  welfare  development and securityof one group  in spite of  or at the expense of  thepoverty  hunger  underdevelopment and insecurity ofothers are simply deceptive and short-lived  and thus theyneed to be abandoned. In certain fields  this underlyingprinciple has been universally accepted  whereas in manyother fields  we have a long and arduous way to go.Today  no one has the illusion that the environmentcould be defined in terms of political or geographicboundaries. Neither can the eradication of narcotics be apurely national enterprise. We in Iran are particularlycognizant of that fact  as we have had to endure a heavyhuman  social and financial toll in our campaign againstinternational narcotics traffickers.In the field of human rights  it appears that theinternational community is gradually embracing a morecooperative approach based on constructive engagementand understanding. Pluralism  acceptance of diversity anddialogue among cultures and civilizations in this pivotalarea of international affairs will undoubtedly enhance the12universality of human rights instruments  making themmore readily acceptable and globally implementable.Dialogue is the product of concurrent acceptance ofcommonality and diversity. From this perspective international endorsement of dialogue illustrates recognitionof the diversity of cultures and civilizations and thereaffirmation of the cultural rights of all peoples andnations  so that all human beings can engage members ofother civilizations from the standpoint of their own culture civilization and historical background  and not by simplyechoing the mentality of a totally alien culture. Only suchinteraction can be mutually enriching and indeedmeaningful. The Islamic Republic of Iran firmly believesthat the recognition and reaffirmation of cultural rights ofnations is a first step for the promotion of sustaineddialogue.In the field of peace and security  we need to trulyaccept the reality that security is an indivisible need anddemand of the entire human race. Thus we need to set asidethe residuals of the bipolar system and replace bloc securityumbrellas with a new and innovative concept of globalsecurity networking  an inclusive and participatory systemwhich uses the existing mechanisms in a complementaryrather than competing scheme.Attainment of this objective can be immensely helpedand expedited by empowering civil society organizations toparticipate actively in global disarmament and securityforums and debates. This valuable role has hitherto beenmostly limited to the social and human rights fields  and thesecurity and disarmament arena has been more or lessdeprived of its contribution and insight. This deficiencyneeds to be rectified.Meanwhile  short- and medium-term measures includeconfidence-building at the regional and global levels transparency in the field of armaments  a steady reductionof military expenditures  the elimination of weapons ofmass destruction and non-proliferation of nuclear weaponsin the interim. The Islamic Republic of Iran has itselfadopted these measures  and has based its foreign policy onconfidence-building and the removal of old barriers  withparticular emphasis on its immediate neighbourhood.As the Chairman of the Organization of the IslamicConference  we have also made significant progress indeveloping mechanisms and instruments to enhanceconfidence among Member States and to institutionalizedialogue and coordination with other bodies  such as theEuropean Union.The United Nations has an indispensable pivotal rolein shaping the new world of the next millennium. Thepreservation and extension of its achievements  coupledwith revitalization of the moral authority and politicalrelevance of the United Nations in the comingmillennium  require restoration of the fundamentalpurposes and principles of the United Nations  as well asa rational  transparent and participatory process ofreassessment of the existing institutions.Enhancement of the relevance of the United Nationsrequires  first and foremost  strengthening the role andincreasing the efficiency of the General Assembly  byfocusing its deliberations on contemporary challenges andproblems facing our world today  engaging it in timelyand effective decision-making to address global economicand political issues  and enabling it to seriously examineand effectively react to the reports of other organs of theUnited Nations  particularly the Security Council  asmandated by the Charter. In this context  we believe thatthe General Assembly  as the sole democratic  universaland transparent organ of the United Nations  is the properforum to carry out an in-depth analysis of the implicationsof the emerging debate on collective action to addresshumanitarian catastrophes. The imperative of maintainingthe integrity of the Charter system is the common pointof departure in this exercise.I firmly believe that the success of next year'sMillennium Summit rests on an innovative approach toprepare the United Nations system to march — andindeed to lead the world community — towards a newparadigm of international affairs. Outdated approachesand old remedies have failed to rectify the main problemsafflicting humanity  even at times exacerbating andaggravating them. In our collective quest for fundamentalsolutions  we all need to discard old perceptions assumptions and conceptual frameworks. This is the verypremise  as well as the primary goal  of dialogue betweencivilizations.Vital change in human societies requires brave andbold leadership by statesmen and the elite to question old ineffective ways and open the arena for the participationof thinkers  intellectuals and civil society organizations inthe search for a kinder and gentler tomorrow. We hopethat our Assembly will have such bravery and foresight."
"79",3348,"IRQ",54,1999,"First of all I would like to congratulate you  Sir  on your election tothe presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourthsession. I am fully confident that your experience andcompetence will contribute to the success of this session.With the end of the cold war  there was a feelingthat the world would see balanced international relations characterized by peace  stability and well-being. But thestate of affairs has proved otherwise; the internationalimbalance continues and is being used to place the logicof hegemony above all else in order to perpetuate it in theworld and its international organizations  particularly theUnited Nations.Because of this situation  the world has witnessed aseries of deep and rapid-moving changes that have led tothe emergence of many areas of political and militaryconflicts with dangerous consequences reflected in thehuman  economic and social conditions of many regionsin the world. These conflicts have claimed the lives ofhundreds of thousands of innocent civilians and havecaused the huge squandering of material and humanresources.The world will enter the new century in this fashion.The picture before us demonstrates the tyranny of force the imposition of hegemony and the aggravatingeconomic problems by which the States of the South areincreasingly marginalized to the extent that their entitiesand elements of survival are about to be eliminated. This27will lead to economic subordination  inevitably followed bypolitical subordination. In this context  there has emergeda new phenomenon of imposing various kinds of embargoesand economic sanctions  withholding development anddepriving States of the exercise of their economic rights asenshrined in international law and covenants. Thecatastrophic effects of this imbalance are reflected in thesocial conditions of many regions in the world. Theseeffects are demonstrated by an increase in the intensity ofpoverty  the spread of illiteracy  deterioration of the healthsituation and degradation of living standards. It can also beseen in the marginalization of many social segments ofsociety  especially youth  because of lack of jobs; the samegoes for the increase in crime and the prevalence of drugs as well as other serious social problems which can hardlybe controlled.It is no secret that one of the main reasons for theaggravation of this situation is the arbitrary imposition ofcomprehensive sanctions and embargoes on many States inthe world for political purposes  without any soundfoundation in international law. It is obvious that this policyhas resulted in tragic effects on the economic and socialstructures of the targeted States and on third countries. Itconstitutes a flagrant violation of the purposes andprinciples of the United Nations Charter and the principlesof justice.The most dangerous phenomenon witnessed during thepresent decade  which in the course of this session hasbecome an endeavour orchestrated by a group of WesternStates  is the advocacy of so-called humanitarianintervention. This doctrine  which has no place ininternational law  stems from an organized infringement ofthe most fundamental rules of the present internationalorder  such as sovereignty  political independence  territorialintegrity and non-interference in internal affairs. Theseprinciples cannot provide a protective shield for graveviolations of human rights or for intervention  sometimeswith the use of force  in order to protect those rights. Noone should be deceived by this doctrine as the newframework for a modern forum of neo-colonialism based onthe logic of power.First of all  we should realize that no situation used asa justification for this doctrine is free from the externalpolitical interventions that led in the first place to theemergence of such a situation. Accordingly  it could not beclaimed that international responsibility for the situationrests exclusively with the targeted Government. On theother hand  we should also realize that the purposes andprinciples of the United Nations Charter and themechanisms of the Organization are not devoid ofmodalities to deal with any situation of the type advancedto justify this doctrine.The problem does not lie with the principles  rulesand procedures. Rather  it rests with the selfish andunilateral policies of the controlling Powers  whoseinterests cannot be served by using the United Nationsmechanisms established for the correct application of theprinciples and rules of the Charter  which reflect the jointwill and collective interests of the members of theinternational community.The logic of this Western doctrine is not unknownto Iraq. At an early date  President Saddam Hussein drewattention to the dangers of the policy of might andopportunism in international relations that is carried outat the expense of the balance between rights andobligations and joint responsibility  as reflected in theCharter and in international law.It is not justifiable to consider the role of the UnitedNations as marginalized after it has become captive to theviews of the controlling Powers in international relationsand their selfish interests. Regardless of what the Charterprovides in terms of rights  duties and procedures  we areconvinced that the doctrine of presumed humanitarianintervention represents a dangerous destructive tool thataffects the gains that have accrued through joint efforts infavour of the general international interest  as evidencedby the records of this Organization. The universalizationof the concepts of this doctrine would mean the completedenial of the will of the vast majority of States  with theresult of destroying the present international order. Iraqjoins all delegations which have declared a positioncontrary to this Western doctrine. We call for joint effortsto confront it.I wish here to refer to a live example of the logic ofpower experienced in Iraq in 1998  at around this time ofyear  when the Security Council was discussing thearrangements for conducting a comprehensive review ofthe implementation by Iraq of its obligations underSecurity Council resolutions  especially those relating todisarmament  with a view to considering the lifting of thecomprehensive sanctions imposed on Iraq since August1990. While the Security Council was convened todiscuss the Secretary-General's report on Iraq'scooperation in the field of disarmament  the United Statesand British forces stationed in the Gulf region launcheda large-scale military aggression against Iraq  from 16December through 20 December 1998  using the lies and28fabrications of Richard Butler as a pretext for theiraggression. That aggression claimed the lives of a largenumber of innocent civilians  in addition to destroyingmany infrastructure sites  as well as much industrialequipment which had already been subject to a strictmonitoring system established by the former SpecialCommission  which did not detect any violation of SecurityCouncil resolutions at those sites.In spite of this gross violation of the Charter andmechanisms of the Organization  the Security Council  themain organ concerned with the situation  remainedcompletely crippled and did not take any immediatecollective action. The international condemnation of theAmerican/British aggression against Iraq last December didnot come from the Security Council. Rather  it came fromGovernments and peoples of Member States on a largerscale after a noticeable lull. As the Assembly will recall the Security Council was preoccupied with a bare-facedprocess for gaining time through mandating panels to assessthe special situation concerning Iraq's implementation of itsobligations under the resolutions of the Security Council.Those panels began their work unilaterally  withoutany advanced consultation with the Government of Iraq andwithout listening to its point of view. This process resultedin reports reflecting the political balance within the SecurityCouncil  which distanced it from the real substance of thesituation. At that point the process reached the stage of thepresentation of draft resolutions ignoring the rights andobligations provided for in the resolutions of the Councilitself. In fact  those draft resolutions added new obligationsfor Iraq  not contained in the relevant resolutions of theSecurity Council that Iraq had already implemented.While the Security Council resolutions imposedvarious obligations on Iraq  they in turn imposed a specificobligation on the Security Council  stipulating that thecomprehensive embargo was to be lifted once Iraq fulfilledits obligations under the same resolutions. But what hashappened in the course of the last nine years is that theCouncil  during 40 sessions held to review Iraq'simplementation of its obligations  has failed to take adecision to lift the comprehensive embargo  much less toease the situation even by 1 per cent  despite the fact thatall countries  even Iraq's enemies — for example  theUnited States of America — have attested that after nineyears of intensive implementation under the severestcircumstances and threats of continued aggression againstIraq nothing important has been left unfulfilled.Why then has the Council failed to lift the embargoon Iraq? The reason behind all this is the Americanhegemony over the Council  which prevents the Councilthrough various means from properly implementing itsresolutions. We have seen for several months intensiveendeavours in the Security Council  particularly by thefive permanent members  to adopt a unified position onIraq.The correct position that conforms with theresolutions of the Security Council is very clear anduncontroversial. Once the logic of law and justice isadhered to  Iraq demands its clear and legitimate rights —namely  the lifting of the iniquitous sanctions imposed onit in accordance with the Council's resolutions. Theseresolutions were agreed upon by the five permanentmembers and have been implemented by Iraq over thelast nine years. Now it is the turn of those five States tohonour their obligations. Iraq's position should be clear toall. To gain Iraq's approval  any proposal or resolution —or consequences  if there are any — should be based oninternational law and non-selectivity  otherwise the resultswill meet with a definite rejection and we will continueour struggle to lift the sanctions comprehensively andfinally in order to achieve all our legitimate demands.It has become clear to all  through public  personaland official testimonies  that the former SpecialCommission — a panel unfortunately bearing the name ofthe United Nations and acting nominally under its flag —has been used by the United States and Great Britain toachieve their aggressive objectives against Iraq's people sovereignty and security. In order to achieve the ultimateend of its main mission  the former Special Commissionhad adopted two methods for its work in Iraq: first conducting espionage activities for American  British andIsraeli intelligence so as to enable them to realize theirobjectives of destabilizing Iraq politically and removingits patriotic regime; and  secondly keeping the embargo inplace by reporting to the Security Council that the SpecialCommission had not yet fulfilled its mandate of disarmingIraq.During its work in Iraq  the former SpecialCommission resorted to dubious methods to falsify factsand present them in a manner that was in line with theAmerican approach  which is hostile to Iraq. The last ofthese had to do with the issue of VX vials found in theCommission's headquarters at Baghdad. Those sampleswere used by the Commission to contaminate the missingwarheads that were sent to American laboratories foranalysis. That was in order to enable the United States29Administration to find evidence supporting its allegationsregarding Iraq's weapons programmes. The Commission'sdubious practices were not limited to this  but went as faras hastily destroying the VX samples in order to concealthe irrefutable evidence of the Commission's involvementin the American conspiracy against Iraq.The American attempts to distort and pervert therelationship between Iraq and the Security Council have notbeen limited to exploiting the former Special Commission.They reached their ugliest forms in the open obstruction ofany efforts to ease the effects of the comprehensiveembargo imposed on Iraq  which has resulted in bittersuffering for the people of Iraq  particularly its children.The obstacles experienced during the implementationof the Memorandum of Understanding signed between Iraqand the United Nations regarding the oil-for-foodformula — which all reports and realities indicate cannotmeet the essential humanitarian needs of the people ofIraq — are striking evidence of the AmericanAdministration's insistence on harming the people of Iraqand depriving them of their fundamental humanitarianrights  as enshrined in all international covenants.It is worth mentioning that the total value of thesupplies that arrived in Iraq for the five initial phases of theimplementation of the Memorandum of Understanding isalmost equal to the funds deducted from the revenues ofIraqi oil sales to cover the expenses of the SpecialCommission  the expenses of the United Nations in Iraqand the costs of the United Nations CompensationCommission. The total value of the supplies that havearrived in Iraq from the beginning of 1997 to the present is$4 948 300 000  while the funds deducted for the SpecialCommission  the United Nations services and theCompensation Commission are $4 041 185 000.A cursory look at these two figures clearly shows thefailure of the Memorandum of Understanding to meet theessential humanitarian needs of the people of Iraq. Themethods the United States and Britain use in dealing withthe contracts that are related to humanitarian needs  and thedeliberate delay in processing these contracts  make themain goal of the Memorandum of Understanding thefinancing of the expenses of the United Nations instead ofsecuring the essential humanitarian needs of the Iraqipeople and stopping the deterioration of their humanitarianand health situation.This also exposes the intentions of the American andBritish Governments to strip the Memorandum of itshumanitarian substance by putting on hold the contractsdirectly related to the health situation of the people ofIraq. For example  while the value of the contracts signedfor water  sanitation and electricity has amounted to $352million  the value of the supplies that have arrived in Iraqso far is only $64 million — that is  only 18 per cent ofthe total value of those contracts. The rest has been puton hold by the British and the Americans.The most striking evidence of the suffering of thechildren of Iraq as a result of this unjust  comprehensiveembargo is the 12 August 1999 report of the UnitedNations Children's Fund (UNICEF)  which containsstatistics on child mortality resulting from malnutrition shortages of medicines and the deteriorating economicand nutritional situation of Iraqi mothers. The report hasproved decisively that the embargo imposed on Iraq is themain reason for the huge increase in the child mortalityrate.The United States Administration has spared nocosts to distort the facts about the Memorandum ofUnderstanding  or spared any tendentious lies andallegations about the distribution of food and medicalsupplies. The Secretary-General's reports on the Iraqprogramme  which are based on the reports of UnitedNations observers deployed throughout Iraq  have provedthe accuracy  regularity and equity of the distributionprocess of all humanitarian supplies received under theMemorandum of Understanding.The United States of America deliberately works tomaintain the embargo and to double the suffering of thepeople of Iraq  despite the disappearance of all thereasons linked to the imposition of the embargo. ThisAmerican objective has become quite clear through themany statements made by American officials that makethe embargo a tool to achieve the hostile Americanpolitical policy against Iraq.One of the basic pillars of the hostileAmerican/British policy against Iraq is the imposition ofthe two no-fly zones on Iraq. This constitutes a violationof the United Nations Charter and international law. Wehave already mentioned the evidence about this in a letterto the President of the Security Council dated 15 January1999. This has also been confirmed by the viewsexpressed by some permanent members and by othersinside and outside the deliberations of the Council.It is well-known that the continuation of these no-flyzones is a means to perpetuate the aggression with a view30to achieving the purposes of the Anglo-American politicalscheme against Iraq. American officials do not hesitate toindicate their real intentions of using these dailybombardment operations to achieve the United StatesAdministration's goals against Iraq's independence andsovereignty and to destabilize its patriotic Government.The Washington Post published on 31 January 1999 anarticle quoting a senior official of the United StatesAdministration describing a certain attack as a means ofreaching the goal in a way that satisfied all objectiveswithout any loss  and saying that if the United States wereto carry out a massive campaign  people would inquireabout what had provoked such attacks.Proceeding from this policy of partitioning theaggression  the American and British warplanes have beencarrying out daily exercises in a show of power thatviolates Iraq's airspace. In this way they launch savagebombardment operations against civil and economic sites inIraq  including communication stations  oil pumping stationsand private houses. Even mosques and churches have notbeen spared these continued savage attacks; the churchesinclude the Church of Mar Matti  which goes back to thefourth century AD and which the American and Britishaircraft bombed on 11 August 1999.From the aggression of December 1998 to the present the total number of sorties carried out by American andBritish aircraft amounted to 12 143  of which 9 830 launched from Saudi and Kuwaiti territory  were carried outin southern Iraq. Two thousand three hundred and thirteen(2 313) sorties were carried out in northern Iraq fromTurkish territory.The United States Administration is seeking to findinconsistent pretexts for these daily acts of aggression  towhich hundreds of innocent civilians fall victim. It claimsthat the bombing of civilians is in legitimate self-defenceagainst Iraqi air force attacks.Let us ask this: where does the United States derivethe right to defend an act that lacks any kind of basic legallegitimacy? Who gives the American aggressors the right toact in self-defence  as they claim  in Iraqi airspace? Theacts carried out by the United States Administrationrepresent a declared war waged against the people of Iraq.This is a charade — no more  no less. A senior Pentagonofficial  in describing these operations in the TheWashington Post on 2 September 1999  admitted that thiswas a low-level war.Proceeding from its legitimate right to self-defence which is guaranteed in all international instruments andcovenants  Iraq will not hesitate to counter all Americanand British acts of aggression that aim at violating theintegrity of its airspace and territory and threaten itssecurity as well as that of its people.Iraq will continue to confront American and Britishaggression by all available means and potential. It will notyield to American blackmail. The hostile policy of theUnited States towards Iraq  which runs counter to theCharter of the United Nations and international law  hasbeen made clear in official statements by senior officialsin the United States Administration that stress that theUnited States is determined to unseat the patrioticGovernment of Iraq and dismember its national unity.In addition  the highest American legislative bodyhas enacted laws that allow the Administration to interferein Iraq's internal affairs  to allocate huge sums of moneyto carry out acts of terrorism  sabotage and assassinationinside Iraq and to appoint high-ranking officials in theAdministration to oversee these immoral and illegitimatetasks.This American policy has contributed to encouragingTurkish forces to carry out large-scale military operationsinside Iraqi territory on the pretext of chasing elements ofthe Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). These Turkishmilitary operations have caused instability and disorder innorthern Iraq and pose a threat to Iraq's national securityand territorial integrity. Iraq has regularly reported theserepeated Turkish acts of aggression to the United NationsSecretary-General and to the President of the SecurityCouncil. These acts constitute a violation of the principlesof good-neighbourliness and a threat to internationalpeace and security in the region. But the United Nationshas taken no action to curb these operations  and thereason is very clear: it is a reflection of the United Statespolicy aimed at maintaining the abnormal situation inIraq.The continued United States hegemony andgovernance of the destinies of the peoples of the world as well as of international economic and politicalorganizations  confront the United Nations with its mostserious challenge ever. The United Nations should standup to this domination and prove its ability to restoreequilibrium so as to realize the purposes set out in theCharter  primarily the achievement of peace  security andstability  the promotion of friendly relations and theencouragement of economic cooperation between States.31In a speech delivered by President Saddam Hussein on17 January 1999  Iraq called for an assembly of variousinstitutions to be established by interested States to agreeupon statutes and charters with a view to achieving seriouscooperation in the economic  political and military fields inorder to preserve balance and bring about peace  startingwith Asia and questions related to it. That assembly wouldnot be directed against anyone  but would be aimed atprotecting its members and at legitimately defending theirsecurity and interests as well as international security  inaccordance with established humanitarian norms. From thisrostrum we call upon the peoples and States of the worldthat have faith in the values  culture  freedom independence  justice and equity of the nations and peoplesof the world  to consider President Saddam Hussein'sproposal with a view to initiating a dialogue aimed atturning the proposal into a reality that would help achievebalance  peace and security throughout the world.Moreover  many States  including permanent members ofthe Security Council  have explicitly called for a multipolarworld in which political  economic and military balanceprevails  in the interest of maintaining international peaceand security.The United Nations adherence to the principles set outin its Charter and the full and fair implementation of itsresolutions  without selectivity and discrimination  is thebenchmark of its credibility in restoring the trust of Statesin its ability to achieve justice and peace and toencourage States to comply with and implement theprovisions of its resolutions.The United Nations  in particular the SecurityCouncil  should implement its resolutions on the MiddleEast  primarily those relating to the question of Palestine and should support the legitimate struggle of thePalestinian people to regain their legitimate andinalienable rights to live on their national soil in Palestine.It should also support their struggle against the Zionistcolonization of their territory and their fight to establisha sovereign independent State on their national territory with Jerusalem as its capital.The United Nations must implement its resolutionson making the Middle East a zone free from weapons ofmass destruction. In particular  it should implementparagraph 14 of Security Council resolution 687 (1991) which considers Iraq's disarmament a step towardsestablishing in the Middle East a zone free from weaponsof mass destruction. So far the United Nations has takenno steps in that direction.In conclusion  the realization of the concepts ofjustice  democracy and development throughout the worldis subject to the fair democratization of internationalorganizations  in particular the United Nations. Theseconcepts can be achieved only through carrying out aninterrelated series of administrative  structural andpolitical reforms of the United Nations  its agencies andorgans so that it can shoulder its responsibilities under theCharter  primarily its responsibility for the maintenance ofinternational peace and security."
"80",3395,"ISL",54,1999,"Allow me at the outset tocongratulate the President heartily on his election. His postis a challenging one  and I am particularly pleased that thissession is being chaired by a colleague from Namibia which is an important partner for my country.The crucial role of the United Nations in the globalcommunity can never be overstated. As this millenniumdraws to a close  it is natural to take stock of the past andtry to foresee what the future holds in store. TheOrganization's reform measures have included an inwardlook at the organizational structure and personnel mattersand  last but not least  its financial make-up. In this respect many feel that more needs to be done. We must have thecourage to scrutinize not only the Organization itself  butalso the manner in which the Member States conduct theirbusiness inside these walls. While we are going throughthis process  the utmost care should be taken to prevent thediscussion from negatively affecting the public image of theOrganization. Moreover  we should make sure that it doesnot have detrimental effects on the morale of the UnitedNations international staff  whom we depend upon for thesmooth operation of the difficult and often dangerous taskswe assign to them. A constructive approach to reform isvital for the future of the United Nations.There is a real need to strengthen the ability of theUnited Nations to tackle the complex challenges of themodern world. A case in point is the Working Group onthe reform of the Security Council  which has deliberatedfor years without tangible results  with no end in sight.This constant repetition can serve only to weaken theUnited Nations  which has proved itself on manyoccasions to be of fundamental importance to mankind.But it is not only the organizational structures thatneed to be adapted. We need also to look at thesubstance. In this regard  I welcome the emphasis placedby the Secretary-General in his recent report on creatinga culture of prevention. As he correctly points out  ourpolitical and organizational cultures and practices remainoriented far more towards reaction than prevention. Thisneeds to be changed; the efficiency of the United Nationsmight thereby be greatly enhanced.During a recent meeting of the Foreign Ministers ofthe five Nordic countries held in Iceland  we issued ajoint declaration against the use of child soldiers. In thedeclaration it is noted that the current protection ofchildren in armed conflicts is insufficient and thatinternational standards must be raised. On the occasion ofthe tenth anniversary of the Convention on the Rights ofthe Child this year  the Nordic Ministers support theurgent finalization of an optional protocol to ensure thatpersons below the age of 18 years are not recruited intoarmed forces or into armed groups distinct fromgovernmental forces. Children should not be forced totake part in hostilities under any circumstances.In this regard  I would like to express mysatisfaction with the work carried out by the SpecialRepresentative of the Secretary-General for Children andArmed Conflict  especially for his efforts to make non-governmental forces around the world refrain from usingchild soldiers.The vast majority of United Nations Member Stateshave ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child.We have committed ourselves to certain actions topromote children's rights. Causing children to take part inarmed conflicts or otherwise putting them at risk ofbecoming victims of such hostilities is clearly against thebest interests of the child  which should always be ourprimary consideration. There is another powerful reasonto protect children: they are our future. Protecting today'schildren is in itself an important contribution towardspeace and towards creating a culture of prevention. Weshould also strive to ensure that children are able to enjoytheir rights during transitional periods following armed30conflicts or other emergency situations until enoughstability has been achieved to start reconstruction.It seems that not a week goes by in our world withoutcountries and indeed the international community having towatch in horror as cowardly terrorists target people goingabout the business of their everyday lives. The murderingof innocents will never further any cause or put an end toany conflict; it will only add names to the roster of thedead. We urge States to sign and ratify counter-terrorismconventions.In this connection  I would further like to reiterate ourresolve in combatting transnational crime and theinternational trade in drugs. No country is immune fromthese modern evils. Given their global scope and theresources available to criminals  Governments the worldover must work together to put an end to these activities.This year we have recognized the importance of theelderly and their contributions to our lives and society byobserving 1999 as the International Year of Older Persons.The Icelandic authorities have done their utmost to enhancethe visibility of issues facing the elderly in today's society.This has been done through a number of projects  includingprojects designed to bridge the generation gap byencouraging interaction between age groups.At a time of unparalleled economic growth spurred onby the globalization of the world's economy  the fruits ofthis growth  unfortunately  are not evenly distributed. Weare witnessing a growing gap in the distribution of wealthwithin societies as well as between the North and theSouth. Moreover  we have been witnessing an appallingtrend whereby the curse of poverty has increasingly beenfalling upon the shoulders of women. There are no easyanswers on how to tackle this problem in the short term but two long-term approaches stand out regarding theempowerment and advancement of women. They areeducation and respect for human rights.An educated woman passes knowledge to her children which is not as often the case with men. It is universallyaccepted that education and social development go hand inhand and are conditions for a peaceful and prosperousworld. In this age of globalization and technology  itbecomes ever more important to ensure universal education.Therefore  it is crucial to incorporate education intodevelopment projects. For the past few years we have beendoing that through training in the fisheries sector as well asby conducting adult literacy programmes for women incountries such as Namibia. Similar programmes are beingprepared for Malawi and Mozambique.Vigorous efforts also have to be made to end otherforms of discrimination against women. This applies notonly at the national level but also at the internationallevel  where the actions of international organizations areincreasingly having a direct impact on peoples' lives  forexample through crisis management. When carrying outsuch tasks  it is the duty of the organizations concernedto ensure that women and their interests are representedat the negotiating table.During the high-level segment of this year's sessionof the Economic and Social Council  the Icelandicdelegation paid special attention to the plight of the urbanpoor who inhabit coastal regions around the world.Today  my country  Iceland  has a thriving economybased on our fishing industry. The development of aviable fishing industry has strengthened the economy bycreating employment opportunities and prosperity  whichin turn have benefitted the population at large. It is self-evident that a developed fisheries sector can be a crucialfactor in enhancing the food security of developingcountries. The Icelandic authorities have urged privatecompanies to invest in the fisheries sectors of manydeveloping countries. Partnerships forged in this mannerbetween firms in my country and a number of developingcountries have led to transfer of technology in this field thereby spurring economic growth and development in thecoastal regions in question.We believe that many developing countries canbenefit much more from rational utilization of theresources of the oceans. Therefore  approximately half ofour development cooperation has been concentrated onresearch and training in the fisheries sector  putting anemphasis on the sustainable utilization of naturalresources.Through the years  Iceland has placed particularimportance on the work of the Commission onSustainable Development. During its seventh session earlier this year  the Icelandic Government noted thenecessity of abolishing State subsidies that contribute toovercapacity in the fisheries sector worldwide  andparticipated actively in discussions on the need forimproved coordination within the United Nations systemin the field of ocean affairs. It is our view that the overalldebate on the oceans can be improved. It is  however  ourfirm belief that efforts to improve the handling of oceanissues should draw upon existing institutional resources.31These efforts should also carefully take into account theprinciple that global bodies should not try to solve local orregional problems of fisheries management. Themanagement of living marine resources is a very complexand sensitive task that has to be dealt with using the mostadvanced scientific knowledge available and in harmonywith local socio-economic and environmentalcircumstances.Conflicts where the civilian population is expresslytargeted are abhorrent and leave scars that take generationsto heal. Once again  we have witnessed the emergence ofthe dark and evil side of human nature in the horribleethnic cleansing that took place in the recent conflict inKosovo. It would have been desirable if the United Nationscould have played an all-encompassing role in thesettlement of that conflict.In this regard  I would like to endorse the position putforward on humanitarian intervention by the Secretary-General. When a State not only stops protecting the rightsof its citizens but turns against them through grossviolations of human rights  the international communitycannot and should not stand idly by.Iceland currently holds the chair of the Council ofEurope  which encompasses 41 European countries. I wouldlike to take this opportunity to stress the value andimportance of close cooperation between the Council andthe United Nations in the field of human rights. We haverecent examples of such practical cooperation in Kosovo where the Council of Europe is working together with theUnited Nations and other organizations in fulfilment ofSecurity Council resolution 1244 (1999) and the EuropeanUnion-led Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe.Referring again to the benefits of prevention  I should saythat prevention is at the very centre of the Council ofEurope's work on human rights  democracy and the rule oflaw.The agreement between Portugal and Indonesia on thefuture of East Timor was historic  as was the referendumwhich took place. The appalling violence that followed isa cause of great concern. Every effort has to be made tohalt it and to punish those responsible. My Governmentfully supports Security Council resolution 1264 (1999) andwelcomes the speedy deployment of the multinational force.Nothing should be allowed to delay the process towards theindependence of East Timor.We welcome also the change of pace in the MiddleEast peace process. The positive developments in the lastfew months between the Israelis and the Palestinians havebeen very encouraging  and we sincerely hope that thisrenewed momentum will carry us towards a lasting peacein the region. We urge other countries in the region toseize this particular moment and to start the healing ofwounds that have been festering for so long.Icelanders are no strangers to natural disasters  andwe know the devastation they can unleash upon countriesand peoples. Our hearts and sympathy go out to ourfriends in Turkey  Greece and now  most recently  on theisland of Taiwan  who face the aftermath of earthquakesthat claimed the lives of a great number of people. Wehave now decided to join the United Nations DisasterAssessment and Coordination Stand-by Team because webelieve we can make a contribution.During this century we have witnessed mankind'sgreatest achievements as well as its greatest failures.While many countries have gone from war to peace andfrom poverty to prosperity  others have been unable tograsp these often elusive goals of humanity. It is clearthat we will be entering the new millennium withunsolved problems and with challenges of such amagnitude that they will continue to confront us into anunforeseen future.I would like  in closing  to stress what I said in thebeginning — that only with a renewed and revitalizedUnited Nations can we hope to deal with the threats andchallenges that lie ahead. If we  the Member States shoulder our responsibilities and implement the changesnecessary  then the United Nations will always be at theforefront of the quest for peace and prosperity. If we donot have the courage to adopt the necessary changes  wecannot expect our children to do so."
"81",3442,"ISR",54,1999,"The fifty-fourth session ofthe General Assembly of the United Nations takes placeat a time marking humanity's crossing into the nextmillennium. It emerges as a link in the long chain oftumultuous events that have reshaped the map of thefamily of nations.12The United Nations was born against the backdrop ofthe destruction and desolation of the Second World War the most bitter  deadly and inhumane war known tomankind. The descent of the Nazi regime to the depths ofevil was like an eclipse in the history of civilization andwill be recalled in history as a nightmare in which mancreated the devil  who wreaked devastation  destruction terror and annihilation upon the world. The stand taken bythe Allied forces against the Nazi monster  and the creationof the United Nations in April 1945  on the verge of thedefeat of the forces of destruction  was an act that markedthe return of humanity to its senses  to salvage the future ofmankind.In this month when we mark 60 years since theoutbreak of the most horrible of wars  we are strengthenedmore than ever in our sense of hope and confidence in thenecessity of the United Nations and of its activitiesthroughout the world. The various agencies of the UnitedNations work to enhance world health and tend the sick; tosupply the needy with food and nourishment; to buildbridges between cultures; to promote education andovercome ignorance; to instil hope into the lives of refugeesand displaced persons; and to assist the victims of disasters whether natural or man-made.The soldiers of the United Nations forces are the truepeacekeepers of our age. In its corps are soldiers from allthe nations of the world. At times they risk their lives inareas riddled with conflict and violence around the world whether their United Nations mandate is to make peace orto be observers that safeguard the peace. These distinctions important as they may be to the policy makers and shapersof international relations  have no meaning to the individualUnited Nations soldier  posted far from his country  whobrings hope and tranquillity to places fraught with tragedy suffering and violence.After many centuries of violence and war  ofenslavement and destructiveness in the name of murderousideologies  after decades of cold war and polarized worldalliances of the East and the West  the human race is nowmaking great strides down the paths of peace andreconciliation. Before our very eyes  a process isenveloping the world  signalling hope for the future.Mankind is adopting a new path  the path of the prophetIsaiah  who as far back as 2 600 years ago prophesied thatthe day would come when“they shall beat their swords into ploughshares  andtheir spears into pruning-hooks: nation shall not lift upsword against nation  neither shall they learn warany more.” (The Holy Bible  Isaiah 2:4)This prophecy — which has been adopted by theUnited Nations as a source of hope  as the symbol of thevictory of the good in human beings over evil — shouldserve today more than ever as a beacon and a path for allwho cherish peace around the world and for theirrepresentatives gathered here today.The world has become more open. Satellites  theInternet and telecommunications networks shortengeographical and cultural distances. The political andideological blocs of the past have disintegrated  and thewalls of animosity have fallen along with the tyrants anddictators who built them. They are being replaced by newblocs  some of which are in the process of being createdwhere development and prosperity reign. I hope andbelieve that these beneficial transformations will alsooccur in the Middle East.In our region  too  the light of hope has beenrekindled. We are now in the midst of a political process the objective of which is to reach peace between Statesand reconciliation between peoples. Israel aspires to reacha comprehensive peace with its neighbours  a peace ofharmony. Israel will not be satisfied with a merelypolitical or strategic peace. In our eyes  the absence ofwar is not the peace we aspire to achieve.May I be allowed to emphasize once again thatpeace means a culture of peace; peace means no morethreats of violence  whether implied or categorical; peaceentails the end of boycotts  the end of contempt anddefamation  the end of incitement and confrontation...peace is also a language of peace: it is the way leadersaddress their nations  teachers teach their students andreligious leaders inspire their followers.At a time when various kinds of religious extremismare rearing their heads and eroding human wisdom andhuman freedom  it is essential that inter-faith dialogue bestrengthened and that the religions be manifested in theirenlightened forms  which sanctify tolerance andcoexistence.On the way to achieving peace in our region  weoften find ourselves confronted with contradictoryrealities. Parallel to the political process  our negotiatingpartners are conducting a constant political war againstIsrael in various international forums  including from thepodium of this Assembly. This dualism is inconsistent13with the peace process and is intolerable  as are the extremedecisions taken by the Arab League against Israel. Thesedecisions are not in keeping with the spirit of peace  asexpressed in the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum.We hoped for and expected a different atmosphere one that would complement the impetus initiated by thenew Government in Israel. We have been saddened towitness events that undermine the essence of peace. Theseevents can be defined only as anti-peace resolutions.Engaging in a peace process  on the one hand  andmaintaining anti-Israel declarations and resolutions  on theother  raises some serious concerns about our negotiatingpartners and their concept of peace. Is it a peace ofnormalization with open borders  or is it only one oftemporary initial recognition? Will our relations with theGulf and Maghreb countries  such as Morocco  Tunisia Mauritania  Qatar and Oman  be allowed to expand anddevelop? Or will these relations remain hostage to moodswings after each and every difficulty in the negotiations orwhenever there is disagreement? Continued doubts aboutthese cardinal questions cannot be tolerated in the light ofthe heavy price and grave risks that Israel is taking uponitself in this process.Three weeks ago  on 4 September  Israel and thePalestinian Authority signed the Sharm el-SheikhMemorandum  which for the first time creates a direct chronological  political and conceptual link between theInterim Agreements and the final status agreement. On 13September  the final status talks were renewed betweenIsraelis and Palestinians.We are determined to reach a framework agreementthat will form the basis of the final status agreement byFebruary 2000  as stated and agreed upon in the Sharmel-Sheikh Memorandum. In this framework we will selectthe issues and set an agenda for the final status agreement.The topics at hand are known  as are the differing vantagepoints and positions of each side. The differences can beresolved only by direct negotiations.Regarding the final status  I wish to affirm from thispodium that when we refer to political separation as one ofthe prime concepts of the permanent settlement  we are alsosaying that  for the benefit of both sides  we should notnecessarily sever ties that are vital to coexistence in thevarious spheres of living.From Israel’s perspective  there is no competition andnever has been any between the different negotiating tracks.Israel also aspires to reach peace with Syria  ourneighbour to the north. This is  after all  in the highercommon interests of both Israel and Syria. H o w e v e r  along with these common interests  the following pointmust be made clear: A democratic country like Israelcannot accept a precondition to beginning the talks thatrequires a prior acceptance of the final outcome asdictated by the extreme and dogged formulas of theopposing side.We must maintain the momentum of good will sothat we can face our children  Syrian and Israeli alike with a clear conscience and say to them in all honesty:We tried everything and did our utmost. I call upon theleaders of Syria  in view of what we have gone throughtogether  to cease hesitating. It is time to talk. Meetingsand discussion are not political sacrifices — they arebasic necessities.On the road to a comprehensive peace  we wish tosee Lebanon join the camp of peacemakers. The anomalywhich has developed in its territory must come to an end.We have never had nor do we have now any territorialclaims or disputes with Lebanon. Our one and onlyinterest is to guarantee the safety and security of ourcitizens. I must say that  regrettably  the Government ofLebanon has for many years failed to enforce itssovereignty in the southern part of Lebanon and to disarmHezbollah. I hope that this situation will improve and thatIsrael  within the framework of an agreement  will be ableto leave the southern part of Lebanon.Nevertheless  with that as our ambition  I wish toemphasize that we will not be held hostage much longeron this track to a stubborn and defiant attitude. We willmake our own independent decisions  as we see fit  inorder to ensure our protection and our vital interests taking all options under consideration.A reconciliation between Israel and its neighboursmust extend the promise that all the peoples of the regionmay reap the benefits of peace. Normalization must notbe viewed as a one-sided gesture. As a natural outcomeof peaceful coexistence  normalization is not in theservice of one particular party. It is in the interests of allthe nations of the region.We hope to renew the multilateral tracks as early asthis year. There is a need for close cooperation inregional multilateral projects. Our region has tremendouspotential. In order to fully realize this potential  we mustestablish a mechanism of true cooperation among the14States of the region. This cooperation would clearly be tothe benefit of all of us in the region.The scarcity of water in our region  which will onlyget worse  may impose a new way of life on the inhabitantsof the Middle East in the coming years. Israel isanticipating this problem and preparing for it  but in thiscase  as in others  cooperation in the region is essential andwill benefit all sides.The working groups of the multilateral tracksundertook various assignments of primary importance.Unfortunately  their activities have been frozen forirrelevant reasons. This is the time to resurrect them. Anydelay or imposed condition is liable to undermine the peaceprocess and delay the aid packages so essential to thepeoples of the region. Throughout this important process on the bilateral and the multilateral tracks alike  we areaccompanied by the international community. First andforemost was the United States of America  along with theRussian Federation  the European Union  Canada  Norway Japan  China and other countries and organizations thathave assisted and continue to do so. Their key contributionsearn them special commendation from this rostrum.Egypt and Jordan were our first partners in breakingdown the walls of enmity and in thawing relations in ourregion. Improving our relations with Egypt  as well asrenewing the multilateral tracks  are essential to furtheringthe common objectives of the nations in our region. T h erelations between Israel and Jordan are an example ofappropriate and favourable relations between neighbouringcountries. We intend to strengthen and broaden the relationsbetween the two nations in the economic  social andpolitical realms.As we march further along the difficult path ofmaking peace  we look back with sorrow and sadness as weremember the pioneers who broke new ground and are nolonger with us today: the late Menachem Begin  AnwarSaddat  Yitzhak Rabin  King Hussein and King Hassan IIof Morocco. Their vision and their work inspire us tocontinue to work towards completing their enterprise ofpeacemaking.We cannot afford to be disillusioned. Our region isneither North America nor Benelux. Even as we negotiatethe peace process  we remain aware of the threats anddangers directed against us  threatening the stability of theentire region. The mix of extreme fundamentalism  on theone hand  and of the potential use of weapons of massdestruction  on the other  threatens the peace  stability andfuture of the entire region. This threat is not just anelement of academic debates in the study of internationalrelations  but a harsh reality which we must all face.From this international platform  I call for a halt toall technological  scientific and other kinds of assistanceto countries looking to obtain unconventional weapons while threatening the existence of the State of Israel andthe region as a whole.The Persian Gulf War demonstrated that leadershiplacking reason and stability poses a threat to all thecountries in the region and to the world at large. Themonitoring groups and machinery in Iraq must beimmediately resumed. That is the obligation of theinternational community so long as the Iraqi regime seeksnon-conventional weapons and threatens the region. TheUnited Nations is the largest  most authoritative and mostrecognized international body. It should therefore be theone to take the initiative and the responsibility in curbingthis danger.Terrorism is an additional strategic enemy and wecannot come to terms with its existence. It is a threat notonly to Israel  but to many other nations across the worldas well. Terror knows no borders or civilized rules. Therecan be no coexistence with terror  either in the context ofthe negotiations conducted by Israel with its neighbours or in the broader regional context. Anyone who believesthat terror is a nuisance which can be tolerated ismistaken. Terror is in essence a strategic threat. Asynthesized  coordinated and unrelenting approach mustbe adopted against it.Here  in this building of stone and glass  reflectingthe current image of our world today with its points oflight and shadows of darkness  counterparts and enemiesmeet as friends and allies in the creation of a forum fordiscussion and coexistence. Discussion is the way toresolve conflict. It is also the way of tomorrow. Dialogueand common language are the tools of diplomacy  the rawmaterial for the creation of a new reality and thefoundation for a stable and safer society.It was here in the General Assembly  at thebeginning of the decade  that I first met with my Chinesecounterpart. After 40 years of total dissociation betweenour two countries  we endeavoured to re-establishdiplomatic relations between Israel and China. It was alsohere that we laid the groundwork for establishing tieswith the former Soviet Union  as well as with India Nigeria and other States. These are only a few examples15demonstrating the possibility in this arena for building abridge between nations and States.As a nation that experienced great difficulties overcome only by accelerated development efforts  the Stateof Israel takes part in the international effort to aid othersand share knowledge  experience and technology experience which it has accumulated in various fields. Thenation of Israel is proud of its ancient tradition of sharingand identifying with the world at large.Through the Division for International Cooperationwithin the Israeli Foreign Ministry  Israel maintains ongoingprojects and a broad range of training courses in Israel. Wehave demonstration units and we are conducting research.For example  a special medical centre was recentlyestablished in Mauritania and serves the many citizens ofthat State who suffer from chronic eye problems. Similarly Israel invests great efforts and resources in trainingprofessionals to acquire the skills and abilities necessary formeeting the various challenges that engage many parts ofthe world.In the more than 40 years since its inception  theDivision for International Cooperation has trained morethan 70 000 trainees from more than 120 countries  whohave come to Israel and attended its training courses in theareas of agriculture  water resources  health and medicine science  education and others.In 1998 alone  some 155 courses were held in Israelon a variety of topics  with the participation of more than4 000 trainees. Gladly  I can report that many of thetrainees were from Middle Eastern countries. Fully 820Palestinians participated in these courses over the past year thereby helping to strengthen the bridges of peace whichhave been built between Israelis and Palestinians. In thesame year  Israel ran more than 150 courses in over 60different countries  with the participation of over 7 000trainees. I am proud to point out that in many of thecountries to which we sent Israeli experts  the localpersonnel managed to translate our goodwill into positiveresults on the ground  to the benefit of their people andtheir land.Because of the reputation it has acquired  the Divisionfor International Cooperation is also one of the centraladdresses in Israel to which people can turn in times ofdisaster around the world. We have recently witnessed justhow essential such assistance can be in times of naturaldisasters. Israel has always responded favourably torequests for aid and relief  regardless of the politicalcontext or the state of diplomatic relations.We wish to support and commend the United Statesof America  our friend and ally  an inspiration to us all inits efforts to promote the values of cooperation amongnations. This is also the time to express our appreciationto the United States for its intensive efforts to bring truepeace to the Middle East.Even today in the United States we have witnessedagain a new resort to the threat of boycott. The case athand is the threat to declare a boycott against theAmerican company Disney  because the company daredto allow Jerusalem to be portrayed in an exhibitioncelebrating the millennium. We condemn these threats andthe use by certain Arab States of this anachronisticdevice. It has no place here or anywhere else in theworld.Over thousands of years  since the time of biblicalKing David  the builder of Jerusalem  until the presentday  Jerusalem has not served as the capital of any othernation in the world besides the nation of Israel  theJewish people. Even after our forced exile from the landof Israel  we continued  generation after generation  tostay faithful to Jerusalem. The flame of Jerusalem wascarried in our hearts as a hidden source of faith and hope.In our wanderings  in the East and in the West  inthe African deserts and on the outskirts of Siberia  fromthe golden age of Spain through the dark Inquisition during the prosperous Europe of the romantic era to thecharred ashes of the Holocaust  throughout all the abovethe eyes of the Jews and their prayers have been directedtoward Jerusalem. Year after year  from father to son  theanthem of the Jewish nation has constantly been “NextYear in Jerusalem”.With the passing of those previous generations andexiles  we have had the privilege of being deemed worthyto return to Jerusalem  to rebuild the ruins  to rededicatethe city as a centre radiating with beauty  open to allfollowers of all religions  as the poet has said  wherefreedom of all religions is a fact of life.It is so upsetting then that even today  51 years sincethe independence of the State of Israel  there are stillthose who would deny our natural right to decide thelocation of our capital  a natural right given to everynation in the world. From Jerusalem  the city of David  Iwill quote from the original song of David on Jerusalem 16in words which transcends the limits of time and retainstheir meaning in every generation:“Our feet shall stand within thy gates  oh Jerusalem.Jerusalem is built as a city that is bound firmlytogether.” (The Holy Bible  Psalm 122:2-3)Today  as before  from this podium we declare to theentire world  to our friends and people and those who aredistant from us: Jerusalem  unified under Israelisovereignty  is and will remain forever the capital of Israel."
"82",3489,"ITA",54,1999,"I congratulate you  Sir  on yourelection as President of the General Assembly; it is a sureguarantee of success for the fifty-fourth session. I also wishto thank your predecessor  Didier Opertti  the ForeignMinister of Uruguay  for his exemplary management of theAssembly's work during the past year.On the many issues facing the General Assembly inthe year to come  Italy shares and supports the statementmade yesterday by the Foreign Minister of Finlandspeaking on behalf of the European Union.The last few years of this century have disproved thenotion that people and human freedoms take second placeto State sovereignty. In Kosovo and East Timor acoalition of States resorted to the use of force  but not forself-seeking national interests  not to defend their borders not to impose new hegemonies.The end of the nuclear nightmare has coincided witha rampant proliferation of local conflicts  terrorist acts andtraumatic economic and financial crises. Can the end ofcommunism have given peace to former cold-war enemiesand conflict to the rest of the world? The cold warbrought a precarious  imperfect peace. Was that preferableto the tragic series of conflicts that have embroiledhumanity over the past 10 years? The division of Europehelped neutralize tensions throughout the planet. Does thismean that nuclear weapons brought about a period ofunprecedented stability  and — as some have suggested paradoxically — that we should award the Nobel PeacePrize to the bomb? The breakdown of the formerinternational order has created a plethora of new States.Does this mean that dividing the world in two was theonly way to grant common citizenship to peoples andreligious groups that have never learned the art ofpeaceful coexistence? The international community nowtakes military action to deal with tragedies that only a fewyears ago would have left us indifferent  and yet we arestill influenced by military assessments  strategic interests regional solidarity  public opinion and the magnitude ofany human rights violations. How can we act accordingto more precise rules  based primarily on the duty ofStates to protect the rights of individuals?The crises that have broken out in recent years haveraised agonizing dilemmas and difficult questions thatdemand answers. It would be wrong to use theimperfections of the international system as an excuse forinaction. But it would also be wrong to ignore the newdemands for certainty and the rule of law: the greatestchallenge is how to relate authority to law and lay downcodes of conduct and political discipline that reconcilepower with legitimacy.Allow me to articulate a set of principles that couldguide our action in the new century. First  we shouldenhance crisis prevention rather than conflict suppression.Secretary-General Kofi Annan has rightly observed that19we must eradicate the cultural and economic causes ofconflicts and that a culture of conflict prevention mustprevail over the culture of conflict suppression. We knowwhat these causes of conflict are: the huge gap between theliving standards and incomes of different classes andnations; the exponential increase in mass migration frompoor to rich countries; cultural difference and the conflictsand fanaticism it triggers; criminal acts for the sake ofglorifying or even creating a nation. These are the fourhorsemen of the contemporary Apocalypse.Secondly  we should use force only as a last resort.Arms should be used to stop criminal behaviour only wheneconomic and political instruments are inapplicable or havefailed. Ten years ago  these same instruments brought downtotalitarian communism  which was a more formidableenemy than today's tyrants. In the Balkans and in EastTimor  peacekeeping operations were launched to addressserious  massive and systematic violations of human rights.The decisions to intervene were made after repeateddemands that the culprits end a state of illegality; after anexhaustive and fruitless search for a diplomatic solution;and by a group of States rather than by a single Power.We are living in an age of unfinished wars. In Iraq asin Serbia  authoritarian rulers have been seriouslyweakened  but they are still in power. How and how muchcan sanctions be used to replace or complement the use offorce? Perhaps we need clearer international strategies andrules that pay heed to the most vulnerable members ofsociety  to the political opposition and to the risk ofstrengthening despots through sanctions. Our focus shouldbe more on incentives than on sanctions.Thirdly  we need to define rules. No one knows thesize or shape of the next challenge. But our response mustbe dictated by respect for universal principles rather than bya balance of power. We must beware of conjuring up thespectre of international law as the law of the strongest. Wemust beware of making some countries more equal thanothers. To do so would run counter to our best political andcultural traditions  in which the law is meant to protect theweak.The Western world and the Euro-Atlantic institutionsare no threat to anyone's integrity  prosperity and freedom.But we must perfect the instruments that uphold theinternational rule of law. We must spell out the duties ofStates. We must create a fully fledged corpus of case lawon universal human rights. We must work out rules andprocedures that will justify the erosion of sovereignty in thename of global responsibility. This is why every countrymust make it a priority to ratify the internationalinstruments for safeguarding human rights. I am thinkingin particular of the International Criminal Court  whichwas instituted in Rome in June of last year. Theseinstruments should be reflected in our national legislationand practice. Finally  we should encourage theinvolvement of our own institutions. It is in this spirit thatwe have invited the United Nations High Commissionerfor Human Rights  Mrs. Mary Robinson  to address theItalian Parliament.Until human rights are firmly institutionalized doubts will remain over the relationship betweenlegitimacy and effectiveness. The gradual construction ofuniversal citizenship is a learning process to which we allshould contribute. Otherwise we shall be racing towardsfragmentation  seeking forms of independence that are noteconomically viable and that are vulnerable to others'desire for hegemony.Fourthly  we must learn to appreciate the judgementof others. I would like to quote  in this respect  one of thefounding fathers of American democracy  James Madison.He said:“An attention to the judgement of other nationsis important to every government for two reasons.The first one is that  independently of the merits ofany particular plan or measure  it is desirable  onvarious accounts  that it should appear to othernations as the offspring of a wise and honourablepolicy. The second is that  in doubtful cases particularly where the national councils may bewarped by some strong passion or momentaryinterests  the presumed or known opinion of theimpartial world may be the best guides that can befollowed.”Today's world has acquired a new sensitivity. It willno longer tolerate the oppression of the weak. Thisimplies a rethinking of the principles of nationalsovereignty and non-interference that have governed thecommunity of nations for over three centuries  beginningin Europe. But we must avoid double standards  applyingone yardstick to friendly countries and another to thosethat are not. This is what makes the ultimate sanction ofthe United Nations so indispensable  since an internationallegal standard cannot — except in exceptional temporarysituations — be the prerogative of any single group ofStates.20When we defend the rights of others  we cannotpretend that the lives of our own people are not also at risk.By the same token  it would be inconsistent not to place thesame value on other human lives as we do on our own.Every culture and tradition must be involved in thedefence of liberties and freedom. We cannot ignore theregional dimension of human rights  whose inviolableuniversal character can be enriched by the varieties ofhistoric experiences. But stalemates and the paralysis ofintersecting vetoes must be avoided by anchoring even thestrongest States to a system of rules and principles balancing their power against the effectiveness and strengthof the international institutions.Fifthly  we should strengthen the institutions. Theaftermath of the cold war has proved that large political andeconomic groupings can more easily guarantee ethniccoexistence  religious tolerance and economic advancement.This should be kept in mind whenever pressure builds torelease the genie of self-determination from the bottle ofState sovereignty.Only the great institutions  whether regional — suchas the European Union and the Atlantic Alliance — oruniversal — such as the United Nations — can close thegap between democratic codification of laws and theireffective enforcement. Unless we have a strong institutionalnetwork  every peacekeeping operation could end uplooking as if we were taking the law into our own hands.Everyone would feel as if he should look out only for hisown security  leading to a proliferation of weapons of massdestruction. Therefore  let us resume the disarmament talks as President Clinton proposed in his statement yesterday and place our common security on more solid foundations.There is one lesson to be learned from these years ofturmoil: actions to prevent and repress the most seriousviolations of human rights may take precedence overrespect for national sovereignty. No Government can hidebehind the shield of its own borders. Legitimacy demandsthe redefinition of relations between States and theinternational community. It demands the reformulation ofthe principle of non-interference  which has sometimesallowed States to neglect their duties towards their citizens.Although the United Nations is an organization of States the rights and the ideals it protects are those of individuals.I have listed some rules that will help redefinecoexistence among peoples through the work of the UnitedNations. We live in a world in which threats against onegroup immediately affect every other group and impel themto take responsibility  a world in which the concept ofnon-interference can no longer be invoked to obstructaction in the face of serious violations of fundamentalrights. We must ask ourselves how to address all thesechanges  for the sake of closer and more equitableinternational cooperation.Of course  States will continue to have differentperceptions of national interests  and there will be acontinued need to reconcile them peacefully. But for theUnited Nations to meet the challenges of the new century our codes of conduct must be placed within a more solidinstitutional framework. The United Nations SecurityCouncil should be made more representative anddemocratic in composition  in line with proposals of anumber of Member States. All the citizens of the worldshould be able to identify themselves with the UnitedNations and feel a part of its decision-making and law-making processes; this for the sake of universalsovereignty  which is not the prerogative of a few  but theright of all.The cold war represented an international orderdominated by two super-Powers and held in check bynuclear weapons. Today’s world is economically moreunited  but politically more divided. The watchword ofthe economy is deregulation. But politics requires rules ifwe do not want anarchy to prevail. Unlike the market  inpolitics no invisible hand can generate peace andprosperity. What we need is a visible hand that enactsrules and regulations  and obliges States to respect them both beyond their borders and in the treatment of theircitizens. Let us make the United Nations the visible handof peace and prosperity. This may be the greatestchallenge awaiting us. We must face it together  here inthis forum  and place it at the centre of the upcomingdebate on the role of the United Nations in the twenty-first century."
"83",3535,"JAM",54,1999,"On behalf of the delegationof Jamaica I extend to you  Sir  our congratulations on yourelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at itsfifty-fourth session. You and your country  Namibia  aregraduates of the United Nations  steeped in its principles faithful to its causes and committed to its goals. We havefull confidence that your leadership will continue to guideus this session in the adoption of constructive decisionswhich will serve to strengthen the role of the Organizationin world affairs.We express our appreciation to the outgoing President Mr. Didier Opertti  Minister for Foreign Affairs ofUruguay  for his outstanding work in conducting thebusiness of our last session. We congratulate theSecretary-General for his report (A/54/1) outlining theactivities of the Organization over the past year andcontaining his vision for its future work.Jamaica welcomes the three States that this year havejoined the membership of the United Nations: the Republicof Kiribati  the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom ofTonga. Their presence will enrich our deliberations asthey bring their particular experiences and perspectives toinfluence the direction and work of the Organization.Their admission coincides with the holding of the specialsession of the General Assembly on small islanddeveloping States which over the last two days addressedthe particular vulnerabilities of these States  which meritspecial attention within the international community.The three nations we welcome today are also linkedto Jamaica through the Commonwealth of Nations. Thisyear the Commonwealth celebrates its fiftieth anniversary and we salute its achievements in cooperation —especially in promoting the development objectives of itsmembership — including the recent initiatives to addressthe special problems of smaller States.The widening of the gap between rich and poor andthe increasing marginalization of a large number ofdeveloping countries within the world economicframework are urgent matters demanding the attention ofthe international community. The reasons for these trendsare well-known: superior endowments of naturalresources; early advantages in modernizing productionprocesses; high levels of capital accumulation andtechnological development — all have helped consolidatethe dominance of the developed countries in worldproduction and trade. Countries which started later in theday will not find it easy to close the gap.And it is not true that the developing countries haveonly themselves to blame. Most of us have implementedprogrammes of structural adjustment and stabilizationpolicies  but we have found that the current orthodoxy offree markets and a development model based onliberalization  deregulation and privatization is not providingthe promised benefits in trade and investment flows. Thereis evident need to review the prescriptions and to promotea development policy which takes into greater account thespecific socio-economic context of developing countries andto devise more equitable arrangements in internationaleconomic relations.In an interdependent world  the human dimension ofthe development equation  especially the growing incidenceof poverty and all its manifestations  must continue to be amatter of concern to the entire global community. It istherefore essential that we seek to establish a betterframework for development cooperation and to implementan agenda for development as a matter of priority withinthe United Nations system.Currently  what we are seeing is a withering of interestand diminished commitment on the issue of cooperation fordevelopment and a hardening of attitudes in an atmospherewhich preaches competitiveness and the survival of thefittest. It is clear to us that special arrangements are needed not only in relation to special categories of countries  butalso in relation to commodities  where serious problemswould result from the rigorous application of the dogma offree trade. Regrettably  even where such specialarrangements exist they are under threat.The challenge to the banana regime established withinthe framework of the Lomé Convention and the ruling ofthe World Trade Organization (WTO) panel  which hasnow led to negotiations for an amended regime  sends amessage which is particularly discouraging and signals theindifference of some countries to the plight of others. Theend result is not yet determined  but at this time theeconomies of some Caribbean States face a danger not justto their prospects for economic stability and growth  but totheir very survival. Many appeals have been made whichhave gone unheeded. More than anything else  the bananacontroversy has signified the extent to which the interestsof small producers are at the mercy of those in a positionof dominance in the world economy and world trade.Another discouraging trend is the diminishedsignificance and reduced contributions of donor countries inthe area of development cooperation. At a time of theincreasing incidence of poverty and a looming threat ofmarginalization  levels of official development assistancehave been steadily decreasing at both the bilateral and themultilateral levels. In the case of the United NationsDevelopment Programme (UNDP)  technical assistancehas been shrinking  especially over the last five years. In1994  contributions to UNDP were in the region of $1.1billion. This has steadily declined to the current level forthis year of $718 million.We have been supporting initiatives for reform inorder to promote better coordination and greaterefficiency and cost-effectiveness in the delivery oftechnical assistance in the operational activities of theUnited Nations. What we have seen  however  is that thereform process seems more directed at generating costsavings and achieving a pooling of resources withoutincreasing the quantum of funding available fordevelopment cooperation under the auspices of the UnitedNations. The process under way is one of contraction ofUnited Nations-related development activities at thecountry level and a withering-away of the role of theUnited Nations in an area of critical importance fordeveloping countries. The reduced impact of the UnitedNations at the country level is already significant andcomes at a time when the needs are greater than ever.We call for a new commitment to developmentcooperation  a new global partnership between thedeveloped and the developing countries and a newdialogue to review the policies and principles directinginternational economic relations  and for a newdispensation with regard to policy prescriptions affectingthe development process. Without this  developingcountries will be engulfed in the perils of globalizationwith consequences not just for economic welfare  but forthe viability of political structures and social stability.There are also other  more insidious dimensions ofglobalization  especially those which impinge on thesecurity of States  which we must consider. Within thegrowing internationalization of markets facilitated byimproved technology and policies of liberalization  thespectre of transnational crime has grown to significantproportions  especially in the illicit trade in narcotics andsmall arms. Together  these instruments of death anddestruction represent a significant danger to the internalsecurity of many countries  fostering criminal activitieswhich serve to destabilize and corrupt the social order  toundermine democratic institutions and to increaselawlessness.2We believe that this growing trade in weapons  whichpromotes organized crime  terrorist activities and drugtrafficking  requires the urgent attention of the internationalcommunity. Jamaica therefore welcomes the arrangementsfor the holding of the first international conference on smallarms  which is to take place in the year 2000. We lookforward to this as a good opportunity to develop aprogramme for implementation by Member States to controlthe scale and distribution of these weapons.On reviewing the broader issue of internationalsecurity  we have to note developments which give rise toconcern and anxiety about the future of the world order andthe role of the United Nations. The Organization shouldbecome engaged wherever international peace is threatenedand where conflicts break out. Although the danger ofglobal conflict arising from ideological confrontation hasnow  in large measure  receded  the world is still full ofthreats to peace.Wars continue to be waged at the regional level primarily as a result of regional rivalries and unresolvedterritorial disputes. At the national level  ethnic strife andpolitical divisiveness have continued to fuel internalconflict  leading to heavy loss of life and economicdisruption and affecting regional stability from thespill-over of refugees to neighbouring States.We endorse the Secretary-General's strategy of quietdiplomacy and urge him to use his influence whereverpossible to forestall the outbreak of conflict and to promotepeace and reconciliation between disputing parties. Inaccordance with the principles of national sovereignty  hewill need the cooperation and support of Member States inhis efforts for the maintenance of peace  as delicateproblems can arise in relation to any process of diplomaticintervention with respect to the role to be undertaken by theUnited Nations and appropriate regional organizations.During the past year  events in the Balkans have raisedprofound questions about the principle of intervention  theuse of force  the scale of military enforcement and the roleof the Security Council. The debate on these questions hasrevealed differing perspectives  elements of consensus andvarying positions on the applicable principles ofinternational law. In recent times  we have witnessedatrocities committed as a result of the practice of ethniccleansing as communities rise up against each other tosettle old grievances. We all must continue to condemnthese practices and understand the need for some kind ofaction to halt such excesses which violate internationalhumanitarian norms.However  the principles of international law affectingthe sovereignty of States and the use of force should notbe brushed aside. We believe in the adoption of anapproach which has the confidence of the internationalcommunity whereby diplomatic and any necessaryenforcement action is taken or authorized by themultilateral institutions entrusted with safeguardinginternational peace and security. The Security Council hasthe primary responsibility. It should not be ignored anddisregarded in favour of unilateral action on the part ofany State or group of States.While the situation in the Balkans has dominatedinternational attention over the past year  more attentionshould be given to the situation in Africa  where evenmore serious problems have arisen involving ethnic strifeand political turmoil  affecting neighbouring States andcreating humanitarian emergencies. As theSecretary-General has observed in his report  too littleattention has been given to the conflicts arising in Africadespite the enormous toll in loss of life and in disruptionand suffering resulting from armed insurgencies andinter-State conflict. However  we are encouraged by theprocess taking place in the West African region affectingLiberia and Sierra Leone. We must pay tribute to thework of the Economic Community of West African States(ECOWAS)  which has shouldered the burden of peace-building in these two States so battered by civil conflict.We also note with appreciation the efforts of theOrganization of African Unity (OAU) in regard to thesituation in the Great Lakes region and hope that theLusaka Agreement will form the basis for reconciliationand peace. The situation in Angola remains a tragic onefor the country  and the international community shouldremain united in support of measures taken against theUNITA insurgency and to bring an end to the nightmarewhich has for so long impeded the progress of thatcountry.We are distressed by the continuing problems in theHorn of Africa. We continue to support regional effortstowards peacemaking between Ethiopia and Eritrea andwelcome the OAU framework agreement which has beenworked out to assist the parties to reach a settlement. Weurge the Secretary-General to continue to maintain closecontact with the parties in all the areas of tension  withthe aim of promoting peace and stability  and to foster aspirit of reconciliation so that African States may be ableto concentrate their efforts in confronting the criticalchallenges of economic and social development.3In the Middle East  while the situation still remainstroublesome  there are some signs of renewed hope with therevival of the peace process and the emergence of a morepositive climate for making progress towards a settlement.We welcome the signing of the Sharm el-SheikhMemorandum earlier this month and urge the parties tomove towards accommodation  to seek to realize thelegitimate rights of all parties as the basis for a just anddurable peace. The challenge is formidable and the solutionwill require statesmanship and courage.In South-East Asia the outbreak of violence in EastTimor is a matter which has caused deep concern. As thereis an obvious need for ensuring the safety of the inhabitantsof the territory  we fully support the deployment of theinternational force which is now in the territory to maintainorder. It is necessary now to contemplate the next step which will be to devise arrangements for the political futureof the territory.In our area of Latin America and the Caribbean thereremain a number of unresolved territorial disputes but ourexpectation is that States in our region will use availablemechanisms to resolve such disputes by peaceful means. Inthe Caribbean our efforts are directed towards developinggreater integration both within the Caribbean Communityand within the wider ambit of the Association of CaribbeanStates  ACS. This is part of our regional effort towardsestablishing a regime of peace and cooperation in theCaribbean Sea. In this regard  I should express our ongoingconcern over the remaining remnants of cold war politics inour region. The continuation of the embargo against Cubais a source of tension and carries the risk of conflict  whichis particularly troubling for neighbouring States. In thespirit of the friendly relations we enjoy with Cuba and theUnited States  we call for dialogue  the normalization ofrelations and an end to policies of confrontation andexclusion.Small countries have an important interest in ensuringthat peace and stability is a permanent feature of the worldorder. In the absence of military power we depend ondiplomacy and on the United Nations and its machinery andinternational adherence to its principles to safeguard andprotect those who are militarily weak. It is in our interestto seek to strengthen and uphold all the multilateralinstitutions dedicated to this effort. The Security Council which has such an important role in this structure  shouldbe given the fullest support in meeting its responsibilities.This is best achieved through the democratic participationof the United Nations membership in the work of theCouncil  which serves to strengthen its effectiveness and togive it greater credibility within the international system.Jamaica supports that process and aspires formembership of the Council for a two-year periodbeginning next year. We do so out of a motivation tomake our contribution as a small State in the managementof international peace and security. We are driven by astrong commitment to multilateralism and to upholdingthe principles of the Charter and by a determination toexercise a careful and balanced judgement in relation toall issues affecting peace and security which may comebefore us. It will be our goal to assist the SecurityCouncil to work effectively and to act decisively. We willseek to involve the broader membership in itsconsultations and to influence the discharge of theCouncil's responsibilities with fairness and with fullrespect for the legitimate interests of all parties  withinthe broader interest of international peace and security.The work of the United Nations in the area ofhumanitarian relief has always been an important part ofits operations  and this is the area in which its work hashad the most direct impact and practical meaning at thelevel of the people. This is particularly so in the deliveryof emergency relief in natural disasters. The increase inthe scale and intensity of earthquakes  hurricanes  floodsand famine in recent times has increased the demands onthe system  and there is an obvious need to maintaincapability and readiness in the relevant agencies. At thesame time  we should support the various initiatives fordisaster prevention  including the enforcement of stricterbuilding codes  improved drainage systems  the exchangeof scientific knowledge  increased monitoring and the useof early-warning systems to protect ourselves and mitigatethe damage.Much more can be done to avert disasters in thoseareas where members have greater control and power.Man-made disasters create a tragic problem of refugees which otherwise is often the result of war  persecution orpolitical turmoil. The tragic plight of refugees uprootedfrom their homes and forced to flee is a sad anddisturbing picture  and even more so for the neighbouringStates  which are often poor countries that do not havethe means to handle heavy inflows.As we have seen from the Secretary-General's report one of the distressing practices in recent conflicts hasbeen the deliberate targeting of civilians and humanitarianworkers. This unacceptable flouting of humanitariannorms is a matter of serious concern for us and indicatesthe need for further elaboration of principles ofinternational humanitarian law applicable in time of war.4Our review of the state of the world in the economic political and humanitarian dimensions suggests the need forgreater effort in building political commitment andinvesting resources for achieving common goals. Too manyof the old problems remain unresolved  and our unity ofpurpose is too often compromised by political differencesand considerations of narrow economic interests. At a timeof increasing globalization  the reality of interdependenceshould be leading us in the other direction — towardsmutual respect  tolerance  understanding and partnership ina world of diversity  for these are the true foundations ofmultilateralism.As we close this century and approach the newmillennium  we should do so in the hope of reachinggreater achievements by acting in concert to uphold ourideals of humanity and to fight the common enemies ofmankind: war  poverty  human suffering and injustice. Thisshould be our firm resolve."
"84",3581,"JOR",54,1999,"Permitme first to congratulate you  Sir  on your election to theoffice of President of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session. I am fully confident that your experienceand skills will bring the work of this session to asuccessful conclusion. Please permit me also to expressmy deep appreciation and gratitude to your predecessor Mr. Didier Opertti  for his magnificent and distinguishedstewardship  which made a success of the last session.I take this opportunity to pay tribute to theSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for his wiseleadership and outstanding work towards realizing andemphasizing the goals and principles of the UnitedNations and his tireless efforts to achieve peace  securityand stability in the world.In the last few months of the second millennium and as we bid farewell to it and await the dawning of thethird millennium  this session of the General Assemblytakes place at an important historic and symbolic moment a moment of mixed emotions. We look back and see thatmankind has achieved great things despite the serioussuffering and pain that have marked the twentieth century.We look forward with great hope to entering a new era inwhich we shall build a more humanitarian world  inwhich nations will be able to live in true partnership  witha sense of belonging to this planet  in a more just andharmonious way. We shall have an enhanced ability tocope collectively with the major challenges that confrontus and to respond to changes that require a long-rangeglobal vision. This will increase our ability to provideanswers and solutions to the difficult questions and issuesthat face us.This historic moment is of particular importance inthe life of Jordan  which was engulfed by grief a fewmonths ago  when it was deprived of its great leader  thelate King Hussein Ibn Talal — may God bless his soul.He had succeeded in turning Jordan from a small countrywith limited resources into an oasis of peace and stabilityin a region beset by disturbances and wars. This countryhas just begun a new era under the leadership of KingAbdullah II Bin Al Hussein. His Majesty has assumed theresponsibility for continuing  with renewed vigour  to leadJordan to progress and prosperity  as we look forward toushering in the new century. He is committed also toJordan’s continuing to make its important and essentialcontribution to the building of peace in the Middle Eastand to continuing to contribute generously at theinternational level. He strongly believes  as Jordan’sleaders have always believed  that our country belongs to30this international family. Jordan is committed to the Charterof the United Nations and to the principles of internationallaw.Our late leader was a unique international leader  withan unflinching belief in the role of the United Nations andin the peaceful settlement of disputes. He expressed hisbelief in these principles by working all his life to bringabout a just  comprehensive and lasting peace in the MiddleEast based on international legitimacy. He did this out ofhis strong belief in human dignity  in people’s right to livefree from all forms of injustice and despotism  and out ofan awareness that human life is too precious to be wastedin confrontations and wars. Human beings have the right tolead free and dignified lives  channelling all their resourcesand energies towards achieving economic and socialdevelopment and participating in building a prosperous andsecure future for the generations to come.The life of our great leader who is  alas  no more  isthe story of the building of modern Jordan. His exceptionalcontributions in the international arena were also a rareexample of what can be achieved by a historic leader whobelieves in high moral principles and supreme virtues.Jordanians felt a deep sense of pride and appreciation whenthey saw the whole world — leaders and common peoplealike — standing side by side with them  sharing their griefat the loss of the creator of their renaissance and theirmodern State. They also felt a deep sense of trust andconfidence in the strength and durability of theirconstitutional and institutional structures  which were builtby the late leader of their country and have ensured a stableand successful beginning to the era of King Abdullah II BinAl Hussein  in a way that has won the appreciation andrespect of the world.Jordanians are rallying today behind their King andmarching behind him on the road to realizing their hopesand aspirations. Jordan is beginning  under the leadership ofKing Abdullah II Bin Al Hussein  a new era with a firmcommitment to following the same course that hasdistinguished and will continue to distinguish Jordanianpolicy at both the domestic and international levels.Over the past few months  Jordan has continued itsefforts to advance the peace process in the Middle East.This process had suffered over the past three years fromfoot-dragging leading to effective deadlock  all of whichseverely tested the confidence of the peoples of the regionin the peace process as a whole. The result of last May’sparliamentary elections in Israel gave rise to new hopes ofreviving this process and putting it back on track. Thepositive developments of the past few weeks show thatthe region stands now before a second historicopportunity to achieve peace on all tracks. We sincerelyhope that the leaders of the region will seize thisopportunity  live up to the expectations and aspirations oftheir peoples and not hesitate to take the bold decisionsneeded to bring the negotiations to fruition.The question of Palestine has been and will continueto be at the core of the Arab-Israeli conflict and theMiddle East crisis. The establishment of peace in theregion therefore requires  first and foremost  that a justsolution should be reached to this question — a solutionwith which the peoples of the region will be satisfied andwhich they will if need be defend. Jordan has been callingthroughout the past year for the Wye River Memorandum which was arrived at with the unprecedented involvementand assistance of the late King Hussein  to beimplemented. We have been consistently aware of theimpact that implementation of the Memorandum wouldhave on reactivating the peace process on all tracks  onestablishing confidence and a spirit of partnershipbetween the Palestinian and Israeli leaderships  and on re-establishing confidence in the peace process amongst thepeoples of the region. The signing of the Sharm el-SheikhMemorandum has enhanced the prospects forimplementing the Wye River Memorandum in a way thatwe hope will advance the final status negotiationsbetween the Palestinians and the Israelis so that asettlement may be reached that would ensure that thePalestinian people realize their right to self-determination including their right to establish an independent State ontheir national territory  with Al-Quds al-Sharif — HolyJerusalem — as its capital.As King Abdullah II has emphasized  Jordan willcontinue to provide support for a successful conclusion ofthe negotiations. We are directly interested in theirsuccess because the issues on the agenda relate to ournational interest  particularly the issues of the refugees the borders and Jerusalem. Over the past 50 years  Jordan more than any other party  has shouldered the burden ofthe refugee problem. This has put immense pressures onJordan’s resources and economy  particularly given thatevery reduction in the services provided by the UnitedNations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugeesin the Near East (UNRWA) has placed additional burdenson Jordan. Direct expenditures by the Government ofJordan on services provided to the refugees in 1998reached 4.75 times the amount spent by UNRWA on suchservices. Total expenditures incurred by the Governmentof Jordan equal the entire budget that UNRWA spends on31refugees in all its areas of operations throughout the MiddleEast. Jordan calls on the international community not toallow any reductions in the role of UNRWA or in itsprogrammes until the refugee question has been resolved inaccordance with international legitimacy — which wouldlead to the closing of this file in its entirety once and forall. Jordan also calls on the donor countries to continuetheir support for UNRWA to enable it to continue todischarge its responsibilities.With regard to the peace process on other tracks Jordan believes that a comprehensive solution is aprerequisite for the establishment of peace in the region.Without such a solution  no settlement can be assured ofdurability. Jordan therefore strongly supports the efforts toreactivate negotiations on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks.It supports the demand by Syria and Lebanon thatnegotiations should be resumed from the point at whichthey stopped. The Jordanian leadership will spare no effortto help bring about a breakthrough in negotiations on bothtracks.Hopes have been rising over the past few weeks thatthis can be achieved  particularly in view of Syria’sreaffirmation of its full commitment to work for theestablishment of peace and of its concern for reviving thepeace process and bringing it to its desired goal: theachievement of a just  lasting and comprehensivesettlement. There have also been a number of positiveindicators from the Syrian Government and the IsraeliGovernment has said that it is convinced of the crucialimportance of reaching a peace agreement with Syria.While looking forward to these positive developments withgreat hopes  the peoples of the region earnestly desire thatthis historic opportunity should not be missed and that theefforts made will succeed in reaching a settlement wherebySyria and Lebanon will have their legitimate rights restoredthrough Israel’s withdrawal from the Syrian Arab GolanHeights and from southern Lebanon in implementation ofSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967)  338 (1973) and425 (1978).The peoples of the Middle East region have sufferedunprecedented hardships because of the failure to reach acomprehensive  just and lasting peaceful settlement. Vastresources have been squandered on a useless arms race thatfailed to provide security for any of the parties. Today thepeoples of the region look forward to real progress in thepeace process — progress that will help create a climateconducive to an end to the arms race and to convincing thevarious parties that peace is the only option capable ofproviding security for all. It will also convince them tomake the Middle East a zone free from weapons of massdestruction. This requires a commitment from all partiesto accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons and to ratify the ComprehensiveNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.The issues of refugees  economic disparities andwater  as well as the elimination of weapons of massdestruction  require effective regional cooperation andconcrete international support. Without resolving thefundamental political aspects of the conflict  the regionwill continue to suffer from the consequences of non-cooperation in resolving these issues. Unless they areresolved  they themselves will escalate and create newhotbeds of conflict in the region.On the eastern flank of our region  the Iraqi peoplecontinue to suffer unprecedented hardships as a result ofthe continued economic sanctions. The price of thesesanctions is paid by the Iraqi people in terms of theirhealth  nutrition  education and prospects for progress.This poses serious future dangers for the region as awhole.Jordan therefore calls for ending this suffering bylifting the sanctions. It also calls for the implementationof the relevant Security Council resolutions  includingthose concerning the Kuwaiti prisoners of war andmissing persons. It further calls upon the Security Councilto conduct a comprehensive review that would lead toextricating Iraq from this situation and to affirm itsposition of upholding the territorial integrity of Iraq asone of the main pillars of regional security.Jordan’s geographical location between twoextremely complex situations resulting from theconsequences of the Middle East crisis in general and thelack of progress in the peace process during the past threeyears in particular  as well as the continued economicsanctions against Iraq for nine years  has subjected theJordanian economy to tremendous pressures. Countrieswith capabilities and resources much greater than Jordan’swould have difficulty coping with them. Although Jordanis committed to implementing an integrated programme ofreform and restructuring of its economy and to takingdifficult and painful economic measures  the impact ofthese two situations makes it virtually impossible forJordan to achieve acceptable levels of economic growth and it continues to suffer a huge external debt.Viewing the real economic situation of Jordan andthe challenges facing it without linking it to the regional32environment that affects it does not give a true picture ofthis situation. While Jordan is grateful for and appreciativeof the international community’s support for Jordan’sefforts to cope with its enormous economic challenges  andits assistance to Jordan in playing its central role inmaintaining stability in the region  Jordan would like theinternational community to have a better understanding ofits economic problems. From this perspective  we view withspecial appreciation the final communiqué issued at theSummit meeting of the leaders of the industrialized nationsin Cologne last June  which reflected political will to helpJordan and called for the consideration of reducing Jordan’sforeign debt-burden. We hope that the friendly creditorcountries will take all possible measures to translate thatpolitical will into action  enabling Jordan to reduce its debtburden to a point that allows its economy to be revitalizedand to achieve higher growth rates.The tragic situation the people of Kosovo were madeto experience severely tested the ability of the internationalcommunity  at the close of this century  to prevent thecrimes of ethnic cleansing and the violation of basic humanrights from being committed in a most despicable  racistmanner. This matter raises extremely serious and complexquestions about the role of the United Nations and thelimits that separate the right of States to assert theirsovereignty without committing mass crimes againsthelpless unarmed civilians.There are lessons to be drawn from this bitter humanexperience. On the one hand  the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization’s ability to put an end to the criminal acts hasgiven clear evidence to all those who harbour thoughts ofrebelling against international law and of committingsimilar acts that they should not presume that theirdomestic military strength ensures absolute dominance including violation of human rights. Upholding the principleof sovereignty should not overturn the obligation to observehuman rights and international humanitarian law.On the other hand  as Members of this internationalOrganization  we must look into finding mechanisms thatensure the enhancement of the United Nations and itsability to be the framework that expresses the determinationof the international community to prevent such crimes  andto be the umbrella for the coordination and organization ofcollective international action to achieve that goal.That situation has demonstrated the need forformulating a new international order for the twenty-firstcentury  in which all peoples can enjoy respect for theirdiversity and can participate in the formation of a worldconscience that ensures their coexistence. Continuedprogress by peoples in adopting democracy as a way oflife makes it urgent to strengthen democracy within theinternational system. Since the United Nations is thebackbone of the world system  it must evolve in such away that reflects the new realities in the internationalarena.Our international community has an urgent need topause for a real review of the international situation in allits dimensions: political  security  economic environmental and human rights. We hope that the worldsummit to be held next year will provide an opportunityfor such a review.While we see that many issues and crises consideredby the United Nations remain to be resolved  this does notnecessarily mean failure on the part of the United Nationsas much as it demonstrates the importance of an existingpolitical will to resolve them.Furthermore  the challenges of globalization posenew kinds of global problems  which require harmoniousglobal solutions to the challenges facing developedsocieties  such as terrorism  drug-trafficking and pollutionof the environment  and to the challenges that threaten thedeveloping countries  such as debt  unemployment andeconomic recession. Such solutions must also strengthenthe ability of the developing countries to benefit from theopportunities provided by globalization and to avoid itsnegative effects by preventing a broadening of theinequalities that lie between them and the developedcountries. The persistence of these inequalities will causethe developing countries to remain on the periphery ofglobalization.Despite the magnitude of the challenges thatcontinue to confront us as we begin the proceedings ofthis last session of the General Assembly in this century we should not overlook the many positive steps that havebeen made recently. The adoption of the Statute of theInternational Criminal Court was a particularly importantmeasure taken towards confronting and preventing theperpetrators of war crimes and crimes against humanityfrom escaping punishment. I must also mention thesuccessful conclusion of the first Conference of StatesParties on the Prohibition of the Use  Stockpiling Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and OnTheir Destruction.Such accomplishments contribute to strengtheninghuman security and consolidating the commitment to33human rights. They also provide examples of the potentialfor activating international cooperation in many areas including the promotion of international commitment tocondemning and prohibiting terrorism.In a different context  Jordan welcomes the agreementreached by Libya and the United Nations on the Lockerbieissue. It also commends the strenuous efforts made by theSecretary-General of the United Nations  which contributedto the reaching of an agreement. It calls for the completelifting of sanctions against Libya  after the removal of thereasons for such sanctions and following the extradition ofthe two suspects for trial.On the matter of regional crises  we appeal to ourfriends in Pakistan and India to resort to peaceful means toresolve their conflict and to refrain from any escalation thatwould seriously endanger the peace of the Indiansubcontinent and the whole world.As for the dispute between the United Arab Emiratesand the Islamic Republic of Iran  Jordan calls for  as italways has  the resolution of this dispute through dialoguebased upon mutual respect. It also hopes that Iran will heedthe United Arab Emirates’ request to enter into dialoguewith a specific timetable and agenda  in order to reach asolution that conforms to international legitimacy  whichdenies the admissibility of occupation of territory by force.Jordan attaches special importance to maintaining adialogue between religions and civilizations  in order tobring closer together the views of the various beliefs religions and civilizations. This will also create a commonbase for developing humanitarian thought  which calls forpeace and cooperation rather than confrontation. Theseefforts have resulted in creating a greater awareness at thedomestic and international levels of the goals of thisdialogue. We hope that the United Nations will promote through its specialized agencies  programmes of dialogue inthe various fields of human activity and at all national regional and international levels.The international community is called upon to usedialogue to combat dangerous discriminatory practices which we see today  such as Islamophobia. Islam is beingsubjected to a severe and unjustified attack  which attempts intentionally or unintentionally  to establish a linkagebetween Islam and those extremist and terrorist movementsthat hurt Islam and Muslims by using religion as a tool.Discrimination and arbitrary practices against Muslimpopulations in various countries are only a result ofextremist thinking  far removed from the principles ofcivilized behaviour and humanity. The internationalcommunity must consider how to confront thisphenomenon of Islamophobia in order to prevent itsproliferation.Natural disasters  which have afflicted manycountries recently  remind us of a basic fact  which is thatwe all face phenomena and challenges that do notdiscriminate between us on the basis of race  religion wealth or geographical location. While expressingsympathy to our friends in Turkey and Greece  whichhave been hit by earthquakes recently  and our admirationfor the positive sentiments they have expressed to eachother in their suffering  we realize that confronting naturaldangers and disasters  like confronting other challenges requires a sincere political will to take collective action inorder to preserve the planet  to which we all belongequally."
"85",3628,"JPN",54,1999,"I would like to extendmy heartfelt congratulations to Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab 12Foreign Minister of the Republic of Namibia  on hisassumption of the office of President of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-fourth session. I would also like to paymy respects to Mr. Didier Opertti Badán  Foreign Ministerof Uruguay  for all his efforts during his tenure as Presidentof the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. It is alsomy great pleasure to welcome the admission of theRepublic of Kiribati  the Republic of Nauru and theKingdom of Tonga as new Members of the United Nations.Permit me on this occasion to extend my heartfeltcondolences and sympathy to the people of the Republic ofTurkey and the people of Greece  who have suffered greatlyas a result of the recent earthquakes in those countries. Ialso express my deep concern regarding the grave damagecaused by the earthquake that occurred in Taiwan early inthe morning of 21 September  and extend my heartfeltcondolences and sympathy to those who have suffered fromthe disaster.This is the last session of the General Assemblybefore the Millennium Assembly is convened next year.During the one-year period to come  we must identify theissues  such as conflicts and poverty  which theinternational community will face in the twenty-first centuryand find an answer to what role the United Nations shouldplay in addressing these issues.Since its founding in 1945  the United Nations hasbeen dealing with issues of world peace and security  aswell as economic and social issues  including development.In the area of peace and security  during the cold-war era the ability of the Security Council to cope with conflictswas severely restricted. Even under such circumstances however  the United Nations made creative efforts  such aspeacekeeping operations  and achieved certain results in theMiddle East and elsewhere. Since the end of the cold war the number of peacekeeping operations that has beendispatched has increased dramatically  and their mandateshave become diversified. Their activities bore fruit  forexample  in Cambodia and Mozambique.Regarding the issues of refugees and displaced personscreated by conflicts  the humanitarian assistance activitiesof the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner forRefugees (UNHCR) and others are highly appreciated. Inthe economic and social area  the United Nations  alongwith its specialized agencies  has raised issues  set standardsand implemented those standards in every field  includingdevelopment  the environment  human rights  science andculture. In the area of development  in addition to effortsundertaken through its programmes and funds  including theUnited Nations Development Programme  the UnitedNations has achieved certain results in coordinating theassistance activities of the international community. TheUnited Nations has  furthermore  played a decisive role inassessing the public opinion of global society. We shouldhold in high regard such efforts of the United Nations.Fully recognizing the significance of theOrganization  the people of Japan regarded their country’sadmission to membership of the United Nations as theircountry’s reinstatement in international society after theSecond World War. They have been supporting andcontributing to the activities of the United Nations eversince.There is  however  still much to be done by theUnited Nations in such areas as the prevention andresolution of conflicts and poverty alleviation. It is alsoimportant to have fresh viewpoints  including that ofhuman security  in addressing such new issues as thoserelating to globalization and other global matters. Theseare the issues we will be passing along to the twenty-firstcentury.One of the most important issues that the UnitedNations must continue to address is conflict. In Africa conflicts continue in many regions. Although peace hasbeen restored in Kosovo  the conflict there left deep scarson local communities in the region and on the hearts ofthe people  demonstrating once again the importance ofconflict prevention. Furthermore  numerous challengesexist on the path towards future reconstruction. There arepersistent tensions in Asia. While various conflicts havebeen resolved in Latin America  there is still work to bedone to achieve stable post-conflict development including the development of and the clearing oflandmines in the border region between Peru andEcuador  who reached a peace agreement on their borderdispute last year.Regarding the efforts to deal with conflicts  I wouldlike to emphasize the following three points. First  it isimportant to take a comprehensive approach  whichincludes conflict prevention and resolution  peacekeepingand peace-building  and the elimination of potentialcauses of conflict  such as poverty. Secondly  it isnecessary to deal with conflicts in a manner that issuitable to the situation in each region. These two pointswere also made in the report of the Secretary-Generalentitled “The causes of conflict and the promotion ofdurable peace and sustainable development in Africa”(A/52/871)  which was issued last year. Thirdly  as13regards peace-building  it is necessary that internationalassistance  from post-conflict emergency humanitarianassistance to long-term development aid  be implementedseamlessly. In addition to these efforts  it has becomeimportant to ensure the security of personnel who areengaged in humanitarian or development assistanceactivities.In Africa  the United Nations is cooperating in effortsto bring peace in situations of conflict  such as in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo and Sierra Leone  andin the border dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea. Japanwill consider extending assistance to the efforts of theUnited Nations as well as to the reconstruction efforts ofthe countries concerned. We think that efforts to tacklepoverty in Africa also contribute to the prevention ofconflicts in the region.With regard to Kosovo  Japan has provided the UnitedNations Mission in Kosovo with personnel and is activelyextending financial support in such areas as humanitarianand reconstruction assistance. It recently dispatched a studymission to explore possible concrete assistance projects.Turning our attention to Asia  we hope that security inEast Timor will be restored at the earliest possible date through the activities of the multinational force working incoordination with the Government of Indonesia and withthe Indonesian armed forces. This force is now starting tobe deployed on the basis of the Security Council resolutionadopted on 15 September.Japan has already announced that it will extend asubstantial financial contribution to the multinational force.It is making this contribution with the intention offacilitating the participation of developing countries in theeffort. Japan will decide the amount of its contribution afterthe whole picture of the multinational force becomes clear.The situation of refugees and displaced persons in andoutside East Timor causes serious concern. Japan hasannounced the contribution of a total of $2 million to theactivities of UNHCR and the World Food Programme. Inaddition  it intends to positively consider further assistanceafter taking into consideration a report from theGovernment mission now in the region  along with otherfactors. Furthermore  Japan  in the medium and long term also intends to provide appropriate assistance for thereconstruction and development of East Timor.As regards conflict prevention  I wish to commend theOrganization of African Unity for already launching effortsto establish an early warning system  and  as regardsAsia  I would like to commend the ministerial meeting ofthe Regional Forum of the Association of South-EastAsian Nations for its decision last July to discussconcretely how preventive diplomacy might be dealt with.Next  I would like to touch upon three issues that arecommonly observed in regions in conflict: small arms anti-personnel landmines  and refugees and displacedpersons.In its efforts to cope with the small arms issue Japan strongly hopes that the General Assembly willadopt a resolution at this session promoting therecommendations of the report of the Secretary-Generaldrafted by the Panel of Governmental Experts on SmallArms. Japan looks forward to working with othercountries for the implementation of thoserecommendations. Japan will also actively contribute tothe successful convening of the international conferenceon small arms to be held by the end of 2001.On the issue of anti-personnel landmines  with theentry into force last March of the Convention on theProhibition of the Use  Stockpiling  Production andTransfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on TheirDestruction  it is now necessary to achieve a universaland effective ban on anti-personnel landmines and to clearthe mine areas  while extending assistance to minevictims  among whom are many children. Japan hascontributed financial assistance of more than $40 millionto international and non-governmental organizations andwill continue to strive to achieve the goal of “zerovictims” at an early date.With regard to the issue of refugees and displacedpersons  Japan highly commends the activities of UNHCRand others and intends to continue to actively cooperatewith them.Since the end of the cold war  international effortshave achieved certain results with respect to thenon-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction including nuclear weapons  and their delivery vehicles —namely  missiles — as well as arms reduction. Yet theTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons(NPT) regime has been challenged by the nuclear testingor secret development of weapons of mass destructionconducted by some States.Japan calls upon the nuclear-weapon and the non-nuclear-weapon States alike to take constructive actions14to ensure the successful convening of the ReviewConference of the Parties to the NPT next spring. Japanalso calls upon the States that have not yet done so topromptly sign and ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty so that it can enter into force as soon aspossible  and appeals to every country to respect themoratorium on nuclear testing. Further  it is also importantto reactivate the START process and promptly tocommence the negotiations on the fissile material cut-offtreaty.Japan has consistently called for realistic measures fornuclear non-proliferation and disarmament. Every year since1994  it has submitted to the General Assembly a resolutionon nuclear disarmament with a view to the ultimateelimination of nuclear weapons. Late last July  the TokyoForum on Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament which was established at Japan’s initiative  issued its report which we believe provides a realistic guideline for progressin nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament. Japan wouldlike to consult actively with other countries with a view toimplementing the meaningful recommendations containedin the report.The importance of addressing the issue of weapons ofmass destruction other than nuclear weapons  such asbiological and chemical weapons  as well as the issue ofdelivery vehicles  including missiles  is beyond discussion.In particular  Japan will work towards the early conclusionof negotiations on the protocol to the Convention on theProhibition of the Development  Production and Stockpilingof Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and onTheir Destruction.With regard to the North Korean missile issue  Japanappreciates and welcomes the important progress achievedin the recent United States-North Korea talks. Japanstrongly hopes that North Korea’s moratorium on missilelaunching is further assured.Poverty continues to be a serious issue in manyregions of the world. There is a vicious cycle in which thefrequent occurrence of regional conflicts exacerbates theproblem of poverty  while poverty in turn causes theoccurrence and recurrence of regional conflicts. Indeed poverty should be recognized as the primary issue of thetwenty-first century  and it is incumbent upon variousplayers  such as the United Nations  other internationalorganizations  States and civil society  to cooperate towardsits eradication.At the Second Tokyo International Conference onAfrican Development  which was co-organized by Japan the United Nations and others last October  the TokyoAgenda for Action was adopted  which encouragesAfrican countries to take initiatives on their own; calls forthe strengthening of cooperation between Africancountries and developed countries as well as internationalorganizations; and calls for the promotion of cooperationbetween Asia and Africa. Japan will remain activelyengaged with the issue of poverty in Africa throughfollow-up efforts for the implementation of the Agendafor Action  such as the debt- management seminar whichJapan co-organized with the United Nations and otherslast month in Kenya.Japan has been the world’s largest donor of officialdevelopment assistance since 1991. Despite the severityof its domestic budgetary situation  it will continue toextend effective  efficient and high-quality officialdevelopment assistance and will tackle poverty problemsthrough the further promotion of cooperation with therelevant organizations of the United Nations.Debt problems are making it extremely difficult fordebtor nations  especially the poorest countries  to achievedevelopment. Japan has provided assistance through debtrescheduling and grant aid for debt relief  and will takecomprehensive measures to deal with the debt problem including the steady implementation of the commitmentmade at the G-8 summit meeting in Cologne.Important conferences  such as special sessions ofthe General Assembly  are being held successively in theareas of economic and social development and humanrights. The General Assembly’s special session onpopulation and development was held this June  at whichmeaningful proposals for future action were adopted. Thesustainable development of small island developing States which are susceptible to the effects of climate change andare also geographically vulnerable  is the very importantsubject of the twenty-second special session to begin on27 September. The development of landlocked States which are also geographically disadvantaged  is importantas well.The promotion of the implementation of theCopenhagen Declaration and the Programme of Actionadopted at the World Summit for Social Development in1995 will be discussed next year at a follow-up specialsession. The General Assembly special session entitled“Women 2000” will also be held next year in order tofurther promote the results of the 1995 Fourth World15Conference on Women. Building upon the achievements ofthese special sessions  Japan intends to contribute activelyto international cooperative endeavours in these areas.This is the final year of the International Decade forNatural Disaster Reduction. The international communitymust take prompt and concerted action in responding tolarge-scale natural disasters  as clearly underscored by ourexperience with the recent earthquakes in Turkey andGreece  last year’s hurricanes in Latin America and thetsunami in Papua New Guinea. The United Nations isrequired to play a more active role in this endeavour.Moreover  efforts in the area of natural-disaster reductionneed to be strengthened. Recognizing the importance ofnatural disaster reduction in the context of developmentpolicy and environmental issues  Japan will promote effortsin this field.With regard to the advancement of globalization  whiletaking advantage of the new opportunities it provides forthe revitalization of the world economy  the improvementin living standards  the creation of jobs  and development we must also address its negative effects  such as thegrowing instability in international finance and the wideninggap between the rich and the poor. Japan is steadilycarrying out financial assistance measures totalingapproximately $80 billion  including the New MiyazawaInitiative — by far the largest package of assistanceprovided by one country — for the East Asian countrieswhich were hard hit by the economic crisis. We stronglyexpect the economic recovery of the region to resume andthat a sound and sustainable development of the worldeconomy will be achieved.We are also concerned that globalization mayaggravate such problems as environmental destruction international organized crime  drug  terrorism and thespread of infectious diseases. These global issues  whichtranscend national borders and pose direct threats to eachand every person  need to be dealt with by the internationalcommunity as a whole. It is necessary that we adoptpolicies that give consideration to women  children andothers  who are most susceptible to the effect of theseglobal issues.Although globalization also engenders creativity byfacilitating interaction among various cultures and differentvalue systems  due consideration also needs to be paid tothe cultural diversity of the world. From this standpoint  weconsider that the United Nations Educational  Scientific andCultural Organization will play an even more important rolein the coming century.Japan has been stressing the importance ofaddressing the various issues I have just mentioned byfocusing efforts on human security  that is  the protectionof the dignity and life of every person against the manythreats posed  for example  by poverty; the outflow ofrefugees; environmental issues; infectious diseases  suchas AIDS; human rights violations; international organizedcrime  including human and drug trafficking; conflicts;anti-personnel landmines and small arms; and terrorism.Last June Japan hosted the International Symposiumon Development  at which the issue of how to encouragethe self-reliance of individuals to escape from povertywas discussed. On the initiative of Prime MinisterObuchi  Japan established the Human Security Fundwithin the United Nations to support the activities ofinternational organizations and to promote humansecurity. Japan recently announced its contribution of$100 million for reconstruction and assistance for thereturn of refugees in Kosovo  and it will implement thatassistance through the Human Security Fund and othersources.It cannot be said that the efforts of the UnitedNations to address the issues that will confront theinternational community in the twenty-first century aresufficient. Nevertheless  it is not right to claim that theUnited Nations is incapable of addressing those issuesadequately  and therefore disregard it. Neither is it rightto simply deplore any attempt to disregard theOrganization. In as much as many issues today requireefforts of the international community as a whole  and asthere is no other universal and comprehensive institutionthat can replace the United Nations  our only recourse isto reform and strengthen the United Nations  so that itwill be capable of dealing with the issues adequately.From this viewpoint  I would like in particular to makethe following three points.The first is the need for Security Council reform.During the 50 or so years since the end of the SecondWorld War  the international situation has undergonedramatic changes. Given those changes  the functions ofthe Security Council  as the body primarily responsiblefor the maintenance of international peace and security need to be strengthened. Towards that end  it is essentialthat the Security Council be re-created to reflect thepresent international situation  with reform of thecomposition of both its permanent and non-permanentmembership. Japan would like to assume greaterresponsibilities as a permanent member of the SecurityCouncil.16Second  there is an urgent need for reforms to placethe United Nations on a sound financial base. It isnecessary for Member States to fulfil their obligation to paytheir assessed contributions  and for the United Nations towork to further control its budget. Despite the severeeconomic and financial situations  Japan has been faithfullyfulfilling its obligation to pay its assessed contribution andhas been making substantial contributions to the UnitedNations and related organizations. However  as the SecurityCouncil reform has not been realized  and as the necessarybudgetary reforms have yet to be carried out  one cannotbut question the fairness of a situation in which Japan isexpected to pay an assessed contribution that exceeds thesum of the contributions made by four of the permanentmembers of the Security Council  not including the UnitedStates.Third  it is necessary for the United Nations tostrengthen its efforts in the economic and social area including development. The Organization is expected toobtain the active participation of various actors inaddressing problems in the economic and social area  andeffectively coordinate their efforts. Japan attachesimportance to the role that the United Nations  especiallythe Economic and Social Council  plays in this area  and isdetermined  if it is elected this year  to work as a memberof the Council towards strengthening the activities of theUnited Nations in such areas as the coordination betweenthe United Nations agencies  the promotion of dialoguewith Bretton Woods institutions and the broad participationby civil society in activities in this area  and coordinationof these activities.We have already devoted a significant amount of timeto the discussion of United Nations reform. Today there isa common recognition throughout the internationalcommunity that the reform of the United Nations isnecessary. Indeed  there is not a single country that isopposed to reform per se. Nevertheless  progress towardsreform is far from satisfactory. The amount of time that hasbeen expended in discussions so far tells of the difficultythat lies in the way of reforming an organization. We mustrecognize at the very core of our being that if we fail tostrengthen the United Nations through reforms  internationaltrust in the Organization will be undermined. This wouldnot only destroy the United Nations  but would be suicidalto all the Member States and the international communityas a whole.The Millennium Assembly and the MillenniumSummit  scheduled for next year  will provide an occasionon which the United Nations can demonstrate to the worldthat it is capable of effectively tackling the issues that theinternational community will face in the twenty-firstcentury. The efforts which Member States make duringthe one-year period to come could very well determinethe viability of the United Nations in the coming century.I would like  therefore  to conclude my remarks by callingupon all Member States to cooperate with each other inpursuing the common interests of the internationalcommunity as a whole."
"86",3653,"KAZ",54,1999,"Let me congratulate you Sir  on your election to the high office of President of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-fourth session. We areconfident that under your able leadership we will be able toaddress successfully the items on our agenda.Please allow me also to convey our appreciation toyour predecessor  Mr. Didier Opertti  for his considerablecontribution to the work of the General Assembly at itsfifty-third session.We pay a tribute to the Secretary-General for hisefforts to meet the unprecedented and complex challengesfacing the United Nations.On the threshold of the third millennium — as at thebeginning of this century — the world community mustdeal with substantive issues of war and peace. On the onehand  the process of globalization  which is unfoldingbefore our eyes  has triggered a rich flow of ideas  capital technologies  goods and services all around the world having profoundly transformed our societies.Philosophically  mankind has taken a big step forwardtowards qualitatively new dimensions of existence.On the other hand  the world continues to be rockedby conflicts rooted in causes that have become compoundeddespite the advent of global technologies andcommunications. First among the causes of conflict isethnic  national and religious intolerance. It is absolutelyunacceptable that this most dangerous virus is spreadingrapidly throughout many regions of today's world  givingrise to terrorist acts and bloody conflicts. The danger is thatpeople affected by conflicts look for the sources of theirtroubles among other nationalities and religions. As a result we face a vicious circle wherein death and desperationreign unchecked. We are confident that civilized society  bypooling its resources  will eventually be able to break outof this vicious circle  having convinced people of thebenefits of a conflict-free existence. If we talk about theantagonism between war and peace  then we have everyright to demand the use of means to enforcing asustainable peace  including military means.At the same time  it is impossible to ignore the factthat the present world order is in desperate need ofreliable measures to ensure balance between the essentialelements of its support structures. Kazakhstan shares theview of those States which believe that in the nextcentury the world should be multi-polar and free ofcentres of power and dividing lines  confrontations andshowdowns  interference in the internal affairs of othersand imposition of policy directives. Cooperation andmutual understanding  democracy and sustainabledevelopment will define the core of the coming worldorder.We believe that the United Nations remains a uniqueintergovernmental institution that ensures a positive trendin the development of international relations. Kazakhstancalls for a strengthening of the United Nations  the onlyforum that is universal both in terms of its compositionand in terms of the comprehensiveness of its agenda.Only the United Nations has the right to addressfundamental issues of peace and security.The Yugoslav crisis has clearly demonstrated howurgent the issue of strengthening the authority of theUnited Nations has become. We are becomingincreasingly convinced of the need to enhance theresponsibility of the Security Council for the maintenanceof international peace and security and to makeauthorization of certain actions its exclusive prerogative.The nature of many conflicts makes this anespecially challenging task. That is why we believe thatto be able to adapt to new political realities  the SecurityCouncil should enter the twenty-first century renewed andstrengthened through the admission of new permanentmembers  first of all Japan and Germany  as well as non-permanent members representing different regions of theworld.The efforts to consolidate the international regimefor the non-proliferation of all weapons of massdestruction and put in place effective controls over theproduction of fissile material remain at the centre of ourpolicy for achieving global security and stability.Kazakhstan has made an important contribution tonon-proliferation and to putting an end to nuclear-weapontesting. We consider the decision to admit Kazakhstan to21membership of the Conference on Disarmament as adequaterecognition of our actions in this direction. Renunciation ofnuclear weapons and accession to the Non-ProliferationTreaty and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treatyhave become natural choices for our country  which has feltthe full brunt of the harmful effects of nuclear testing.Kazakhstan vigorously advocates further consolidation ofthe non-proliferation regime  and supports the initiative toestablish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Asia.Our country has consistently called for the creation ofsecurity structures in Asia. As is well known  at theAssembly's forty-seventh session  the President ofKazakhstan  Mr. Nursultan Nazarbaev  put forward aninitiative to convene a Conference on Interaction andConfidence-Building Measures in Asia (CICA). On 14September  the opening day of the current GeneralAssembly session  after seven years of negotiations anddiscussions  Almaty hosted the first meeting of the ForeignMinisters of the Asian States members of the Conference.Government officials responsible for foreign policy signeda Declaration of Principles Guiding Relations betweenCICA Member States which confirmed the Asian States'strong commitment to and goodwill towards efforts toensure security and stability in the region.Thus  for the first time in history  a legal foundationfor an Asian security system has been laid. It is difficult tooverestimate the significance of this development in thecontext of the international community's efforts tostrengthen international security. We are talking here abouta region that is home to more than 3.5 billion people andthat accounts for more than 40 per cent of world trade.We are grateful to all the States participating in theCICA process for their support for our initiative and fortheir genuine willingness to work together to build asecurity system for Asia. I take this opportunity to expressour appreciation to Secretary-General Annan  for his closeattention to and support for the initiative by Kazakhstan.Recent political developments attest to how urgent theneed is to create a security system in Asia. I refer here toterrorist incursions in southern Kyrgyzstan and to terroristacts in the Northern Caucasus in Russia.From the point of view of security in our region  webelieve that the outcome of the latest summit of the“Shanghai Five” is very important. Its participants createda mechanism of confidence providing for transparency inmilitary activity and reduction of those activities in borderareas  settlement of border issues and a regular exchangesof information on military activities. The heads of the fiveStates believe that multipolarity reflects a general trend inthe development of the contemporary world andcontributes to the long-term stability of the internationalsituation.Kazakhstan calls for a lasting and just peace inAfghanistan within the negotiation process  according tothe “six plus two” formula. At the same time  we believethat the Afghan peace process should involve all theStates concerned. For this reason  Kazakhstan supports theproposal to convene a representative internationalconference in Bishkek  Kyrgyzstan  on the settlement ofthe conflict in Afghanistan.Kazakhstan highly appreciates the United Nationsefforts to promote the integration of the economies intransition into the world economy. Our country counts oncontinued cooperation with the United Nations on theissues of consultative services and technical assistance.We are firmly committed to the policy of deepeningregional economic cooperation and actively using for thispurpose the capacity of the United Nations. Our countryis satisfied with its cooperation with the EconomicCommission for Europe and the Economic and SocialCommission for Asia and the Pacific in the elaborationand implementation of the Special Programme for theEconomies of Central Asia.We support the revival of the Silk Road.Geographically  Kazakhstan  along with other CentralAsian States  plays the role of a bridge connecting thetwo continents. During the era of the Roman Empire traderoutes between Rome and Shanghai passed through theregion. The revival of the Silk Road will boost theeconomic development of the Central Asian region.In current conditions it is envisioned that the SilkRoad will be revived by building on three pillars: energy a transcontinental transportation system andtelecommunications. The thrust of this project — whichreflects global  regional and local interests — is todevelop the natural resources of the region  first of all itslarge oil and gas fields. One has to bear in mind however  that no large-scale pipeline project can berealized without the hydrocarbon resources of Kazakhstan.In view of the increased competition in the worldenergy-carriers markets  Kazakhstan is giving priorityattention to the construction of oil and gas pipelines. Thenorthern Caspian pipeline consortium project  scheduledfor completion in 2001  is a top priority for our country 22because when it is operational Kazakhstan will be able todouble  at a minimum  both its oil production and its exportdeliveries to foreign markets.We pin many of our hopes on the development of thehydrocarbon resources of the Caspian Sea shelf. For thisreason we believe that the issue of the legal status of thissea is of fundamental importance. Kazakhstan commends abreakthrough agreement with Russia on the delimitation ofthe seabed in the northern part of the Caspian Sea on thebasis of a modified median line.The issues of sustainable development  environmentalprotection and rehabilitation of ecological disaster areashave become especially pressing at the end of this century and demand immediate action. Kazakhstan is interested inthe mobilization of the international community to solveenvironmental problems  because it has disaster areas  suchas the region of the former Semipalatinsk nuclear testingground  the dying Aral Sea and other zones. Our country which suffers from desertification and floods  is alsodirectly affected by global climate changes.On behalf of the Government of Kazakhstan  I wouldlike to express our great appreciation to the Statesconcerned for their support for the efforts to overcome theserious social  ecological and humanitarian problems of theSemipalatinsk region. The adoption of two GeneralAssembly resolutions on international cooperation andcoordination for the human and ecological rehabilitation andeconomic development of the Semipalatinsk region hasundoubtedly contributed to an interest in and reflection onthe outstanding issues.Special words of appreciation are due to theGovernment of Japan and the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme (UNDP) for sponsoring an internationalconference convened at the beginning of September inTokyo. The outcome of this representative forumreverberated throughout our country. We consider thisconference a practical contribution by the Government ofJapan and the UNDP to the implementation of the relevantGeneral Assembly resolutions. In this regard  I cannot missthis opportunity to recognize important work by theInternational Atomic Energy Agency  the United NationsChildren's Fund  the United Nations Population Fund andthe United Nations Educational  Scientific and CulturalOrganization  as well as by the donor countries that actedas cosponsors of the conference.Kazakhstan is taking concrete steps to democratize itssociety and to deepen its political reforms. Kazakhstan'shead of State has introduced a programme that coverssuch important areas as elections  political parties  theParliament  the judicial system  the status of women andthe mass media. Earlier this year the first open andcontested presidential elections were held in Kazakhstan.The refinement of the election process continues.The law on elections has been amended to reflect therecommendations of the Organization for Security andCooperation in Europe. Its provisions will be used in theparliamentary elections scheduled for this October. Theelection process is becoming more representative encouraging active involvement of candidates and voters.A programme of phased transition to holding elections forlocal and regional governments is being developed. Therole of non-governmental organizations  an importantelement of a civil society  is being enhanced. The judicialsystem and the mass media are steadily becoming moreindependent.Achieving an open society  with a market economy is the course for Kazakhstan's further development. Theprocess of democratization in our country is gainingmomentum and has become irreversible.Along with political reforms  Kazakhstan is takingvigorous actions to protect the long-term interests offoreign investors. Our objective is to ensure — throughthe creation of a favourable investment climate in thecountry — its full integration into the world economicsystem of today.Kazakhstan expresses support for the efforts of theSecretary-General to reform the Organization in order toenhance its effectiveness and capability to respondadequately to emerging problems and challenges. Webelieve that concrete results in the renewal of theOrganization can be achieved only through joint efforts ofall Member States. That is why all States should continuetheir coordinated efforts to strengthen the role of theUnited Nations in the promotion of global stability andsecurity in the next century."
"87",3700,"KEN",54,1999,"May I  on behalf of mydelegation congratulate you  Sir  on your election asPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourthsession. Kenya's pride in seeing you preside over the affairsof the Assembly  which you have been associated with forso long  derives from our close and long bilateral ties withyour great country.I take this opportunity to register my delegation'sappreciation to your predecessor  His Excellency DidierOpertti of Uruguay  for the able manner in which hepresided over the work of the fifty-third session.We commend the Secretary-General  Mr. KofiAnnan  for the effective and tireless manner in which hecontinues to manage the affairs of this Organization andencourage him to continue serving the internationalcommunity with his characteristic selfless dedication toduty. Kenya will continue to support his efforts to furtherstrengthen the Organization.Kenya warmly welcomes the Republics of Kiribatiand Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga into this family ofnations.As we approach the new millennium  there is needfor us to reflect on the past  the present and the future ofour world. The cumulative history of mankind during thecurrent millennium has been characterized by the struggleof the human race to overcome the various problems ofhunger  war and disease. Throughout time man hasinvested constantly to provide shelter  increase literacyand tackle the various problems of underdevelopment.The latter part of this millennium has witnessed enormouspolitical  economic and social changes. Where onceslavery was acceptable  today freedom is the norm. Whereonce crude methods of economic production dominated today sophisticated production techniques govern. Whereignorance was widespread  today science and technologydetermine man's progress. Where before the human rightsof peoples were unknown  today they are an integral partof the international agenda.But even as we note the progress that has beenmade  the scourge of poverty and underdevelopmentremains a painful reality for most of us. We believe thatpoverty is the root cause of the conflicts that pervadevarious regions of our globe  unleashing immensesuffering on humankind — particularly on women andchildren.Our continent  Africa  continues to suffer from theravages of intra-State and inter-State conflicts. The issueof the complementarity of the roles of the United Nationsand that of regional organizations needs to be addressed.African countries have taken their own initiatives toresolve the various conflicts raging in the continent.Although progress has been made in some cases  many ofthe conflicts remain intractable  making it difficult foraffected countries to redirect their efforts and resourcestowards economic development.20In our own region  together with other members of theIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) Kenya is seized with the conflicts in Sudan and Somalia.The subcommittee on the Sudan peace process  forexample  is actively engaged in the search for a peacefulsettlement to the conflict in the southern Sudan. At themost recent meeting  held in Nairobi from 19 to 23 July1999  members of the IGAD ministerial subcommitteeagreed to establish a secretariat to facilitate intensive andcontinuous negotiations to resolve this conflict. Aschairman of this subcommittee  Kenya is optimistic that thisnew arrangement will contribute positively towards reachinga negotiated settlement. We hope we can count on thesupport of all the members of the international communityto find a solution to this long-standing conflict.Kenya continues to be seized with the situation inSomalia. As a neighbour that shares a border of 1 200kilometres with Somalia  we are concerned at the loss ofinternational interest and support for this sad country. Theinternational community should resume its active interestand support for Somalia in order to instill in the innocentpeople of that country some measure of hope for the future.We are grateful for the roles that the Organization ofAfrican Unity and the United Nations have played andcontinue to play. However  Kenya calls for greaterinvolvement by the United Nations in support of ongoingregional efforts. The new initiative unveiled by theChairman of IGAD  President Guelleh of Djibouti  at thispodium on 22 September 1999  deserves seriousconsideration.In efforts to support and assist the people of Somalia the territorial integrity of that country must be respected.Regional entities that may have come into existence duringthis period in Somalia's history should be seen as buildingblocks intended to eventually lead to a Government ofnational unity. We the neighbouring countries  as well asthe international community  have an important role infacilitating the process leading to a peaceful andcomprehensive settlement of the conflict. Our commoncommitment to a united Somalia should not waver.In the tradition of African hospitality  Kenya hasalways provided a home to displaced people fromneighbouring countries. As a result of the collapse of thecentral authority in Somalia  a large number of refugeesfound their way into our country. We are proud to havebeen able to assist and even settle some of them. In thisregard  we are grateful for the role being played by theUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  theUnited Nations Children's Fund  the World HealthOrganization and many others who have providedinvaluable assistance  without which it would have beenimpossible for the Government of Kenya alone to copewith the humanitarian crisis.Recently  Kenya decided to tighten its bordercontrols with Somalia. However  we remain committed tofacilitating ongoing humanitarian operations  whichcontinue with numerous daily flights into Somalia fromour territory — and  in some cases  by land as well. Wehave been able to do this by coordinating our actions withthe relevant humanitarian agencies and organizations.The crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congoremains of utmost concern to us because it poses aserious threat not only to the Great Lakes region but alsoto the rest of our continent. It is for this reason thatKenya has been involved in the attempts to resolve theconflict  particularly in its early  initial stages. Kenya'soffer to host in Nairobi the proposed Congolese nationaldebate on the political future of their country still stands.We commend the recent personal efforts that PresidentChiluba of Zambia has made in negotiating a settlementplan which seeks to find a comprehensive solution to thatcrisis. We will do everything possible to complementthese efforts and hope that the international communitywill be prepared to fulfil its own supporting role.As the international community continues to play itspart  the responsibility for a final  comprehensive andlasting settlement to the crisis in the Democratic Republicof the Congo falls largely to the people and their leaders.In that regard  Kenya urges all parties to the LusakaAgreement to demonstrate their commitment byimplementing it  both in letter and in spirit  in a timelyand appropriate manner.We firmly believe that it is time for the SecurityCouncil to actively step in and provide tangible supportfor the peace process. Africa expects that the supportgiven to peacekeeping operations in other parts of theworld will be replicated  both in scope and in content  inthe case of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Weknow that most members of the Security Council haveembraced this challenge and are willing to do their part.The situation in Angola continues to be a source ofgreat frustration. Indeed  the resumption of hostilities ata level not seen since the signing of the Lusaka Protocoldoes not augur well. Kenya is deeply disappointed thatthe leader of UNITA  Mr. Savimbi  continues toflagrantly defy the collective will of the international21community. We call on him to immediately cease all actsof hostility against the people of Angola.With regard to the border conflict between Ethiopiaand Eritrea  we note with satisfaction that the combinedinitiatives of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  theUnited Nations and the United States to secure definitiveagreement on the modalities for the implementation of theOAU Framework Agreement are still on course. We appealto both parties to exercise utmost restraint and not toresume fighting.In accordance with the United Nations Charter  theSecurity Council has the primary responsibility to determinethe existence of any threat to international peace andsecurity and to recommend appropriate interventionmeasures. There can be no derogation from this primaryresponsibility. In the fulfilment of this responsibility  itmust be borne in mind that the principle of non-interferencein the internal affairs of Member States remains a cardinalelement in the conduct of international relations  as speltout in the Charter.We have serious reservations on the evolving viewthat even the United Nations Charter provides leeway fornon-United Nations intervention. We would like to cautionthat this approach needs to be carefully balanced withlegitimate concerns of sovereignty. Whatever we may sayon intervention  the sovereignty of States remains at thecore of diplomatic discourse. Derogation from this principlein the case of serious humanitarian emergencies must bemade on the basis of general consensus in the UnitedNations.It is in this spirit that Kenya has always supported andparticipated in many United Nations peacekeeping missionsthroughout the world. We will continue to contributepersonnel and remain actively involved in United Nationspeacekeeping activities. All peacekeeping missions must beestablished in accordance with the United Nations Charter.This is why we welcome the assumption of responsibilityin Kosovo by the United Nations in the form of the UnitedNations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo(UNMIK). We should do everything possible to supportefforts towards the restoration of normalcy in Kosovo. Wealso hope that the spirit that prevailed in the establishmentand financing of UNMIK will be applied to peacekeepingoperations in Africa.With regard to the situation in East Timor  Kenyacommends Indonesia for allowing the internationalcommunity to send a United Nations — mandatedmultinational force to restore order. We welcome theunequivocal statement by the Foreign Minister ofIndonesia  Mr. Ali Alatas  reiterating his Government'sresponsibility to ensure the fulfilment of the newlyexpressed will of the majority of East Timorese to seeka new destiny outside the Indonesian Republic. We hope as he expressed the hope  that the parting of ways will  inhis own words  proceed honourably  peacefully andamicably.As Sierra Leone continues along the path of nationalreconciliation and true peace  we encourage the UnitedNations to remain committed to and engaged in thatcountry. We again place on record our appreciation to theEconomic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) for its immense sacrificein assisting the people of Sierra Leone in their search forpeace and democracy. On our part  we will continue tosupport our brothers and sisters in that country. Towardsthat end  we have already contributed personnel to theUnited Nations Observer Mission in Sierra Leone(UNOMSIL).Kenya is encouraged by the recent positivedevelopments in the Middle East peace process. Theresumption of direct dialogue between the State of Israeland the Palestinian National Authority  which resulted inagreement on the implementation of aspects of the Wyeaccords  demonstrates the vast opportunities that politicalgoodwill can unleash. We encourage those involved tostay on course and we welcome indications that the othertracks in the Middle East peace process are receivingcareful attention.On the economic front  my delegation is of the viewthat the slow progress in Africa's efforts to attainsustainable economic growth and development is directlyrelated to the failure by the international community tomobilize adequate resources for development. This hasbeen aggravated by situations of internal conflict and theprevalence of such diseases as malaria and AIDS  amongothers  which are compounded in turn by the shackles ofpoverty and deprivation and an unfavourable externaleconomic environment.My delegation welcomes the Heavily Indebted PoorCountries Debt (HIPC) Initiative made at the G-8 meetingin Cologne  Germany. The crushing burden of externaldebt on the developing countries  especially those in sub-22Saharan Africa  remains a major obstacle to ourdevelopment efforts. While we welcome this Initiative  weare of the view that much still needs to be done. We wouldlike to see HIPC coverage broadened to include more of theindebted countries  with relief being offered in a graduatedmanner. This would envisage providing the greatest reliefto the most indebted countries. In addition  considerationcould be given to modifying the existing terms andconditions of HIPC to enable countries like Kenya  notcovered by HIPC as currently proposed  to participatewithout the possibility of losing access to credit that wouldotherwise be available to them. The terms and conditions ofthe HIPC Initiative are based on a piecemeal approachwhich will not contribute to the overall goal of debtcancellation. Debt-relief measures should be structured ina holistic and comprehensive manner without erodingAfrica's future capacity to attract investments and should belinked to the long-term social and economic developmentof the continent.Another issue that requires the concerted efforts of theinternational community is that of poverty eradication.Kenya has already launched a Poverty Eradication Plan which has received some support and which we hope willattract wider support to allow us to achieve our goal ofbecoming a newly industrialized country by the year 2020.Bold actions are required to ensure that the developedcountries fulfil the commitments agreed upon to maintainofficial development assistance flows to developingcountries at 0.7 per cent of their gross national product. Inthis regard  Kenya supports the proposal to hold aninternational conference on financing for development nextyear.The United Nations remains our only hope tospearhead the process of development. Accordingly  allMember States have an obligation to support theOrganization in order for it to fulfil its developmentmandate. The United Nations Development Programme(UNDP) and other specialized bodies — such as the UnitedNations Children's Fund (UNICEF)  the Office of theUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees(UNHCR)  the United Nations Environment Programme(UNEP) and the United Nations Centre for HumanSettlements (Habitat) — must be strengthened in order toenable them to succeed in their respective roles.Kenya looks forward to the convening of the firstSouth-South summit in Havana  Cuba  in April next year.The conference will be a historic milestone in thestrengthening of South-South cooperation. The South-Southsummit provides a golden opportunity at the highestpolitical level for the members of the Group of 77 andChina to share their experiences and to consolidatepolitical goodwill  which is so vital for economiccooperation and development.Kenya attaches great importance to economiccooperation among developing countries. It is for thisreason that Kenya has actively pursued the path ofeconomic integration at the regional and subregionallevels. In addition to the Common Market for Eastern andSouthern Africa (COMESA)  comprising 21 countrieswith a population approaching 400 million  we aredetermined  at the subregional level  to upgrade the EastAfrican cooperation arrangements — comprising Kenya Uganda and Tanzania — into a full-fledged East Africancommunity by the end of the year. Our vision is toestablish an East African community with a population ofnearly 90 million people with natural  historic  social andcultural ties into one investment destination  one touristdestination  one single market and one common externaltariff  with a free flow of goods  services and people.Kenya is greatly concerned by the rise intransnational crime  narcotics  money-laundering andterrorism networks. The tragic bombing of the embassiesof the United States of America in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam in August 1998 is still fresh in our memories.This incident  not to mention the recent terrorist attacksin Moscow  has heightened our resolve to work closelywith the international community to fight and eradicateterrorism. We call for concerted efforts to adopt effectiveinternational measures to eradicate the growing anddangerous links between terrorist groups  drug traffickersand armed criminal elements. Towards this end  Kenyaparticipated actively in the Algiers summit of OAU inJuly 1999  at which African States adopted a conventionon preventing and combating terrorism. Clearly  moreneeds to be done. We support the proposal to hold aninternational conference next year on combating terrorism.Kenya is situated in the heart of a turbulent region.The proliferation of illegal small arms and their increasedcriminal use on Kenyan territory  often by groups fromacross our borders  is motivating us to push for practicaland sustained international cooperation to stop illegaltrafficking in small arms. In this connection  we expressour support for the convening of an internationalconference on the illicit arms trade in all its aspects to beheld by the year 2001.In our own region  Kenya will host a meeting beforethe end of this year to address the complex problems of23small arms and their ramifications for security and conflictsin our region. We look forward to the support andcooperation of our development partners to ensure that thisconference is a success.On this issue  Kenya would like to draw a cleardistinction between the legitimate rights of sovereign Statesto self-defence and therefore to the procurement ofarmaments for that purpose  and the illicit traffic in smallarms involving non-State actors.Kenya welcomes the urgency and importance withwhich the international community has recently addressedthe problem of antipersonnel landmines. We participatedactively in the negotiations leading to the OttawaConvention on anti-personnel landmines and in the recentMaputo Conference of States Parties to the OttawaConvention. We have signed the Ottawa Convention  whichis now going through the ratification process. Theprevailing international consensus on outlawing landminesmust be maintained in order to achieve the target of a totalban on the production  use and eventual elimination of anti-personnel landmines. International cooperation is essentialin the areas of landmine clearance and the physicalrehabilitation of victims  as well as their social andeconomic rehabilitation and reintegration.As we celebrate the United Nations Decade ofInternational Law  Kenya regards the adoption of theStatute of the International Criminal Court as a historicmilestone in the progressive development of internationallaw. We participated actively in the negotiations leading tothe adoption of the Rome Statute  became the eighty-fourthState to append our signature to it and have embarked onthe ratification process for it.We look to the Preparatory Commission for theInternational Criminal Court to elaborate on the outstandingissues  including the elements of crime and the rules ofprocedure  in order to reach an early consensus and ensureuniversal acceptance of the Statute. We hope that thePreparatory Commission will complete its work before theJune 2000 deadline.As eloquently stated by the Secretary-General  reformof the United Nations is a process and not an event. Inorder to attain a more transparent  accountable anddemocratic United Nations  the collective resolve of itsMember States is imperative. We must resist any attemptsto approach the reform process in terms of downsizing:reform must entail restructuring to cope better with theimmense economic development challenges facing ourworld  and the success of the reform effort must bemeasured in terms of the Organization's capacity todeliver programmes  strengthen the Secretariat  enhanceits strategic orientation and use the development dividendto enhance socio-economic development in all ourcountries. In this context  Kenya welcomes theappointment of Dr. Klaus Töpfer as Director-General ofthe United Nations Office at Nairobi. As host to the onlyUnited Nations headquarters in the developing world  wecontinue to be greatly concerned by the underutilizationof the excellent conference facilities at the United NationsOffice at Nairobi. Practical plans are urgently required toplace the Nairobi Office on the same level as the UnitedNations Offices at Geneva and Vienna by providing itwith adequate resources and personnel to enable it tocarry out its functions effectively.The changes that have taken place in internationalrelations need to be reflected in the composition andstructure of the Security Council. The Security Council isa body that is empowered to make important executivedecisions on matters of peace and security on behalf ofthe entire membership of the United Nations. It isimperative that the reform of the Security Council shouldensure greater accountability and democracy together withequitable representation. The universal and democraticnature of the United Nations should be preserved andreforms introduced to ensure fair representation of all themajor geographic regions of the world.A strong and persuasive case has been made byAfrican countries for at least two seats in the permanentmembership of the Security Council. Our recentexperience as a nonpermanent member of the Council hasconvinced us of the urgency of restructuring thisimportant organ so that developing countries can playtheir rightful part in the maintenance of internationalpeace and security.Kenya is of the view that sanctions should beimposed only in accordance with the Charter and onlyafter all means for the pacific settlement of disputes underChapter VI have been exhausted. A thorough study of theshort- and long-term effects of sanctions  especially oninnocent victims  should be undertaken. The objectives ofsanctions should be clearly defined and the sanctionsshould be lifted as soon as those objectives have beenachieved. Sanctions should be imposed for a specifiedtime  and the conditions to be met by the country or partyon which sanctions are imposed must be clearly definedand subjected to periodic review. We reject any attempts24to impose or prolong the application of sanctions forreasons other than the specified objectives.The application of sanctions usually has profoundeffects not only on the target countries but also on theirneighbouring countries and other trading partners. Effortsshould therefore be made to put Article 50 of the Charter which refers to third States  into operation by establishingmechanisms or Funds to provide them with relief. In thisregard  Kenya urges that the sanctions on Iraq should beurgently reviewed with a view to their suspension andeventual lifting. We also hope that the sanctions on Libya recently suspended  will soon be lifted.As we enter the twenty-first century  it is hard toimagine what this world would be without the UnitedNations. Consider for a moment the number of lives thathave been saved by the Organization; the personal freedomsthat many countries and individuals now enjoy; and thediseases that have been controlled or eliminated: the list ofsuccesses is endless. But much still needs to be done: theSecretary-General's proposal for a Millennium Assembly with a millennium summit as an integral part  wouldprovide an important forum for us to reexamine the role ofthe Organization and chart our path for the nextmillennium. Kenya will play its part."
"88",3724,"KGZ",54,1999,"First of all  I would like on behalf of thedelegation of the Kyrgyz Republic to congratulate Mr.Theo-Ben Gurirab on his election as President of theGeneral Assembly for the current session. We hope that as a result of his great experience  our work during thissession will be successful.At the threshold of the third millennium a mostpressing issue is facing humanity: the establishment of thenew world order  which will affect the nature of theworld in the future. The issue concerns all members ofthe international community  regardless of their place orthe role they play in international relations.The continuing threat of the proliferation of weaponsof mass destruction; problems involving the protection ofthe environment; technological and natural disasters;unresolved conflicts  terrorism and all forms ofextremism  illegal trafficking in narcotics; the armstrade — these are serious sources of tension throughoutthe world. Recent events related to the settlement of theproblem of Kosovo are another reminder of the hugeprice that continues to be paid in human suffering.Kyrgyzstan is striving to make a positivecontribution to the achievement of the global goal ofestablishing a new world order founded on security stability and prosperity. We wish to demonstrate to theinternational community our commitment to suchuniversal principles as democracy  respect for humanrights  support for market economies  the pursuit of good-neighbourly relations  stability and security — not only inour region but throughout the world.The years since our independence have convinced usthat for Kyrgyzstan there is no more rational foreignpolicy than a balanced  multipolar approach focusing onthe development of friendly  consistent relations both withStates that play an important role in regional and worldaffairs and with those in which our country sharespragmatic interests.29Among the major international events for the KyrgyzRepublic in recent years I wish to mention the admission ofour country into the World Trade Organization; theadoption  at the fifty-third session of the General Assembly of a resolution — resolution 53/24 — proclaiming the year2002 as the International Year of Mountains; and theelaboration by Askar Akayev  President of the KyrgyzRepublic  of the Silk Road diplomacy doctrine.President Akayev's Silk Road foreign policy is basedon the ideas of global interdependence and of reviving theSilk Road as a bridge joining countries and civilizations soas to develop in the third millennium an intensive multilevel  multifaceted system of communication betweencivilizations. It is no accident that the philosophy behindthe Silk Road diplomacy doctrine carries over to theRepublic's other foreign policy initiatives of recent years.These include the holding in Kyrgyzstan  under the auspicesof the United Nations  of an international conference onAfghanistan; the proclamation of the year 2002 as theInternational Year of Mountains; and the activeparticipation of Kyrgyzstan in the establishment of aCentral Asian nuclear-weapon-free zone.In particular  enshrined in the doctrine is the idea that given the current situation  reliable and dynamic politicaland commercial relations cannot be established without thestrengthening of multilateral relations of mutual cooperationand trust between all the States of the region. The SilkRoad policy requires Kyrgyzstan to establish and developas fully as possible such relations with the countries ofCentral Asia in all sectors and cooperative areas  includingthe maintenance of regional and global security.The mutual cooperation of China  Kazakhstan Kyrgyzstan  Russia and Tajikistan within the framework ofwhat is called the Shanghai Five is one of the most positivefactors for the maintenance of security in Central Asia  andfor Central Asia's development  and for its transformationinto a region of peace  good-neighbourly relations andprosperity. Since the first meeting of the heads of State ofthe Shanghai Five and the signing of the agreement onconfidence-building in connection with military activities inthe border areas  the countries involved have  throughfriendly consultations  been able to generally settle borderissues and reduce the armed forces present in the borderareas. We have established and strengthened cooperationand with it increased security  peace and calm along theborders.From 24 to 25 August 1999  in Bishkek  the fourthsummit of the heads of State of the Shanghai Five tookplace. As participants pointed out  we are now seeing atransformation among the Shanghai Five. Whereas in thepast the group focused on military and politicalcooperation  now it is defining major directions for tradeand economic cooperation. The role of the Bishkeksummit in this context was to transform theseunderstandings into practical actions.It is necessary specifically to point out the uniqueformat of the five in the context of which countries ofvarying size  with different state systems  levels ofeconomic development and military strength arecooperating. A concrete demonstration of this was thesigning in Bishkek of an additional border agreementbetween China and Kyrgyzstan  which effectivelyremoved from the agenda the question of inter-Statedemarcation and established a real basis for thetransformation of the Kyrgyzstan-China border into aborder of peace and mutual cooperation in the twenty-firstcentury.Kyrgyzstan continues to participate actively in theprocess of creating a nuclear-weapon-free zone in CentralAsia. An important role in the successful implementationof this initiative is being played by the consultativemeeting of experts of regional countries  held underUnited Nations auspices. We feel that the rapidconversion of Central Asia into a nuclear-weapon-freezone is becoming a multidimensional issue  since theachievement of this goal will favour profound positiveprogress on the global  regional and subregional levels  aswell as in the area of bilateral relations between thecountries of our region. It will also be in harmony withthe world community's aspirations to establish a safenuclear-free future.As is well known  dramatic events have recentlytaken place in southern Kyrgyzstan in connection with theincursion into Kyrgyz territory of well-armed banditgroups of international terrorists with many years ofexperience fighting in Afghanistan and Tajikistan. As aresult of the illegal actions of these terrorists  who aremembers of the implacable radical wing of Islamicextremism  a tense situation has emerged in the Batkenand Chon-Alai areas of Osh Province. Internationalterrorists have behaved barbarically  taking foreignhostages and murdering peaceful citizens. The bandits andthe forces behind them have made brazen  arrogant andfar-reaching attempts to impose their extremist views onthe country and have decisively and irrevocably chosenthe path of attacking peaceful democratic States andeconomic and social reforms. They have threatened the30security and destroyed the tranquility of each and everyState of Central Asia.We are deeply concerned at having to confront suchphenomena as the internationalization of Islamic extremism.Among the terrorists invading our country  we haveobserved not only representatives of States of Central Asia but also foreign mercenaries. Events in southern Kyrgyzstanand in Dagestan  Russia  are links in the same chain  forgedby international Islamic extremists seeking their owncriminal objectives. These international bandits seek refugebehind the noble values of Islam  which they roughly flout sowing death and suffering among peaceful populations.I wish to stress in particular the staunch andcommitted support of our friendly neighbours — includingKazakhstan  Tajikistan  Uzbekistan and Russia — forKyrgyzstan's efforts to eradicate these bandit groups. TheStates of the region have shown the internationalcommunity their firm desire to work together and tocoordinate their efforts in confronting internationalterrorism.In turn  Kyrgyzstan expresses its deep-seated hope forreciprocal support from the world community in its struggleagainst international terrorism  which is a worldwide threat.In this context  Kyrgyzstan highly commends the supportand solidarity of the States members of the Conference onInteraction and Confidence-building Measures in Asia meeting at the level of Foreign Ministers in Almaty on 14September. The Conference adopted a joint declaration onthe situation in Kyrgyzstan in which it condemned thecriminal activities of terrorists and expressed solidarity andsupport for my Government's fight against terrorism.The criminal acts of international terrorists in southernKyrgyzstan have reinforced the need for a speedysettlement of the armed conflict in Afghanistan. It isbecoming ever more apparent that the designs of theIslamic extremists based in Afghanistan and of the forcesbehind them are spreading their destabilizing influencethroughout Central Asia through terror  murder  hostage-taking and drug and weapons trafficking. In this connection I wish particularly to point out that the ongoing illegaltransshipment of narcotics from Afghanistan across theterritories of the Central Asian countries is a primary sourceof financing for the criminal activities of the Islamicextremists. We feel that the world community must take themost decisive measures to prevent these Islamic extremistsfrom sowing violence  chaos and triumphal obscurantism inCentral Asia.Kyrgyzstan intends broadly to support the efforts ofthe international community in the context of the “sixplus two” group. In turn  striving to make our owncontribution to the early settlement of the internalAfghanistan conflict  which has become a breedingground for Islamic extremism in the region  our countryis ready to provide facilities for the convening  underUnited Nations auspices  of a conference on peace inAfghanistan.Highly appreciating the importance to theinternational community of the United Nations as auniversal Organization  Kyrgyzstan is profoundlyinterested in the successful reform of its work. Wesupport comprehensive reform  which should encompassall the organs of the United Nations  including theSecurity Council  which must vigorously address allaspects of human development. The Kyrgyz Republicconfirms its view of the need to expand Security Councilmembership and is also in favour of equitablegeographical representation in both categories.There is no doubt that the process of reforming theUnited Nations should reflect upon the work of all itsagencies. In our country today  we are seeing thesuccessful work of such United Nations specializedagencies as the United Nations Development Programme(UNDP)  the United Nations Children's Fund  the UnitedNations Population Fund  the Office of the United NationsHigh Commissioner for Refugees and others. We feel thateffectiveness and results are the main criteria in assessingtheir work. It is necessary to give heightened attention tothe work of those agencies from which we can obtainmaximum output. In this connection  there needs to bemore active efforts to enhance the quality of work toimplement concrete measures designed to resolve socio-economic  cultural  humanitarian and legal issues.In this respect  I wish to highlight the important roleplayed by UNDP  as the Organization's basic financingand coordination agency  to strengthen United Nationsdevelopment efforts in such countries as Kyrgyzstan. In1998  Kyrgyzstan became a pilot country in UNDP's newresult-based approach. The results of the work of thissystem  which have been mainstreamed in all UNDPoffices and headquarters  are being planned for use in amulti-year funding framework. We hope that this systemwill become an effective means of attracting additionalfunding. In this connection  we cannot fail to beconcerned by the reduction in and unpredictability ofUNDP core resources. We wish to appeal from thisrostrum to the Governments of donor countries to31undertake to study closely the possibility of increasing through UNDP  their assistance to States with economies intransition.In this difficult period for countries such as my own assistance rendered through UNDP and other specializedagencies is an important factor in the strengthening of ourindependence  stability and progress.In conclusion  I wish to stress Kyrgyzstan's readinessto cooperate with all Members of the United Nations inachieving progress on a broad number of issues on theagenda of this final session of the millennium."
"89",3767,"KHM",54,1999,"It is anhonour for me to address this Assembly. I bring to allgreetings and good wishes from His Majesty NorodomSihanouk  King of Cambodia  and from the people and19the Royal Government of Cambodia. I should like to informthe Assembly about the recent strides Cambodia has madeand about how it stands ready to fulfil its role in thecommunity of nations. I wish also to share with theAssembly some humble thoughts on global events of thepast and responsibilities for the future.First of all  on behalf of the delegation of theKingdom of Cambodia  and on my own behalf  I wouldlike to extend heartfelt congratulations to Mr. Theo-BenGurirab on his election as the President of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-fourth session. We wish him successin his important work and pledge him our full support andcooperation.Allow me also to express my sincere thanks andadmiration to Mr. Didier Opertti  President of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-third session  for his benevolentleadership and guidance.I also wish to take this opportunity  on behalf of theRoyal Government and the people of Cambodia  to warmlywelcome the Republic of Kiribati  the Republic of Nauruand the Kingdom of Tonga to the United Nations.Just in the past year  Cambodia has finally turned acorner of history  putting firmly behind it the darkness ofits recent past and emerging into the new dawn of itsfuture. For the first time in many decades  Cambodia isnow a fully integrated country  without rebels or separatistsand without internal strife or conflict. The black chapter ofstrife  violence  turbulence and turmoil is finally closed.Last year we held open and free general elections on ourown  assisted and witnessed closely by the internationalcommunity  which pronounced them fully free and fair.After considerable discussions among the main electedparties concerning a common platform to serve the cause ofthe country and its people  a new coalition Government isnow in place.The last remnants of the genocidal Khmer Rouge haveeither surrendered or been captured  and are in custodyawaiting trial for their crimes of genocide. We are firmlyresolved to do whatever is needed to ensure an open trialfor those responsible for genocidal crimes perpetrated in thecountry in the past. In holding this trial  we will carefullybalance the need to provide our people  who were thevictims of this genocidal regime  with justice in orderfinally to put behind us that dark chapter in our nationalhistory  and the paramount need for continued nationalreconciliation and the preservation of the hard-earned peace national independence and sovereignty which we valuemost highly.Peace  which was so elusive for many decades past now finally prevails throughout the country. Cambodiahas joined that important regional group  the Associationof South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)  and is determinedto play its responsible role in regional and internationalaffairs.Cambodia and its people are committed to pluralistdemocracy and to upholding and protecting human dignityand human rights. We will be guided and governed to inall our efforts by the pursuit of the rule of law  whichprovides equality for all before the law and ensures thatlegal procedures and practices are the same for all andthat the law is enforced through a competent andimpartial judiciary system with built-in procedures forappeal and for rendering judgment.On the economic front  we have pursued and willcontinue to pursue market-oriented policies  with safetynets for the vulnerable sectors of society until they areable to compete on an equal footing with others. Ourprincipal goal is poverty alleviation. Our economicpolicies and practices  with generous externalassistance — for which we are grateful — have resultedin steady growth over the past few years. Even during thefinancial melt-down in the region two years ago theCambodian economy maintained a fairly even keel.Moreover  with strong political will  the RoyalGovernment is implementing its policy platform andreform programmes with a view to establishing a viablefoundation for long-term economic growth and sustainabledevelopment. The key areas of the reform programmesinclude military and police demobilization; public sectorreform aimed at strengthening democracy; improvingpublic services and increasing their efficiency; enhancingthe rule of law and respect for human rights; andeconomic reforms focused on maintaining macroeconomicstability: strengthening banking and financial institutions fiscal reform  sound management of public property andincreased public investment in physical and socialinfrastructure and human resource development.So now  as the century ends  we can say withconfidence that we are firmly back on track as oneunified nation — unified in our desire not to be drawninto the divisive factions of the past  but rather to playour part in the comity of nations for a better future for allmankind. We look to the future with great optimism born20out of our own achievements in political reconciliation compromise and adaptation placing the people’s longer-terminterests above narrow and short-term partisan gains  andout of our sound economic and social policies. We are bothdetermined and confident that Cambodia will march aheadinto the next century  and millennium  with renewedconfidence and vigour  and that it will contribute to humanprogress.This is a historic session which affords us all anopportunity — indeed compels us — to reflect on the pastand plan our planet’s future together. Looking at a widerperspective  we can see that humanity has witnessedunimaginable and immeasurably great change and progressover the last millennium. Progress in science andtechnology has helped us conquer deadly diseases  extendand enhance human life and improve the human condition.We have vastly increased our understanding of our planetand our universe. We have annihilated distance andimproved communications to make our Earth a globalvillage indeed.Much of our technological progress and many notableachievements have indeed occurred in the last merehundred years  and the more we advance  the morepossibilities for achievement arise.Yet our achievements also mask many continuedfailings and appear to give rise to potential dangers. On aplanetary level  we have vastly depleted our naturalresources  mining and using non-renewable resources at arapid rate; destroying our forests; depleting our oceans;polluting resources that are essential to our very survival such as air and water; and driving to extinction rare speciesof fauna and flora  the value of whose contributions tobalance and harmony in nature we have yet to understand.We have acquired weapons of awesome power thatcan destroy all that we have accomplished and built. Thetechnological revolution that we have witnessed in thiscentury has gone so far that human morals have yet tocatch up with it. We have deployed vast efforts andresources — intellectual  physical and financial — toachieve this tremendous progress in science and technology but we must be sure that these accomplishments can beharnessed and will serve only to increase the well-being ofhumankind instead of destroying it.The greatest concern of the coming century is that therevolutionary progress in science and technology achievedover the past 100 years has resulted in  among otherthings  the production of all kinds of weapons of massdestruction. As a result  there are now countless armsfactories and a huge stock of modern weapons in manycountries worldwide. Meanwhile  the modernization ofarmed forces — which is actually an arms race —continues unabated  in parallel with the many conflictsthat are spreading throughout the world. Where will thissituation lead us? This century has witnessed two greatwars  unleashed by intolerance and bigotry  which causedmore division in their wake. More and more lives arebeing lost. Social tensions and hatred abound  caused byreligious and other differences. The world has reached astage of complete disorder  where the rich and mightyimpose their agenda on the poor and force the weak tofollow them.We must also stress that scientific and technologicalresearch  which has been conducted in a morallyirresponsible manner  has turned our world into one ofdrug production  where most of the discoveries have beenmade by the developed countries but have had adestructive impact on poor developing countries. Theworld is facing many fundamental challenges  such asorganized crime  drug and human trafficking  and so on that jeopardize the future of coming generations.In addition  the gap between the rich and the poor the mighty and the meek  and the haves and have-notshave widened. We have lost the art of sharing and caring.Our numbers have multiplied many times  but science hasyet to find ways to feed future billions and to stretchmother earth’s capacity to sustain us. The aging of ourpeople will pose immense challenges for futuregenerations  when fewer productive people will have tomeet the needs of larger numbers of dependents  youngand old alike. Half a billion people live in abject poverty while a few enjoy conspicuous comfort. The poor vulnerable and oppressed suffer everywhere because ofexploitation and neglect.In our rapid progress and our daily race to achievemore and temporarily resolve problems as they arise  weseem not to pay attention to the longer-term future. Thedawn of the next millennium is forcing us to pause andreflect. In the past  human destiny has from time to timebeen guided by far-seeing messiahs and visionaries. Butwe cannot afford to wait for another messiah to appear.Since all our religions teach us that there is a messiahdeep down in each one of us  that is where we mustsearch for answers. Let not the arrogance of our justifiedachievements lull us into inaction for the future.21World leaders have a rare and grave responsibility tocarry out this soul-searching. It is given to few of us toundertake the task of charting the future as the nextmillennium dawns. We have to set aside our daily choresand power games and devote our attention to long-termproblems. A few hours or days of reflection in 2000 willdetermine the destiny of the next thousand years and morefor humankind and for mother earth. Let us for a timeforget all our differences; imagine that there are no nationalboundaries or religious  racial or regional differences; anddevote our attention to the most important and essentialareas we must address in the next four to five years inorder to set our planet on the correct course for the future.We do not need long  drawn-out academic conferences ofevery kind and on every subject to do this. We do not needvolumes of position papers. We need only to trust ourcollective knowledge; the lessons of the past  which areimmense; and our innate basic good instincts.In this spirit  I would like to express Cambodia’sstrong support for the 2000 millennium summit of theleaders of all countries  where — without having to watchour sound-bites  pose for the cameras or please domesticaudiences — we can talk of our planet and humankind andof what needs to be done. The overarching need is toensure that the Cambodian Buddhist concept of “Dharma” or its equivalent in every religion  be respected  and that wedo what past messiahs have enjoined us to do. In essence we must lead a balanced and tolerant life  in harmony withoneself  with one’s neighbours  with other beings  withnature and with the cosmos. Perhaps we have to visualizeand devise new institutions and agendas  or significantlyreshape and redirect existing ones  to guide us through thebeginning of the next millennium.We also have to set short- to medium-term agendas ofa more practical nature. Of topmost priority is the need toeradicate poverty  a continuing scourge and stigma forhumanity. We should devise steps to achieve this in thefirst 10 years of the next century. With sharing from therich to the poor  internationally and within countries  this isnot an impossible task. Already the G-8 nations haveagreed to forgo past debts of poorer nations. This trendneeds to continue  and future assistance should largely bethrough well-monitored grants rather than loans.Secondly  we must preserve and enhance ourenvironment and ecology. We have already seen how someareas try to dispose of their contaminated wastes in otherplaces. It is necessary to stop the generation of wastes or tocontain their levels at the source. In some cases we have toslow  or sacrifice current consumption  but this takesvision and determination.Last but not least  we need to re-evaluate the rolesof common institutions and focus on their positiveaspects. The United Nations has served us well for morethan half a century. It has done commendable workbeyond its original mandate and has adapted to changingneeds. It has been a platform for defining common goals.But we need to show more dedicated determination to ridit of functions  committees and forums which have lostrelevance or usefulness.Within the United Nations much has beenaccomplished under the bold and visionary leadership ofthe Secretary-General  Kofi Annan  and we all pay tributeto his wisdom and managerial abilities. Yet somechallenges remain including further efforts to curtail theburgeoning budget levels. Cambodia supports the need toreform the United Nations. The Organization and itsspecialized organs need to become more unified at thecountry level under the mechanism of the United Nationsresident coordinator. In other words  there should be asingle United Nations presence in each country  withspecialized organs serving under one leadership  muchlike an ambassador providing an overall umbrella for allthe activities of his country in a host country.With this reform  our world body will be required toimprove the criteria for recruiting staff and officials forposting in various United Nations agencies  especially forposting in member countries. Otherwise  they willconsider themselves almighty gods  without any virtue ready to violate the sovereignty of a member country which has paid considerable membership dues to pay theirhigh salaries. In this regard  Cambodia has had someexperience in the history of its cooperation with someUnited Nations officials.The Kingdom of Cambodia deems it necessary  onthe other hand  to abide strictly by the United NationsCharter and to reinforce the role of the Security Councilin the process of maintaining peace in the world. Weappeal to the international community to make furthercontributions to the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme (UNDP)  so that it can continue to providedevelopment aid to the least developed countries.We also think that punishing poor people of the leastdeveloped countries  by imposing sanctions and economicblockade to achieve one’s political agenda  goes againstthe principle of humanity and respect for human rights22and for the right to self-determination of the people livingin the affected country. Therefore  Cambodia fully supportsthe demand of many countries for the immediate removalof the economic blockade imposed on Cuba.Cambodia fully welcomes the decision of theGovernment of Indonesia to accept the multinationalpeacekeeping forces of the United Nations so as to restoreand strengthen order and stability in East Timor. Wecherish the strong hope that the multinational peacekeepingforces of the United Nations will effectively cooperate withthe Indonesian Government to quickly and successfullycreate a peaceful situation for the people of East Timor.In closing  let me once again appeal to world leadersto use the opportunity of the dawn of the new millenniumto carefully evaluate our achievements and their costs  aswell as the future perils that confront us  and to considerimportant steps to establish a new world order that will takethis planet safely through the next thousand years. Thelessons of the past should steer us towards ensuring lastinglegacies for generations yet to be born. Cambodia standsready to join in this global effort."
"90",3812,"KNA",54,1999,"I wish mostheartily to congratulate you  Sir  on your election to leadthis body at this most significant time  as we stand at thethreshold of the new millennium. I am persuaded thatyour antecedents  both in your own country and here atthe United Nations  have eminently prepared you for therole that you have been elected to fill. I  for my part pledge the total support and assistance of my delegationfor the accomplishment of your great task.I would also like to pay tribute to the work of yourpredecessor  the Foreign Minister of Uruguay  arepresentative of the Group of Latin America andCaribbean States  who steered the General Assemblythrough the difficult period of the fifty-third session.Once again  I would like to express my unreservedesteem for the Secretary-General  whose charm  affabilityand intellect have been of great benefit to the UnitedNations system. It is clear to all that Mr. Kofi Annan ismaking a unique contribution to the development of this our Organization. My country  Saint Kitts and Nevis  itsGovernment  its people and myself heartily commend theSecretary-General.May I take this opportunity to say a word ofwelcome and congratulations to the three new MemberStates admitted at the opening of this fifty-fourth session:the Republic of Kiribati  the Republic of Nauru and theKingdom of Tonga. As representative of a small islandState from the Caribbean  I am happy to welcome themas small island States from the Pacific region. I recognizethat even though they have only now attained fullmembership in the United Nations they are well seized oftheir obligations and they will play their full part inupholding the principles of the Charter. Once again Icongratulate them and wish them well for the future.23When this Organization was formed  some 54 yearsago  it ushered in bright hopes and held out bright promise.It was an Organization dedicated to the ending of war andthe enhancement of peace. Nations were to have beatentheir swords into ploughshares and their spears into pruninghooks. I wish that  as we come to the end of the twentiethcentury and embark upon the twenty-first  we really couldhave celebrated this bright new world. But even now during the closing months of the closing year of themillennium  mankind has been afflicted by violence andbrutality  and man's inhumanity to man has been expressedin some of the most outrageous fashions.The recent development in Kosovo  the terriblydisturbing stories of the human tragedy that befell itspeople  the injustices that were highlighted during thatconflict — all this constitutes a severe limitation in thework of the United Nations.My Government takes the view that genocidal activity from whichever sources it emanates  is unacceptable and aviolation of international law. The United Nations musttherefore be vigilant as it continues its pacification efforts.Now that the job of rebuilding is under way  let us lookforward — look forward with hope to an era of peace andreconstruction — and let us hope that what may haveseemed initially a failure may turn out to be part of thestriking success of the United Nations.As if there is to be no respite from the challengesaffecting this body  while we thought we were overcomingthe problems of Kosovo there flared up the problem of EastTimor. Saint Kitts and Nevis  as a small State  has beenappalled at the wanton violence and death visited upon theEast Timorese people since the referendum. This worldbody must roundly condemn the inhumane activitiesperpetrated against the people of East Timor only becausein seeking to fulfil their aspirations to live as a sovereignpeople  they gave legitimate expression them.My Government would like to commend the work ofthe Secretary-General and all others who have sought topull us back from this abyss of human disaster. Saint Kittsand Nevis urges the Indonesian authorities to dischargetheir obligations with maturity and to work together withthe international community for the preservation of thepeace and the protection of the people of East Timor. Wewelcome the acceptance by the Indonesian authorities of aninternational protective force and we pray that the people ofEast Timor will have their rights respected and be able todevelop in freedom and democracy. We commend therecent commitment of the international community to thereconstruction and development of Kosovo and  now  tothe people of East Timor.We still hope  however  that there will be equalresponsiveness to the people of the Great Lakes regionand the rest of sub-Saharan Africa.Since I have referred to the outrages in areas of theworld which constitute a dark blot on the humancondition  perhaps I ought to balance my remarks byrecognizing that  in one area of the world  the MiddleEast  where peace for such a long time seemed illusive a process of peace is now finally under way. I shouldplace on record the appreciation of my country for allthose who are assisting in the process of peace. We mustcontinue to support the efforts of the peacemakers inorder to ensure that the rhetoric of violence is silenced.Saint Kitts and Nevis urges the United Nations andfellow world leaders to work towards preserving theintegrity of the country and the people of Kuwait and toensure that they enjoy the dignity of life without fear. Theterritorial integrity of their national must be respected andpreserved and the Security Council solution concerningIraqi aggression in Kuwait should be fully implemented.By the same token  Saint Kitts and Nevis notes thepeace process in Ireland and compliments all those whoare contributing to the process. The world communityshould give its support to this initiative so that those whoare seeking to retard the process of peaceful developmentwill find no encouragement.At this point  Saint Kitts and Nevis would like toexpress profound condolences to the Government of theRepublic of China on Taiwan on the loss of lives whichresulted from the recent devastating earthquake. We hopethat the process of recovery will be speedy. I call on theinternational community  therefore  to come to theassistance of Taiwan  which in times past has assistedwillingly in bringing relief to countries facing similardisasters.Let me know say a word about the unsettled issue ofthe Chinese people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. Indoing so  let me first make it clear that it never has beenand is not now the intention of my country to interfere inthe internal affairs or to give offence to any StateMember of the United Nations. Saint Kitts and Nevis ispersuaded that the Chinese people have the capacity andthe accumulated wisdom to find a solution to whatevertheir differences appear to be  but our relationship with24the authorities of the Republic of China  with whom wehave conducted diplomatic relations since our independencein 1983  convinces me that the 22 million Chinese onTaiwan have a valuable contribution which they can maketo international dialogue. The record of their developmentas a freedom-loving  peaceful  pluralistic democracy; themiraculous rebuilding of their economy; and theircontribution to developing countries are all attributes which in our view  require that they be recognized as beingcapable of making a contribution in international forums including those of the United Nations.In addition to the scourges of human conflict  there areother evils which still stare us in the face in these last fewmonths of the closing year of the century. Poverty stillconfronts the vast majority of mankind. Children are stilldying of malnutrition and some  in order to get food  haveto allow themselves to be victimized and turned into cannonfodder. Some still do not get an education. Indeed  there aremany children around the world who do not enjoy achildhood. I am happy that the United Nations has declaredthe decade beginning 2001 to be the International Decadefor a Culture of Peace and Non-violence for the Childrenof the World. The new millennium belongs to our children.It belongs to our children in Saint Kitts and Nevis and tothe children of the world. We have a duty to help make  forthem and with them  a better world than the one in whichwe now live.Additionally  I have noted that the agenda for thisfifty-fourth session includes an item entitled “Building apeaceful and better world through sport and the Olympicideal”. Saint Kitts and Nevis wishes to place on record itscountry's support for that item  as we are doing everythingin our power to build the development of our youth throughsports.By the same token  I am proud to report that oureducational policies are yielding very positive results. Wein Saint Kitts and Nevis have achieved a 98 per centliteracy rate and we have not only begun  but areintensifying the process of making all of our young peoplecomputer-literate and equipped to face the challenges of thenew dawning century. Saint Kitts and Nevis welcomes theassistance of the international community to enable us torealize our objectives in this regard and to give thisprogramme even greater forward thrust.It is our view that the technological advancement ofthe past 54 years  instead of creating dislocations  should beused to improve understanding. It should be used toimprove efficiency of production and to provide betterrevenue allocation and better living standards. Saint Kittsand Nevis urges those countries with the wherewithal todemonstrate appropriate leadership. I encourage them touse the availability of and their access to thesetechnologies not only to generate greater economic wealthfor themselves  but also to advance the economic andsocial well-being of the citizens of the world.We applaud the progress being made with regard towomen in development since the adoption of the BeijingDeclaration and Platform for Action at the Fourth WorldConference on Women on 15 September 1995. Ourcountry has demonstrated its unswerving commitment togender equity by our participation in the Committee onthe Convention on the Elimination of All Forms ofDiscrimination against Women (CEDAW). For its part Saint Kitts and Nevis is currently implementing a newgender management system and is introducing measuresto ensure that the national budget in my country is moresensitive to gender issues. We are grateful to theCommonwealth Fund for Technical Cooperation fortechnical assistance in this regard.In a few days  the United Nations will convene aspecial session of the General Assembly for the reviewand appraisal of the implementation of the BarbadosProgramme of Action for the small island developingStates. We trust that the international community will givedue recognition to the efforts being made by small islandStates to implement their commitments under theProgramme of Action and note that those efforts havebeen affected by financial and other resource constraintsand by global  economic and environmental factors. Welook forward  therefore  to the international community'sproviding continued support for capacity- and institution-building programmes and projects in the small islanddeveloping States.In the meantime  my Government welcomes thecontinued efforts of the Alliance of Small Island States(AOSIS) in promoting the interests and concerns of smallisland States. All small island developing States  likethose of us in the Caribbean  are susceptible to thevagaries of nature as well as to man-made difficulties.Just last week our brothers and sisters in the Bahamas like those along the south-eastern coastal states of theUnited States of America  suffered terrible and destructivelosses as a result of hurricane Floyd. I urge StatesMembers of the United Nations to be generous in theirsupport for any reconstruction endeavours for thethousands of displaced people.25Last year Saint Kitts and Nevis suffered a similarmajor blow  from hurricane Georges. The Assemblyexpressed its support for the efforts of my Government  andseveral other governments in the region  as we coped withthat particular disaster. The Assembly also urged all Statesas a matter of urgency to contribute generously to the relief rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts. It further requestedthe Secretary-General  in collaboration with theinternational financial institutions and other bodies andagencies of the United Nations system  to assist the affectedGovernments in identifying their medium- and long-termneeds and in mobilizing resources  as well as helping withthe task of rehabilitation and reconstruction in the affectedCaribbean countries.I have dealt with this at some length because SaintKitts and Nevis wishes to thank the Assembly for thesupport expressed in that decision. We hereby place onrecord that we have received assistance from the UnitedNations system and  in particular  from the United NationsDevelopment Programme (UNDP)  and I assure therepresentatives in this world body that our efforts atrehabilitation have proceeded with what some havedescribed as remarkable speed. But  however commendableemergency assistance is  it is not a formula for long-term sustainable development. Countries such as ours need thecontinued support of the international community to ensurethat our development is not sacrificed on the altar ofglobalization and trade liberalization.How will the banana farmers in Saint Lucia  SaintVincent and the Grenadines  and Dominica  or the sugar-cane workers in Saint Kitts and Nevis preserve the integrityof their families? How will they preserve the dignity of agood standard of living when the impersonal tentacles ofglobalization reach out to deprive them of the resourcesthey need to survive? Human rights  in their purest andmost practical sense  embody the human condition in all itsbasic elements. Therefore  the United Nations  as a majorguarantor of these rights  should act as a counterbalance toglobalization  which has begun to take food away from ourpeople instead of helping them.The World Trade Organization is expected to play akey role in promoting trade liberalization  thereby fuellingthe globalization process. The World Trade Organization however  is not a panacea for the ills of world trade. Nonew rules can alter the fact that in most areas of exports developed countries will have a comparative advantage overdeveloping countries. It is a basic principle in economicsthat a country with a comparative advantage in producinggoods and services in given areas will always make moneyat the expense of countries that are less equipped. Inshort  the rules as now written will inevitably lead to azero-sum situation where trade between developedcountries and developing countries is concerned.A regime  therefore  of unrestricted trade can lead totremendous shocks in the economy of the less developedcountries with very critical repercussions for theircitizens. As part of the Caribbean Community  we havealready witnessed how the logic of applying the samerules to all  regardless of the level of economicdevelopment  has led to serious dislocation within thebanana-producing countries of our Caribbean subregion.Saint Kitts and Nevis would prefer to see this body through the United Nations Conference on Trade onDevelopment (UNCTAD)  take up the issue of whathappens to countries caught in the toils of a free-traderegime. Saint Kitts and Nevis believes that this matterrequires careful study by experts with a global perspectiveand it is our view that the United Nations is the oneOrganization capable of studying this issue objectivelyand putting recommendations before the leaders of theworld to remedy what could potentially be a disaster forsmall  vulnerable economies.By and large  a country such as Saint Kitts andNevis  which depends upon a buoyant tourist sector  theexport of sugar and the provision of financial servicescannot — I repeat  cannot — object in principle to aworld of open economies. But our position is that a worldeconomic order predicated upon open economies worksbest with countries whose economies are roughly equal.If we are committed to eradicating poverty in every areaof this world  then we must address the implications forpoverty that are inherent in trading arrangements.Those of us who live in the Caribbean  mostly indeveloping countries and small island States  arevulnerable and also affected by  inter alia  lack ofcapacity and human resource bases  the need for financialresources  social problems  high levels of poverty and theeffects of globalization. We rely heavily on the coastalareas  as well as the marine environment in general  toachieve sustainable development  and meet our needs andgoals. For us  in the context of sustainable development the Caribbean Sea must be seen as a special area. SaintKitts and Nevis earnestly expects that Member States  theinternational community and the United Nations systemwill actively support our efforts in order to develop andimplement this concept and take action so as to avert the26threat of pollution from ship-generated waste  as well asaccidental release of hazardous and noxious substances.Despite the socio-economic quagmire that bedevils andundermines our efforts  my Government has remainedsteadfast. It has remained committed to create moreopportunities for the people of Saint Kitts and Nevis. Butwe are aware that the Government cannot solve theseproblems alone. There is a critical role for the private sectoras well. My Government is equally committed to workingwith local and international businesses  without  however surrendering the fate of our nation to disinterested forcesthat could wreak further havoc on their lives.My Government repeats its call for an expansion ofthe interpretation of human rights to incorporate fullyeconomic rights and the right to development. Inrecognizing that there is an inseparable link between thehuman rights and economic rights of the individual  myGovernment has pledged to continue our programme tobuild affordable houses  create jobs  fight poverty andpursue new sources of local and foreign investment. MyGovernment will be an avid partner and facilitator ofbusiness without compromising the quality of life for eachof our citizens.There is an important part for national Governmentsto play in the protection of their citizens’ human rights  butthere is a more substantial  comprehensive and far-reachingrole for the United Nations as ultimate protector of theentire body of human rights.This means that there should be a greater partnershipbetween the United Nations Conference on Trade andDevelopment (UNCTAD) and the United Nations humanrights mechanisms and other agencies and organs. In thisway  new strategies can be devised for opening access tomarkets for those countries that continue to find themselveson the periphery of the international trading system. TheOrganization should help to create and investigate practicalalternatives.Hence  I maintain that we need a United Nations thatis informed by the inequities of the world economicsystems  and is able to respond to the social challenges thatare being exacerbated as a result.We do our best to achieve the eradication of poverty.Saint Kitts and Nevis seeks the support of the internationalcommunity  thus building a bridge to a better world.Tomorrow’s world should open with our people findinganswers to the request to give them each day their dailybread  and the kingdom of peace should be realized hereon Earth. There is an urgency to match our deeds withour words so that we may  all of us  find the forgivenesswhich is necessary as the basis for building peace in thisworld.Last year I spoke of the viability of social-venturephilanthropy through which Governments and businessesmay collaborate with each other. This concept alreadyexists at a similar level within many corporate structures.Companies are already engaged in projects that enhanceand maintain a positive corporate image. We would takethis further if companies would recognize the importanceof preserving a good corporate culture by improving thestandard of living of the national constituencies in whichthey do profitable business. A reformed United Nations with its existing organs  funds and programmes  can helpto implement such strategies.We must move with informed haste  because I fearthat if we fail to translate the benefits of democracy technological growth and economic wealth into tangiblegains for our people  future chaos will not be far behind.I am one of those who refuse to accept that the developedworld could be ignorant of the challenges facing the smalland poor economies. I am reluctant to think that nationalinterests could be so blinding that Governments neglect torealize that the problems plaguing any one region  forinstance  have serious ramifications much further afield.We have to recommit to the elimination of thepotent cancer of illicit drugs and global consequences. Weare all victims. Therefore  we must all become partners.Let us commit to root out the menace of narco-traffickingthat is becoming embedded in our various societies.I dare say that the multitude of problems before usis complex and very involved. The old paradigms thatprevailed in the cold war have outlived their usefulness.It is not only those elements that directly threaten ourpolitical and strategic interests  but also those factors thatundermine a country’s ability to preserve its economic social and cultural fabric that should guide nationalinterests. There is no longer one giant enemy  but thereare a number of persistent factors that could conspire atany one time to destroy the delicate balance of oursocieties.In spite of all the shortcomings of this body  if theUnited Nations did not exist  it would be necessary toinvent it  because there is no other organization that hascontributed as much to the development of humankind.27Moreover  the Government of Saint Kitts and Nevisis happy to be given this opportunity to express its viewson a number of issues of concern to my country.Without the United Nations  a micro State such asSaint Kitts and Nevis would never have been heard.Therefore  as we cross over into the new millennium  SaintKitts and Nevis joins with the rest of the world as wecommit ourselves to the continued development of theUnited Nations in order to ensure that all peopleeverywhere will enjoy the fulfilment of the promise ofpeace  prosperity and progress."
"91",3838,"KOR",54,1999,"On behalf of mydelegation  I offer Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab my sincerecongratulations on his election as President of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-fourth session. I also pay a tribute tohis predecessor  Mr. Didier Opertti  under whose leadershipthe Assembly succeeded in achieving positive results at itsfifty-third session.I have every expectation that this  the final session ofthe Assembly of the twentieth century  will be as fruitful.The rich experience and leadership Mr. Gurirab brings tothe presidency ensure the session's success. I assure him ofour full cooperation and support in his noble endeavours.I warmly congratulate the three new Members  theRepublic of Kiribati  the Republic of Nauru and theKingdom of Tonga  on their admission to the UnitedNations.The new millennium is about to dawn  and we willenter it with great hope for the new age  but also burdenedby numerous problems left unresolved from the passingcentury. To realize the hope and mould the twenty-firstcentury into an era of global peace and stability  ofwell-being and prosperity for all humankind  we must faceup to these problems  decide what our priority goals are andseek measures to achieve them. So that the fifty-fourthsession may illuminate the way  let us gather the best ofour collective wisdom.The defining character of our times is change andthe acceleration of change. The guiding precept of theglobal actors is shifting from nationalism tointernationalism  and further to globalism. The wholeworld is converging around shared values and behaviourpatterns. In economic affairs  the market economy isbecoming the global norm. In political matters reconciliation and cooperation have become the expectedmode of behaviour. The world is becoming a globalvillage of countries willing and eager to live with oneanother in interdependence and integration.A conspicuous exception to the tide of the times isthe Korean peninsula  where the confrontational structureof the cold-war era still keeps the two divided sides inmutual distrust and hostility. Decades have passed sincethe end of the Korean war  but genuine peace has yet tocome to the Korean people. Despite the warm wind ofreconciliation blowing around the world  the Koreanpeninsula has remained frozen in an icy time warp.The Republic of Korea aspires to melt away the iceand reconcile with the Democratic People's Republic ofKorea. It aspires to free the Korean peninsula from thefinal legacy of the cold war and allow it to take itsrightful place in the grand march of history towards thenew era. To realize this aspiration  the engagement policyof the Government of President Kim Dae-jung has beensending warm winds of sunshine to the North  in hopesthat it will respond in kind. Inspired by the lessons ofhistory and the trend of the times  this sunshine policyrepresents a bold shift in our thinking about South-Northrelations.Our engagement policy is not aimed at underminingor absorbing the North. Instead  it is a policy ofcooperation  designed to help North Korea overcome itseconomic difficulties and promote the co-prosperity of allKoreans  so that we may finally be free from the threat ofanother war. It is a policy of tolerance  envisioning thepeaceful coexistence of two systems along the road toeventual unification.The steady and consistent implementation of theengagement policy during the past year and a half hasmade meaningful and unprecedented openings in the thickwall that divides South and North Korea. South Koreanbusinesses are investing in the North. In one such venture over 100 000 South Korean tourists were able to visit ascenic mountain in the North for the first time since thenational division.19Economic cooperation is also an important element inthe work of the Korean Peninsula Energy DevelopmentOrganization  a joint endeavour of the Republic of Korea the United States  Japan  the European Union and manyother countries to help resolve North Korea's energy-shortage problem while keeping it free of nuclear weapons.The engagement policy is being carried out in closeconsultation with the United States and Japan. It also hasthe full support of our neighbours in North-East Asia —China  the Russian Federation and Mongolia — as well asthe G-7  the Association of South-East Asian Nations  theEuropean Union and other members of the internationalcommunity. South Korea is deeply grateful for theirunderstanding and support.Still North Korea remains suspicious of our intentions.It may perceive the engagement policy as a strategy tobring about its downfall or to absorb it. Speaking in thissolemn Hall  I must reiterate the genuine  good-heartedintentions of the engagement policy. The Republic of Koreahas no wish to undermine North Korea or to make it a partof us. All we seek is peaceful coexistence.I make this appeal. Let us  South and North Korea live in lasting peace. Let us together join the mainstream ofhistory: reconciliation  cooperation and interdependence. Isincerely hope that North Korea responds to the warmsunshine we have been sending it with some warm sunshineof its own.I also hope that the North Korean authorities will takesteps to fundamentally address the chronic food shortageand other difficulties that have plagued the people in theNorth for many years. The problems require the continuedinterest and assistance of the international community.Countless children in the North are suffering and dyingfrom starvation and malnutrition  stunted growth anddisease. With their right to food and life irrevocablyimpaired  tens of thousands of North Koreans have fled thecountry in search of food.The primary responsibility for redressing the situationlies with the North Korean authorities. They must face upto the enormity of the problems. We also hope that theinternational community will provide continuedhumanitarian assistance to North Korea.The Government of the Republic of Korea has activelytaken part in the humanitarian efforts to help theDemocratic People's Republic of Korea. We are prepared tooffer far more in terms of food and fertilizer  as well asassistance to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea'sagricultural restructuring. We urge the North Koreanauthorities to join us in dialogue for cooperation on thisand other matters.North-East Asia  where the interests of the majorPowers intersect  is an economic powerhouse and a regionvital to global peace and stability. With the marketeconomy taking root throughout the region  a new age ofstability  cooperation and mutual prosperity is sproutingin North-East Asia. The countries of the region arebecoming bound ever closer together in economic ties andinterdependencies. Unhampered exchanges andcooperation are expanding far beyond the trade in goodsand services to people-to-people contacts and otherinteractions in the fields of culture  sports  education andmany others. Mutual understanding and appreciation isdeepening.To further the trend  North-East Asia requiresadequate mechanisms to deal with transnational issues such as environmental pollution  drug-trafficking refugees  organized crime and public health. There is alsoa need for a region-wide channel of dialogue andcooperation to defuse tension and prevent conflict.To enjoy a stable security environment and co-prosperity in the twenty-first century  the countries ofNorth-East Asia must learn from the lessons ofregion-wide cooperation and integration in many otherareas of the world. They must strengthen mutual trust byupgrading the mode and calibre of their dialogue andconsultations. They should promptly set out to establisha dialogue forum where they can all engage in earnestexchanges of views and nurture the sense of community.The Republic of Korea stands ready to cooperateclosely with the other countries of the region to launchsuch a mechanism for dialogue and cooperationencompassing all of North-East Asia. I urge the countriesof the region to join in the efforts to translate this ideainto reality.Peace and co-prosperity in North-East Asia willcertainly gain from the global disarmament andnon-proliferation efforts  in which the Republic of Koreahas been an active participant. With the ratification of theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT)  mycountry is now a party to all the key non-proliferationtreaties. We call upon other countries that have yet to signand ratify the CTBT to promptly do so  so that the Treatycan soon go into effect. We call upon all States to join inthe non-proliferation efforts by acceding to all global20regimes  such as the Chemical Weapons Convention  aimedat combating the spread of weapons of mass destruction.A priority task for the global community will be tosuccessfully carry out the review Conference of the Treatyon the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) slatedfor next year and to revitalize the Conference onDisarmament. I urge the Democratic People's Republic ofKorea  as a party to the NPT  to fulfil its responsibilitiesunder the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)safeguards agreement and to cooperate with us toimplement the 1991 Joint Declaration on theDenuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.We are living in a single global community.Globalization has been good to the Republic of Korea.Without the open markets  interdependencies and instantinformation flow nurtured by globalization  we would nothave been able to achieve the rapid economic developmentthat we did. However  stuck in the expediencies fosteredduring the years of Government-driven quantitative growth Korea neglected to strengthen the market rules in thenational economy. We failed to realize that globalizationrequires constant efforts to reinforce the market rules —transparency  accountability  efficiency and productivity. Asa result  Korea was struck by a severe economic crisis in1997.But now we are trying to make up for past neglect.During the past year and a half  we have been undertakingsweeping and intense reforms in the key sectors of society.The reforms have required painful restructuring andsacrifices  but we have been steady and firm in putting intopractice the belief that trade and investment liberalizationand the strengthening of market rules are the keys tosustained economic growth and prosperity.A year ago  from this same rostrum  I spoke about theefforts of my Government and people to overcome thecrisis  guided by the conviction in the parallel developmentof democracy and the free-market economy. Today  I amhappy to report that the efforts have begun to pay off andthe country is expected to achieve over 6 per cent economicgrowth this year  a dramatic turnaround from the -5.8percent of last year. Other economic indicators also speakof a stable  recovering economy.Korea has learned valuable lessons from the economiccrisis. We are now keenly aware that free and faircompetition and good governance are essential tosustainable economic development. We also realized that asystem of social welfare based on human-resourcesdevelopment must be established to mitigate the painfulconsequences of the reforms. Applying those lessons inthe reform drive  we are on our way to becoming amarket economy with a human face.Of course  in a globalized economy  crisis knows noborders and the efforts at preventing and coping withcrisis must also extend beyond borders. In this regard  wewelcome the discussions concerning the restructuring ofthe global financial architecture. For the discussions to beproductive  the crisis-stricken countries and otheremerging market economies should have extensiveparticipation. Keeping track of the discussions formeaningful progress  we count on the continuedcooperation between the United Nations and the BrettonWoods systems.One consequence of globalization has been thewidening gap between the developed and the developingcountries and the increasing marginalization of the leastdeveloped ones. Unattended  the disparity will only growin the twenty-first century of unlimited competition becoming a risk factor that could endanger global stabilityand peace. There is a pressing need for a new paradigmof international development cooperation  whereby thechronic poverty and excessive debts besetting thedeveloping countries and other related issues are taken aschallenges to be overcome with the active input of allmembers of the global community.Development is meaningless without a healthypopulation to reap the fruits. Thus  we welcome the jointinitiative of the United Nations Children's Fund and theWorld Health Organization to establish the GlobalAlliance for Vaccines and Immunization and theChildren's Vaccine Initiative. Doing its share in the effortsto save the 9 million children of the world who are dyingevery year from diseases that can be prevented  theRepublic of Korea has hosted the International VaccineInstitute since 1994. We hope the Institute will be able towork in close cooperation with the Global Alliance andthe Vaccine Initiative.In the half century since the Universal Declarationof Human Rights was adopted in 1948  the UnitedNations has taken the lead in forging global mechanismsfor the protection and advancement of human rightsaround the world. The principles of universality indivisibility and interdependence of all human rights arenow widely upheld. Human rights violations  whereverthey may take place  are now considered a legitimateconcern of the international community. Human rights has21become a priority agenda of the post-cold-war globalcommunity. In the Republic of Korea  the Government ofPresident Kim Dae Jung has made significant advances inthe field of human rights. We have also been an activeparticipant in the efforts of the United Nations and theglobal community to resolve concrete cases of human rightsviolations.While we note the advances in human rights  we mustnot forget that a quarter of the world's population stillstruggles to survive in abject poverty. Poverty undermineshuman dignity and human rights. Poverty is fertile groundfor conflict and dictatorship. Poverty alleviation should beincorporated as a key goal in the United Nationsendeavours to advance human rights around the world. Wewish to see the mainstreaming of human rights in all theprogrammes and activities of the United Nations furtherexpanded and deepened. Furthermore  we believe thisglobal body should strengthen its capacity for early warningand preventive action so as to forestall massive humanrights violations and the outflow of refugees.The task of advancing human rights has alwaysbenefited from the push and pull of civil society. It will beeven more so in the new century as Governments and theUnited Nations work in closer alliance and cooperation withnon-governmental organizations  research organizations andadvocacy groups. Next month  some 3 000 non-governmental organization representatives will gather inSeoul to take part in the 1999 international conference ofnon-governmental organizations. Exploring the role of thenon-governmental organizations in the twenty-first centuryglobal community  the meeting from October 11 to 15should bring the United Nations system and civil societycloser together.Let us turn our attention to the situation in East Timor.The Republic of Korea applauded the Government ofIndonesia for making the decision to let the people of EastTimor choose their own fate. The will of the people  asunequivocally registered on 30 August  must be upheld. Theviolent repression of that will is a grave challenge to thebasic principle of democracy and human decency. Theatrocity must not be left unpunished and law and ordermust be restored in East Timor. The IndonesianGovernment has again shown wisdom and courage inaccepting the multinational peacekeeping forces under theauspices of the United Nations. We hope that peace is soonreturned and that the will of the people for independence isfully implemented through the conjoined efforts of theIndonesian Government and the United Nations. TheRepublic of Korea will take part in the peacekeepingoperations and will continue to do its share in the effortsto safeguard regional and global peace and stability.The United Nations has much work to do in thetwenty-first century. The Republic of Korea deeplyappreciates the reforms introduced by theSecretary-General to enhance the responsiveness of theglobal body to new challenges. We welcome thedesignation of the fifty-fifth session next year as theMillennium Assembly to identify the challenges awaitingthe global community in the twenty-first century. Wehope the Millennium Assembly strengthens the globalleadership of the United Nations for the new age.In this regard  such thought-provoking concepts asglobal public goods  human security and globalgovernance may serve to frame the discussions at theMillennium Assembly.I look to the twenty-first century as the era of theUnited Nations. I sincerely hope to see the global bodyrenew itself and fulfil its missions through continuousreforms and to enhance its effectiveness and democraticcharacter. Recalling the lofty spirit that gave birth to theUnited Nations half a century ago  on behalf of theGovernment and people of the Republic of Korea  Ipledge our abiding support for the global body in itsnoble mission for peace and prosperity around the world."
"92",3884,"KWT",54,1999,"Itgives me pleasure  Sir  to extend to you on behalf of theState of Kuwait our warm congratulations on yourelection as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session. Given your extensive experience ininternational affairs and your personal skills and ability we are confident that you will be able to guide thedeliberations of the Assembly effectively. Let me assureYour Excellency that our delegation will cooperate withyou in a diligent and constructive spirit in order to reachour common goals.16I wish also to pay tribute to your predecessor  HisExcellency Mr. Didier Opertti  who demonstrated goodstewardship in his efforts to enhance the role of theAssembly.Let me take this opportunity to express once again ourdeep gratitude to the Secretary-General  His ExcellencyMr. Kofi Annan  for his tireless endeavours to reform thestructure and streamline the functioning of the Organizationwith a view to bringing it more in line with the ever-changing realities of modern times.Kuwait welcomes the Republic of Kiribati  theRepublic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga tomembership in the United Nations. Our wish is that thesenew Member States will enhance the role and effectivenessof our Organization in the fulfilment of the objectives andpurposes of the Charter.The wheel of time is now bringing us closer to the endof the twentieth century and entry into the third millennium.Against the backdrop of this truly historic benchmark  wethink that the world community should renew its resolve toachieve higher standards of living and political stability andsecurity  all of which are essential factors for progress.With a deeper and greater sense of resolve  humankind'sfuture can be better than our present.Tragically  the twentieth century has seen two bitterworld wars  in addition to numerous bilateral  regional andcivil conflicts that claimed the lives of millions and millionsof innocent human beings. Those innumerable wars put toomany spikes in the wheels of growth and progress of manydeveloping nations.Our cherished hopes and aspirations were alwaysdirected towards fulfilling the long-standing human dreamof using the immense scientific and technologicaldiscoveries and know-how acquired especially in the pastfew decades of the twentieth century to address or solve themajor and pressing global problems and phenomena facingthe human race. However  about one fifth of the humanrace suffers from hunger; hundreds of millions of peoplelive below the poverty line; the arms race  for reasons ofsecurity or territorial expansion  consumes enormousproportions of national budgets or assets to the detriment ofeconomic and development programmes; massacres drivenby ethnic or political motives have become excuses forliquidating opposition forces and consolidating politicaldictatorships; human rights violations persist under differentjustifications; and the phenomenon of terrorism  which isbecoming increasingly intertwined with drug abuse andillicit trafficking in drugs  imperils the stability ofsocieties and States  with the potential risks ofjeopardizing security and stability far beyond nationalborders. In our view  the international community mustcope with these devastating dangers in a more seriousfashion in order to rid the world of their evil.Also  the millennium has seen many devastatingnatural disasters that resulted in vast human losses andextensive property damage. The most recent tragicexample is the earthquake that struck the friendly TurkishRepublic in August. We are confident that Turkey willeventually overcome the dire consequences of thatnational catastrophe. Along with many other countries andinternational relief and aid organizations  Kuwait hastilyresponded by airlifting basic human relief assistance andsupplies. Our response emanated from humanitarianmotives and our sense of good neighbourliness. In thisregard  I wish to recall the decision by the States of theGulf Cooperation Council (GCC) to donate $400 millionto alleviate the impact of that severe quake.In the same vein  we wish to extend our warmcondolences and sympathy to the friendly Governmentand people of Greece and to the families of victims of thetremor that hit there earlier this month. In order to drawsome lessons from the recurrence of such disasters Kuwait calls for expanding and reinforcing the role andeffectiveness of the United Nations disaster relief organs.Such a role would help coordinate the contributions of thevarious States in order to fulfil their desired and optimalgoals  to the best of their capabilities.My delegation now strongly feels that theinternational community should not underestimate the roleand achievements of the United Nations system. Itsoutstanding track record over the past five decadesshould  in our view  deepen our appreciation for thevaluable and credible manner in which the United Nationssystem addressed and resolved many conflicts andproblems across the globe. Indeed  the Untied Nationssaved mankind many potential tragedies. Hence  onecannot really imagine our contemporary world withoutthis Organization  to which Kuwait is honoured to belong.Against the backdrop of the legacy inherited by thepresent generation and the possible challenges that willface us in the future  preparations are under way toconvene the Millennium Assembly session here in NewYork in September next year. Given its historical contextand the level of global participation  we hope that thesession will prove to be a true benchmark in the history17of humanity. Kuwait feels that such an historic occasionrequires proper and adequate preparation to ensure a trulymeaningful outcome in terms of sketching the future pathof the Organization in the new century.The issues on the global agenda are all serious andpressing  and some new vision is needed to deal with them.In any case  we are convinced that international cooperationand coordination and consolidation of human efforts willremain crucial to any viable endeavours to address thoseobstinate and interlinked problems within the framework ofthe United Nations. Therefore  continued support to ensurereinvigoration of the United Nations remains in order.As we look forward to the millennial summit as anunprecedented event  we think that the forthcoming historicoccasion should not be a replay of the United Nationsfiftieth anniversary celebrations  which were a largelyceremonial and symbolic event. The gathering of worldleaders should go beyond the usual ritual of deliveringspeeches and photo sessions. Rather  our objective shouldbe charting out a meaningful path for the future in apragmatic  action-oriented fashion. The new vision shouldfocus on business-like treatment of universal issues such asjustice for all  equality  harmonious co-existence cooperation  inter-cultural dialogues and promotion ofrespect for human rights  and advancing economic andsocial development to the top of our global agenda.At this juncture  allow me to highlight the fact that theState of Kuwait has been ranked number one in the Arabworld and number thirty-five in the world in the UnitedNations Development Programme(UNDP) HumanDevelopment Report of 1999. Kuwait will  God willing continue its steady efforts towards the improvement of theeconomic and social conditions across the country  guidedby  among other factors  the Human Development indices.In the same vein  I wish to recall the recent initiative byHis Highness the Amir of the State of Kuwait  whoproclaimed a decree granting the women of Kuwait fullpolitical rights to participate in parliamentary elections andto run as candidates for the national assembly. Thisinitiative is yet another example of the keen interest on thepart of His Highness the Amir to consolidate thedemocratic system in Kuwaiti society and to expand publicparticipation in civil life. Indeed  it is a testimony to andrecognition of the prominent role and the valuablecontributions by Kuwaiti women to our society.Another important goal we hope the MillenniumAssembly will achieve is the expansion of the membershipof the Security Council and the display of moretransparency in the Council's procedures and methods ofwork. The question of reform of the Security Council hasbeen exhaustively discussed over the past six years. Timehas indeed come for proper action with a view toallowing all United Nations Member States to participatein the decision-making process in a more representativeand equitable manner  under controls that would ensure abalance between effectiveness and larger membership.The reform should also ensure the special responsibilityand ability of the Council members to maintaininternational peace and security.Following the end of the cold war  the world haswitnessed many challenges that threatened internationalpeace and security in various regions. As a result of thegeneral ease in international relations and the growingrapprochement between East and West and the mountingdesire for global cooperation and coordination  the UntiedNations system  through the Security Council  the primaryorgan responsible for the maintenance of internationalpeace and security  sought to address and manage thosecrises according to the ways and means that were setforth in the Charter. Yes  the United Nations has achievedsubstantial progress  though in varying degrees  andsometimes at a very heavy price in terms of losingdedicated personnel and peacekeepers on behalf of thecause of peace and in the service of humanity. Even whenthe United Nations might appear to be faltering inperforming its mission  sometimes perhaps in a ratherembarrassing way  the theoretical question that alwaysarises in our minds is: would that situation have beenbetter had the United Nations not intervened? And theresultant answer that we arrive at is invariably: absolutelynot. Lapses  setbacks and failures are all  unfortunately an inevitable tax that has to be paid in our pursuit ofexcellence and progress  good intentions notwithstanding.The sanctions system  under Article 41  Chapter VII of the Charter  is one of the tools and methods that theSecurity Council found itself impelled to resort to indealing with a number of States. The objective was tomake them change their behaviour and dissuade themfrom the pursuit of policies of aggression  which runcounter to the fundamental norms and principles ofinternational law and the Charter of the United Nations.Experience on the ground has proved this method to beeffective. On two occasions the Council suspended thesanctions imposed against some States once they hadcomplied fully with their obligations under the relevantSecurity Council resolutions. This proves in no uncertainterms that the sanctions were not an end in themselves 18but a means used to impose respect for the Charter and theSecurity Council resolutions.Acting within the terms of its responsibilities  theSecurity Council established at the end of last January threeseparate panels to evaluate the extent of Iraq's compliancewith its obligations under Security Council resolutionsrelating to Iraq's invasion of the State of Kuwait. TheSecretary-General himself participated in the selection ofthe members of those panels  eminent  internationallyknown persons who were efficient and neutral experts. Thepanels met for a period of two months. They also soughtthe expert advice of many specialists and heard the viewsand presentations of many witnesses. Following extensivemeetings and intense deliberations  the panellists reached aset of conclusions and recommendations that I shall brieflysummarize as follows.First  the panel concerned with disarmament concludedthat there were still a number of important and seriousmatters that had not yet been resolved. It emphasized theneed for the return of the inspection teams to Iraq as soonas possible under an integrated and reinforced monitoringand verification system based on relevant Security Councilresolutions.Secondly  with regard to the humanitarian situation thepanel submitted several constructive proposals andrecommendations which  if implemented  would improvethe humanitarian conditions in Iraq. Perhaps the mostimportant recommendation was the call to improve theoperational mechanisms of the oil-for-food programme.Also  the panel invited the Government of Iraq to ensureequitable distribution of humanitarian goods and to pay dueattention to meeting the needs of the vulnerable groups ofthe Iraqi population.Thirdly  the panel concerned with Kuwaiti and third-country prisoners of war and the return of stolen propertyto Kuwait  the panel thought that in regard to the prisonersof war issue  cooperation by Iraq with the InternationalCommittee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the TripartiteCommission had so far been below expectations. The panelwas not satisfied with the Iraqi explanations of why Iraqhad failed to provide information on the files submitted toit by the ICRC. The panel urged the Government of Iraq toreconsider its decision not to participate in the TripartiteCommission and its technical subcommittee. With regard tothe return of Kuwaiti property  the panel concluded thatIraq had not fully complied with paragraph 2 of SecurityCouncil resolution 686 (1991)  which demands that Iraqreturn all stolen property to Kuwait.Although those panels were established by theSecurity Council mainly to explore the possibility ofmitigating the impact of the sanctions regime andimproving the humanitarian conditions in Iraq  it is deeplyregrettable that Iraq itself has declined to participate intheir work. Iraq has also rejected the conclusions andrecommendations reached by these panels. In this context the Secretary-General  in paragraph 81 of his report(A/54/1) on the work of the Organization submitted to thecurrent session of the Assembly  referred to Iraq's failureto fulfil its obligations and set the humanitarianrequirements that Iraq must meet. The Secretary-Generalstates:“Relations with Iraq took a turn for the worse duringthe year  despite a brief period of compliance withthe Memorandum of Understanding signed byDeputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz and myself inFebruary 1998. In the face of continuing Iraqi non-compliance  the use of force by two Member Statesand the division in the Security Council thatfollowed it was predictable. Our principal demandsremain unchanged  however: Iraq must fully complywith all relevant Security Council resolutions; theinternational community must be assured that Iraqno longer has the capacity to develop or useweapons of mass destruction; missing Kuwaiti andthird country nationals must be accounted for; andKuwait's irreplaceable archives must be returned.Meanwhile  the people of Iraq continue to suffer theeffects of sanctions”.For purely humanitarian reasons enjoined by ourIslamic religion and by all other religious as well asinternational principles and norms  the State of Kuwaiturges Iraq to put an immediate end to the plight ofKuwaiti and third-country prisoners  returning them totheir families or fully accounting for them. Iraqiinsistence that there are no such prisoners inside Iraq andthat these people should be considered as missing personsis not an answer. What is at stake are the lives of people who should be treated as trusts in our collectiveconscience. Since last January  Iraq has been boycottingthe meetings of the Tripartite Commission and itstechnical subcommittee  bodies that operate under theaegis of the ICRC with the objective of locating andidentifying those innocent victims.The following questions arise here. Is Iraq indeedserious in dealing with this important humanitarianmatter? Does Iraq's attitude show any good faith? Wouldanyone safely claim that Iraq is working on implementing19relevant Security Council resolutions while boycotting themeetings of ICRC-sponsored humanitarian bodies?Only internationally established institutions can handlethis issue. We believe that earnest and sincere cooperationwith the Tripartite Commission is the key to the resolutionof this humanitarian problem  which really does not tolerateany further delay.An intensive effort is currently under way within theSecurity Council to pass a new resolution related to theremaining obligations on Iraq  taking into consideration therecommendations made by the three aforementionedevaluation panels. While Kuwait concurs with the goodintentions underlying the current efforts by members of theSecurity Council  which take the form of a draft resolutionput forward by the United Kingdom and the Netherlands together with some other related views  we would like toreaffirm the important need to maintain the unity of theSecurity Council in dealing with this issue. Also  wedemand assurances that Iraq will remain committed to allthe requirements of Security Council resolution 687 (1991) which should be treated as one indivisible political andlegal unit.In the meantime  Kuwait reiterates its full sympathywith the suffering of our brotherly people of Iraq. TheGovernment of Iraq alone bears full responsibility for theperpetuation of those hardships. Kuwait  for its part confirms its support for and endorsement of all SecurityCouncil resolutions aimed at easing those travails throughthe oil-for-food programme. Furthermore  we wish toreiterate our firm commitment to the need for thepreservation of the independence  sovereignty  unity andterritorial integrity of Iraq.Out of concern for and interest in bolstering theunderpinnings of security and stability in our region  theState of Kuwait confirms its support for all efforts aimed atresolving the dispute between the United Arab Emirates andthe Islamic Republic of Iran over the Emirates' three islandsby peaceful means. These would include the referral of thematter to the International Court of Justice. In themeantime  Kuwait welcomes the willingness of the friendlyIslamic Republic of Iran to start direct negotiations with theUnited Arab Emirates. We hope the tripartite ministerialcommission formed by the Cooperation Council of the GulfArab States will be able to initiate working mechanisms forbeginning direct negotiations that could lead to the peacefulresolution of the dispute over the three Emirates' islands:the Lesser and Greater Tunbs and Abu Musa. This avenuewould indeed contribute to confidence building and to thepromotion of security and stability throughout the region.It would also expand and deepen cooperation between theIslamic Republic of Iran and all States in the region.Kuwait welcomes the Sharm El-SheikhMemorandum recently signed between the PalestinianAuthority and Israel  which sets forth specific steps forthe implementation of the Wye River accords. However we demand that the new Administration in Israel do itspart on reviving the peace process and resumingnegotiations on all tracks. Israel must demonstrate honestcommitment to the principles and operational frameworkof the overall peace process  which is anchored inSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)and the land-for-peace formula. This includes fulfilmentof all obligations and agreements signed with thePalestinian Authority within the peace process  with aview to reinstating all legitimate Arab rights  includingthe restoration to the brotherly Palestinian people of theirfull national rights  especially the establishment of theirindependent State on their national territory  withJerusalem as its capital. The Government of Israel mustalso cease forthwith its illegitimate settlement-buildingand land-confiscation policy. It should also end itsunilateral measures to create de facto realities on theground  especially in the city of Jerusalem. Furthermore Palestinian refugees must be reassured of their right toreturn to their homes in accordance with relevant UnitedNations resolutions.We are baffled by  and accordingly reject  thereferences  declarations and insinuations recently madethat promote the notion of resettling the Palestinianrefugees outside their own ancestral homeland. Such anotion represents a stark violation of the fundamentalprinciples of international law  United Nations resolutionsand the inalienable right to self-determination.Furthermore  a resettlement plan would be aninfringement on the sovereignty of other States and aninterference in their domestic affairs.Israel's withdrawal from the occupied Syrian territoryin the Golan Heights back to the 4 June 1967 lines isindeed the litmus test of Israel's genuine commitment tothe land-for-peace principle. Moreover  we demand thatIsrael end once and for all its repeated acts of aggressionagainst the sovereignty and independence of our sisterState  the Lebanese Republic. We stress the need for animmediate Israeli pull-out from southern Lebanon andWest Bekaa in accordance with Security Councilresolution 425 (1978)  which must be implementedwithout any restrictions or conditions. In this context 20Kuwait emphatically notes that the Syrian and Lebanesetracks must be recognized as organically interconnected ifa just and lasting peace is to be established.In addition  while Kuwait endorses and appreciates theefforts of the two sponsors of the peace process  togetherwith the European Union  to revitalize that process  we callupon all of them to redouble their efforts at this criticalstage of the peace process.At the regional level  and given the long-standinghistorical and human bonds  as well as the close economicinterests fashioned by the geographic location of theArabian Gulf region and its proximity to India andPakistan  with which the State of Kuwait maintains friendlyrelations  we appeal to both countries to resolve theirbilateral dispute over Jammu and Kashmir by peacefulmeans and in accordance with United Nations resolutions.We sincerely hope that India and Pakistan will engage in ameaningful dialogue and draw on the deep and richreservoir of wisdom available to the leaderships on bothsides of the divide. We think that their economic resourceswould better be utilized for the development and welfare oftheir peoples and for enhancing security and stability in thatsensitive region. Mutual confidence and cooperation shouldprevail over intense rivalry in the arena of terror.Kuwait welcomes the outcome of the popularconsultation held under United Nations supervision in EastTimor late last month. The ballot gave the East Timoresethe chance to determine their future freely  with theguarantee and cooperation of the friendly Government ofIndonesia. Kuwait has followed with sadness and pain thebloody events that have taken place in East Timor.However  we welcome the Security Council resolution toestablish a multinational force to put an end to violence andto restore security and public order to that Territory. Wewish that force full success in its mission. We also callupon neighbouring countries to respect the mandate of theforce and to help the people of East Timor fulfil theirlegitimate aspirations. In this regard  Kuwait wishes to givecredit to the friendly Government of Indonesia for itscommitment and efforts at putting an end to the violence the killing and destruction that ravaged East Timor in thewake of the referendum. Credit is also due Indonesia foragreeing to the formation and peaceful reception of themultinational force.Still on the international scene  Kuwait welcomes thepeace accord reached between the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia onKosovo as a first step towards the resolution of the disputeand the return of displaced persons to their homes inKosovo. This will eventually put an end to the conflictand restore peace and security to the people  who havethe right to live in freedom and dignity.The Balkan crisis  which was precipitated by theFederal Republic of Yugoslavia  has demonstrated onceagain that the United Nations role is indispensable to themaintenance of international peace and security and forlending legitimacy and credibility to any solutionsreached  be it in a regional context or an internationalone. Kuwait supports and encourages the United Nationsto continue its role until all aspects of the crisis havedefinitively resolved.The world today is living through a communicationsrevolution that has helped to shorten distances betweenStates and to speed up global connections  thus turningour planet into a village where people instantly react toevents that take place anywhere across the globe.International economic integration has become part andparcel of development plans and programmes that aim atachieving progress and prosperity for nations. Unilateralisolationist policies have become relics of the past anduntenable under a new world order that is becomingincreasingly and rapidly universal.The new order  known as “globalization”  requiresjoint efforts in order to lay down the principles regulations and arrangements that seek to ensure progressand well-being by creating new prospects for the flow offinancial and technical aid to help national States projecttheir ability to contribute to the building of a better futurefor humanity. Hence  developed countries are expected toincrease their economic and technical assistance todeveloping States and to expand the exchange ofinformation and technical know-how in an attempt tonarrow the ever-widening gap in the fields of technologyand communications.Moreover  international efforts must be invigoratedin the face of a new emerging challenge posed by thedwindling sources of fresh water. Water reserves shouldbe utilized on a just basis and with a sense of sharing inthe use of this main artery of life itself. Bearing thatvision in mind  Kuwait is pursuing its efforts to supportdevelopment projects in many developing countries. TheKuwait Fund for Economic Development offers long-termfinancial loans at concessional interest rates. Also  mycountry contributes  within its means  to manydevelopment projects and programmes that are jointlyfinanced by international financial institutions  regional21organizations and the United Nations agencies. Kuwaitintends to pursue this path out of its conviction thatdevelopment is the key to progress and a main incentive forbuilding security and stability. Furthermore  reaching outwith assistance to those in need is a moral obligation onthose who are more privileged. This would indeedstrengthen international cooperation  openness and mutualrespect among nations.Now  as our world is about to bid farewell to thecurrent century  good-hearted and decent people nurturevarious hopes and ambitions for serving humanity andbuilding a better life on this small planet. We all hope tocreate and conserve a safe and healthy environment  free ofthreats to the security of all life. As we look down the roadto the future  we can hopefully see a fulfilment of thedivine prophecy of justice for humanity when we heedGod's words  calling on us to feed the hungry and to ensurepeace of mind and security for all human beings. We wishworld leaders who will be assembled in this Hall inSeptember next year success in defining a road map for thefuture  in setting a new vision and in renewing our commonresolve to establish peace  justice and development for allpeoples of the world."
"93",3930,"LAO",54,1999,"The unanimous election of Mr. Gurirab to the presidency ofthe General Assembly at this fifty-fourth session is a warmtribute to Namibia and its heroic people  who are well-known for their victorious struggle against foreigndomination and for their tireless defence of the principlesof the Charter of the United Nations. As I am familiar withhis skill and broad experience of international relations  Ibelieve that under his wise leadership the work of theGeneral Assembly at this session will be crowned withsuccess.I should also like to take this opportunity to expressmy sincere congratulations to Mr. Kofi Annan  theSecretary-General of our Organization  for his work toreform and revitalize the United Nations  as well as for hissteadfast commitment in the service of peace anddevelopment throughout the world.As this century of rapid change fades away  we areconfronted with challenges  but also presented with manyopportunities. Globalization has become a problemthroughout the world. While technological progress and theglobalization of production and finance have broughtprosperity and modernity to many countries  particularly inthe developed world  the great majority of people are stillliving in conditions of persistent poverty. The protection ofthe environment  the eradication of poverty and the struggleagainst drugs and all forms of terrorism have also becomeurgent problems requiring concerted action at global level.In the face of this situation it is more urgent than everfor the international community to adopt concrete collectivemeasures to enable the United Nations to devote more of itsresources to social and economic development in order tobuild a better life for all the world’s peoples  in particularfor the poorest among them. If it is to take up thesechallenges  the United Nations  as the only universalinternational organization  needs the capacity to act and toadapt to a new and changing world situation.With the end of the bipolar world  many countries especially developing countries  had hoped that thenuclear era would end as well. Here  the Lao People’sDemocratic Republic  along with the other countriesmembers of the Association of South-East Asian Nations(ASEAN)  signed the Treaty on the Southeast AsiaNuclear Weapon-Free Zone  which entered into force in1997. It also endorsed the joint declaration of 9 June1998  subscribed to by the Foreign Ministers of Brazil Egypt  Ireland  Mexico  New Zealand  Slovenia  SouthAfrica and Sweden  the objective of which was torevitalize nuclear non-proliferation and disarmamentefforts. Such positive steps will help us together graduallyto build a world free of nuclear weapons  thus creatingmeaningful guarantees for the survival of mankind.To guarantee peace  to promote the development ofall countries  and to adapt to a new world situation  theOrganization must be reformed so that it can fulfil itsmandate and achieve its purposes. Here in the UnitedNations  all countries have equal standing  in conformitywith the principle of the sovereign equality of States. Andhere in the United Nations  we extol the principles of thenon-use or threat of use of force against the independenceor sovereignty of States  of the peaceful settlement ofdisputes  and of non-interference in the internal affairs ofother States.In speaking of United Nations reform we cannotpass in silence by the delicate work under way in theOpen-ended Working Group on the Question of EquitableRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of theSecurity Council and Other Matters Related to theSecurity Council  where a number of interesting initiativeshave been put forward. Our position on this matter is wellknown  and was set out at the fifty-first session of theGeneral Assembly: we favour an increase in both thepermanent and the non-permanent membership  in linewith the principle of equitable geographical distributionand taking into account the prominence of the country inquestion. As part of the effort to attain that goal  somecountries — such as  in particular  Japan  Germany andIndia — could become permanent members of arestructured Security Council. As we all know  thequestion of Council reform is not a simple one. We needto be patient  to continue the debate and to take advantageof the momentum we have created  so as to attain the3goal of giving that organ greater transparency  legitimacyand  above all  credibility.True to its consistent policy of peace  friendship andcooperation  the Lao People’s Democratic Republicconsiders that the use of force against a sovereignindependent State without Security Council authorization no matter what the pretext  runs counter to international lawand the Charter of the United Nations. We believe that allconflicts  no matter how complex  should be resolved onlythrough negotiations.Convinced of the importance of peace in the MiddleEast  my country is pleased that Israel and the PalestineLiberation Organization have resumed serious negotiations which led to the signing of the Sharm el-SheikhMemorandum on 4 September 1999. It is essential for theparties directly concerned to continue those negotiations inorder to settle their problems on the basis of existingresolutions and agreements. This would open the path topeace  cooperation and peaceful coexistence among thepeoples of the region.Among the glaring injustices in the world  we cannotforget the economic  trade and financial blockade that hasbeen waged for more than 40 years against the Republic ofCuba. We consider that the United States ought to put anend to that operation  which runs counter to the presentworld trend towards international economic cooperation fordevelopment.Peace on the Korean peninsula remains fragile. Weappeal to all the countries concerned to show maximalrestraint and to continue their dialogue with a view torestoring mutual understanding  and together to seeksolutions that would meet the aspirations of the Koreanpeople for the peaceful reunification of the two parts ofKorea  and that would contribute to the consolidation ofpeace  stability and cooperation in the region.Since 9 July 1999 we have seen renewed tension inthe Taiwan Strait. The Lao People’s Democratic Republicreaffirms its consistent position that Taiwan is an integraland inalienable part of China  and that the Government ofthe People’s Republic of China is the sole legal andlegitimate representative of the entire Chinese people.Over the past two years  the financial crisis affectingthe whole of South-East Asia has quickly made itself felt to varying degrees  in other regions — indeed  throughoutthe world. In some countries there are today signs of aneconomic upturn  but nothing indicates that the worldeconomy is yet on the road to solid recovery. In the lightof that crisis and of the fact that countries large andsmall  industrialized and developing  are becomingincreasingly interdependent  the international communitymust work together to find an effective solution to thecrisis  to promote worldwide growth  and to bring aboutsustained social and economic development.Since the 1995 Copenhagen World Summit forSocial Development  the struggle against impoverishmenthas been bolstered. But it is clear that developingcountries  especially the least developed among them cannot accomplish this huge task on their own andwithout the necessary support and assistance of theinternational community. In that context  we consider thatthe special follow-up meeting that will take place in 2000will give the international community an opportunity toreview the situation and to take the measures necessary toattain the noble goals set at the Summit.For years  the special problems of landlockeddeveloping countries have been discussed at variousinternational conferences and meetings. Although manymeasures have been taken both at the national and at theinternational levels  those problems are still far frombeing resolved.The President took the Chair.The Lao People’s Democratic Republic  which hasthe honour of chairing the Group of LandlockedDeveloping Countries  is cooperating actively with theother member countries to establish and maintain aneffective and self-sustaining system of transport andtransit. This huge task requires support and assistancefrom the entire international community in order for ourcountries to meet our particular needs. It is more thanurgent that the recommendations adopted last August inNew York at the fourth meeting of governmental expertsfrom landlocked and transit developing countries andrepresentatives of donor countries  and financial anddevelopment institutions  be wholly translated into realityas soon as possible.In the Lao People’s Democratic Republic over thepast year  the multi-ethnic Lao people has strongly unifieditself and is actively working for national development particularly in the area of agricultural production. Thishas made it possible for us not only to achieve self-sufficiency in rice production  but also to have somethingof a surplus in reserve. This achievement has helpedsoften the effects of the economic and financial crisis in4the region. Throughout the country  political stability andsocial harmony  important conditions allowing us topromote sustained national socio-economic development inkeeping with the policy of renewal  continue to be ensured.At the international level  the Lao People’s DemocraticRepublic is continuing its efforts to strengthen and extendits external relations and cooperation  particularly withneighbouring countries  and it is cooperating with othermembers of the Association of South-East Asian Nations inthe implementation of the Hanoi Plan of Action and of theVision 2020 for the progress and the prosperity of theregion.The question of drugs continues to be a major concernin the daily life of South-East Asia. In this respect  myGovernment has made great efforts to reduce the annualproduction of opium and is carrying out a vigorous battleagainst drugs  the results of which have been greatlyappreciated by the international community. At this time  incooperation with the United Nations International DrugControl Programme (UNDCP)  we are working out astrategy for a substantial eradication of opium productionover the next six years. In this connection  I appeal to theinternational community to contribute to the Fund UNDCPin order to achieve those objectives.Saving future generations from the scourges of war poverty  hunger and sickness remains an essential objectiveenshrined in the United Nations Charter. Aware of thishighest goal  the Lao People’s Democratic Republic willspare no effort to make its modest yet positive contribution."
"94",3973,"LBN",54,1999,"It is my pleasure  Mr. President  to congratulate you onyour election as President of the General Assembly at itsfifty-fourth session. We are confident that your efforts andexpertise will ensure the success of this session.I should also like to thank your predecessor Mr. Didier Opertti  for having successfully conducted thework of the fifty-third session. Furthermore  I would beremiss if I failed to express our thanks and appreciation tothe Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for his dedicationto the pursuit of world peace and stability and for hiscontinuous efforts to enhance the credibility of theOrganization through the settlement of disputes  old andnew.This session is unique not only because it is the lastGeneral Assembly session of the century that witnessed thebirth of the United Nations  but also because it coincideswith the emergence of serious trends that call for by-passing some of the basic principles on which the UnitedNations was built. They advocate the establishment of anew world order  one to whose requirements the UnitedNations must conform rather than being part of the widerand more comprehensive United Nations framework.A case in point is the call to acknowledge theprinciple of relative sovereignty or the obligation tointerfere where necessary in the internal affairs of States  orto marginalize the role of the Security Council  which is themain tool for the maintenance of international peace andsecurity.Some States believe that the establishment of a newworld order is a result of decisive  historic developments invision and concept. Others  however  feel that it is no morethan a mere desire on the part of some to impose ideascommensurate with the drastic change that has taken placein the balance of power on the international scene. In ouropinion  this issue requires further deliberations anddiscussions.Through dialogue we  the peoples and countries of theworld  can arrive at a unanimous understanding of thequestions at hand  and in this way secure the necessaryassurance in our pursuit of the common good and securityof humanity. History has shown that no regime or systemcan endure and prevail unless it is built on justice andequality. It cannot be selective  nor can it pursue a policyof double standards. It cannot assert its authority oversome and remain indifferent to injustices done to others.It cannot give generously to some and persistently depriveothers. Any system that seeks to maintain internationalpeace and security must depend on preventive diplomacyto preempt problems long before their onset andexacerbation.Furthermore  it should create an effective mechanismfor peacemaking  one that contributes seriously tobuilding and safeguarding peace. It is essential that wetackle the root causes of problems  not merely theirviolent manifestations.We must also persevere in our pursuit of worldeconomic and social justice. We should not be contentwith defending stability from a restrictively politicalperspective.In any event  no world order  whether old or new can condone  for example  the occupation of the lands ofothers by force. It cannot allow acts of aggression to becommitted against people and property  nor should itsubject civilians to various forms of arbitrary practices.In March 1978  Israel undertook a unilateral act ofaggression against Lebanon. It occupied one tenth ofLebanese territory. In the face of this aggression  theSecurity Council adopted resolution 425 (1978) and calledupon Israel to withdraw its forces from all Lebaneseterritories immediately and unconditionally.Even though more than 21 years have passed sincethe adoption of that resolution by the Security Council  ithas not been enforced. Israel continues to occupycherished parts of southern Lebanon and the WesternBekaa valley. Throughout those years  Israel hascontinued its almost daily acts of aggression againstLebanon and its people.In 1982  Israel's hostility peaked when its forcesinvaded Lebanese territory  reaching the capital  Beirut after a long siege. After a partial withdrawal fromLebanon  Israel resorted to the current scorched-earthpolicy. Throughout the month of July 1993  Israelbombed dozens of Lebanese villages and towns fromland  air and sea positions. It inflicted heavy propertydamage  killed and wounded more than 250 civilians and9forced more than 300 000 Lebanese out of their homes andvillages.In April 1996  continuing its policy of comprehensivedestruction and bombardment  Israel intentionally massacred102 civilians in the village of Qana  using incendiarybombs. Most of our fallen martyrs were women  childrenand elderly men who sadly thought they could find a safehaven in the premises of the United Nations forces insouthern Lebanon  but alas  Israel did not hesitate to violatethe sanctity of those premises.Soon after  an understanding was reached for aceasefire and for protecting civilians. This became knownlater as the April Understanding of 1996. A group wasestablished to monitor the implementation of thatagreement  with the membership of Lebanon  Syria andIsrael and under the co-chairmanship of France and theUnited States of America.Allow me  on this occasion  to express ourappreciation to the group for the useful and restraining roleit has played pending the realization of the full andunconditional Israeli withdrawal from the Lebaneseterritories.Unfortunately  this has not prevented Israel fromrepeatedly and seriously violating the terms of the AprilUnderstanding. Israel has lately launched yet another attackagainst Lebanese civilians and infrastructure. On 24 and 25June 1999  Israeli warplanes destroyed two power plantsand three bridges  causing a total blackout in Lebanon.Communications were jeopardized  extensive propertydamage was incurred and many people were killed. ThisIsraeli act of aggression has had direct and indirect negativeeffects on the social and economic life of Lebanon untilthis very moment.Israel persists in its oppressive arbitrary practicesagainst civilians in the territories that are still under itsoccupation. Civilians are kidnapped  detained  tortured orkilled  displaced or expelled.We in Lebanon are tirelessly working with the UnitedNations and other humanitarian forums to put an end tothese acts and to prevent their recurrence  the most recentof which was the imposition of siege on the village of Aitaal-Sha b and other villages in the south. Agricultural cropswere destroyed and many of the residents were kidnapped expelled or detained.On 14 July 1999  Lebanon celebrated Lebaneseprisoners' day. From this rostrum  we again call for theredoubling of efforts and for bringing more pressure tobear on Israel to release all the Lebanese detaineeslanguishing in Israeli prisons as hostages.Israel's Supreme Court has acknowledged andcondoned holding these prisoners. Some of these peopleare incarcerated in al-Khiyam detention camp insideLebanese occupied territories. There are many elderly andsick among them who are often denied visits and thehumanitarian care usually provided by the InternationalCommittee of the Red Cross. This is a breach of theFourth Geneva Convention concerning the protection ofcivilians in time of war.On this occasion  Lebanon emphasizes once again itsright to be compensated for the loss of life and for theproperty damage that has been inflicted upon it for manyyears as a result of Israel's acts of aggression andarbitrary practices against its civilians.Lebanon recalls the need for the unconditionalimplementation of resolution 425 (1978). Pending theenforcement of that resolution  it is only natural that theLebanese people stand united in resisting Israelioccupation. It is also just and natural that they uphold thelegitimacy of the Lebanese resistance  which is after allan embodiment of the faith in one's homeland and ahighly evolved form of struggle for freedom. Moreover the Lebanese resistance constitutes a consecration of thelegitimate right of self-defense included in the terms ofreference of the April Understanding of 1996.Israel repeatedly circumvents the mandate of theUnited Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). Forour part  we highly value the positive and constructiverole that UNIFIL plays. On this occasion  we would liketo express once again our appreciation and gratitude tothe Force for the noble sacrifices it has made in fulfillingits mandate under the most arduous circumstances.Lebanon is certainly committed to the Middle Eastpeace process. Lebanon stands ready  given theinseparability of the Syrian and Lebanese tracks  toresume the negotiations from the point where they left offin 1996 and in accordance with the terms of reference ofthe 1991 Madrid Conference. Our ultimate objective is toreach a just  comprehensive and permanent peace in theMiddle East on the basis of the resolutions ofinternational legitimacy. Lebanon reiterates here itscommitment to resolution 425 (1978)  which does not call10on the parties concerned to negotiate but doesunequivocally call upon Israel to withdraw immediately andunconditionally from all Lebanese territories.At a time when serious prospects have appeared on thehorizon for the resumption of the peace negotiations  anddespite what might be said about the art of negotiation  therecent declarations by senior Israeli officials do not augerwell for the peace process. Nor do they expressly indicatethe presence of presumably good intentions. They do notleave room for us to conclude that there is a genuine desireon the part of the Israeli side to establish peace based onjustice. All of this prompts us to view with caution theconditions set out for the resumption of the peace processat the present stage  to say the least.Israel's intransigence becomes all the more apparent inthe light of the statements made by its Prime MinisterBarak. In those statements  Mr. Barak stressed several no's namely  no to a return to the 1967 borders  no to thepartition of Jerusalem  no to dismantling the settlements and no to the return of Palestinian refugees. Mr. Barakrepeated his position when he declared at his recent meetingwith President Clinton that the Palestinian refugees shall notreturn to their homeland and that they should stay in thecountries where they presently reside. The naturalprerequisites of peace cannot be reconciled withMr. Barak's no's. Those prerequisites are based on justiceand have been endorsed by international legitimacy. Theyrequire the following elements.Israel should withdraw unconditionally from Lebanon in accordance with the provisions of Security Councilresolution 425 (1978).All of the Golan Heights should be returned to Syria to the borders of 4 June 1967  as has already beendiscussed and agreed upon.The Palestinian people should be able to regain theirinalienable rights. Those rights include their right to self-determination  to the establishment of their State on theirnational soil  with Jerusalem as its capital  and their right toreturn to the lands in Palestine from which they wereuprooted.On this occasion Lebanon would like to draw theattention of the international community to the fact that itis impossible for a peaceful settlement to be achieved andfor the long-awaited peace to endure and prevail unless thePalestinian refugees  particularly the hundreds of thousandswhom Lebanon has hosted on its soil  are allowed to returnto their homeland. From this international rostrum Lebanon resonates its people's unanimous andunequivocal rejection of settling Palestinian refugees onits territories. This unanimity was consecrated in theLebanese Constitution  which is the cornerstone of thenational covenant. We see it as necessary to drawattention to the danger of approaching this question froma merely economic and social perspective while ignoringits political dimension. That political dimension is  inessence  the core of the injustice that befell thePalestinians who were displaced from their homeland.This unanimous position is shared by both the Lebaneseand the Palestinians in Lebanon.Lebanon therefore renews its call for theinternational community to shoulder its responsibility infull. It must come up with a just and equitable settlementthat addresses the issue of the final status of thePalestinian refugees  in accordance with theinternationally agreed principles that govern similarsituations. Those principles  it should be recalled  wererecently applied in Kosovo. Settling Palestinian refugeesin Lebanon  which is equally rejected by the Palestiniansand the Lebanese  would create  if carried out  a potentialhotbed of tension that would jeopardize the security of theMiddle East region and its stability as well.We view positively the opportunity for progress inthe peace process. The recent visit by United StatesSecretary of State Madame Madeleine Albright to somecountries in the region was an acknowledgment of theresponsibilities of her country and the influence that thatvisit can bring to bear on the parties to the conflict. Forour part  we are keen on the role that the United Statesand the Russian Federation can play in the pursuit of ajust and comprehensive peace. We believe that they canboth provide the necessary guarantees for the successfulimplementation of the prospective agreement.We equally count on an active European role in boththe political process and the development of the region aswell. This applies to the negotiations for the settlement ofthe conflict and to the subsequent stage. We particularlyapplaud the supportive role of France  on which we canalways rely.We would like on this occasion to thank thePresidency of the European Union  currently held byFinland. Our thanks go in particular to Ms. TarjaHalonen  the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Finland  whorecently visited Lebanon as part of her visit to the region.Ms. Halonen expressed the European Union's readiness tocontribute to the search for a just  peaceful andcomprehensive solution to the Middle East question.Lebanon was among the first countries to condemn theIraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. It supported allthe Security Council resolutions adopted in this regard. Weexpress our solidarity with sisterly Kuwait on the questionof the release of Kuwaiti detainees and prisoners of war.We also support Kuwait's claim of sovereignty over all ofits territories and resources. Releasing the Kuwaiti prisonerscan contribute to the improvement of inter-Arab relations.At the same time  Lebanon hopes that the embargo imposedon the brotherly people of Iraq be lifted. They  too  areentitled to live in dignity and to enjoy prosperity andsecurity.Lebanon attaches special importance to the question ofconsolidating the security and stability of the Arab Gulfregion. We applaud the efforts made by Gulf CooperationCouncil to eliminate the causes of tension and to settleexisting disputes by peaceful means in the context of goodfaith and good neighbourly relations. Those efforts wereundertaken to settle  among other things  the disputebetween the United Arab Emirates and the Islamic Republicof Iran over three islands.The United Nations is the sum total of the collectivewill of its Member States. It has been unable to dischargeall of its obligations in the context of the settlement ofprotracted and new disputes. It has also been unable torestore peace to many of the tension-ridden regions of theworld. It is appropriate to proceed with the reformprogramme envisaged for the international Organization  asoutlined by Secretary-General Kofi Annan in 1997. Thiswill enable the United Nations to respond to the acceleratedpace of international relations in the political  economic andsocial fields.But despite all the risks and pitfalls  our internationalOrganization is still a unique international authority. It isthe proper forum in which to engage in a balanced andobjective discussion that will lead to at least somenecessary solutions. It is heartening indeed to recall that theOrganization has had some outstanding and promisingachievements in several fields of human endeavour. Theseinclude achievements in the fields of human rights  therights of the child and women's rights  as well asenvironment and development. They also include theprogressive development of international law and theenriching of the body of international law by theestablishment of new institutions such as the InternationalCriminal Court.It is pertinent to mention in this respect that Lebanonhas a time-honoured culture that is deeply rooted inhistory. Our country has been an integral part of theinternational scene  acting and reacting to it positively since it joined the Organization as a founding Member.Because of its openness and intellectual wealth  it hasalways taken the lead in responding to the requirementsof progress at various levels.Lebanon is seeking to join the World TradeOrganization (WTO). It has been working steadily todevelop its economy and rationalize its financial policies.By so doing  it will be able to bring these policies in linewith the standards and regulations drawn up by WTO.This will ultimately pave the way for a world economicpartnership in trade and development on the basis ofmutual benefit and equality among States.Lebanon attaches great importance to environmentalissues and has created a ministry for this specific purpose.Lebanon joins in the international efforts currently underway to resolve these problems. It calls upon powerfulStates to honour the commitments they entered into underthe international conventions concluded for this purpose.Lebanon also believes that the phenomenon ofglobalization has become a reality that is imbued withboth positive and negative elements  which in turninfluence the cultures and economies of Member States.In our opinion  the United Nations is the proper forum toaddress and check the repercussions of this phenomenon.It is in fact the mature offspring of the 1940s version ofglobalization.Lebanon has always been firm in its commitment tothe principles of democracy and freedom and faithful toits obligations under the Charter of the United Nations. Ithas always honoured the decisions and resolutions of theinternational Organization and its various bodies andconferences. We have built in our capital  Beirut  abeautiful headquarters building for its subsidiary bodies.We believe in its mission and are committed to itspurposes.Lebanon is currently devoting every effort tocomplete the process of reconstruction and to consolidateand rationalize its institutions. We are steadily working onestablishing the rule of law. Our unique experience withcoexistence  built on moderation  tolerance and unity in asound national environment  is an example to befollowed. Lebanon is determined to regain thedistinguished position it once held in the region and the12world. It will remain true to its Arab identity  with all theconsequences and dimensions that this entails.Lebanon is a small country on the east coast of theMediterranean. For 5 000 years  it has hosted successivecivilizations. Lebanon influenced these civilizations and wasinfluenced by them. We shall take the lead in giving  oncewe have recovered our national soil thanks to the struggleof our sons and with the effective support of theinternational community."
"95",4020,"LBR",54,1999,"On the occasion of the fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly  marking our lastmeeting in this century  I am humbled to address this bodyon behalf of President Charles Ghankay Taylor  theGovernment and the people of Liberia.It gives me great pleasure to congratulate the Presidentmost cordially on his election to preside over this fifty-fourth session and to assure him of my delegation’s supportand cooperation during the session. When we giveconsideration to the scope of his diplomatic experience  theexpanse of his wisdom and the integrity of his heart  wecan only conclude that this is his hour  when hisqualifications bespeak eloquently his ability to preside overthe Assembly.I recall my country’s involvement in the struggle forNamibia’s independence  and I am proud that  just about adecade after achieving independence through the sustaineddiplomacy of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) andthe United Nations  Namibia is serving in such a highcapacity. Significantly  it presides over the agenda of thelast session of the General Assembly of the twentiethcentury  where constructive discourse on new paradigms forpeace  development and social progress will shape the newmillennium.I pay tribute to Mr. Didier Opertti of Uruguay. Wehave witnessed his many attributes  especially his wisestewardship of the fifty-third session  which has laid thebasis for this one. I therefore offer to Mr. Opertti bestwishes in his future callings.For many reasons  I would like to express specialappreciation and gratitude to the Secretary-General  Mr.Kofi Annan. My focus is on his innovative leadership atthe helm of this world body. In particular  I note that onlytwo years since his introduction of system-wide reformsthe Organization has been geared in the direction ofrendering improved and better services and betterhandling of world situations. We recollect the happymoments of his visit in July to Liberia  which gavefurther testimony to the Secretary-General’s commitmentto solving the problems of Africa. The Government andpeople of Liberia are deeply proud that the UnitedNations leadership has focused on the search for sustainedpeace in our region  especially in the work of the UnitedNations Peace-building Support Office in Liberia  whichhas been instrumental in the consolidation of peace inLiberia.We heartily welcome the admission of three newmembers: the Kingdom of Tonga  the Republic of Nauruand the Republic of Kiribati. We look forward to theircontribution to the ideals of the United Nations.It is encouraging to note that the inflexible attitudesgenerated by the cold war have been superseded bydialogue. For the promise of a better future  innovativeand alternative efforts are required in all areas of humanendeavour. Accordingly  the world is experiencing atransformation in international relations. At the dawn ofa new millennium  we are moving from confrontation tocooperation. Nation States continue their search withinsubregional organizations for the stabilization of civilorder  the elimination of human suffering and themaintenance of peace. Liberia reaffirms its commitmentto the concept of world peace that is sustainable incontext and global in approach. Hence  we believe thatequal treatment should be accorded to all conflicts wherever they might occur.Liberia takes a dim view of the disparity in theresources committed by the Security Council to theconflicts in Kosovo and East Timor  on the one hand  andthe Democratic Republic of the Congo  on the other.Regarding the Democratic Republic of the Congo  Liberiacommends President Chiluba of Zambia for his mediatoryrole  which led to the signing of the Lusaka Agreementby all the concerned parties. We endorse his recentrequest to the Security Council that it authorize andsupport the deployment of a peacekeeping force in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  with an appropriatemandate.32Following the relaxation of tension in internationalrelations  there should be a renewed determination on thepart of us all to search for creative avenues to resolve civilconflicts and promote regional  political and economiccooperation for the prosperity of all peoples.At the onset of his assumption of national leadership following free and fair elections  President Charles Taylorembarked upon sound programmes aimed at achievingnational reconciliation  the resettlement of all refugees andinternally displaced persons  the rehabilitation and thereintegration of ex-combatants and reconstruction. Not onlyis our Government making every effort to achieve thesespecific goals; we are also committed to improving thequality of life of our people.In this regard  President Taylor’s Administrationremains committed to three cardinal principles: ensuringnational unity through national reconciliation  resettlementand reconstruction; good governance through accountability efficiency and transparency; and the guaranteed protectionof human rights.Regarding good governance  I should like to state thatmechanisms for revenue collection have improved andexpenditure has been strictly controlled to ensure prudentfiscal and monetary management and public accountability.Our human rights record has improved tremendously andremains the focal point in our continued efforts to meet thechallenges of national reconciliation. In furtherance of thisobjective  President Taylor holds regular consultations withleaders of the opposition  civil society  religious groups andthe media on matters of national interest.I should also mention that in response to PresidentTaylor’s policy of inclusion  opposition political leaders inMay this year toured the United States and certainEuropean capitals to further sensitize the internationalcommunity and donor Governments to post-conflictproblems confronting Liberia and to seek assistance.The Secretary-General  in his statement to the fourthMinisterial Meeting of the ad hoc Special Conference onLiberia  held on 3 October 1997  highlighted theGovernment’s commitment to national reconstruction. Heurged the international community to render necessaryassistance to achieve this goal. Accordingly  a donors’conference on Liberia was held in Paris  France  in April1998. The amount of $230 million was pledged forLiberia’s national reconstruction programme. However  it isdisheartening to note that donors have not yet honouredtheir commitments. We earnestly appeal to them to givehumane consideration to the difficult circumstances ofpost-conflict reconstruction. We are eager to rejuvenatethe economy  revitalize productive activities  restore thesocial infrastructure and improve the standard of livingfor all Liberians. Unfortunately  these efforts cannot belaunched without support and assistance from theinternational community.The evolving trends of globalization pose enormousthreats to weak and vulnerable nations  which arecontinuously marginalized in a global economic system.For most developing countries  particularly the leastdeveloped countries  which include Liberia  the debtoverhang and the unequal levels of trade are perennialproblems for their socio-economic development andreintegration into the world economy.The huge debt burden inherited by Liberia remainsa major obstacle in our post-war reconstruction efforts.Our debt stock is $3 billion. This means that eachLiberian man  woman and child carries a debt burden of$1 200. In a country where the per capita income isbarely $275 it may never be possible to fully repay thiscolossal financial obligation. Additionally  the cost ofrehabilitation and resettlement makes it imperative thatconsideration be given to our request for debt relief. Weare continuously undertaking economic reforms to dealwith the massive demands of our people and theinternational community. In view of all that  we call onour creditors to consider relieving Liberia of thisenormous financial burden.Debt relief should be considered on a humanitarianbasis against the background that such a move wouldconsolidate existing peace  enhance rehabilitation andfoster social and political stability. We believe that itwould be supportive of Liberia’s desire for inclusion inthe evolving global economy.The resolution of the Liberian civil crisis would nothave been possible without the close cooperation thatexisted between the international community and theLiberian people. We believe that the high level ofcollaboration between Liberia and the internationalcommunity should continue to guide our futureendeavours in post-conflict Liberia so that the gains madeby all stakeholders will not be lost.Of major concern in our reconstruction  rehabilitationand healing programme is the condition of women andchildren  for no amount of planning for reconstruction canever succeed if the plight of women and children is33ignored. Thus  we are implementing programmes thatrefocus their emphasis towards pursuing educationalopportunities and safeguarding the rights of women andchildren.Over the past two years Liberia has repeatedly soughtthe lifting of the 1992 arms embargo imposed on it by theSecurity Council. Our request is based on a principled legalstance that the Liberian civil war  which had necessitatedthe imposition of the embargo  effectively ended on 2August 1997 with the installation of a duly elected civilianGovernment. Thus  the intent of the arms embargo  whichwas to contain the war and the proliferation of arms inLiberia  is no longer necessary.In our submission to the Council requesting that theembargo be lifted  we referred to the 1996-1997 finalcommuniqué of the Economic Community of West AfricanStates (ECOWAS)  by which that regional organizationlifted all sanctions and embargoes on Liberia and calledupon the international community to do the same. It isimportant to note that it was ECOWAS that saw the needto impose an arms embargo on Liberia and to request theinternational community  including the Security Council  tosupport the embargo.The Government of Liberia continues to stress that thearms embargo presently imposed against Liberia by theSecurity Council is unjust. There are no defined criteria ortime limit for its lifting. It has been expanded in perpetuitywithout any explanation. The Government of Liberiareiterates that the continued refusal by the Security Councilto lift the arms embargo is a clear infringement of Liberia'ssovereignty  which the United Nations Charter defends.Like all Member States  Liberia has the unqualified right todefend itself and all those within its borders. The attitudeof the Council on this matter imputes partial sovereigntyand has hindered the freedom of a Charter Member of thisOrganization.The arms embargo has created an imbalance  with thepotential for adverse consequences for peace and security.The substantial advance of the destruction of arms inLiberia was followed by cross-border aggression. The armsembargo on Liberia does not contribute to peace in thesubregion; rather  it contributes to a fragile situation ofinsecurity and suspicion  which could lead to instability.Such an untenable condition need not exist in a region witha high population of refugees and former combatants poverty and deteriorating socio-economic conditions.In our continued efforts to prevent the proliferationof arms left over from the civil war  and to ensureregional peace and stability  on 25 July 1999 theGovernment of Liberia decided to destroy arms andammunition collected from the then warring parties duringthe disarmament process. This destruction exercise isbeing carried out with the assistance of the UnitedNations  ECOWAS and the United States Government.Most of the ammunition and arms have been destroyed.The arms and ammunition destroyed as of 10 September1999 are as follows: 3 156 156 total rounds ofammunition of all sizes and 19 297 total weapons of allsizes. Following are the categories of weapons that weredestroyed: 18 420 small arms; 626 heavy machine guns;150 anti-tank launchers; 63 mortars; 26 recoilless rifles;9 guns and howitzers; and 3 rocket launchers. The totalis 19 297.The destruction of these arms and ammunition doesnot negate the necessity of lifting the arms embargo. Theformer represents a clear departure from war mode to theinstitution of a culture of peace. The latter restoresLiberia's sovereign right to equip and maintain a nationalarmoury under the aegis of a restructured national armyto ensure proper accountability and fulfil the electedGovernment's constitutional responsibility for nationalsecurity.Liberia's international efforts are geared towardspeace and security  primarily in our subregion andgenerally in the world. Our stability is inextricably linkedto security in the West African subregion. It is within thiscontext that President Taylor took bold initiatives whichsignificantly contributed to peace in Sierra Leone. Liberiaalways felt that the conflict in Sierra Leone was primarilyinternal. Our persistence to bring about a negotiatedsettlement  rather than the use of force and violence emanated from our national experience with the futilityand destructiveness of armed confrontation.In this connection  my Government participated invarious talks  which led to the signing of the historicLomé Peace Agreement. Presently  Liberia is hosting twoleaders of the Sierra Leonean conflict in Monrovia inorder to resolve internal differences and facilitate theirearly return to Freetown for the smooth implementationof the Agreement. My Government is genuinelycommitted to the Sierra Leonean peace process and willdo everything to ensure that peace and normalcy return tothat sister Republic.34We concur with the Secretary-General'srecommendation to the Security Council on theestablishment of a United Nations peacekeeping force forSierra Leone; this  we believe  will sustain and strengthenthe efforts of ECOWAS.Liberia has been concerned about its borders withneighbouring countries  especially Guinea. We havewitnessed two incidents of armed aggression along ournorthern border  which resulted in the loss of life  propertyand the displacement of people. In this regard  we appeal tothe international community to provide us with all thenecessary assistance to enable our Government to cope withthe problems of refugees and internally displaced persons as well as to address the humanitarian crises created as aresult of the attack by dissidents. We are indeed gratifiedthat the Secretary-General has added his voice to the appealfor assistance.Liberia is committed to finding a diplomatic solutionto the problem along the Guinea-Liberia border andreaffirms its adherence to the practice of good-neighbourliness. We call on the international community toduly consider the vulnerability of the subregion due to thelarge volume of refugees and the attendant humanitariancrisis. My Government is of the strong conviction thatdialogue and cooperation between and among neighbourswill enhance security  peace and stability in the subregion.Accordingly  at a mini-summit of the heads of State andGovernment of the Economic Community of West AfricanStates  (ECOWAS) held in Abuja  Nigeria on 16 September1999  Liberia reached an understanding with Guinearelative to security and cooperation. We therefore call onthe international community to lend its support to theefforts aimed at reactivating the Mano River Union.Since 1992  Africa has experienced numerousimpediments to its economic development. There has beena continuous decline in its exports  imports and the flow ofdirect foreign investment and overseas developmentassistance. This situation is compounded by the increasingdebt burden  estimated at $300 billion. These negativetrends hamper Africa's integration into the global economy thus leading to its marginalization. We therefore call for thecreation of a more favourable economic environment thattaken into account the unique problems of Africa.We congratulate the Secretary-General on themeasures he has taken in helping create a favourableeconomic environment for Africa  as outlined in his“Progress report on the implementation of therecommendations contained in the report on the causes ofconflict and the promotion of durable peace andsustainable development in Africa” (S/1999/1008).Furthermore  we reaffirm our commitment to theprovisions of the Algiers Declaration of the Organizationof African Unity (OAU) with respect to the establishmentof a genuine international partnership.We welcome the offer of the United States PresidentBill Clinton to forgive the debts of the world's poorestcountries  including Liberia.As a signatory to the Convention on the Rights ofthe Child  my Government has taken measures to improvethe environment for nurturing and developing the child.We hereby reiterate our commitment to the rehabilitationand reintegration of children into civil society  inaccordance with the Maputo Declaration adopted by theOAU. We therefore call upon the international communityto provide support for efforts in this regard.Liberia firmly believes that the unification of Chinashould be peacefully pursued and that although it is amatter for the Chinese people themselves to determine there is nonetheless a need for the United Nations toexamine the exceptional international situation pertainingto the Republic of China on Taiwan. In so doing it willensure that the fundamental rights of 22 million people toparticipate in the work and activities of the UnitedNations  and it will do honour to this great world body.The Republic of China on Taiwan has contributedsubstantially to the international community in the area oftechnical and development assistance and has shown astrong commitment to human rights  democracy  marketeconomy and multilateralism. The unparalleled economicand political development of the Republic of China onTaiwan has brought a strong desire of its people toparticipate in international activities.Resolution 2758 (XXVI)  however  denies over 22million people their right to participate in United Nationsactivities and contravenes the United Nations Charter'sprinciple of universality. Taking into account the changinginternational climate  characterized by global economicinterdependence  it is essential for the United Nations toreview this unfair resolution as it steps into a newcentury. Liberia believes that the Republic of China onTaiwan can play a more important and beneficial role inthe United Nations community and that it is willing toplay that role. Liberia strongly urges the United Nationsto find a speedy and satisfactory resolution to theRepublic of China on Taiwan's participation in the UnitedNations.35In conclusion  since its establishment  the UnitedNations has represented mankind's legitimate aspirations.Despite its shortcomings  we continue to see it that way.Liberia cannot overemphasize its support for the ongoingreforms of the United Nations. Twenty-five years ago Liberia called for a review of the United Nations Charter toensure its effectiveness to cope with some of thefundamental problems that continue to beset the worldcommunity.Although we have not been favoured with the usuallevel of international support to help speed up the pace ofprogress in rebuilding our country  Liberia is most gratefulfor the vital support it has received  especially in the areasof rehabilitation and reintegration of ex-combatants andresettlement of refugees and displaced persons. It may notbe intentional  but it is regrettable that the issue of Africanrefugees has received little attention from the internationalcommunity  as has the issue of the developmental needs ofthe continent. The United Nations must ensure that on itsagenda the treatment of refugees around the globe is notskewed unequally against a particular region.If this world body will underline the promotion ofsustainable development  the pursuit of global peace and theneed to safeguard human progress  and if we realize that inorder to succeed we ought to rededicate ourselves to highand inspiring objectives  then we can truly ensure the futureof all mankind  irrespective of our places of origin.In Liberia  we have evolved four strategies for the newmillennium: first  to eradicate ignorance  disease —particularly the HIV/AIDS pandemic — and poverty  andto promote human rights; secondly  to strengthen the fullcapacity of the United Nations to effectively preserve theinternational system; thirdly  to promote universal harmonyand globalization; and fourthly  to protect humankindagainst the scourge of nuclear  chemical and biologicalwarfare  and to preserve our ecosystem.As we enter a new century  we need to re-evaluate ourundertakings and take measures to improve conditions inour world with an unflinching respect for the dignity ofhumankind."
"96",4066,"LBY",54,1999,"I would like at the outset  Sir  to express the warmcongratulations of my delegation and of my country onyour election to the presidency of the General Assembly.You are one of sisterly Namibia's freedom fighters  and oneof Africa's faithful sons. Your unanimous election to yourimportant post and your country's simultaneous membershipof the Security Council are strong evidence of the respectand appreciation that Namibia enjoys in the eyes of theentire international community. In the Security Council Namibia's notable positions on important internationalissues also irrefutably demonstrate Namibia's unremittingstruggle for freedom  right  sovereignty and justice — astruggle now waged by means different from those thatNamibia used during its independence struggle.I also commend your predecessor  His ExcellencyMr. Didier Opertti  for his successful guidance of theprevious session.I wish also to welcome the Republic of Kiribati  theRepublic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga as newMembers of the United Nations.The Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. KofiAnnan  deserves our deepest appreciation for hiscontinued efforts to make this Organization freer and lesssubmissive to the domination and control of the super-Powers of this critical historical era.Over the past several decades  the United Nationshas made considerable achievements  the most notable ofwhich has perhaps been its role in the elimination ofdirect colonialism and in the attainment of independenceby many countries which today occupy their proper placeas States Members of this Organization.The world has witnessed fundamental changes which imperatively call for serious reform of the UnitedNations and its basic structures  so that the Organizationcan truly perform its role as an umbrella  a haven and areference-point for all. Colonialist soldiers have left theharbours and the airports  but with the collapse ofinternational equilibrium  colonialists are reappearing innew guises  with new means and with both new and oldapproaches. Colonialism is coming back in the guise ofthe International Monetary Fund  the World Bank  otherfinancial institutions  economic cartels  and  whennecessary  military alliances. It is coming back in theguise of international conventions imposed through so-called international legitimacy  which is really nothingmore than an expression of higher policies dictatedthrough temptation or coercion. Colonialism is comingback in the guise of globalization  which is but a meansof ensuring and consolidating dependence in terms of theeconomy  politics  culture and even social values.Colonialism is also returning through direct armedinvasion  when necessary  as we have recently witnessed.It is also returning through bilateral sanctions policiesenforced through so-called international legitimacy andthrough selective disarmament or rearmament.Colonialism is returning through the elimination — notthe mere violation — of State sovereignty. The sloganthat is now much in vogue  “humanitarian intervention” will help erode the little that remains of State sovereignty.That pretext has been completely exposed. If the newColonialists understood the real meaning of humanity they would not be producing and stockpiling all kinds ofweapons of mass destruction or committing aggressionagainst others. Nor would they be imposing sanctions oncountries  as they continue to do  with the aim of16humiliating  starving and killing their peoples. We declareour absolute rejection of intervention under any slogan.This is the world following the collapse ofinternational equilibrium: the strong and the rich arebecoming stronger and richer  and the weak and the poorare becoming weaker  poorer and more deprived.In the face of these fundamental changes  it hasbecome necessary  indeed urgently imperative  that theUnited Nations should undergo a transformation that wouldenable it to respond to its new tasks as an umbrella  ahaven and a reference-point for all. This change will nothappen by itself  nor will the powerful initiate it. Theweaker nations can only resort to uniting their limitlessefforts  strengths and potentials to bring about and imposesuch change. My country believes that this desired changemust achieve the following:First  the authority for decision-making in the UnitedNations must rest with the General Assembly  whereMember States enjoy equal sovereignty.Secondly  the Security Council must become anexecutive instrument or authority for the General Assembly.Thirdly  there must be a radical revision of SecurityCouncil membership that will be equitable to all under-represented regions  particularly in the southern hemisphere:Africa  Asia and South America.Fourthly  the Security Council's rules of proceduresmust be issued by the General Assembly  which representsthe international community. Otherwise  it will bemeaningless to say that the Security Council works onbehalf of the international community. Quite simply put  themajority of the members of the international community didnot participate in the formulation of the Charter. A verysmall number of the United Nations Members formulatedit over half a century ago.Fifthly  all privileges resulting from the victories anddefeats of World War II must be abolished  particularly theprivilege of veto  and any other privileges that prevent thismost important international Organization from becomingtruly democratic.Despite the crises  conflicts and wars that ravage theAfrican continent  this year has witnessed solutions forsome of them  prospects for several others and initiativesfor the solution of the remaining conflicts. As we expressour satisfaction with this trend  we wish to recall  as wehave always done  that African wars and conflicts are theproduct of the division of Africa by the colonial Powers which must assume full responsibility for all the damagesinflicted upon the continent  including an apology and fullcompensation to its peoples. The solutions reached formany African conflicts were a result of the enormousefforts of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) subregional organizations  several African States andsome African leaders who truly care about Africa'ssecurity  stability and development.Libya has effectively supported and participated inthese initiatives  and will continue to do so  in closecooperation with the OAU  all other concerned countriesand the Secretary-General of the United Nations. As acontribution to the efforts made to tackle the situation inthe Democratic Republic of Congo and the Great Lakesregion  Libya has succeeded in convening a number ofmeetings  for heads of State of the region  in Sirte  Libya where they reached the Sirte Agreement  later completedand signed in Lusaka  which is aimed at putting an end tothe conflict in the area.In Somalia  Libya continues its efforts  incoordination with all concerned countries and groups inconflict  for national reconciliation in that forgottencountry. We hope that these efforts will result in thereunification and stability of Somalia. Libya has alsocontributed to bringing peace to Sierra Leone and stabilityto Guinea-Bissau  as well as contributing to the effortsundertaken by the OAU to put an end to the disputebetween brothers in Ethiopia and Eritrea  in the Horn ofAfrica. A Libyan envoy was sent there to help end thewar and bring peace to those two brotherly countries.Africa's plights are not confined to wars andconflicts  but also include several economic and socialproblems: 44 per cent of Africans live in abject poverty;AIDS threatens the entire African population; malaria andother epidemic diseases still threaten the lives of millionsin Africa. In respect of the latter  my country calls for thespeedy adoption and implementation of an internationalplan to eradicate these diseases in Africa before itbecomes impossible to contain and eliminate them.Attempts by African states to confront and solve theseproblems are hampered by the heavy debts of thecontinent  which reached $350 billion in 1998  equalling300 per cent of the value of African exports and services.The time has come to cancel African debts and to dealwith this question on the basis of new and equitableprinciples.17In order to confront these challenges and to usher astrong and united Africa into the new century  our brotherColonel Muammar Al-Qadhafi extended an invitation to hisbrothers  the leaders of Africa  to convene an extraordinarysummit in Sirte  Libya  from 8 to 9 September 1999. Theirpositive response had been unprecedented since theestablishment of the OAU. They all participated in thesummit  with the exception of Somalia  which has nocentral government. Thirty-nine heads of State and fourPrime Ministers were at the forefront of the participants.Some of the founding fathers of the Organization ofAfrican Unity were also at the summit  as well as formerOAU Secretaries-General. The summit  which is a historicevent in its own right  concluded with the adoption of theSirte Declaration establishing an African Union and itspolitical  economic and legislative institutions. Africa isnow determined  more than ever before  to surmount all thenegative aspects of its present realities and to move forwardtowards its future  full of hopes and aspirations  countingbasically on its own resources  capabilities and theendeavours of its sons.The Palestinian issue has not been settled yet  simplybecause the essence of the problem is being ignored:Palestine is still occupied. Its people are still scattered allover the globe as refugees  replaced by immigrants from allover the world. Unless an end is put to all this  and unlessthe Palestinian people are given their right to return to theirhomeland  neither peace nor security will be achieved in theArab East region. The occupation of the Syrian GolanHeights must also be totally ended  as well as theoccupation of southern Lebanon  in implementation ofSecurity Council resolution 425 (1978).We demand the immediate lifting of sanctions imposedon Iraq  and we emphasize the importance of preserving itsunity and territorial integrity  respect for its sovereignty non-intervention in its internal affairs and ending theongoing military aggression against it.In order for the world to live in peace and security  itmust be freed from the nuclear horror that threatens allpeoples. Elimination of nuclear arsenals and all otherweapons of mass destruction must have priority  and allefforts to achieve disarmament  at both regional andinternational levels  must be concentrated on realizing thisgoal. Unless those who currently possess such weapons getrid of them  there will always be those who strive topossess them. Efforts aimed at the non-proliferation ofnuclear weapons will be futile unless the nuclear Powerstake practical steps that would demonstrate their seriouscommitment to the undertakings they have made. These twotracks must move together or stop together. We have noother choice.The Arab region is subject to the threat of nuclearweapons possessed by Tel Aviv. These weaponsconstitute a permanent threat to the people of the regionand to neighbouring areas  and unless these weapons areeliminated  all efforts to prevent their proliferation in theregion will be unsuccessful.Libya is the southern Mediterranean country with thelongest coast. Therefore  we have a vital interest inmaking the Mediterranean a Sea of peace and cooperationfor the benefit of all peoples of this basin. This goal canbe achieved only if foreign military bases and fleets areremoved from the area  as they are a source of constantdanger to all Mediterranean peoples.Several countries  including my own  are still tryingto overcome the thorny problem of landmines that wereplanted in by the belligerent Powers during the WorldWars. These landmines have caused damage  losses andtragedies of untold magnitude  both human and material.Vast areas of Libya are covered by millions of land minesdeployed by the Allies and the Axis Powers during theSecond World War. We hold those Powers responsiblefor what they have inflicted upon our people as a resultof these landmines  and we reiterate our demand that theStates responsible implement the resolutions of theGeneral Assembly adopted in this regard  through thepayment of compensation to the affected countries andpeoples and the removal of these landmines.The revolution of 1969 allowed Libya to achieve itstrue and complete independence. By driving the foreignmilitary forces and bases from its soil  my countryliberated its policies and decision-making capabilities. Forthese reasons  Libya has since then been the target ofongoing hostile media campaigns aimed at distorting ourpolicies and tarnishing our international image. Oursupport for and solidarity with liberation movements havebeen portrayed as support for terrorism. Our standing bythe side of the oppressed and the downtrodden and ourassistance to help them liberate their countries and theirresources and defend their own interests have beenconsidered interference in the internal affairs of others.There have also been clandestine campaigns thathave sought to assassinate political leaders  in particularthe leader of our revolution  Colonel MuammarAl-Qadhafi  who has been targeted several times. Both airforce and naval campaigns have targeted Libya’s18territorial waters and the main cities of Tripoli andBenghazi. As a result  dozens of martyrs were killed andmany times as many were wounded — in addition toextensive loss of and damage to property. The mainobjective of these raids was once again to murder ourbrother Muammar Al-Qadhafi  whose home  office and tentwere destroyed during these raids.Economic pressure has been used against Libya.Unilateral boycotts and embargoes were followed bybilateral and collective embargoes  then by theinternationalization of these embargoes after the SecurityCouncil had become hostage to the will of the powerfulsince the collapse of the international balance of power.This was particularly the case during the first years of the“era of frenzy”  as Mr. Kofi Annan called it in a report tothe General Assembly.Why and how was the international “boycott” — asopposed to international “sanctions” — imposed? I call ita boycott and not sanctions because a sanction is a form ofpunishment for a definitively proven action  a punishmentdecreed after a final sentence has been pronounced by acompetent court that has the jurisdiction to condemn theaction in question. But no proof or evidence was presentedto the Security Council that Libya  or even the two Libyansuspects  had actually committed any action that led to thecrash of Pan Am flight 103 over the Scottish town ofLockerbie. Nevertheless  the sanctions resolutions wereissued in the name of so-called international legitimacy  alegitimacy that is both wrong and wronged. This is wrongbecause resolutions are adopted in the name of the SecurityCouncil; the Security Council is wronged because it isforced to issue resolutions under political and economicpressures and threats. The relevant resolutions were adoptedon the basis of suspicions regarding just two Libyancitizens — yet the sanctions targeted the entire populationof Libya. This was a form of collective punishment againstan entire people on the basis of a mere suspicion that hadnot been fully investigated. This punishment was imposedwithout a trial and obviously without any conviction in acourt of law. So much indeed for legitimacy. In fact  howlegitimate could this be during the years of frenzy?The conclusions — or cinematic fantasies — regardingthe suspicions were refuted at the time. Malta conducted anofficial investigation  the findings of which demonstratedthat not one unaccompanied suitcase was loaded onto theflight from Malta to Frankfurt. For their part  the Frankfurtauthorities investigated the matter and reached theconclusion that not one unaccompanied suitcase had arrivedat their airport from Malta  nor had left it for London.What then  is the origin or basis of this suspicion?I would like to briefly remind the Assembly thatfrom the first moment that the accusation was broadcastby the media  and before the matter was even presentedto the Security Council  Libya had done the following.First  we had requested the other party to provide thejudiciary authorities in Libya with its findings so thatthese authorities could commence their investigationsaccordingly. Alternatively  we proposed that that partysend investigators to Libya to participate in theinvestigation. We proposed sending Libyan judges toreview the case file. We also proposed that aninvestigation be conducted by a neutral party or parties or by the United Nations. All these requests were refused.Secondly  we requested the application of article 14of the Montreal Convention for the Suppression ofUnlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation or theassignment of this matter to the International Court ofJustice. All these requests and proposals were alsorefused.Then  on 27 February 1998  the International Courtof Justice issued two rulings in favour of Libya confirming its jurisdiction over the case under theMontreal Convention. The Non-Aligned Movement — ata meeting of its Foreign Ministers in Cartagena Colombia  from 18 to 20 May 1998 — made arecommendation to the upcoming Non-Aligned MovementSummit in Durban  South Africa  that the sanctionsimposed on Libya be lifted if the other party to thedispute did not agree to suspend the sanctions at the nextreview of the Security Council  which had been set forJuly 1998. At the Organization of African Unity summitin Ouagadougou  Burkina Faso  held on 10 June 1998 that organization declared that its members would nolonger comply with the Security Council sanctions if theother party continued to reject any of the optionsproposed by international organizations to resolve theconflict. Faced with all these developments  the otherparty had only two options left: either to accept a trial ina third country  or for the international community toimmediately lift the sanctions without having recourse tothe Security Council. Such a situation would havethreatened the authority of the Security Council — or more accurately  it would have threatened the authority ofthose who influence the Security Council — this latterbeing in the Council’s view — a much more seriousmatter.19A further legal complication was the possibility thatthe General Assembly would be presented with aconstitutional dilemma  especially after the issuance of thetwo rulings of the International Court of Justice — thehighest judicial institution of the United Nations. It was theSecurity Council versus the International Court of Justice.We could present the case to the General Assembly at anytime. The other party therefore had no option  andreluctantly  accepted  hoping to gain time. But then itreturned to its main objective vis-à-vis Libya. It declared itsacceptance of a trial in a third country and presented  asalways  a badly written draft resolution to the SecurityCouncil  along with other draft resolutions imposed on theCouncil by means that are well known to all  especially tothe Council’s members.Once again  most Security Council members supportedLibya  and once again the international communityreiterated its strong support for Libya in letters thatreflected the will of the overwhelming majority of theinternational community. These letters are all officialdocuments of the Security Council.But in all fairness  and to state the truth  from whichwe have never deviated  I will say that the Government ofthe United Kingdom has reacted seriously to the Libyanproposal  expressing its willingness to refer the wholequestion to none other than a Scottish court sitting in theNetherlands. We state the truth in our own interest and inthe interest of others.The rest is well known to all delegations. On 5 April1999  the two suspects arrived of their own free will in theNetherlands  accompanied by Mr. Hans Corell  theUnder-Secretary-General for Legal Affairs.But has the other party fulfilled its obligations? Has itshown respect for the resolutions of the Security Council?The answer is no. In fact  the other party prevented theadoption of a resolution by the Security Council to suspendthe sanctions and agreed only to a press release. Onceagain  under pressure from the Non-Aligned Movementmembers of the Security Council and from the otherCouncil members  and after several letters were submittedby the States members of the Non-Aligned Movement  theOrganization of African Unity  the Organization of theIslamic Conference and the Arab League to the SecurityCouncil and to the Secretary-General of the United Nations the other party accepted  unwillingly  the text of apresidential statement for the suspension of the embargo.Three months after the sanctions were suspended  on30 June 1999  the Secretary-General submitted a report tothe Security Council in document S/1999/726 pursuant toparagraph 16 of resolution 883 (1993) and paragraph 8 ofresolution 1192 (1998)  which requested him to report tothe Security Council within 90 days on compliance by theLibyan Arab Jamahiriya with the remaining provisions ofresolutions 731 (1992) and 748 (1992). On 9 July 1999 the Security Council considered the Secretary-General'sreport  but was unable to adopt a resolution that wouldhave lifted the sanctions imposed on Libya  because ofthe intransigence of one State  the United States  which isa party to the dispute. That State even threatened to usethe veto. This  in fact  can only be seen as reneging onprevious commitments made by the Security Council inparagraph 16 of its resolution 883 (1993) and paragraph8 of its resolution 1192 (1998). Moreover  it ignores theSecretary-General's report  whose contents lead to onlyone conclusion: that Libya has fulfilled all its obligationsunder Security Council resolutions.What justification  if any  does the United Stateshave for using the veto to prevent the Security Councilfrom adopting a resolution to lift the unjust sanctions onLibya? First  the United States has reiterated theaccusation it has made before and since the fabrication ofthe Lockerbie case: that Libya supports terrorism. TheUnited States has been repeating that allegation ever sincewe evicted it from Libya's military bases and harbours ended its monopoly on our oil  and liberated our countryfrom colonialism. That is why the United States stillaccuses us of terrorism. The Secretary-General's reportcategorically refutes this claim. Members may refer toparagraphs 29 to 34 of the report and to other pages inorder to ascertain the baseless nature of this accusation.Moreover  one can also cite reports issued by theAmerican State Department and statements made bypresent and former officials of American Administrationsthat all point to the fact that such claims can no longer bemade.Libya is a victim of American terrorism  not viceversa. It is the United States of America that committedall the acts of aggression that we have previously referredto. It is the United States that sheltered  financed  trainedand armed terrorists and transported them to Libya tocommit acts of terrorism in 1984 and afterwards. Thosewho continue to shelter terrorists wanted by othercountries are not in a position to refer to others bydescriptions that apply only to themselves. Libya hasstood by liberation movements  particularly in Africa.This is a legitimate cause  not support for terrorism.20The second justification is that Libya has to cooperatewith the Scottish court in the Netherlands. This ismeaningless  since Libya has undertaken to cooperate withthe court  as the Secretary-General's report has shown.Furthermore  this matter has been discussed by the judiciaryauthorities of the three countries in the presence of Mr.Corell. The Security Council  in paragraph 4 of itsresolution 1192 (1998)  decided that all States  not Libyaalone  shall cooperate with the court. The text is available;we can look it up if there is any doubt. Since all parties arecalled upon to cooperate  how can this argument be used toprevent the Security Council from acting in accordance withits obligations by lifting the embargo on Libya? This matterfalls under the competence of the International Court ofJustice and the Scottish court  with which our judiciaryauthorities are cooperating. It is blatant interference whena member of the Security Council tries to influence thework of these courts  which are independent institutions thatdeserve the respect not only of Libya  but of all others aswell.The third justification is even harder to swallow. It isthe demand that Libya compensate the families of thevictims. How can this be done when the court has yet tosit? It will not hold its first session until 4 February 2000and the laws state that the suspect is innocent until provenguilty. When we raised this issue  it was suggested that wesettle out of court. Why out of court? Why then is the courtin the Netherlands? We were told that these are Americanlaws. American laws apply to United States citizens  not toLibyan citizens. The Security Council and the GeneralAssembly reiterated last year and the year before thatnational laws cannot be applied beyond national borders.This logic of power should be used only to uphold the law.At the joint meeting  the Secretary-General himself wassurprised to hear this proposal before the court was insession. They reiterated it. He asked them how it could bedone. They said that the court would hand down a sentence.He pointed out that it had not yet done so and that  if it did Libya would be committed to respecting it. How could theypossibly make such a request when the suspects have notbeen found guilty? We are trying to prove their innocenceand our country's. How can we be asked to paycompensation when a ruling has not yet been issued? Thisis yet another way of interfering in the internal affairs ofthe Scottish court sitting in the Netherlands.Who will compensate Libya for the damages it hassustained in excess of $70 billion after seven years ofunjustified sanctions and embargoes? Who will compensateus? The United Nations? Will the Member Statescompensate Libya for something they have not done? Letus be logical and work within the law on the basicprinciples of justice. Since we have agreed to theestablishment of the court  let us allow the court to carryout its responsibilities.Libya's fulfilment of its obligations has also beenunderlined in the Secretary-General's report  in thedecisions of the thirty-fifth African Summit held inAlgeria last July  in the decisions of the Arab League thisSeptember and in the decisions of the Ministerial Councilof the Non-Aligned Movement a week ago. All thesedecisions call for the immediate and complete lifting ofthe sanctions. In this  they join the overwhelming majorityof the international community.Preventing the Security Council from adopting anoverdue resolution lifting sanctions that should not havebeen imposed in the first place will threaten the Council'scredibility and ability to honour its obligations. It willalso reinforce the Security Council's failure to act incompliance with the will of the majority of the UnitedNations Member States and in accordance with theprinciples and purposes of the United Nations Charter  asstated in Article 24. The will of one State cannotrepresent the will of the entire international community.My country requests one thing: that the SecurityCouncil speedily adopt a decision lifting all the sanctionsimposed on Libya. We demand that the case not beallowed to be politicized after the matter has taken itslegal course. The case should be left entirely to theScottish court in the Netherlands  without any interferencefrom any political entity  including the Security Council.If the Security Council continues to be prevented fromadopting such a decision  my country will take allnecessary steps to guarantee fairness  including raising aconstitutional dilemma between the highest and mostimportant judiciary organ  the International Court ofJustice  and the Security Council. We will raise it beforethe General Assembly in order to have a decision taken."

We must remove the remainingvestige of apartheid  and we must make a quantum leapin eliminating poverty and disease by addressing thecauses of poverty.The Caribbean has always leapt over the restrictionsof size and resources to embrace the global vision of aliberated world  and the liberation of Africa plays a24seminal role in this process. Caribbean thinkers such asPadmore  C.L.R. James  Professor Arthur Lewis  Dr. EricWilliams and Dr. Walter Rodney have all sought tosensitize the world to the catalytic role which Africa mustplay in global development.We recognize  however  that an essential condition forfulfilling this role must be the overcoming of theunderdevelopment that plagues that continent. But if we areto progress in that direction  we must first boldly admit thatdisunity among the countries of Africa has much to do withthis condition. In an era when other geographic regions andcontinents have been uniting for economic advancement the African continent remains divided. The time has come therefore  for the Organization of African Unity (OAU) togo further than just making declarations of unity. Pan-Africanism must not continue to remain stunted  as it wasat the threshold of the sixties. African leaders and statesmenmust show the resolve and the unwavering character ofNelson Mandela  and give African children  born andunborn  hope in the future of Africa.In this regard  the results of the recent Algiers summitof the OAU are therefore most welcome  for the summithas demonstrated a new sense of urgency and commitmenton the part of the new leaders of Africa. The UnitedNations must not fail to support this progressivedevelopment. For our part  Saint Lucia  mindful of theAfrican heritage of our people  will exhort our Caribbeancolleagues to consider applying for associate status with theOAU and to consolidate further our solidarity in theAfrican  Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) forum.Our call for unity is not being sent only to ourbrothers in Africa. It goes out also to all developingcountries  be they in the Caribbean  Latin America  Asia orelsewhere. If we in the developing world are to have abetter future in the new millennium  if we are to obtain anybenefits from the new international systems that areevolving around us  we cannot depend only on the goodwillof the countries of the developed world. There must beunity of action and purpose among us; there must be an endto the in-fighting  the skirmishes  and the wars between us.The South-South Summit in Havana next year will providean excellent opportunity for cementing solidarity on issuesof common concern and deciding on a forward-lookingagenda for the development of our people.In the Commonwealth Caribbean  we the members ofthe Caribbean Community (CARICOM) can be proud ofthe 25-year integration movement in which we have beenengaged. We are in the process of completing arrangementsfor the creation of a single market and economy and forthe establishment of a Caribbean court of justice that willbe the final appellate court for CARICOM membercountries. But  certainly  we must recognize that while wehave made progress  we have not gone far enough. InOctober  the heads of Government of the CaribbeanCommunity will meet in a special session in Trinidad andTobago to consider the future governance of theCaribbean Community. We urge the leaders ofCARICOM  in what will be their final meeting of thecentury  to take decisions on the future of CARICOM thatwill erase from the memories of West Indian people allthe hurt  all the pain  all the disappointments of our failedattempts at closer political union during this century. Letthe occasion for their October meeting be the springboardthat catapults West Indians into what will truly be a newera. Let our people enter the new millennium with aCARICOM that will be fully integrated  economically andpolitically.We can extend this tableau to embrace the Non-Self-Governing Territories of our region. My Government waspleased to have hosted  in May of this year  the annualUnited Nations seminar of the Special Committee onDecolonization to review the economic  political andconstitutional developments in the remaining small islandNon-Self-Governing Territories. This highly successfulseminar brought together representatives fromGovernments and non-governmental organizations andexperts from the Caribbean and Pacific regions. Thisimportant activity resulted in the adoption by the SpecialCommittee of targeted recommendations in thefurtherance of the decolonization of these Territories. Tothis end  we strongly support a second decade ondecolonization to focus on the socio-economic  politicaland constitutional development of the remaining smallisland Territories  which are integral components of boththe Caribbean and the Pacific regions.But the realization of these regional goals turns onthe full emergence of Cuba as a vital and creative forcein the integration and development of the Caribbean. Thisemergence is frustrated by the inability of the UnitedNations to harness the political will to remove theinhumane sanctions imposed by the United States on theCuban people  despite the successive overwhelming votesreligiously taken every year in the Assembly. At the fifty-third session of the General Assembly  157 countriesvoted in favour of resolution 53/4 to end the economicembargo against Cuba. The totally callous disregard forthe cumulative will of the Assembly is the touchstonewhich characterizes the relationship between the super-25Power leviathan and the 187 Lilliputian nations that talkand vote in this forum. Where is the democracy of whichwe speak? Where is the mutual respect for sovereignnations? Where is the humanity?The events in Rwanda  Kosovo and East Timor havedrawn serious lessons for the international community. Thespectre of an effete United Nations looking on helplesslywhile Member nations intervene unilaterally is a nightmareon the eve of the new millennium. It is for this reason thatSaint Lucia strongly supports the call by Secretary-GeneralKofi Annan for the United Nations to be empowered totake action  whether militarily or otherwise  to stop crimesagainst humanity.Saint Lucia remains concerned at the systematicweakening and marginalization of the United Nations. Inthis regard  attention is drawn to its operational activitiesand its development programmes  particularly the UnitedNations Development Programme (UNDP). We call ondonor countries to reconsider the effects of the budget cutson regional and country programmes.We need a United Nations that not only carries out itspeacekeeping and humanitarian capacities  but one that alsoplays a central role in the governance of globalization andtrade liberalization to ensure that globalization is aboutdevelopment.Our common humanity must demonstrate itself in ourprompt response to natural disasters in each other'scountries. The people of Taiwan have been the most recentvictims of devastating earthquakes  which claimed the livesof thousands of innocent people. We commiserate withthem. It is at such critical moments that the spirit ofbrotherhood must emerge. There was a surge of hope at thenews that the People's Republic of China had pledgedassistance to the Taiwanese across the Taiwan Strait. Let ushope that the Creator is working in a mysterious way tobring about the peaceful and mutually agreeablereunification of the Chinese people on this occasion of thefiftieth anniversary of China.Our own island State of Montserrat continues tostruggle to recover from the destruction caused by volcaniceruptions. Yet the international community continues toexclude this small island from concessional assistance onthe basis of its high gross national product per capita calculated from its small population and inflows ofassistance  mainly from the United Kingdom. The UnitedNations  in particular the Committee for DevelopmentPolicy  must take the lead role in the revision of the criteriafor concessional assistance to include vulnerabilities andqualitative data including openness of the economy andeconomic shocks. The sustainable development of smalldeveloping countries will remain a dream unless thesefundamental structural and systemic biases are addressed.Saint Lucia is particularly concerned about theexclusion of transnational corporations from the rules ofengagement the World Trade Organization (WTO) setsfor trade  since a large percentage of the financing for ourdevelopment comes from trade in one commodity. SaintLucia will continue to call for an integrated approach tothe consideration of trade and finance in the context ofthe upcoming conference on financing for developmentand for the participation of all actors  including theBretton Woods institutions and the WTO  under theleadership of the United Nations.The dispute over the arrangements for the marketingof bananas has been particularly distasteful. People inmember countries of the European Union are beingpunished through sanctions by the United States for thesupport of their Governments for the banana marketingregime. That country continues to promote the interests ofits multinational companies involved in the banana tradeat the expense of smaller economies. There are at themoment proposals on the table designed to put in place anew WTO-compatible system for the marketing ofbananas in Europe. All parties  particularly producingcountries  are of the view that a tariff rate quota systemis the most viable regime for all concerned. Acontinuation of the tariff rate quota is essential forensuring that the market continues to generate adequateprices.Yet the United States transnationals engaged in theindustry are instead promoting a simple or linear tariffmechanism that will have disastrous effects for Caribbeanproducers. Saint Lucia and other ACP countries haveexpressed dissatisfaction with this recommendation. Weagain implore all European Union member States torevisit this choice and to consider its implications forSaint Lucia and other ACP countries. We are inherentlyunequal trading partners  and the WTO should not subjectsmall economies to liberalization and unbridledcompetition on an equal footing with economies andcorporations far more advanced than they are and expectthem to survive. Saint Lucia again calls on theinternational community  including the WTO  todifferentiate between trading partners and promote fairtrade through special and differential treatment  not on avoluntary basis  but as a contractual obligation.26Saint Lucia has been in the forefront of the fight forthe survival of small island States. To quote the words ofthe President of the United States in his recent address tothe Assembly “We must refuse to accept a future in which one partof humanity lives on the cutting edge of a neweconomy  while the other lives at the knife edge ofsurvival” (A/54/PV.6).Globalization has left us on the knife edge of survival.We are thankful to Europe for empathizing with ourvulnerabilities  and we regret that they have attracted thewrath of sanctions for their pains. Between the rhetoric andthe reality lies the gaping wound of disillusion and despair.President Clinton rightly posed the question:“Will globalism bring shared prosperity  or will itmake the desperate of the world even moredesperate?” (supra).Saint Lucia can confidently attest to the truth that thesmall States and the developing world are desperate  andthat their desperation is compounded by the fact that theglobal preoccupation with money and markets is fastdestroying the values and sacred norms in our respectivecountries.“Ill fares the land  to hastening ills a preyWhere wealth accumulates  and men decay”.(Oliver Goldsmith  The Deserted Village)The decadence and moral turpitude that has taken overour paradise of an island is unbelievable. The conspiracythat threatens to decimate our bananas has left us withtourism as a strategy for diversification. The twin monstersof drugs and crime promise to overrun us  and the filth thatspews from cable television pours into our homes. Some ofthese homes are nothing more than vile little hovels whoseinhabitants are sustained at night by religion andunemployed by day. The decay is all-pervasive  and womenfrom nearby territories are imported to ply their sordid tradein strip-tease joints.We have lost our innocence; this is the surest legacythat globalization has visited upon us. We cannot beswayed by the rhetoric of partnership when the relentlesslogic of globalization is geared to decimate  to marginalizeand to eliminate. The developing world must focus closelyon the Seattle Round and ensure that the wide sweep ofliberalization and open markets does not wash us away. Ifthe dogmatism and inflexibility of powerful States threatenour survival  then we must band together in a “TradeUnion of the Poor” to seek justice and humanity. Nopoison is a necessary drink  and we cannot be expected toswallow globalization's cup of hemlock for the greaterglory of the shapers of the new millennium. We want anew millennium shaped by all Member States  addressingthe needs and interests of all  and beneficial to all.We share our apprehension with this body. We willwork in the embrace of its wise Charter  but we woulddescribe globalization in the words of the Irish poetWilliam Butler Yeats:“And what rough beast  its hour come round at last Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?”(The Second Coming)"
"98",4124,"LIE",54,1999,"This is the sixth time that I have had thehonour to address the General Assembly  and it is a greatpleasure for me to be back here in this body.I would  at the outset  like to congratulate Mr.Gurirab warmly on his election to the presidency of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-fourth session. BothLiechtenstein and Namibia figure among the youngerMembers of this Organization  since both our countrieswere admitted to the United Nations in 1990. The32President can count on Liechtenstein's support as he guidesthe Assembly to fruitful outcomes.I would also like to extend our warm welcome to theKingdom of Tonga  the Republic of Kiribati and theRepublic of Nauru.The general debate is an important opportunity for allof us to take stock  to comment on the state of theOrganization  to voice our concerns and  if necessary dissatisfaction and  most important  to offer constructivethoughts and ideas for the future.At the time when Liechtenstein became a Member ofthe United Nations  nine years ago  the cold war had justcome to an end  and we tried to identify the challenges andopportunities created by the new situation. The hopes andexpectations were high  the concerns and problemsmanifold. It was clear to many of us that our Organizationwas not fully equipped to face the upcoming challenges and  indeed  mistakes have happened along the way.Today  we can say that the somewhat perverse orderof the cold war has been replaced by the era ofglobalization. Some of us welcome this new era  some ofus fear it. However different our opinions  there can andshould be one common denominator: that we acknowledgethe arrival of this new era and that we join our forces toface its challenges.Globalization has two faces: it offers a potential  fromwhich — if properly explored — mankind as a whole canbenefit. It also contains risks  especially for those who arealready in a perilous position.In order to be able to face these two enormous tasksefficiently  we have to work together  because that is theonly way for us to succeed. The United Nations is the soleforum that is of truly global range  and thus it offers theonly opportunity for us to address these issues — assumingwe are equipped with the right tools.The past years have been characterized by importantand far-reaching reform efforts. The challenges ofglobalization make further measures necessary  such as theenhanced inclusion  participation and accountability of non-State actors. In a globalized world  such actors playincreasingly influential roles  both positive and negative.Persons and organizations that constitute significanteconomic forces have to be involved in our considerationsand decision-making processes. Actors such as terroristsand parties to internal armed conflicts have to be heldaccountable for their actions and for the consequencesthereof.The public at large often mistakenly equates theUnited Nations with the work of only the SecurityCouncil. This is factually wrong  and we should use everyopportunity to inform people worldwide about the widerange of activities carried out by our Organization and itsspecialized agencies. But we also have to bear in mindthe immense importance of the work of the Council andmust have a certain appreciation of why the publicfocuses only on the Council's work  erroneous as thisapproach may be. It is simply a fact that the credibility ofthe United Nations depends to a very large extent on thecredibility of the work of the Security Council. Thiscredibility has suffered serious blows in the recent past and we cannot afford to ignore the root causes of theproblem.We have to address the existing problems and todesign ways and means to avoid further  perhapsirreversible  damage. Strict observance of the keyprovisions of the Charter is one essential element in thisrespect  and reform of the Security Council is another.For a long time we have talked about all aspects of sucha reform  including the composition of the Council. Themoment has come for us to recognize that the question ofthe veto is at the core of every credible and sustainableSecurity Council reform.My country has long expressed concern about thesituation in Kosovo and has asked for preventive effortsin order to avoid an escalation of this situation. Insolidarity with the victims and wanting to take someresponsibility for them  Liechtenstein has given temporaryshelter to a large number of Kosovar refugees  hasparticipated in the provision of humanitarian assistance in particular through the relevant United Nations agencies and has expressed full support to the United NationsMission in Kosovo and to the ongoing efforts ofreconstruction.At the same time  we also have questions  and wenotice that others do too. How can we reconcile the rolegiven to the Security Council under the Charter of theUnited Nations with a “humanitarian intervention” notmandated by the Council? What does this mean for thefuture of the Security Council and of the Organization asa whole? Are regional organizations to assume a leadingrole that goes beyond what is contained in Chapter VIIIof the Charter? It will be important to discuss these33questions  though finding satisfactory answers is certainlydifficult.To our mind  Kosovo has made it very clear oncemore that the prevention of conflicts must be the keyconcept in conflict-resolution as well as in other areas.Preventive measures are the best means of saving lives andresources of every kind  and they can be carried out quicklyand with discretion. Prevention does not make big newsheadlines  but it reduces the number of headlines ondisasters  of which we continue to see just too many. Thepotential of prevention is enormous  but its application sofar is too modest and far too limited.We know that there is still reluctance and hesitation but we feel a sense of urgency  a pressing need to enhancepreventive activities and to replace a classical concept ofsovereignty — a concept that is outdated in many aspects— with a new one which enables us to tackle situations ofpotential and actual crisis with determination and efficiency.We thus welcome the report of the Secretary-General onthe work of the Organization and his very inspiring andtimely remarks on a “culture of prevention”. We areconvinced that this is the right way for the internationalcommunity to go.Kosovo has been and somewhat sadly remains a primeexample of the need for prevention. Liechtenstein has forseveral years now promoted ideas and suggestions on apreventive approach with regard to problems arising fromthe application of the right of self-determination. Theinternational community remains stuck in a situation inwhich the exercise of the right of self-determination —which is the prerequisite for the enjoyment of all humanrights — is denied because it is misunderstood as a claimto independence and statehood. We all have known for verylong  since the adoption by the General Assembly of theFriendly Relations Declaration in 1970  that this is notcorrect. Self-determination can mean many other things  ifexercised in a flexible manner and based on a dialoguebetween the parties concerned. It does not have to lead tothe break-up of States; it should rather facilitate thepeaceful coexistence of States and communities which areprovided a degree of self-administration or self-governanceas an expression of their right of self-determination.It is time to free ourselves from biased and obsoletethinking and to recognize that the effective application andexercise of the right of self-determination is the basis forpreventing violent disintegration of States as well asinternal armed conflicts with all their gruesome aspects andendless human suffering."
"99",4171,"LKA",54,1999,"Allow me first toextend to our President's distinguished predecessor  HisExcellency Didier Opertti  Foreign Minister of Uruguay President of the fifty-third session of the General Assembly our gratitude for the excellent manner in which heconducted the work of the previous session.Allow me also to offer to the Republic of Kiribati  theRepublic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga thecongratulations and warmest good wishes of theGovernment and the people of Sri Lanka on their electionto membership of the General Assembly of the UnitedNations. We welcome them and assure them of ourunstinted support as they take up their places in theAssembly of nations.Our President's well-deserved election to the chair ofthis historic final session of the General Assembly of theUnited Nations for the twentieth century gives us greatpleasure. Many of us  Foreign Ministers  have known himwell over the years. We have worked with him  and wehave greatly admired the energy and dedication that he hasbrought to the performance of his duties as the PermanentRepresentative of his country. The developing countries inparticular have cause to remember with gratitude the rolehe has played in the deliberations of the Non-AlignedMovement and the G-77. He brings to his office wideexperience of the systems and practices of the UnitedNations. He also brings to his office a high degree ofsensitivity to the important issues of the day.I noticed with keen interest that in his openingstatement to the Assembly the President referred inconsiderable detail to the problem of child soldiers. Thisreference was particularly heartening to me as I had  on thebasis of the Graca Machel report  first brought the issue ofchild soldiers to the attention of the Assembly in the courseof my address in 1997. In Sri Lanka a rebel group has forseveral years been conscripting children  even as young as10  for battle. Even worse  it has been making children girls and boys  into suicide bombers  thus creating ahorrible new phenomenon of depravity and cruelty that theworld has never seen before. If the conscience of the worldis not outraged by the tragic fate of these children in mycountry  then nothing will move us to action in defence ofthe young and the helpless anywhere. In his openingaddress to the General Assembly  the President referredto the boast of the “soulless recruiters” that children“are numerous and readily available  more malleableand impressionable  learn quickly  are small andagile  and quite simply require less food andsupplies than adults”.He described their fate as “horrendous” and said that inhis view it“demands that the United Nations show renewedcommitment and redouble its efforts as therepository of humanity's conscience and socialjustice in the world.” (A/54/PV.1)The President referred to the work being done by inter-governmental and non-governmental organizations to savechildren  and exhorted them to“continue to blame and shame Governments for notdoing enough to protect our children's lives and theirfuture.” (ibid)But in some countries Governments are completelyblameless. In Sri Lanka no Government  either beforeindependence 50 years ago or after  has ever recruitedchildren under 18 years of age into the armed forces. Inmy country it is only the Liberation Tigers of TamilEelam (LTTE) that resorts to this abominable practice.These rebel groups are beyond the pale of the law. Theyacknowledge no international conventions. They are notanswerable to any international body. And yet they mustbe brought to book. Some of them  the LTTE included operate with impunity in certain countries  wearing theinnocent garb of charitable  religious or socialorganizations. They collect money for ostensibly anodynepurposes. But in fact the money goes to buy weapons forwar. And  in truth  host Governments which provideshelter to these organizations under the umbrella of liberallaws of asylum and immigration know  or could easilyfind out  that those moneys are going to fuel the very warinto which young children are being dragooned. TheseGovernments adopt as their explanation for inaction theimpeccable excuse that they do not have laws underwhich fund-raising for terrorist purposes can be punished.This is true  but it will soon cease to be true when theconvention for the suppression of the financing ofterrorism is adopted — we hope and pray — at this fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly  requiring allsignatory States to enact domestic legislation in keepingwith the provisions of the convention.25The Secretary-General in his report (S/1999/957) tothe Security Council on the protection of civilians in armedconflict has recommended that the Security Council urgeMember States to support the proposal to raise theminimum age for recruitment and participation in hostilitiesto 18  and demand that non-State actors involved in conflictnot use children below the age of 18 in hostilities  or facethe imposition of targeted sanctions if they do not comply.One of the most effective sanctions would be theproscription of such organizations in countries where theypresently collect money without let or hindrance  or theirbeing named terrorist organizations  as by the United Statesof America  for instance  and the consequent illegalizationof their activities.Since 1997 there has been considerable progress onthe question of child soldiers. The issue is now on centrestage. Regional conferences have been held  and a worldconference is to be held next year. The office of the SpecialRepresentative of the Secretary General for Children andArmed Conflict is operational. A growing number ofcountries refer to this issue in the General Assembly and atother forums. Most recently the Foreign Ministers of theNordic Countries roundly condemned the practice andpledged their support for its eradication. The SecurityCouncil has unanimously adopted its first-ever resolution onthe plight of children. The first decade of the nextmillennium has been designated the International Decadefor a Culture of Peace and Non-violence for the Childrenof the World. And the President stated that he would makeit his business to add his “voice and devotion to” the“laudable efforts to make the twenty-first century oneof love and security for every child in the world.”(ibid)In Sri Lanka we have decided to set up a rehabilitationcentre for the children who desert the rebel army. The taskof restoring them to health and normalcy is a daunting one.It is a task for which we can certainly use all the help wecan get from those who have experience in that field.My plea to the General Assembly today  two yearsafter I first brought up the question of child soldiers  is thatwe must proceed with the utmost dispatch to rescue thesechildren from their fate. They are already scarred; if we donot act quickly they will be scarred beyond redemption.We leave the twentieth century with many spectacularachievements behind us. But let us make no mistake — wemove into the twenty-first century carrying with us old intractable problems that have been with us since the dawnof time. As the present century draws to a close  newproblems of unparalleled menace and danger haveemerged. They will undoubtedly occupy our attention wellinto the next century.Poverty  illiteracy  ill-health  hunger  unemployment uncontrolled urbanization  the growth of mega cities —these are old problems which deeply affect over half ofhumanity.We have not addressed these problems withsufficient vigour over the past decades. While the UnitedNations systems were set up to tackle these problems  thecapacity of the system to deliver results has been grosslyinadequate.The challenge of fighting human poverty mustnecessarily continue to have the highest priority. The poorcontinue to become poorer  remaining deprived of thebasic necessities of life. This is morally outrageous in anera of abundance and conspicuous consumption. Povertydegrades humanity and is a threat to the most basic of allhuman rights. The onus is on us to unite  to wage a moralwar  to eliminate the scourge of poverty from our midst.Sri Lanka is of the view that any developmentagenda of the future must contain a social dimension andassure protection to the most vulnerable elements of oursociety. It is in this regard that the internationalcommunity must move beyond the Heavily Indebted PoorCountries Debt Initiative. By revising the criteria ofclassification  we would expand the number of countriesthat could be helped towards achieving meaningfulreduction in both the stock of debt and its servicing. Debtrelief and official development assistance  which has beendwindling in recent years  should be restored to its formerlevels  void of conditionality  at least for the leastdeveloped countries. A positive step would be thecancellation of their foreign debt. This would help releasetheir very limited resources for social and povertyalleviation programmes. They must be urgently put on thepath to sustainable development  if they are to survive.Though relieving these countries of a major portion oftheir debt burden is a commendable step  it is equallyimportant to ensure that they do not relapse into thepoverty trap.The time has come for the countries of the South toformulate an effective and implementable economicagenda. The recommendations of the Non-AlignedMovement ad hoc panel of economists are of primaryimportance in organizing the substantive work of the26agenda for the South. They include the need for theelaboration and regular updating of the developingcountries' agenda; development of a networking systembetween countries of the South  involving specialists andresearchers in the various fields of importance; an economiccoordination scheme to help identify and analyse aspects ofinternational economic and trade-related issues; and theassembling and launching of expert groups  which couldmobilize those national and inter-South institutions  like theSouth Centre in Geneva.The South Centre could be a possible coordinatingmechanism  which could facilitate the implementation ofthe South agenda. With the increased marginalization ofdeveloping countries in matters of international finance andtrade  it is imperative that we urgently put in place acoordinating mechanism to implement the recommendationsmade by the ad hoc panel of economists.The general thrust of globalization and liberalizationof the international economy has now become irreversible.The growing linkages between countries  the opening up ofmarkets  the spread of investments  the impact oftechnology on standardizing products  the shrinking ofdistances and the speed of modern communications  offernew windows of opportunity for developing countries especially if their positive aspects are seized upon and theirpitfalls avoided. The task facing us in the developing worldtoday is one of adapting this twin process to conform to ourown specific requirements and priorities. This  in our view would be the primary objective of an economic agenda ofthe South in the evolving global economy of the future.Although there have been significant developments inthe world economy under the influence of the doctrine ofglobalization and liberalization  it is imperative to recognizeits limitations and drawbacks where developing countriesare concerned. We need to grapple with the reality andshake off any feelings of complacency. It is nowincreasingly evident that the benefits of globalization haveby and large bypassed much of the developing world despite strict adherence to the tenets of the structuraladjustment policies. The poorest among us — spanning thecontinents of Africa  Central America and Asia — haveexperienced increasing marginalization in the worldeconomy.Surveying the South  we find it evident thatglobalization and liberalization have  paradoxically increased the economic gap between rich and poorcountries. This is the conclusion reached in the tenth UnitedNations Development Programme Human DevelopmentReport. Domestic liberalization measures undertaken bymany of the developing countries have also contributedtowards a widening of the gap between the rich and thepoor. A number of countries have recorded someacceleration of economic growth in the wake ofliberalization and deregulation. But they have alsowitnessed a shift in income distribution in favour of thosein the upper income groups. Domestic policy reformsundertaken by a large number of developing counties inthe direction of liberalization and deregulation have notsecured for them a place on the “Globalization Express”.The globalization and liberalization process isunfolding in a manner which gives developing countrieslittle voice in shaping the policy framework thatunderpins this procedure. The ad hoc panel of economistsunder the aegis of the Non-Aligned Movement  whichwas set up on a proposal made by Sri Lanka  hasconcluded that there is very little opportunity fordeveloping countries to be represented at discussions andin the councils under which various aspects of theglobalization process are assessed  monitored and tailored.Initial optimism on globalization and liberalizationis being replaced by anxiety and concern. The emergenteconomies in Asia are in crisis  experiencing sharpdownward pressures on their currencies and capitalmarkets and experiencing stresses  not only on theireconomic structures  but also on their social fabric andpolitical processes. Fears of widespread internationalrepercussions have borne fruit  and the impact ofcontagion is all too evident. A bitter lesson that hasbecome all too obvious is the vulnerability of economiesto uncontrolled financial flows of various kinds particularly those of a speculative nature.The globalization and liberalization environmentcontains no safeguards to control and regulatedestabilizing forces in a situation in which rapidmovements of vast amounts of capital across nationalborders is a daily reality. The response of the multilateralfinancial institutions and the major Powers to the EastAsian crisis has been ad hoc and ex post facto  but theneed in the first place was for preventive mechanisms.In this milieu  Sri Lanka's response has been tomaintain as best it could a steady level of economicgrowth  despite an unfavourable external economicenvironment. Our capital account transactions have onlypartially been liberalized. In our view  foreign directinvestment should be of a medium or long-term nature in27order to discourage excessive outflow of short-term capitalduring a financial crisis.It is now virtually established wisdom that the leastdeveloped countries have been increasingly marginalized inthe globalization and liberalization process. A restructuringof the global financial architecture must include specialprotection for these most vulnerable segments of our globalsociety. Since a crisis in any one part of the global structurehas the power to cause havoc in the rest of the worldeconomy  we must look beyond national solutions to globalones  for both are now irrevocably interlinked.Sri Lanka  as chair of the Group of 24  has taken aspecial interest in building a consensus among developingcountries on the issues of reforming the global financialarchitecture  and also on the matter of implementation ofWorld Trade Organization agreements. As a member ofregional groupings  such as the Group of 15  the Group of77  the Non-Aligned Movement  the Bangladesh-India-Myanmar-Sri Lanka-Thailand Economic Cooperation(BIMST-EC) and the Indian Ocean Rim Association forRegional Co-operation (IOR-ARC)  and also as the currentchair of the South Asian Association for RegionalCooperation (SAARC)  Sri Lanka hopes to play a part inevolving a developing country consensus on this issue andinitiating a healthy debate with developed countries  withthe hope of establishing a new  dynamic  mutuallybeneficial international financial architecture. As a part ofthis effort  we have been active in promoting a South-Southdialogue and developing an agenda for the South.In this connection  I wish to commend theobservations of the German Foreign Minister in his speechto the Assembly a few days ago. He said:“The United Nations third major task alongsidepeacekeeping and promoting human rights in thecoming century will be to bring about a reconciliationbetween rich and poor countries ... The developmentof the poorer and the poorest countries must not beleft to the invisible hand of the global market ... Therich countries have a responsibility to help poorcountries take advantage of globalization and enablethem to have a fairer share of the world economy byassisting them with internal reforms and by openingup markets ... Development cooperation in thebroadest sense must become one of the United Nationscore tasks to a greater degree than hitherto. Scienceand technology are geared far too much to theproblems of rich countries.” (A/54/PV.8)The phenomenon of nations pooling their resourcesand strengths  either for collective security or economicdevelopment  has been a particular phenomenon of thesecond half of this century. South Asia has been noexception  the only difference being that the process ofregional cooperation commenced relatively late — just 15years ago — in comparison to other parts of the world.We were also clear from the very outset that ourendeavours were targeted solely for economic and socialdevelopment.The early phase of regional cooperation in SouthAsia required the building of the necessary institutionalcapacities of the South Asian Association for RegionalCooperation (SAARC). Once these capacities were inplace  we began during the last decade to work on thecore issues of economic and commercial cooperation.We have made some progress in tariff liberalizationin South Asia under the SAARC Preferential TradingArrangement. This progress has given us the confidenceto contemplate the more ambitious task of establishing aregional free-trade area. At the SAARC Summit inColombo hosted by Sri Lanka last year  a decision wastaken  and thereafter implemented  to begin drafting thelegal treaty for a free-trade regime.The Colombo Summit also manifested ourdetermination as a region to equip ourselves to maximizethe opportunities afforded by the process of globalization.Our Commerce Ministers have been meeting regularly toprepare for the World Trade Organization (WTO)Ministerial Meeting in Seattle. We will be spelling out inSeattle our views on the achievements so far of themultilateral trading system that has now been put in placeand the course corrections we believe are required. Wehave also networked our central banks and financeMinistries since the Colombo Summit  to strengthen ourcapacities to anticipate and cope with developments in theinternational financial system.The economic focus of our regional cooperation hasnot made us unmindful of our other primary objective namely of social advancement for our region. Thechallenges our region faces are many. They relate toeducation  the empowerment of women  health andpopulation issues  and so on. We are trying to evolve alink between regional goals and national programmes inthe social sector through a depoliticized common vision.To this end we have  again after the Colombo Summit commenced work on a Social Charter for South Asia.28The gains we have made in regional cooperation inSouth Asia are certainly not the material of whichsensational headlines are made. In fact  they may even havegone unnoticed in some quarters. Yet we in South Asiaknow that our achievements are incremental  durable andlong-lasting. Whatever may be the burdens imposed byhistory on our region  our common aspiration for thedevelopment and welfare of our peoples brings theGovernments of South Asia together in collectiveendeavour. Our organization has an inherent strength andresilience that has enabled it to weather serious crises inrelations between some of our members. It has emergedstronger after each such test of its capacity for collectiveaction.Among the new problems of unparalleled menace anddanger that have emerged towards the close of the presentcentury are heightened terrorist activities in many countriesand ever-proliferating criminal activities in the areas ofnarcotics  human trafficking and arms smuggling. Everytime I have spoken from this rostrum  I have argued thatterrorism must be tackled collectively if it is to be tackledeffectively at all. In earlier years this plea seemed to fall ondeaf ears. But a rash of terrorist bombings in the Westgalvanized the rich and powerful countries into action.Today we have one Convention in place and two othersunder consideration at this very session. I am content thisyear merely to reiterate my plea that there should be norelaxation in the fight against terrorism. I urge othercountries  particularly in the West  to follow the lead of theUnited States of America in enacting legislation to outlawterrorist organizations.In the unfolding debate on the stand-off between statesovereignty and the rights of individuals being subjected tomassive human-rights violations  we must be careful to seethat terrorist organizations do not reap the benefit ofmisplaced sympathy in situations of civil conflict. Thosewho resort to terror in pursuit of their political objectivesmust never be permitted or encouraged to believe thatunremitting terror will ultimately bring its reward inrecognition and results. On the contrary  it is only therecognition that a campaign of terror will put its exponentsbeyond the pale of civilized discourse that will persuadeterrorists to seek other ways of gaining a hearing.At the close of this century it is relevant to ask ofourselves this question: do moral considerations any longerinspire or motivate our actions  or have we been completelyovertaken by pragmatic considerations reflected in ourrespective national interests  subjectively defined?I would like  in this context  to make an observation.We have all heard the familiar jibe that a diplomat issomeone who is paid to lie abroad for his country.Indeed  foreign relations and foreign policy have alwayshad the reputation of being somewhat amoral  the objectbeing to secure some national advantage  with themorality of the end  or of the means used to secure theend  being relatively unimportant. But the consequencesof this approach for international relations have beendeplorable. The Charter of the United Nations commenceswith these memorable words:“We the peoples of the United Nationsdetermined to save succeeding generations from thescourge of war  which twice in our lifetime hasbrought untold sorrow to mankind  and“to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights in the dignity and worth of the human person  in theequal rights of men and women and of nations largeand small  and“to establish conditions under which respect forthe obligations arising from treaties and othersources of international law can be maintained  and“to promote social progress and better standardsof life in larger freedom”.One has only to listen to these words to realize thatthe 54 years that have elapsed since they were first statedhave brought serious disappointments. Not only has theworld experienced numerous wars  but nations andpeoples have experienced many kinds of immoralpressures and intimidation. Social progress and betterstandards of life in larger freedom have  for manynations  been an ever-receding mirage. It is clear thatthese noble aspirations need some backing  somestiffening  in their implementation.Some 2 500 years ago a great teacher was born inAsia. He was born a prince. He renounced the world androamed the forests in search of truth until he receivedenlightenment. Let me recall that Buddhism was firstestablished in the central plain of the River Ganges  justsouth of the Himalayas. From that beginning  at one timeor another in the course of its history  the message of theEnlightened One spread to large areas of India  Pakistanand Afghanistan  to Sri Lanka  China and Japan  toIndonesia  Korea  Laos and Viet Nam  and to Myanmarand Thailand. I state this not with any sense oftriumphalism  but to note that this enormous expansion29took place in peace. No battles were fought  no citiesbesieged and no crusades commenced to further theexpansion of Buddhism. And when  in accordance with theBuddha's teaching that all things are impermanent  the tidereceded  no battles were fought  no cities besieged and nocrusades commenced to stem that tide. For all of us whoare concerned with statecraft  this holds a fundamentallesson.I would like to quote in this connection from the greatBuddhist Emperor Asoka  who  as the Assembly knows underwent a radical change of heart through contact withthe Dhamma. In his often-quoted thirteenth rock edict atKalsi  he proclaimed:“And for the following purpose has this rescript onmorality been written  namely  in order that the sonsand grandsons who may be born to me should notthink that a fresh conquest ought to be made; that  ifa conquest does please them  they should take pleasurein mercy and light punishments; and that they shouldregard the conquest by morality as the only trueconquest”.Not only the freedom of thought  but also thetolerance allowed by the Buddha is astonishing to thestudent of the history of religions. Asoka  following thisnoble example of tolerance and understanding  honouredand supported all other religions in his vast empire.The Buddha was just as clear on politics  war andpeace. It is well-known that Buddhism advocates andpreaches non-violence and peace as its universal messageand does not approve of any kind of violence or destructionof life. According to Buddhism  there is nothing that can becalled a “just war”  which is only a false term coined andput into circulation to justify and excuse hatred  cruelty violence and massacre. Who decides what is just or unjust?The mighty and the victorious are “just” and the weak andthe defeated are “unjust”. Buddhism does not accept thisposition.As the Buddha says:“The victor breeds hatred and the defeated lies downin misery. He who renounces both victory and defeatis happy and peaceful”.The only conquest that brings peace and happiness is self-conquest:“One may conquer millions in battle  but he whoconquers himself — only one — is the greatest ofthe conquerors.”Buddhist philosophy contains much more ofrelevance to statesmen. In the past decade the observanceof human rights has been a source of great concern anddebate in international forums. In this connection  I wouldlike to quote the words of a scholar who has examinedthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights  article byarticle  from a Buddhist perspective. He said:“The importance of this Declaration as a commonstandard of achievement for all peoples and allnations is now acknowledged everywhere. From thereligious angle  it is possible to state that in thisDeclaration lie enshrined certain values and normsemphasized by the major religions of the world.Though not directly expressed  the basic principlesof the Declaration are supported and reinforced bythese religious traditions  and among them thecontribution of the Buddhist tradition  to say theleast  is quite outstanding”.Today the teachings of the Buddha are studied andpractised worldwide  and nowhere more avidly than in theWest. It is said that there are over 150 million knownadherents of Buddhism in the world today. But if onetook into account the vast uncounted numbers of thosewho practise Buddhism  that figure would be immenselyhigher.Allow me  therefore  to suggest to this Assemblythat as the third millennium of human history opens itwould be fitting to recall the immense contribution to theunderstanding of the human condition that the teachingsof the Buddha made 2 500 years ago. I suggest furtherthat it would be appropriate to honour the Buddha bydeclaring that Wesak  the sacred day for Buddhists theworld over  be observed as a special day by the UnitedNations. Wesak marks the three most important events inthe life of the Buddha: his birth  his attainment ofenlightenment and his passing away  all occurring on thefull-moon day of the month of May. This was therecommendation made by an international Buddhistconference held in Colombo last November and attendedby delegates from 26 countries. With the permission ofthe President  a draft resolution to this effect  sponsoredby a number of countries  will be introduced in theGeneral Assembly at its current session. The Governmentof Sri Lanka commends this draft resolution to theattention of the General Assembly.30"
"100",4213,"LSO",54,1999,"I extend my sincere andwarm congratulations to you  Sir  on your election asPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth4session. It is indeed gratifying to see a distinguishedstatesman and son of Africa lead the Assembly  especiallyone whose country was born out of the crusade of theUnited Nations for the freedom of colonial peoples. Yourpersonal devotion and commitment to the liberation struggleof the people of Namibia makes you eminently qualified tolead the United Nations in its search for peace. I amconfident that your experience  talent and energies willensure a successful outcome for the work of the session and I assure you of my country's support in all yourendeavours.I also pay a well-deserved tribute to your predecessor Mr. Didier Opertti  for the excellent manner in which hedischarged his duties as President of the Assembly at itslast session.To Secretary-General Kofi Annan  I extend mycountry's gratitude and support for his tireless efforts in thedaunting task of finding lasting solutions to problems thatface our Organization. We particularly commend him forhis latest brave efforts in East Timor.Permit me also to express my delegation's profoundjoy at seeing three States join the ranks of the Members ofthe United Nations. The addition of the Republic ofKiribati  the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tongato our Organization brings closer to fruition the hope of theinternational community to see the United Nationscomprising all the countries of the world. We say welcometo these new Members and extend to them a hand offriendship.I also wish to express my satisfaction with theSecretary-General's trenchant report on the work of theOrganization. In particular  I concur with his analysis of themoral dilemma that faces the United Nations when theSecurity Council is unable to act  because of a lack ofconsensus  in the face of the most heinous human rightsviolations. In those circumstances  and while conflictscontinue unabated in different parts of the world  thecapacity of the international conflict-resolution machineryis put to a severe test. Perhaps no conflict has done this asintensely as the one in Kosovo.The Kosovo crisis represented the very disturbingtrend towards the most serious violations of human rightsin the form of ethnic cleansing and impunity. After theexperience of Bosnia  which is still so fresh in our minds the world could not be expected to sit back and take noaction. It would indeed be a sad comment on the efficacyof the United Nations if the next millennium were to beginunder a cloud of tolerance of impunity in the face ofacknowledged genocide and other gross violations ofhuman rights. While it is recognized that the conflict wasan internal matter of Serbia  the dilemma was whether theworld could sit idly by and watch a people beingexterminated.The more difficult question that Kosovo raises is theone of the role of the Security Council in similar crises.The Charter places responsibility for the maintenance ofinternational peace and security squarely in the hands ofthe Security Council. That body must therefore dischargethis function with seriousness and firmness. It must resistthe temptation to view questions of international peaceand security through the lenses of national fears andpreoccupations. If it is paralyzed by parochial interests the temptation to take unilateral action increases. Thebelated submission of the Kosovo issue to the jurisdictionof the Security Council is therefore very welcome  as isthe United Nations involvement through its civilianadministration.In a similar vein is the tragedy that is East Timor whose denouement seems happily to be in sight. Aftermany years of inconclusive attempts to find a solution tothe problem of East Timor  the new Government inJakarta finally paved the way by allowing the people ofthat sad country to exercise their right to choose. Thecruel violence that was unleashed against them  however when they did express their preference in unequivocalterms is a source of great dismay. We are grateful therefore  that an international peacekeeping force hasnow entered the country and hope that it will bring thenightmare of the people of East Timor to an end. We callon the Government of Indonesia to bring to book theperpetrators of violations of human rights. We lookforward to welcoming East Timor in the councils ofindependent States in accordance with the wishes of itspeople.The last decade of the twentieth century has been atime of momentous changes in all parts of the world particularly in Africa  where for the first timeunprecedented democratic changes and reforms havetransformed the political landscape across the continent.We remain concerned  however  that the proliferation ofconflicts in Africa has had a serious negative impact onour development capacities  as these conflicts haveundermined efforts to improve the living conditions of ourpeoples and retarded progress towards Africa's economic social and political transformation.5The situation in Angola continues to be a source ofconcern for the people of Africa in general and thecountries of southern Africa in particular. As UNITAcontinues to perfect its war machine and effort  theprospects for peace have become more elusive. The peopleof Angola have endured hardship for more than 40 years when the years of the civil war are added to those of a verybrutal colonial war. There are millions of adults in thatcountry who have never lived in a state of peace. Theircountry is richly endowed with resources  and yet thesehave not been harnessed for combating the many evilsfacing the country  but have  on the contrary  been used forprosecuting a war that has impoverished the people beyondmeasure.The States of southern Africa will continue to searchfor a solution to the Angolan crisis. In this regard  theyexpect to receive the support of the international communityin the form of intensified sanctions against UNITA and itsleader  Mr. Savimbi  and increased humanitarian assistancefor the victims of the conflict.The crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congohas equally been a source of concern for the countries ofsouthern Africa since its inception  in view of itsimplications for the security of the region as a whole.Various efforts made under the auspices of the SouthernAfrican Development Community (SADC)  coordinated byPresident Chiluba of Zambia  in collaboration with theOrganization of African Unity (OAU)  the United Nationsand other interested parties  have started to bear fruit withthe signing of a Ceasefire Agreement in Lusaka on 10 July1999 by the heads of State of Angola  the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo  Namibia  Rwanda  Uganda andZimbabwe. The signing  finally  of this Agreement by therepresentatives of the rebel Congolese Rally for Democracyshould help to pave the way for a permanent and peacefulsolution.On the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea  we wishto commend the Organization of African Unity (OAU)Secretary-General for his untiring efforts to find a durablesolution to the problem. We believe that the OAUFramework Agreement remains the only viable option forthe resolution of that unfortunate conflict. We  therefore appeal to the two parties to the conflict to implement  assoon as possible  the technical arrangements worked out bythe OAU  the United Nations  Algeria and the UnitedStates.We continue to support the United Nations efforts tohold a referendum to determine the true wishes of thepeople of Western Sahara and once more appeal to theGovernment of Morocco to assist the process and ensureits success in accordance with the will of the Saharawipeople.In Sierra Leone we welcome the ceasefire that hasbeen arranged under the auspices of the President ofTogo. However  the settlement raises some troublingquestions. It is difficult to accept that those who holdgrievances against a legitimately elected Government canshoot their way into power-sharing  especially when theyhave been accused of the most chilling atrocities  asoccurred in Sierra Leone. Certainly those who areaggrieved have a right to challenge the governance oftheir Government  but this should be done within thelimits of constitutional order and propriety. In spite ofthese reservations  we wish the people of Sierra Leonewell and will continue to support their efforts to establishlasting peace in their country.We also wish to congratulate the countries of WestAfrica under the Economic Community of West AfricanStates (ECOWAS) Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) for thesacrifices they have made to bring about peace in theirneighbourhood.Regarding Palestine  all peace-loving people dreamof the day when the permanent status negotiations willcommence and soon be followed by a permanent peaceand a permanent State for the Palestinians. We thereforeencourage the parties to the Middle East conflict topersevere in their quest for the attainment of the goalwhich has eluded them for so long.The need to secure our global neighbourhood hasnever been greater. Unfortunately  the threat of weaponsof mass destruction continues to bedevil our hopes for apeaceful world  and there does not seem to be a globaldetermination to eliminate these weapons. This is sodespite the fact that over the years this Assembly hasadopted numerous resolutions on the issue of arms controland disarmament and in particular on the establishment ofnuclear-weapon-free zones in different regions of theworld. Unless the United Nations of the future is able tomake significant progress in nuclear disarmament  it runsthe risk of losing credibility as an institution dedicated tothe pursuit of peace. The United Nations of the twenty-first century  therefore  should be one which can givehumankind hope for a world of diminished poverty andno threat of a nuclear war.6Tomorrow  24 September  marks the third anniversaryof the opening for signature of the Comprehensive Test-BanTreaty (CTBT). It has long been accepted that the futurecredibility of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons (NPT) will depend on the effectiveimplementation of the CTBT. Convinced of the need toenhance the institutional fabric of the CTBT  Lesothodeposited its instrument of ratification of the CTBT withthe Secretary-General earlier this month  thus joining thesteadily increasing number of States that have so far ratifiedthe Convention. Lesotho supports the holding of the specialconference on the CTBT  as envisaged under article 14 ofthat Treaty  with a view to accelerating its ratification.In the midst of all these conflict situations is thedramatic and unacceptable deterioration in the level ofadherence to the norms of humanitarian law as oppositesides to a conflict indiscriminately and ruthlessly employany and all means that might advance their ends. Civilianpopulations have become the main targets and directvictims of fighting between hostile armies  with women andchildren suffering disproportionately from atrocities thatinclude rape  sexual exploitation  murder and the mutilationof civilians.The plight of the victims of these heinous crimesunderscores the imperative for the creation of a newjudicial body that would extend the rule of law in itsbroadest conception. Following the overwhelmingendorsement by 120 nations in Rome last summer of theidea to set up an International Criminal Court  the earlyestablishment of the Court is now a top priority. It isgratifying to see that just over a year since the conclusionof the Rome Treaty 86 States have reaffirmed theircommitment to the Court by signing the Treaty  while fourhave already ratified it. My Government remains committedto the early establishment of the International CriminalCourt and has every intention to abide by the terms of theInternational Criminal Court Treaty and will ratify it soon.In his report “Renewing the United Nations: AProgramme for Reform”  of 14 July 1997  the Secretary-General proposed the holding of a Millennium Assemblywith a summit segment in the year 2000  at which heads ofState and Government could “come together to articulatetheir vision of prospects and challenges for the newmillennium and agree on a process for fundamental reviewof the role of the United Nations.” (A/51/950  para. 91)For us in the developing world  the most crucialquestion facing the international community is how tobridge the huge gap between the haves and the have nots ofthis world. Unless we redouble our efforts in this regard our endeavours to curb such social ills as crime will be invain. By the same token  illegal immigration in search ofbetter living conditions elsewhere  which is the directconsequence of economic inequalities  will continue toincrease. It behooves us all  therefore  to treat the problemof poverty with all the seriousness it deserves  and thisfact must be reflected in the deliberations during themillennium summit.The Economic and Social Council deserves ourcongratulations for highlighting the problem during bothits high-level and operational activity segments this year.Of course  the problem of poverty has received UnitedNations attention on several occasions  most prominentlyduring the social summit of 1995 in Copenhagen  whenthe target of halving absolute poverty by the year 2015was agreed. Nevertheless  the problem is still with us andthere are no signs that it is abating; hence the need to re-dedicate ourselves to that noble goal.As is well known  Lesotho is one of the least-developed countries. It is in recognition of that fact thatwe are committing a considerable proportion of ourmeagre resources to the war against poverty. Amongother measures  we have decided to tackle educationaldeficiency in the country  which is one of the maincontributors to poverty. In this regard  Government hasbeen increasing the annual budget for education by 4 percent in real terms  and this increase has had a significantimpact on the delivery of education and the attainment ofan adult literacy rate of 70.5 per cent. Furthermore  theGovernment has recently announced its intention tointroduce free primary education beginning in the year2000.What we  however  find puzzling is the scepticismof some of our development partners regarding thesustainability of the programme. If its viability were acause for concern  we would have expected expressionsof support to ensure the success of such a worthyinitiative  which is in keeping with so many goals ofglobal conferences for poverty eradication.The rampant HIV/AIDS pandemic in sub-SaharanAfrica is putting an unbearable strain on already fragilehealth systems  eroding the gains made in child survivaland the achievement of better health. The combination ofHIV/AIDS and malaria is closely associated withincreases in maternal mortality and the significantreduction in life expectancy in many African countries.We commend the work of the United Nations system in7this regard  and in particular the indication that the responseof the United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS  inpartnership with various bodies  including the private sector is commensurate with the gravity of the situation. Theassistance of the international community is required tocontinue these efforts.The problem of external debt  which continues to bea developmental problem for Africa  received considerableattention at the recent Cologne Summit of the G-8  andpromising decisions were taken to relieve the debt of thehighly indebted poor countries. Lesotho appreciates thevarious initiatives to ameliorate the problem and in generalsupports them  including the effort to find appropriatefinancing mechanisms for the Heavily Indebted PoorCountries Debt Initiative. While Lesotho has successfullyendeavoured to meet its international financial obligationsand commitments  my Government is now faced with aheavy and unbearable burden of debt-servicing  which isconstraining our national development efforts. We thereforecall for a review of the Initiative  with a view tosubstantially relaxing the eligibility criteria so that debt-stressed countries like Lesotho may also benefit from it.The recent sale of gold reserves by some countries hasalready resulted in a substantial drop in the price of goldand the consequential closure of marginal gold mines inSouth Africa. The overall impact has been reducedemployment opportunities  not only in South Africa but alsoin neighbouring countries  such as Lesotho  which havetraditionally depended on employment in South Africangold mines. Let us take care not to create an Africanemployment crisis so soon after the Asian financial crisis.It is incumbent upon the international community to workwith affected countries to develop strategies for mitigatingthe negative effects of whatever mechanisms are agreed forfinancing the HIPC Initiative.The General Assembly decided at its fifty-secondsession to hold an event in the year 2001 for the purpose ofaddressing  in a holistic manner  the question of financingfor development in both its national and internationalaspects and in the context of globalization andinterdependence. We must face up to the fact thatdevelopment is in crisis and that  unless we take boldmeasures to find resources for financing it  the future ofmankind is bleak indeed. My delegation fully shares theview that through this process  which will also addressdevelopment through the perspective of finance  theinternational community will be afforded a uniqueopportunity to start the new millennium with a momentouspolitical gesture that demonstrates global solidarity for inter alia  poverty eradication and the attainment ofeconomic growth and sustainable development.It is in the interest of all countries to pursuedevelopment cooperation on the basis of genuinepartnership and mutually beneficial arrangements. Weremain convinced that the contemporary realities ofglobalization and liberalization make it clear that capitalflows from developed countries not only benefitdeveloping countries  but also combine in a dynamicprocess with the resources of developing countries in amanner that brings benefits to both developing anddeveloped countries.We also want to stress that every effort should bemade to narrow the gap between developing countries —in particular  the least developed countries  such asLesotho — and the developed countries. In this regard we await with anticipation the outcome of the review nextyear of the Plan of Action for the Least DevelopedCountries.It is worth repeating that when we adopted theProgramme of Action at the United Nations InternationalConference on Population and Development in Cairo inSeptember 1994  we were committing ourselves to thesupport of strategies aimed at enhancing the quality of lifefor families and individuals through recognition of theirrights to quality services. The Conference was indeed aturning point that marked a departure from the notion ofpopulation control to a human-rights-based approach inaddressing our demographic concerns.In conclusion  my delegation would like torededicate itself to the principles of democracy  goodgovernance  observance of human rights and the rule oflaw as the only way in which all of us can ensure aprosperous and lasting future for all our peoples."
"101",4239,"LTU",54,1999,"It is a special pleasurefor me to see Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab guiding the GeneralAssembly this session over the junction of two centuriesand millenniums. We will lend all possible support to hisendeavours  including through the PermanentRepresentative of Lithuania  who is also one of his Vice-Chairmen.Another landmark of this session is the fact that wehave grown. We welcome the Republic of Kiribati  theRepublic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga to thishouse of nations where all  large or small  are equal. Weare glad to see nations from the Pacific enrich theorganization. On behalf of the Lithuanian Government I31pay our deep respects to the Secretary-General  who hasalways been a brilliant servant of peace around the globe.Speakers before me have referred to the symbolicmeaning of this session of the General Assembly. It may bejust a simple turn of our calendar pages or we can make ita stepping-stone to a better world with less violence  morefood for the hungry  less deliberately caused suffering anddeath  more care for the helpless and more shelter for thehomeless.This century has taught us many lessons. Yet  even ifwe have avoided another world war  we have witnessed toomany wars. The nature of crises has changed. MemberStates should be able to find common ground in upholdingthe principles of the Charter and acting in defence ofhumanity. We should devise ways and means to preventhumanitarian catastrophes and alleviate profound humansuffering. Just this last year  Angola and Kosovo  SierraLeone and East Timor have posed new challenges to theUnited Nations and made us re-evaluate our actions inconflict prevention; the role of the United Nations SecurityCouncil and its interactions with regional organizations; theCouncil's credibility with regard to speed of deployment;the role of civilian police and civilian administration; andthe problem of impunity. When evidence of the murder ofhelpless people percolates through international borders  thedilemma emerging before the international communitybecomes a moral one of the sanctity of human life andstrict international standards.It is precisely towards this end that the United Nationssystem is undergoing changes. A number of administrativemeasures have been taken  especially those within thepower of the Secretary-General. One of the most urgentmeasures which must be taken is reform of the SecurityCouncil. The Council has too often been accused of failuresin the maintenance of international peace and security in thespecific cases I mentioned.The efficiency of the Security Council's actions can beenhanced by improving its representativeness  legitimacyand credibility  thus generating wider acceptance of itsdecisions. This would be possible primarily through anenlargement of the Council's membership. The two mostqualified industrialized countries could become permanentmembers of the Security Council: their membership wouldstrengthen the Council and ensure democratic decisions. Abroader representation of developing nations on the Councilwould also reinforce its legitimacy and enhance respect forit: they deserve additional seats  both permanent and non-permanent.In recent years we have seen the development of theUnited Nations response away from peacekeeping to moreactive conflict prevention and crises management ofcivilian. Internal crises often lead to the completedestruction of societies and their structures: repair andrehabilitation of collapsed countries by the internationalcommunity are needed.The United Nations needs both the means andcooperation from all if it is to fulfil its mandate in termsof its primary responsibility for maintaining internationalpeace and security. In this connection  Lithuania signed astandby agreement as early as the beginning of 1998 andprovided a detailed description of its contribution. Asubstantial part of our contribution is comprised of well-trained civilian policemen who are now doing their dutyby serving in Kosovo.A comprehensive set of political measures will haveto be elaborated before and adopted at the millenniumsummit  which should be a breath of fresh air for theOrganization. We take this seriously and are ready toassist in designing a meaningful future for the UnitedNations.Situations that deteriorate into conflicts are ignitedby a variety of causes  usually a combination of them.The wave of economic crashes that swept through Asia Latin America and some European countries has had aglobal impact. The quick recovery of many economiesshows that democracies with free market economies havethe strongest immunity against macroeconomic illnesses.Markets and democracy allow for the fairest distributionof resources within societies which would otherwise befeeling the pain of economic injustice.Similarly  concerns about the potential and actualviolence which more often occurs within than betweenStates are almost always well-founded in places with poorhuman rights records. No one today is surprised by newsof violence sparked by various rebel groups that feelmarginalized in the States where they live.Many instruments must still be designed to upholdthe principle that those responsible for gross violations ofhuman rights and crimes against humanity — who stillexpect impunity — must be held accountable. Theestablishment of the International Criminal Court is oneof the fruits of the new developments in internationalrelations. We are committed to the early entry into forceof the Rome Statute and to an effective InternationalCriminal Court.32Weaponry and armaments can be reduced throughcommon actions  regardless of borders. There is literally aconsensus among nations that weapons of mass destructionmust be eliminated  but in reality the process of nucleardisarmament is unacceptably precarious. We see reductionsin numbers of warheads in some places and thedevelopment of nuclear weapons in others. Also  thebiological and chemical weapons which States have reducedhave become available to non-State terrorist entities thatfeel almost no qualms about using them. I see no other wayto build a safer world than by reducing  eliminating andvery strictly prohibiting weapons of mass destruction andthe means for delivering them.Conventional arms and weapons are also weapons ofmass destruction of life: half a million lives in Rwandawere wiped out with clubs and machetes that can only beconsidered weapons. Lives are lost to firearms andlandmines all over the world  even in places that can hardlyqualify as battlegrounds. The elimination of landmines isunder way. Nowhere else but in this Hall can we begineffective conventional disarmament to be carried out underthe responsibility of all States.Europe happens to be blessed with good regionalsecurity instruments  the best of which was neverthelessinspired by the deaths of millions in senseless wars. TheEuropean security charter  the concepts for which are nowbeing discussed in the Organization for Security andCooperation in Europe (OSCE)  will further build on theideals of democracy  peace and unity set out in the Charterof Paris for a New Europe on the basis of the HelsinkiFinal Act. The implementation of OSCE principles including a country's right to choose its own securityarrangements  is fundamental to ensuring peace andsecurity. Finally  regional  subregional and bilateralpractical cooperative efforts do enhance broader Europeanendeavours and processes  including complementing — notundercutting — the work of other Euro-Atlantic institutions.We believe in collective security and have mademembership in effective alliances of democratic and peace-loving nations — the European Union and the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization — our priority. The collectivesecurity that we have chosen is the most efficient means ofmeeting our legitimate needs.Lithuania works actively in the Baltic region to createsecurity and stability based on cooperation and good-neighbourly relations. The Baltic Sea region is becomingone of the most stable and dynamic  developing andpromising regions in this part of the world.Nine days ago  Secretary-General Kofi Annan spokefrom this very podium about a progressing supremacy ofcollective needs over individual needs. In fact  his speechwas a testimony of brave and modern thought. It deservesa place in textbooks for politicians and diplomats.Conflicts are but one challenge for us. There are somany inhabitants on Earth who need our help yetsometimes cannot even ask for it. Children deserve ourstrongest love  and yet they are helplessly suffering inmany parts of the world. They do not realize that theadult world will soon celebrate the tenth anniversary ofthe adoption of the Convention on the Rights of theChild  which has been ratified or acceded to by 191countries — more than the number of United NationsMember States. It is the most universal human rightstreaty  the violation of which must be inconceivable andpunishable. The newly adopted Convention on theElimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour shouldalso become universal and support compliance.This year will also be the twentieth year since theadoption of the Convention on the Elimination of AllForms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). It issymbolic and crucial that this Convention has beenstrengthened by the optional protocol. Lithuania supportsthe proposal by Austria  after its adoption by the UnitedNations General Assembly  to have this new human rightsinstrument opened for signature on 10 December  whichmarks Human Rights Day 1999. States have to givewomen the chance to address their grievances to theCEDAW Committee as soon as possible  perhaps even atthe special session of the General Assembly on “Women2000: gender  equality  development and peace for thetwenty-first century” to be held in June in the year 2000.Ideals advocated by Woodrow Wilson at thebeginning of this century are celebrating their secondbirth at the very end of the century. I am convinced thatafter many ups and downs  the evolution of humankind isfinally taking the straight and right course."
"102",4283,"LUX",54,1999,"I shouldlike at the outset  Sir  warmly to congratulate you on yourelection to the presidency of the General Assembly  whichmarks the opening of the regular annual session. Your wiseand dynamic leadership will determine the scope andoutcome of our work.I would like also to thank Mr. Didier Opertti for hisdedication and commitment throughout the fifty-thirdsession of the General Assembly.Let me also reiterate Luxembourg's confidence  givenour Secretary-General's characteristic tireless determinationto promote dialogue  knowledge and mutual recognition that his efforts will lead to greater mutual understanding.The respect accorded to  and the effectiveness of  ourOrganization will depend on the strong cohesiveness of itsmembership. Within its modest means  my country intendsto contribute to this key objective. Luxembourg is proud ofhaving participated in the definition of the EuropeanUnion's core positions. These were explained to theAssembly by Mrs. Tarja Halonen  the Minister for ForeignAffairs of Finland  in the statement she made in hercapacity as current Chairman-in-Office of the EuropeanUnion.This fall will mark the tenth anniversary of the end ofthe cold war  which for more than four decades hamperedthe harmonious development of international relations.Among other things  it prevented our Organization fromfully discharging its mandate to maintain internationalpeace and cooperation. This anniversary is definitely ahappy one  even if much of what had been hoped for in1989 has failed to materialize and the consequences ofcertain upheavals are still being felt.Nonetheless  today's international environment hasseen far-reaching changes  and the internationalcommunity is now in a position to tackle very complexchallenges. My country hopes that this historicbreakthrough at century's end will be further consolidated.Today is my first opportunity to represent mycountry from this rostrum and to address the Assembly which comprises nearly all the countries of the world.Luxembourg is one of the founding Members of ourOrganization  and in October 1945  it was the smallest.Our presence in San Francisco was due to ourdetermination to cooperate with the internationalcommunity and to reaffirm our sovereignty. Today Iwould reiterate the commitment of the people ofLuxembourg to our Organization  which is called upon toplay a pivotal role in an international environment that isbecoming increasingly globalized yet  at the same time more and more fragmented.While the first aspect of this process  globalization is most apparent in the economic field  the second fragmentation  is more clearly felt in the political arena as social inequities are increasing. This process willundoubtedly result in very complex tensions  heighteningthose that already exist and creating new ones. These willhave to be analyzed and dealt with; to do this we willneed imagination  clear-sightedness and  above all  aneffective resolve and capacity to act. Our security andprosperity will depend on the way in which ourOrganization confronts these challenges.It would be unrealistic to expect a solution from theOrganization every time humanitarian disaster strikes ora conflict breaks out. There is no such thing as a worldgovernment  and it would be a disservice to the UnitedNations to fail to acknowledge this obvious fact.Nevertheless  the United Nations is a platform anda forum for negotiations at the global level  and weshould therefore exert every effort to ensure its smoothfunctioning. To do this it must have adequate funding toduty bound to respect their Charter obligation to pay infull  unconditionally and on time the amounts they owe tothe Organization. This also means that increasingly  the13major political orientations of the Organization are decidedupon by consensus  thereby ensuring the support of allStates for its actions. It also means that the effort to updateand reform the United Nations mechanisms still remainsfully relevant.It is only through cooperation  understanding andsolidarity  together with respect for commitments enteredinto and for the rule of law  that progress towards a truecohesiveness will be possible. All the Members of ourOrganization are directly responsible for ensuring that theircontribution to the common undertaking and to its progressis not lacking. This was the case during the decision tocreate an International Criminal Court. We have thusreached an important stage in the field of internationalethics and morality by providing ourselves with aninstrument through which those responsible for atrocities intime of war and for crimes against humanity will be heldto account. The international community will henceforth bemore vigilant and will no longer allow those who have beenfound guilty of such crimes to continue to enjoy impunity.My country will ratify the Statute of the Court as soon aspossible  and we hope that it will soon become a reality.My country's profound commitment to the EuropeanUnion  which is preparing to enlarge its membership  is asure reflection of our strong aspiration to strengthen boththe internal cohesion of the countries of the region and topromote cooperation at an international level. Thecontribution of the European Union to the life of ourOrganization is intended to be a driving force for its furtherdevelopment.Small countries like mine tend to develop an acuteawareness of their own vulnerability. This is often furtheraggravated by a considerable difficulty: that of makingknown to our foreign partners a little-known nationalreality. That explains our commitment to the vitality andsmooth functioning of intergovernmental organizations. Forus  the United Nations represents an irreplaceable forum forthe exchange of ideas and experiences  but to an evengreater extent it must be a tool for the maintenance ofinternational peace and security  development and respectfor universal values.A new Government has just taken office inLuxembourg. Its first task will be to ensure the continuityof our foreign commitments. But it also intends consistentlyto develop our policy of demonstrating our presence participation and solidarity at the international level. Thisdetermination will be expressed through the majorintergovernmental organizations  which define the rules ofcoexistence between nations and peoples. The UnitedNations unquestionably takes pride of place among them.My Government also intends to further develop itsrelations with the more remote regions of the world. Thisis an effort to respond to a real deficiency  which can beexplained by our size and our limited human resources. Itis important for us to remedy that situation through abalanced programme of contacts. The United Nations  andthe presence of numerous delegations at United NationsHeadquarters in New York and at Geneva  will doubtlessprovide us opportunities conducive to achieving that end.The United Nations Development ProgrammeHuman Development Report this year undertakes an in-depth analysis of the phenomenon of globalization. Itclearly brings out the beneficial aspects and theopportunities provided by this process  while at the sametime showing the negative consequences  which are veryserious and worrying: instability in financial relations high unemployment  an unsteady job market  the ravagesof AIDS  the increasing inequalities between North andSouth  the extension of those inequalities to the field ofknowledge and the constantly growing marginalization ofa large number of developing countries.The political and social effects of thesedevelopments are no less worrying: increasedimpoverishment  new forms of crime and violence increased migration  the destabilization of States and thegrowing number of conflicts. Faced with these issues  theStates Members of this Organization have a majorresponsibility to assume. The proposals contained in thereport therefore deserve constructive examination  and mydelegation is ready to take part in it. Ensuring that thereis a social and ethical dimension to globalization  agreeingon new rules for good world governance and protectingthe environment are some of the major issues to beagreed on in forthcoming discussions. That is why weintend to deepen our commitment in areas related tohuman development.The fight against poverty  which the United Nationshas declared to be a priority objective  cannot beconducted only in the economic sphere. It should be partof an overall plan that also deals with related factors suchas the lack of family care facilities  shortcomings ineducation and health and insufficient administrativestructures. A reallocation of resources is also required aspart of this effort. In that spirit  Luxembourg is now inthe process of meeting the targets of our Organization.Starting in the year 2000  it will be devoting 0.7 per cent14of its gross national product to official developmentassistance. The Government of Luxembourg has decided toincrease that contribution to 1 per cent of its gross nationalproduct over the next five years. Education and health willbe priority areas for our cooperation.During the negotiations in the Millennium Round inthe World Trade Organization we must take account of thatcontext and pay particular attention to the interests of thedeveloping countries. We also support all the effortsdesigned to alleviate the debt problem  particularly in thecase of the least developed countries.The vast majority of the people of Luxembourg upholda model of society that strikes a fair balance between freeenterprise and social justice. This model of a social marketeconomy ensures development and social cohesion  even ifit may require periodic adjustment. This should prove aninspiration at the regional and international levels.Through the experience that we have gained over oneand a half centuries of independence  Luxembourg isconvinced that the principles of democracy  respect forhuman rights  the functioning of the rule of law and thetransparent and ordered management of public affairs arethe essential elements that help to promote development.The major conferences that have taken place during the pastdecade on the subjects of human rights  social development population  the advancement of women and humansettlements have opened a new era of constructive dialogueand shared responsibility  which has made a majorcontribution to defining and redefining the action of theUnited Nations in the field of development. We mustensure that henceforth there will be coordinated  integratedand effective follow-up to the steps that have been taken.Those who represent civil society  the non-governmental organizations  are essential partners of ourGovernments in the implementation of the programmes andaction plans developed and adopted during the majorconferences. It is those people who work in the field indirect contact with women  men and children who are at thevery centre or our efforts. We therefore attach greatimportance to their close association with the follow-upprocess for the conferences and the preparations for futureactivities.Other meetings are in preparation  notably those on thesubjects of racism and development financing. Each ofthese initiatives is part of our effort to promote a fairer andmore equitable society  both internationally and within ourown national societies. The United Nations serves as acatalyst in this process. It is undeniable that in this fieldour Organization has found an innovative and useful roleto play.It is indeed paradoxical that a decade that wasoriginally marked by a desire for openness has ended witha disturbing new outbreak of bloody conflicts andpractices that we thought had become things of the past.How can we overlook the growing number ofhumanitarian tragedies and fail to see the increasingexpressions of nationalism  intolerance and refusal toaccept those who are different? They highlight thehistorical or newly erected barriers which have madeimpractical any dialogue between majorities andminorities.In these circumstances  there is a new requirement.As the Secretary-General has said  strict adherence to thetraditional concept of State sovereignty is no longersufficient to meet present-day realities. We mustinvestigate new ways to live together in society that willrespect the character of each individual. We must findways to improve the functioning of democracy so that itwill be better able to accommodate internal diversity.This Organization  especially the organ responsiblefor the maintenance of international peace and security has not been given sufficient means to adapt to newsituations. The structures of the Security Council areinadequate after several decades during which it has beenimpossible to carry out a thorough review. Althoughdiscussions on Council reform have been under way formore than five years  there is a prevailing feeling ofpowerlessness. It seems unlikely that any new movementcan result from the repeated clash of known positions.Since last autumn  Security Council action has beenhamstrung by the reemergence of schisms harking backto a bygone age. Now as then  the result is an inability toact  so the matter of Iraq has been bogged down. Formore than a year  Council members have been unable towork together and formulate a viable monitoring systemthat would guarantee that the Iraqi regime no longerpossesses weapons of mass destruction. This disputebenefits only those who continue to flout internationallaw. The credibility of the United Nations can hardly gainfrom this prevarication.The recent political and humanitarian crisis inKosovo has shown that the community of nations nolonger has either sufficient determination or sufficientmeans to prevent tragedies of that scale. In the face of the15horror of ethnic cleansing  a number of countries wereobliged to shoulder their responsibilities. The tragicdeterioration of the situation on the ground and the lack ofrealism at the negotiating table made military actioninevitable. My country demonstrated its active solidarityduring that tragedy  because a passive response to suchcrimes is no more acceptable in the international arena thanit is at home. Today  pacification is under way in Kosovo but minorities must be protected  respect for the law mustbe guaranteed  and democratic institutions must be set up.The Organization  in collaboration with other institutions has taken these tasks in hand.The international community's commitment to buildmulti-ethnic  multicultural  democratic societies in theBalkans holds out to the Serbian leadership and the Serbianpopulation the prospect of a peaceful  secure andprosperous future in the community of Europe. It is up tothem to seize this opportunity.The Secretary-General has said that United Nationsaction cannot stop until stability  security and peace returnto the entire African continent. That goal is far from havingbeen achieved  with serious conflicts taking place in centralAfrica and in Angola. But there are glimmers of light inSierra Leone  in the Democratic Republic of the Congo andin the Horn of Africa. The crises there  while not yetresolved  are at least on the path of negotiation. It isencouraging to note that this progress has been achievedthanks to the active participation of the countries of theregion.We cannot allow the fate of Africa to slip out of thefield of action of the international community. We mustcontrol the diverse situations relating to politics development and the democratization of society to enablethe continent to recover its proper place in the comity ofnations. That can be achieved only through sustained concerted medium-term and long-term action by theinternational community and by the United Nations system.My country will participate fully in these efforts.In East Timor it seemed that  after 25 years ofinjustice and oppression  there was a process that wouldgive the Timorese people an opportunity peacefully to takecharge of their future. Their desire for independence wasfreely and clearly expressed under United Nations auspices.Despite the Indonesian authorities having committedthemselves to guaranteeing order and security before andafter the popular consultation  grave violations occurred inEast Timor  followed by massacres and the large-scaledeportation of civilians. We welcome the dispatch of amultinational force under United Nations authority to puta rapid end to the violence and the atrocities  and torepatriate people in decent conditions. We support theefforts of the Secretary-General and of the United NationsMission in East Timor to continue the process leading tothe independence of East Timor. We must quicklyimprove the island's humanitarian situation  whichcontinues to deteriorate  inflicting suffering on thepopulation concerned.In the Middle East  after years of deadlock  Israelisand Palestinians have resumed negotiations with theparticipation of other parties to the peace process  withthe declared intention of concluding them by the autumnof 2000  which would coincide with the MillenniumAssembly. Could anyone imagine a finer symbol ofconcerted international action to restore peace andsecurity than lasting reconciliation in a land that is thecradle of so many religions and so many civilizations?The Millennium Summit will give us the chance totake stock of what has been accomplished and of what thecomplex decade of the 1990s has brought us  as well asto chart the course for future action. The Secretary-General has outlined this in his report on the work of theOrganization. We must give him effective tools toforestall catastrophes  whether caused by the elements orby the hand of man  and to coordinate our work tominimize the consequences of tragedies we are unable toavert.In declaring its determination to tackle humanitarianchallenges in a spirit of prevention rather than of reaction the Organization has set itself an ambitious goal. It is upto us to prove our will and our capacity to workeffectively to reach that goal."
"103",4309,"LVA",54,1999,"It is a great honour for me to address theAssembly at its fifty-fourth session  and its President  Mr.Theo-Ben Gurirab. You may be assured  Sir  of myhighest respect  and may I extend to you my best wishesfor success in your efforts.This fifty-fourth Assembly  the last before the year2000  inevitably gives us food for thought. On the onehand  it urges us to turn to the achievements and themajor successes of which the United Nations can rightlybe proud. On the other hand  it urges us to rise to all thechallenges which the new millennium will not fail to putbefore us. May our debates here help establish peace andsecurity throughout the world  settle conflicts and developinnovative solutions to the problems we will have to face.The noble ideals which have guided the UnitedNations over the years have neither become outdated norlost their relevance. Peace in the world  combatingpoverty  defending human rights — this is a programmewhich is still in force and whose goals could not be moreclear-cut. It is rather like the struggle of the mythical heroagainst the Hydra: he cuts off one head and nine moregrow in its place. Nevertheless  we cannot possibly giveup the fight and we must not drop our guard  not if theworld we wish to build is a civilized one.8(spoke in English)The fifty-fourth General Assembly of the UnitedNations is being held at a time when the United Nationssystem has experienced a certain amount of strain and isfaced with important challenges. These have given rise toquestions about the effectiveness and the very relevance ofthis body within the contemporary international system.This scepticism ranges from concerns about the capabilityof the Organization to address regional conflicts and theneeds of the developing world  to concerns about budgetarymanagement problems. No doubt there is some basis foreach of those concerns. Nevertheless  they should notundermine the fundamental importance of a truly globalOrganization which over a period of decades has earnedrespect around the world. Our ranks are constantly growing and the United Nations continues to approach the goal oftruly worldwide representation.Let me take this opportunity to congratulate theRepublic of Kiribati  the Republic of Nauru and theKingdom of Tonga upon their admission to United Nationsmembership.The reform process of the United Nations is underway  and my country  Latvia  fully supports it. After all Member States are the ones that set the agenda of theOrganization  and it will be the quality and commitment ofeach State that will ultimately determine the success orfailure of our common efforts.Some of the negative feelings about the UnitedNations stem from excessive expectations. One cannot viewthe United Nations as a panacea  particularly wheredecisions on long-lasting regional problems are concernedor when preventive actions on a regional level are longoverdue. Yet even in those situations a modern UnitedNations system is expected to seek earlier and moreeffective involvement than was the case in South-EastEurope  East Timor or the Middle East. It must be stressedthat the painful refugee crisis of Kosovo could not possiblybe resolved without the direct involvement of the UnitedNations and its institutions. But  sadly  the maximumpotential of the United Nations cannot always be utilizedbecause of prejudice  lack of political will or perceivedpolitical ambitions. Let us not forget that the costs of ourreluctance to take action are extremely high: too often ourreluctance results in the deaths of innocent people and isthe cause of wholesale destruction which may take yearsand decades to remedy.The topical issues of cooperation  conflictprevention  non-proliferation  arms control anddisarmament  humanitarian questions  environmentalprotection  poverty eradication and gender equality needto be addressed on a global scale. Without a doubt  theUnited Nations and its institutions must play anincreasingly important role in resolving these issues.Since the mandate of the United Nations is to servehumanity  the United Nations should observe the principleof universality. The United Nations capacity for conflictprevention and preventive diplomacy is by no meansexhausted and further attention should be paid to fosteringthe observance of these preventive principles throughoutthe world.Even as we speak here today  many people in thisworld are suffering at the hands of terrorists or live underterrorist threat. Any instances of terrorism should beuniversally condemned  and steps must be taken tostrengthen the international response to this problem.For the United Nations to become a truly modernOrganization  it must reflect the new realities of achanged international context. Reform of the SecurityCouncil remains central to the revitalization programmeof the United Nations and should reflect both the needs ofthe international community and present-day realities. Theacquisition or possession of nuclear weapons must nolonger be the basis for super-Power status  and the futuremodel of the Council will have to reflect this reality. Thatmodel should also make the Council more open to theviews and contributions of smaller States and non-permanent members.How does Latvia see its contribution to the newUnited Nations? My country is one of those nations thatcould not be a part of the United Nations at its inception;because freedom of choice was forbidden our peoplewhen Latvia lost its independence in 1940  we havespecial respect for this principle today. We also reserve aspecial place in our hearts for the United Nations becauseit was the first international Organization which we joinedafter the restoration of independence in 1991. It was amoment of celebration  pride and even euphoria as justiceprevailed and a long struggle to join the community ofnations finally came to an end.But our people quickly realized that we were nowsetting out along a new road. After a 50-year delay Latvia was faced with the task of becoming an equal responsible and contributing member of a new Europeand a new  globalized international community.9Membership in the United Nations was just the firststep along that road towards reasserting our national andour human rights. More importantly  we recognized ourresponsibility to help other nations setting out on this path.Yet  even at the very end of this century  we stillencounter thinking which a priori denies the right of nationsto choose their own destiny. Thankfully  such views arebecoming less and less acceptable as the years go by. ForLatvia  as a free and sovereign nation  the last few yearshave been a remarkably successful period of activeintegration into the international community  of internalrestructuring  of wide-ranging reforms and societalregeneration. Fifty years of occupation have left us with aheavy social  economic and psychological legacy  but wehave made tremendous efforts to overcome this in everyway. The support offered by the United Nations in thisonerous task has been of enormous significance and Ishould like to take this opportunity to reiterate the heartfeltappreciation of Latvia for the invaluable assistance providedby the United Nations.During this century Latvia has made a remarkableturnaround. It has gone from the depths of tragedy to theheights of success. In a few short years  Latvia has growninto a politically stable State with strong democraticinstitutions and practices. Latvia has restored a thrivingmarket economy and a deep respect for individual rightsand freedoms. Over the past few years and with the help ofthe international community  Latvia has attached particularimportance to the process of forming a fully integrated harmonious society. It is a challenging but criticallyimportant task for my country  the more so because of theburdens imposed by our historical legacy. We perceive it asan ongoing process that involves many cultural andeducational aspects and includes the important element ofthe individual’s right to choose. Our goal is to give eachresident of our country an equal opportunity to contributeto a civic identity that shares common goals and valueswith all Europe. As part of this programme  my countrywill continue to attach particular importance tostrengthening the role of the Latvian language andincorporating minorities into the everyday affairs of thecountry.Latvia believes in complementarity between regionaland global efforts. For Latvia  integration into Europeremains a high priority but it is not the end of the road.Integration into the transatlantic security alliance would bea prudent step but not a sufficient one. For Latvia tosucceed  and for the people of Latvia to have the fullopportunity they deserve to live secure  healthy andprosperous lives  Latvia must be integrated into thepolitical  business and intellectual exchange of the globalcommunity.We are very proud that on 10 February 1999 Latviabecame the first Baltic State to join the World TradeOrganization as a full-fledged member.Within the range of its capabilities  Latvia hasparticipated in peace operations in the Balkans and hascontributed to relieving the suffering of Kosovo refugees.Latvia has been an active contributor to UnitedNations revitalization through its membership in theEconomic and Social Council and the Commission onHuman Rights.Latvia has put forward its candidature for theSecurity Council elections in 2005. This spring mycountry signed the Statute of the International CriminalCourt and is currently planning the ratification process.A very visible indication of our appreciation of thework of the United Nations and a concrete manifestationof Latvia’s support for the Secretary General’sprogramme for United Nations reform is our donation ofa historic  fully renovated building in the centre of ourcapital as a shared home for all United Nations agenciesin Latvia. On 16 July this year  and as one of my firstofficial functions as President  I had the pleasure ofparticipating in the official inauguration of the UnitedNations House in Riga  one of the first United NationsHouses in Europe and the very first in our region.I should like to express my country’s full support forthe proposed Millennium Assembly of 2000 and trust thatit will become a landmark in setting our sights for thetwenty-first century.May the results of the fifty-fourth session of theGeneral Assembly advance our common cause at thedawn of the new millennium."
"104",4356,"MAR",54,1999,"It givesme great pleasure to congratulate you  Mr. President  andthe sisterly country of Namibia on your election to chair25the proceedings of the fifty-fourth session of the GeneralAssembly. This choice is truly an honour for our continentand a tribute to your promising country. We are convincedthat under your leadership our work this year will besuccessful  and this session will constructively result in therealization of our expectations.I would also like to express appreciation and gratitudeto your predecessor  Mr. Didier Opertti  Foreign Minister ofthe friendly country of Uruguay  for his excellent conductof the work of the previous session.We also welcome the new Member States that havejoined our Organization: the Republic of Kiribati  theRepublic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga.I should also like to take this opportunity to thank theSecretary-General of our Organization  Mr. Kofi Annan  forhis admirable management of the Organization and for hiscommendable efforts to infuse it with a new dynamism sothat its organs can fulfil our aspirations. He deserves ouradmiration and appreciation.Many important events have marked this century towhich we are about to bid farewell. They have led to a newpolitical and economic balance of power and a modificationof the international system. With the disintegration ofborders  the evolution of means of communication and thespread of globalization in the financial and technologicalfields  the universality of the issues affecting mankind hasbecome the most distinctive characteristic of internationalrelations  and the problems of the age have become toodifficult for individual countries to resolve.The tragedies witnessed over the last few years including ethnic cleansing and blatant defiance of theuniversal human conscience  call more than ever before forpooling the efforts of the international community andconsolidating the role and the efficiency of the UnitedNations  which is indeed the best-suited forum for settlinginternational disputes. This would make it possible for theOrganization to fully shoulder its responsibilities and keepabreast of current challenges  while displaying a politicalwill that would enhance its credibility and strengthen itsability to achieve its goals.As regards the Security Council  current events on theinternational scene require that we reconsider its workingmethods and its composition in order to enhance itscredibility  promote its ability to preserve internationalpeace and security and ensure balanced representation in itsmembership on the basis of equitable geographicaldistribution.Economic and social conditions in the world stillrank high among the concerns of mankind. Indeed  asillustrated by widely divergent indicators between theNorth and the South  the world is suffering from awidening gap in economic and social conditions andstrong disparities in human development. Those ever-increasing disparities constitute a basic factor in theinstability that characterizes our world today. Thisimbalance has led to a proliferation of poverty in variousparts of the world  as well as to the spread of illiteracy unemployment and several other social ills that nowthreaten world peace and security.We recall with appreciation the distinguished roleplayed by the United Nations  as it has developed overthe last few years a special interest in various economicand social development issues.Morocco is fully aware of the importance of socialdevelopment as a fundamental means of achievingcomprehensive development. This awareness was thecornerstone of several pioneering initiatives taken byMorocco to overcome social problems  especially theplague of poverty. To that end  an institution known asthe Mohammed V Solidarity Foundation was set up  andis now under the supervision of His Majesty KingMohammed  to fight poverty by mobilizing the activecomponents of civil society.In keeping with its firm belief that individual andcollective prosperity cannot take place outside thepurview of democracy and respect for human rights Morocco has taken keen interest in the consolidation ofhuman rights and democratic practices. Hence  Moroccohas undertaken some pioneering initiatives in the area ofpromoting human rights  disseminating a human rightsculture  and protecting them against any violation ortransgression. It has enhanced the role of the variouscomponents of civil society  including institutions thatpromote the role of women  in various political economic  social and cultural fields. Opting for themultiparty system and democratic alternation ofgovernment as a political system  Morocco has madehuman rights and fundamental freedoms an individual anda collective principle that is considered a strong pillar ofthe Moroccan political system. This  in turn  has made itpossible for Morocco to hold a distinguished positionamong the countries that have adopted democracy as asystem and as a way of life.26Convinced of the absolute necessity of coexistencewith its neighbours  in keeping with the strong historicalties between Morocco and Spain  and given the desire ofboth countries to further enhance their cooperation andgood neighbourliness  Morocco has been calling for theimplementation of the initiative of the late King Hassan IIaimed at setting up a joint Moroccan-Spanish workinggroup to reach a final settlement of the current status of thetwo cities  Ceuta and Melilla  and the neighbouring islands in a way that ensures Morocco’s sovereignty over thoseregions while guaranteeing Spain’s economic interests. Wedo hope that the deep historical ties between the twocountries  the solid and privileged relations that existbetween them  and the ambitions of both peoples to achievefurther rapprochement and cooperation  will be a strongincentive towards reaching a final solution to this problem satisfactory to both parties.Ever since their independence  Arab Maghrebcountries have believed in the inevitable necessity toachieve regional integration in order to counter thechallenges of development and to ensure the progress andprosperity of their peoples. In keeping with thoseobjectives  the Arab Maghreb Union was set up as areflection of the region’s age-old shared history and anembodiment of its peoples’ unity of faith  language  historyand common destiny. Given the blocs and groupings thatcharacterize the world today and the challenges imposed bythe current economic situation  we believe that it isnecessary to pursue efforts to give fresh impetus to theArab Maghreb Union as well as a new dynamism to itsvarious organs  while strengthening cooperation among itsmembers so that it may discharge its mission by taking updevelopment challenges and building an integrated Maghrebeconomy.Morocco welcomes with deep satisfaction the positivedevelopments witnessed on the Lockerbie issue  which haveled to the suspension of the sanctions imposed on thesisterly Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. Because of its solidaritywith that country  a founding member of the Arab MaghrebUnion and one of the pioneering leaders among Arab andAfrican countries  Morocco notes with deep regret the longlasting hardships and the grave tragedy endured by theLibyan people due to the embargo imposed on them. Wehope that sanctions applied to the Libyan Arab Jamahiriyawill be completely and definitively lifted as soon aspossible  on the basis of the principles of justice and equity and that the sisterly Libyan Arab Jamahiriya will resume itsconstructive role  within the international community  forthe establishment of security  stability and peace.The international community has followed withsatisfaction the beginning of a comprehensive settlementof the Middle East crisis. This has been achieved throughvarious agreements reached by the parties concerned  thelatest being the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum. Thoseaccords rekindled the hopes of the peoples of the regionin building a new future based on security  stability andcoexistence. The agreements that have been signed —which are founded on the principle of land for peace —set the stage for a new era based on international law  asattested to by the commitments made by the partiesconcerned. The accords uphold the right of all peoples ofthe region to live in security and stability  and the right ofthe Palestinian people in particular to exercise self-determination and to establish its independent State.The brotherly Iraqi people have been suffering foryears from the impact of an economic embargo that hashad pernicious effects on them  especially children women and the elderly. As it voices full solidarity withthe fraternal Iraqi people  Morocco calls for the poolingof international efforts in order to lift the embargo and tofind a peaceful settlement to this problem within theframework of international law and in compliance withSecurity Council resolutions. In this respect  we stress theneed to preserve the sovereignty of Iraq  its security andits territorial integrity.Solving the many problems affecting Africa requiresthat the international community seriously tackle theeconomic and social conditions and the various conflictsthat beset most African countries  conditions that havehad a negative effect on the hopes of African peoples  aswell as on their legitimate right to achieve comprehensivedevelopment and to live under stable and safe conditions.Being deeply committed to our ties of brotherhoodand solidarity with all African countries  Morocco hasconsistently placed African issues at the forefront of itsconcerns. As a token of its unwavering solidarity withAfrican countries  Morocco devotes 95 per cent of itsannual international assistance appropriations to Africancountries.Morocco has followed with keen interest theinternational endeavours aimed at restoring peace inKosovo and at putting an end to the bloody conflict andethnic-cleansing campaigns that have claimed the lives ofthousands of innocents Kosovars  in blatant violation ofinternational law and of the most fundamental principlesof human rights. Given its keen desire to strengthen peacein the region  Morocco has expressed its readiness to27participate in KFOR and has made all possible humanitarianefforts to provide material assistance to Kosovar refugees.To this end  it also set up  at the initiative of Her RoyalHighness Princess Lalla Meryem  a fund to collectdonations for Kosovar children.Because of its geographical location  its historical tiesand its economic and cultural relations with Mediterraneancountries  Morocco believes that the consolidation ofsecurity and stability and the promotion of cooperation inthe region are an absolute necessity. Thus Morocco tookpart in the Euro-Mediterranean dialogue  from theBarcelona conference to the Stuttgart conference  whichprovided an opportunity to assess the Barcelona processthree years after its inception. During the Stuttgartconference Morocco voiced its conviction that for securityand stability to prevail in the Mediterranean basin there hasto be an effective partnership between the countries of theregion that takes into consideration the political  economic social and cultural dimensions.The Kingdom of Morocco has always taken a greatinterest in the question of disarmament  because it is linkedboth to international peace and security and to economicand social development. In this respect  we reiterate theneed to ensure that all the countries of the Middle Eastregion join the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons and submit their facilities to the safeguardssystem of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Thisaction  along with making the Middle East region a nuclear-weapons-free zone  would be a decisive contribution torestoring confidence and peace in that region.As regards the question of the referendum in oursouthern desert provinces  Morocco reiterates its fullsupport for the efforts of the United Nations  especiallythose of the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  aimed atcompleting the process as soon as possible and underconditions most conducive to transparency  justice andsuccess. As a contribution towards that objective  Moroccohas endeavoured  from the start of the process  to informthe United Nations of any deviations that might affect thelegitimate rights of the potential participants in thereferendum. Thus  following the publication of the first partof the preliminary lists of the Sahraouis that have beenidentified  Morocco expressed concern over practices thathave affected the identification process and have led to theelimination of thousands of names of people of Sahraouiorigin  despite the fact that they had met the agreed criteriaand conditions.It is our dearest hope that the United Nations willcome up with equitable solutions that take intoconsideration our concerns and those of thousands ofSahraoui candidates who  had they not been compelled toleave the region because of the fight they were wagingagainst colonialism  would have been covered by thecensus and therefore been accepted directly by theIdentification Commission.The phenomenon of economic globalization has beenswiftly developing and expanding. It has led to aliberalization of markets  swifter exchange relations enhanced global productivity and greater financial flows.The economic changes affecting the international arenacall for a comprehensive review of the rules ofinternational economic interactions in order to adapt themto those changes and to the development needs of all ofhumanity. This aspect was at the forefront of the concernsof His Majesty King Mohammed VI in the address hedelivered  when he was Crown Prince  on the occasion ofthe fiftieth anniversary of the multilateral trading system celebrated in Geneva in 1998. His Majesty pointed outthat“the comprehensive project advocated by thefounders of our system remains fragile because ofthe fate of hundreds of millions of people who willnot accept indefinite marginalization whiletremendous progress and prosperity are beingenjoyed by the advanced countries of the world.”In future negotiations  and within the framework ofthe World Trade Organization  Morocco is of the viewthat the adoption of a global and balanced approachreflecting the legitimate interests of all countries  whiletaking into account the developmental dimension ofadvanced countries  should be the best means to achievea just and balanced international trade system. Moroccobelieves that effective solutions to the debt problemshould not be restricted to partial alleviation of the debtburden of some countries only  but should  rather  takethe form of a comprehensive policy to stimulate theeconomic activity of debt-ridden developing countriesthrough promoting their exports and encouraging directforeign investments in them.Following the ninth ministerial meeting of the Groupof 77 and China — which I had the honour of chairingand which was held in Marrakesh  Morocco  from 13 to16 September 1999  in preparation for the tenth session ofthe United Nations Conference on Trade and28Development — the Group of 77 and China adopted theMarrakesh Declaration  which pointed out that“the disparities in the scope and impact ofglobalization have led to economic disharmony  bothat the international and national levels. This translatesinto new challenges to our development ambitions.Many developing countries are facing difficulties intheir attempts to effectively integrate with the worldeconomy and are suffering the consequences ofglobalization.”In conclusion  we believe that  as we stand on thethreshold of the new millennium  the internationalcommunity should exert greater efforts to create a political economic and social environment conducive to furthercooperation and rapprochement among peoples  so that allof mankind can enjoy the fruits of peace and live inprosperity and tranquility."
"105",4380,"MCO",54,1999,"Allow me at the outset to congratulate you warmly Mr. President  on your well-deserved election and to assureyou of the delegation of Monaco's full cooperation inassisting you in the discharge of your lofty mandate. Yourrole in your country's exemplary struggle for independenceand for the dignity of the Namibian people are deeplymeaningful for us.I should like also to thank the members of the GeneralAssembly for entrusting to my country one of the vice-presidencies of this fifty-fourth session  at the same time asMonaco is commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of theaccession of His Most Serene Highness Prince RainierIII — my father. I wish to assure the Assembly that thedelegation of Monaco will strive to be worthy of thishonour and to work closely with the other members of theBureau — whom I congratulate on their election — and themembers of the Assembly  to ensure that this session  thelast of the century  produces effective  concrete andtangible results.I avail myself of this opportunity to thank alsoMr. Didier Opertti  President of the fifty-third session ofthe General Assembly  for his dedication and accessibilityand for the competence and diplomatic skill with whichhe guided our work.I should like also to congratulate and warmlywelcome the three new States Members of the UnitedNations — the Republic of Kiribati  the Republic ofNauru and the Kingdom of Tonga. The Government andpeople of Monaco are particularly pleased to greet thesethree countries of the Pacific  with which we share anumber of concerns about the protection of the oceansand seas. We assure them of our readiness to enter intoand develop a solid and fruitful cooperation with them.Finally  I should like most sincerely to express mysatisfaction  as many have already done from this rostrum at the resumption of the peace process in the Middle Eastand the immense hopes to which it has given rise.Since the general debate of the previous session many distressing events have unfolded  some of whichhave had serious consequences that will last for years.The conflict in Kosovo  with the thousands of refugeesand the massive suffering that it caused  was one of themost obvious. The whole of the United Nations systemwas mobilized  in a way that has certainly never happenedbefore  to assemble the resources required to come to theaid of the populations in distress. The armed interventionand the decisive role played by the International CriminalTribunal for the former Yugoslavia at The Hague  broughtto bear in defence of the principles of humanity andhuman rights  seem to foreshadow a strengtheneddetermination on the part of the international communityto enforce respect for the fundamental values of justiceand human dignity that inspired the San FranciscoCharter.We offer our sincere encouragement to the UnitedNations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo as itstrives  despite the major difficulties in its way  toimplement the provisions of Security Council resolution1244 (1999). We wish courage  perseverance and successto the men and women responsible for carrying out thatnoble mandate of ensuring security  extinguishing theflames of hate and restoring good-neighbourly relationsamong the communities.12I should also like to emphasize the crucial role playedby the United Nations in holding the election on self-determination in East Timor and in the protection operationthat our Organization has recently launched to come to theaid of the civilian population there. We are followingdevelopments on the ground extremely carefully  and wehope that implementation of Security Council resolution1264 (1999) will proceed without hindrance or delay.In this context  we should recall the very enlighteningdebate held by the Security Council on 12 February on theissue of the protection of civilians in armed conflict  duringwhich the subject of internal conflicts  which have nowbecome more numerous than those between States  wasdiscussed at length. It was recalled that such conflicts fallunder the purview of the 1949 Geneva Conventions  whosefiftieth anniversary we have just commemorated  especiallythe provisions of the Fourth Convention. Article 3  whichis common to all four instruments  imposes rules of conductthat are binding on the High-Contracting Parties  whateverthe circumstances and nature of the conflict. That articlecategorically prohibits any kind of attack on the life andphysical and moral integrity of the person  as well as thepassing of sentences and the carrying out of executionswithout previous judgement or indispensable judicialguarantees.On 16 and 17 September  a further debate took placein the Security Council on the same issue  the positiveresult of which was the adoption of resolution 1265 (1999) which makes considerable demands on both States and theinternational community as a whole. It stresses in particularthat it is incumbent on States to put and end to impunityand to prosecute those responsible for genocide  crimesagainst humanity and serious violations of internationalhumanitarian law. The Principality of Monaco unreservedlyendorses these recommendations  which we consider to beextremely important.We have very high hopes for the establishment of theInternational Criminal Court as a means of betterpreventing war crimes and crimes against humanity. ThePrincipality of Monaco was one of the first signatories ofthe Statute  which was adopted last year.In Kosovo  in East Timor and in conflicts that areoften forgotten or that receive no recognition  particularlythose in Africa  it is the weakest and the most vulnerable particularly children  who suffer most. With the tenthanniversary of the United Nations Convention on the Rightsof the Child taking place on 20 November  it is up to usnow more than ever to see to it that children  in peace aswell as in war  are strictly protected from all forms ofviolence and subjugation. Following on from thepresidential statement of June 1998  Security Councilresolution 1261 (1999)  adopted on 25 August  will  wehope  make a decisive contribution to resolving thedistressing problem of the fate of children in times ofarmed conflict.My country  which is committed to that end  hasbeen host to a number of international non-governmentalorganizations dedicated to the protection of children.These associations are working hand in hand with theUnited Nations specialized agencies. For its part  thePrincipality of Monaco is actively contributing on aregular basis to steps taken to improve the lot of the mostdisadvantaged children.Just as children need to be protected  women  too deserve the keenest attention from the internationalcommunity. Many forms of discrimination andinjustice — indeed  cruelty — including genitalmutilation  which is the cause of much pain andhumiliation  are still too often tolerated. They represent anumber of obstacles to women's achieving their fullpotential. In a report recently submitted to theSubcommission on the Promotion and Protection ofHuman Rights  a non-governmental organization knownfor its competence and precision denounced theunacceptable treatment still being endured by women inmany countries  be they young girls  wives or mothers. Ishould like in this connection to emphasize the highregard in which we held the high-level debate that tookplace in the Economic and Social Council last July on therole of jobs and work in the elimination of poverty emphasizing in particular the advancement of women.Women's access to jobs  as well as to education andprofessional training  has been widely encouraged. It isone of the areas of concern of the Government of thePrincipality  which is taking specific measures in thesocial and educational fields in order to deal with theissue. Respect for equality between men and women indaily life  as well as in the development of theirprofessional careers  in both public and private sectors  isessential if we are to improve the situation of women andcombat the precariousness and poverty that often affectthem much more than men. We are particularly aware ofthat. The substantial involvement of women in politicaland economic decision-making can also contribute toensuring greater social justice  while stimulating andbalancing the economy. The authorities of my country areconvinced of this and are striving to take steps to adjust13and complete the legislation of Monaco so as to ensure thatin every respect it is in conformity with the requirements ofthe United Nations Convention on the Elimination of AllForms of Discrimination against Women  so that Monacocan soon become a party to that essential instrument.Because of the complexity and irrevocably globalizednature of today's economy  it has become necessary  nowmore than ever  to achieve greater balance at both thenational and international levels. Existing inequalities whatever their origin  must necessarily be reduced to makesure that the dangerous gap separating the industrializedcountries from the most disadvantaged countries does notgrow wider. The Ministers of Economics and Finance of 44States and Governments members of the InternationalOrganization of La Francophonie were able to devotethemselves to that subject during their first meeting  whichtook place in Monaco on 14 and 15 April last.Those leaders  like those who met in Geneva at theJuly substantive session of the Economic and SocialCouncil  recognized that globalization  if poorly controlled could have serious consequences for the future of allnations. Stepped up trade and investment  and the adoptionof policies of liberalization — sure engines of growth —have not yet enabled everyone to enjoy significantdevelopment. We must guard against some being barredfrom progress and from the benefits of the major trends inthe world economy  something that could have seriousconsequences.Aware of that danger and of the deterioration ininternational relations it could cause  ministers of theeconomy or of finance of Francophone countries  meetingin Monaco  recognized the need for better supervision ofthe human and social effects of ongoing economicprocesses  including structural adjustment policies. Theystressed the importance of maintaining  or indeedincreasing  official development assistance  while adoptingappropriate measures to encourage private investment. Theyindicated their grave concern at the unbearable burden ofexternal debt for many countries. The Government ofMonaco shares that grave concern.The Monaco Declaration issued at the end of theirmeeting by ministers of the economy or of finance ofFrancophone countries solemnly recalled the fundamentallink among economic development  democracy and goodgovernance. The Declaration stressed the importance ofupcoming multilateral trade negotiations  noted the missionof the World Trade Organization to encompass all membersof the international community  and stressed the importanceof improving the international trading system so that itwill make a greater contribution to sustainabledevelopment and to meeting the real expectations ofpeoples. It also invited the world financial community tomaintain its assistance to development  through bothofficial and private contributions.The Principality of Monaco  which joined theIntergovernmental Agency of La Francophonie inorganizing this first meeting  is committed to contributeactively to implementing the Monaco Declaration and toencourage the establishment of a permanent Francophonecentre for gathering and exchanging economicinformation; the recent summit of heads of State orGovernment of Francophone countries  held at Moncton Canada  from 3 to 5 September  agreed to establish sucha centre in Monaco.Supported by many world leaders  the Jubilee 2000campaign to cancel debts that the poorest countries arefinding it difficult to repay enjoys wide backing. Givencertain modifications  it seems to us to be of greatinterest  if only because it will enable countriesexperiencing great difficulties to resume unhinderedprogress towards development. Here  my country's leadersare duly appreciative of the decision taken at Cologne lastJune by the heads of State or Government of the sevenmajor industrialized countries and of Russia to reducesignificantly the external debt of some 40 such countries.I reaffirm Monaco's unswerving determination tomeet its international obligations and its firm commitmentto the values of human rights and humanitarian principles and wish to affirm that the highest authorities of mycountry are devoting close attention to progress in thesphere of disarmament. The limitation and reduction ofnuclear weapons is a constant concern of the Governmentof the Principality. In our view  universal ratification ofthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons(NPT) — which  to our great satisfaction  was indefinitelyextended in 1995 — should be promoted  as should thecomplete application of the comprehensive safeguardssystem of the International Atomic Energy Agency whose remarkable International Laboratory of MarineRadioactivity we have been honoured to host since 1986.The year-2000 conference of States parties to theNPT will be decisive. Here  my country praises thosecountries  some of them close friends  that have mademajor sacrifices to dismantle a portion of their nucleararsenals while taking great care with the processing of thefissile materials extracted from them. We unreservedly14share the view of Governments that favour the formulationand adoption of international rules to prohibit theproduction of fissile materials intended for the productionof nuclear weapons and explosives.The Government of the Principality considers thatcontrols intended to prevent transfers of materials andequipment that could be used for the manufacture ofnuclear weapons should be strengthened  but it stronglyfavours improved international cooperation for the peacefuluses of nuclear energy — given  of course  all thenecessary precautions with respect to environmentalprotection.The Principality of Monaco earnestly hopes for anearly end to all nuclear-weapons tests; the threat that theseweapons pose to mankind has often  and rightly  beendenounced. We are convinced that the accession of allPowers to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty(CTBT) — which my father  the reigning Prince  ratified on20 November 1998 — would be a giant step towardslimiting these dreadful weapons of mass destruction. As aparty to the CTBT  the Principality would wish to seegreater commitment to that important treaty. We welcomethe existence of nuclear-weapon-free zones established onthe basis of arrangements freely entered into by the Statesof various regions  and hope that strengthening confidenceand international security will ultimately lead to the spreadof such zones.Let me recall the keen interest of the Principality ofMonaco in the implementation of the 1993 ParisConvention on the Prohibition of the Development Production  Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons andon Their Destruction  to which my country has been a partysince 1 June 1995  and of the 1972 Convention on theProhibition of the Development  Production and Stockpilingof Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and onTheir Destruction  our instrument of accession to which wasdeposited on 30 April 1999.My country welcomes the measures adopted atMaputo  Mozambique  last May  at the first Meeting ofStates Parties to the Convention on the Prohibition of theUse  Stockpiling  Production and Transfer of Anti-personnelMines and on Their Destruction  which entered into forcein Monaco on 15 March 1999.Engaged from the very beginning in the fight againstthese deadly devices  which strike hardest at civilianpopulations  particularly the elderly  women and children Monaco signed and quickly ratified this instrument. Mycountry is fully determined to continue its efforts tocontribute to eliminating these weapons once and for all.When  on 12 November 1998  the Principality ofMonaco signed the International Convention for theSuppression of Terrorist Bombing  it wanted to make aformal commitment and to place clearly on record itsposition in this regard. Through me  Monaco confirmsthat decision before the Assembly  once againcondemning all forms of terrorism  which blindly andmercilessly strikes too many innocents  as we have hadoccasion once again to note recently.In this spirit  it is appropriate to pay a special tributeto the United Nations Mission in East Timor for the roleit is playing and for the courage its representatives aredisplaying  notably the members of the international staffthat remained in place under the gravest of threats.In this connection  I should like once again toforcefully reaffirm our complete solidarity with UnitedNations personnel  some of whom this year have lost theirlives  been injured  or suffered violence and other graveoffenses. Monaco  which was among the first countries toratify the Convention on the Safety of United Nations andAssociated Personnel  deplores in the strongest terms andcondemns without reserve the inadmissible acts ofaggression and intimidation of which they have beenvictims. We take this opportunity to salute the first amongUnited Nations personnel  the Secretary-General  whoenjoys our highest esteem for his actions at the head ofthe Organization  particularly during periods of crisis andin the extremely difficult circumstances with which he isregularly confronted."
"106",4405,"MDA",54,1999,"Let me joinother delegations in congratulating Mr. Gurirab on hiselection as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session. His skill and experience will serve us wellas he directs the vital work to be undertaken at thissession. I should also like to take this opportunity tothank his predecessor  Mr. Didier Opertti  for hisoutstanding stewardship of the General Assembly at itsfifty-third session.The Government of the Republic of Moldovawarmly welcomes the admission of the three newMembers of the United Nations: the Republic of Kiribati the Republic of Nauru  and the Kingdom of Tonga.Since its admission to the United Nations in 1992 the Republic of Moldova has consistently been an activesupporter of the world Organization. As a small country we depend on the United Nations for our security and forour very existence. We want to see it further strengthenedand the sphere of its activities expanded. We believe thatin this emerging new international order  it is morenecessary than ever that the United Nations be capable offulfilling the role entrusted to it by the Charter  as theguarantor of peace  security and social justice throughoutthe world.It is from that perspective that we evaluate theUnited Nations reform process launched by the Secretary-General; as we see it  reform means the rationaladaptation of United Nations mechanisms to present andfuture needs. We owe the Secretary-General  Mr. KofiAnnan  our gratitude and support for his reform proposals.Especially  we welcome the implementation of theSecretary-General’s reform proposals aimed at fosteringgreater internal coordination  streamlining procedures andrationalizing the activities of the Organization. In thiscontext  I would like to underline the positive results thusfar achieved by the United Nations Development Groupand the Executive Committee on Economic and SocialAffairs. The preliminary application of the United NationsDevelopment Assistance Framework in 18 pilot countriesand more intense cooperation between Bretton Woodsinstitutions and the United Nations are also producingpromising results.Integration within the United Nations system is alsomoving ahead at the country level. I can already see some12encouraging results from the Republic of Moldova’s “Onecountry  one United Nations” policy. From this perspective we believe also that the integration of United Nationsrepresentation at the country level will lead to substantiveimprovements and greater coherence in the relationshipbetween the United Nations system and the host country. Itake this opportunity to inform members that in the nearfuture a United Nations common house will be officiallyinaugurated in the capital of our country  Chisinau.I would like to mention in this context the substantialassistance provided by the United Nations to my countrythrough the United Nations Development Programme(UNDP) office in the Republic of Moldova. The activitiescarried out by the UNDP office contribute significantly tothe ongoing reform process.We believe that the diversification and deepening ofcollaboration among States has enhanced the developmentof regional and subregional cooperation as well. In fact  theCharter itself attaches great significance to regionalorganizations. Documents laying the foundations forcollaboration between the United Nations and variousregional organizations have been drawn up  in particular inrecent years. General Assembly resolutions pertaining tocooperation between the United Nations on the one hand and the Organization for Security and Cooperation inEurope (OSCE)  the League of Arab States and theOrganization of African Unity (OAU) on the other  arerelevant from that point of view. Some regionalorganizations have acquired new areas of competence including in the field of peace and security  and havebecome a trustworthy support for the United Nations incontaining and eliminating local conflicts. For the nearfuture  we may expect that additional regional organizationsand groupings will be interested in setting up a cooperationframework with the United Nations  similar those that existwith other regional organizations. The Republic of Moldovasupports that trend.As a founding member of the Black Sea EconomicCooperation Organization  and as the country which at theend of this month will assume the presidency of thatorganization  the Republic of Moldova welcomes the recentdecision of the General Committee to include in the agendaof the fifty-fourth session an item concerning the grantingof observer status in the General Assembly to the BlackSea Economic Cooperation Organization. To this effect  theRepublic of Moldova would very much appreciate it ifMember States lent their valuable support to the granting ofobserver status in the Assembly to that organization.We are fully aware of the fact that because of itsoutstanding role in dealing with world problems  theUnited Nations is confronted with a growing number ofnew threats to international security and stability. In thiscontext  peacekeeping operations represent one of theworld Organization’s main instruments with which to stopconflicts in various parts of the world and to createfavourable conditions for their political settlement. It isalso obvious that in recent years the United Nations hasnearly exhausted its ability to respond to the increasingnumber of requests for such operations. Under thesecircumstances  we support and encourage the trendtowards involving regional organizations andarrangements  in cooperation with the United Nations  inthe mitigation of certain conflicts. At the same time  weconsider that peacekeeping operations should as a rule beundertaken under the auspices of the United Nations andin conformity with United Nations standards.Statements made during the general debate haveoffered an eloquent perspective on the major challengesconfronting the present-day system of internationalrelations and on the role that international organizations and primarily the United Nations  have to play in order tomeet them. One of the most important issues spoken of inthis context is the maintenance of peace  security andstability in various regions affected by crisis and internalconflict. Unfortunately  developments in those regionscompel us to acknowledge the insoluble character ofmany such conflicts. These so-called frozen conflicts havea huge potential for destabilization and destruction. TheKosovo tragedy has clearly shown how they candegenerate if we do not succeed in working out timelylong-lasting solutions. The Secretary-General is absolutelyright when he stresses that a tragic irony of many of thecrises that continue to go unnoticed and unchallengedtoday is that they could be dealt with by far less perilousacts of intervention than the one we witnessed recently inYugoslavia.At the same time  one of the main conclusions to bedrawn from conflicts such as those in Kosovo and inBosnia is that no single organization or State is capableof solving conflicts of such complexity and scale on itsown.The uniqueness of the United Nations is definedparticularly by its capacity to efficiently mobilize theresources of the international community and toorchestrate its efforts in order to defuse and solve crisisand conflict situations. That unique potential has to bemore actively and more efficiently used  particularly in13relation to the internal conflicts confronted by some newlyindependent States. Since 1992  when the majority of theex-Soviet republics became members of the United Nations dozens of interventions concerning conflicts in these States Moldova among them  have been spoken of in thisAssembly. One of the main conclusions of those statementswas that without more active involvement by theinternational community those conflicts will remain“frozen”.In this context  it bears mention that the UnitedNations  as well as other international bodies and individualStates  have made an important contribution to ending theviolence and military clashes and in bringing the partiesinvolved to the negotiating table. Another positive resultfrom the actions of the international community has beenthe parties’ acceptance of the idea of resolving theirdifferences through peaceful means.For this reason  the Republic of Moldova  like othercountries with similar problems in our own region  hascontinued to support more active involvement by the UnitedNations and regional organizations in managing theconflicts which they have faced for many years now. Wethink that the time is ripe to give more consideration to thequestion of how the root causes of those conflicts should beidentified and dealt with. In this respect the United Nationscan efficiently use its potential only through intensivecooperation and interaction with the European organizationsand institutions  particularly OSCE. Through enhancedsynergy and avoidance of duplication  and by using andmaintaining consulting mechanisms at various levels andexchanging information about plans and activities betweenitself and those organizations  the United Nations canimprove the situation in countries affected by internalconflicts.However  there must be firm decisions about whataction must be taken to ensure the implementation of therelevant resolutions and decisions adopted of the UnitedNations and the OSCE  the main international organizationsinvolved in settling those conflicts. We believe that theGeneral Assembly should evaluate the efficiency andeffectiveness of cooperation between the United Nationsand OSCE from this point of view also.That I refer to the issue of conflicts in some detail isnot incidental. The problem of the eastern region of theRepublic of Moldova has been repeatedly described  fromthis rostrum  by representatives of my country. To myregret  I must inform of the Assembly that there has beenno tangible progress towards a comprehensive settlement.Throughout the negotiations  we have sought toaccomplish the purpose for which the Assembly wasestablished: to replace mistrust and violent confrontationwith dialogue and agreement between the parties to theconflict.The Government of my country has shown morethan once that it strongly advocates a peaceful resolution through negotiations  of the conflict situation inTransnistria  in accordance with the norms and practice ofinternational law and in collaboration with internationalorganizations  primarily OSCE  and with the RussianFederation and Ukraine as mediators. Although it hasmade the spirit of compromise evident  the Governmentfirmly believes that any proposal for a settlement mustprovide for territorial integrity to be maintained and forcontrol over the territory of the whole country to beensured.Despite a reasonable compromise on the part of theconstitutional authorities  separatist tendencies still persist.A number of documents — elaborated with the activeparticipation of OSCE and other mediators and signed byall parties involved — are being interpreted unilaterally and in a manner contrary to their meaning  by theTransnistrian leaders. Moreover  these leaders are tryingto impose certain concepts that do not exist in law andterritorial practice and are contrary to the principle ofterritorial integrity. Here I refer to am referring to theconcept of “common State ” which has very frequentlybeen imposed in discussions to define relations betweenthe central and local authorities in certain conflict zones.We consider this concept dangerous due as it attempts todistort the notion of statehood and State sovereignty andprovide a legal framework for the ideology of aggressiveseparatism. I believe that the United Nations and otherinternational organizations will also find this concept bothinadequate and counter-productive as a means ofresolving internal conflicts.In Transnistria  we are striving for a rapid anddefinitive solution and a return to stability  and a returnalso to respect for human rights  which continue to beviolated in this region. The case of the Ilascu group  andviolation of fundamental human rights and freedoms itrepresents are eloquent in this respect.We consider it imperative for international efforts tosolve the current crisis situations  most of which haveseparatism as their main cause  to be strengthened. In thisconnection  I would mention that we fully share the viewsexpressed earlier by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of14the Russian Federation concerning aggressive separatism.Indeed  the international community and  first of all  theUnited Nations should decisively suppress anymanifestations of separatism and rigorously and consistentlydefend the principles of sovereignty  integrity and theinviolability of national frontiers. To this end  the completeeradication of outside encouragement and support forseparatist forces is most certainly necessary.Another aspect of the Transnistrian problem ismilitary: this zone is famously overmilitarized  which hasvery negatively affected the settlement process. Thousandsof tons of shells and armaments — both accounted for andunaccounted for  and including equipment limited by theConventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty — arestationed there. This military presence is in evidentcontradiction to the Constitution of the Republic ofMoldova  which declared the State’s neutrality and thatforeign troops are not admissible in our country.Another premise for accelerating the settlementprocess is  would undoubtedly be the immediate  complete unconditional and orderly withdrawal of foreign troops  asstipulated in OSCE summit decisions required by the CFETreaty  the keystone of European security and may on noaccount be violated.I hope that  together with our partners and the relevantinternational organizations  we can establish  very soon  aneffective mechanism and detailed schedule for the takeover destruction or removal of the foreign military arsenal fromRepublic of Moldova territory. I express my gratitude forthe political support and  especially  for the financialassistance provided by many United Nations Member Statesfor the withdrawal or elimination of those arsenals.I voice our hope that the proceedings of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-fourth session will be conducted in aspirit of solidarity and with a realistic and constructiveapproach to the complex issues confronting thecontemporary world at the end of this millennium. Thedelegation of the Republic of Moldova is committed tocontributing  alongside other Member States  to thefulfilment of the lofty goals of the United Nations."
"107",4449,"MDG",54,1999,"Sharing: this will be the theme of my statementfrom this rostrum  because at the end of this millennium when globalization rhymes with poverty  insecurity  socialills and natural disasters  the culture of sharing should more than ever  guide our actions.I want to share  first of all  Mr. President  oursatisfaction at seeing you conduct the proceedings of thisfifty-fourth session. Along with everyone else  and onbehalf of the delegation of Madagascar  I would like toshare my profound conviction that your reputation on theinternational scene is an asset that will guide ourdiscussions towards encouraging results. A talenteddiplomat and a worthy representative of a people that hasbecome a symbol of heroism and patriotism  you enjoyour confidence  our support and our admiration.We would also like to pay tribute to yourpredecessor  Minister Didier Opertti of Uruguay  forhaving held and passed on the torch that he carried withall the competence and determination one would expectof him.Furthermore  to the Secretary-General we offerthanks and recognition for his devotion and wisedynamism. He has known how to be the spokesman foraspirations of harmony  justice and progress. Under hisenlightened guidance and leadership  our Organization istoday well prepared to order the twenty-first century.I wish to join my voice to those of previous speakersin greeting and welcoming the Republic of Kiribati  theRepublic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga  whichhave just enlarged our United Nations community. Letthem share with us the noble ideals that brought ustogether and keep us together: the equality of peoplesunder the law  respect for the sovereignty of every State democracy and peace.Sharing with everyone  our pride in belonging to thegreat family of the United Nations  our forum formeeting  discussion  decision-making and solidarity;sharing the values that provide the foundations for ourinternational community; and sharing in the vitalprogrammes of cooperation carried out synergisticallyamong all the different actors and constituents of ourstructure and system — these  specifically  are the sourcesof our satisfaction.Today  less than 100 days from the new century andthe new millennium  we are keenly aware of thetimeliness of our discussions. Our fifty-fourth session isof particular significance in that it offers all of us theopportunity not only to undertake a retrospectiveexamination of the major events of the century  but alsoto seek ways and means to inject renewed dynamism intofuture international relations.The commitments we made at the fifty-third sessionof the General Assembly must be implemented as rapidlyas possible. We can achieve this through concerted effortsand our shared determination to succeed. However  to dothis  we must proceed urgently to apply the necessarymeasures for the restructuring of our Organization.5We reiterate our support for the position of theOrganization of African Unity regarding the need to expandthe Security Council. The restructuring of that organ mustbe based on the principles of democracy  transparency andequitable geographic distribution. On the question of theveto  in our view there is no room for equivocation: eitherit must be extended to all permanent members or it must beabolished.Our presence and our interactive participation in theconcert of nations prompts us to share our thinking oncertain subjects that constitute challenges of the highestpriority at the end of the century  particularly the questionsof armed conflict  the maintenance of peace  disarmament international terrorism  democracy and human rights  andhuman and socio-economic development.While accelerating the integration of our globalsociety  the end of the era of ideological confrontation hasbeen conducive to the proliferation of conflicts of apolitical  socio-economic  ethnic  cultural or religiousnature.Is there any need to stress that in all these conflictsituations the most vulnerable sectors of society —especially children  women and the elderly — are the firstvictims. Madagascar therefore shares the generalsatisfaction with the adoption by the Security Council ofresolutions 1261 (1999) and 1265 (1999)  on the protectionof civilians in armed conflict.There are some signs of satisfaction and hope: thesigning last 4 September of the Sharm el-SheikhMemorandum; the signing in Lomé on 7 July 1999 of aPeace Agreement for the conflict in Sierra Leone; and the10 July 1999 signing of the Ceasefire Agreement betweenthe principal parties to the conflict in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo. Nonetheless  we note that unfortunately  many hotbeds of tension remain or are beingcreated throughout the world. The tragic situations inAngola  Somalia  Afghanistan and Kosovo are clearexamples of this.As regards East Timor  Madagascar pays tribute to thecourageous efforts of the United Nations Mission in EastTimor during the electoral process. We particularlywelcome the recent adoption of Security Council resolution1264 (1999)  on decisive measures to put an end to thecrisis and to ensure strict respect for human rights.As regards Western Sahara  Madagascar endorses theinitiative of the United Nations to organize a free  honestand impartial referendum  as well as the extension of themandate of the United Nations Mission for theReferendum in Western Sahara until 14 December 1999.We in Madagascar have lived in peace  but we havealways been aware of the need to preserve the IndianOcean as a zone of peace  and thus we are concernedabout the situation in the Comoros  our close neighbour.We therefore welcome the opportunity to have hosted  inApril this year at Antananarivo  the Comorian inter-islandconference  under the aegis of the Organization of AfricanUnity (OAU). We urge the international community tomaintain the efforts to implement the Antananarivo accordso as to bring about a democratic and unified Comorianstate.Last year marked the fiftieth anniversary of UnitedNations peacekeeping operations. We salute the initiativesfor cooperation between the United Nations and the OAUand between the European Union  the OAU andsubregional organizations such as the Southern AfricanDevelopment Community and the Economic Communityof West African States. Nevertheless  in our view theseactions should be in keeping with the principles of theCharter of the United Nations  such as respect for thesovereignty of States  respect for territorial integrity andnon-intervention in internal affairs.While we recognize the usefulness of peacekeepingoperations  Madagascar considers that disarmament isinseparable from any effort to consolidate peace. Indeed the increasing deadliness of conflicts is connected withthe excessive accumulation of light weapons  of whichthere are now an estimated 500 million. In our view theproblem must be resolved upstream  because practicallyall the hotbeds of tension are maintained by theproduction and sale of such weapons and illicit traffickingin them. As a party to the international conventions on thenon-proliferation of weapons and illicit trafficking inthem  Madagascar supports the idea of an internationalconference on the illicit arms trade  in all its aspects.As we turn the page on a millennium tarnished bywars and conflicts  general disarmament must be acommon and shared objective. In this regard  on 25August of this year Madagascar associated itself with theratification of the Ottawa Convention on anti-personnellandmines. Convinced that there can be no security in aworld teeming with nuclear  chemical and biologicalweapons  Madagascar welcomes the holding next year ofthe Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.6Another concern of our times is the struggle againstinternational terrorism  a struggle in which we should besteadfastly united. This is why we wish to we wish tosupport the development of a draft international conventionto block the financing of terrorism. Our active participationat the last OAU summit  held in Algiers  in the adoption ofa convention for preventing and fighting terrorism demonstrates our determination to eradicate this scourge.Furthermore  this very day we have signed the InternationalConvention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings.At a time when all the inhabitants of the planet sharethe desire to live free from the horrors of violence discrimination and exclusion  respect for democraticprinciples is no longer just a precept; it has become anabsolute necessity. We therefore exhort the internationalcommunity to condemn firmly any taking of power by non-democratic means. As the principal guarantor of universalvalues  the United Nations is called upon to take the leadin this area.At the threshold of the twenty-first century  workingtogether to promote human development and human rightsis an obligation. This year  1999 — the International Yearof Older Persons — is crucial for the implementation of theInternational Plan of Action on Ageing  adopted at Viennain 1982. Madagascar therefore welcomes the initiative toconvene in 2002 a special session of the General Assemblydevoted to the updating of this Plan of Action.The right to development is inseparable from theeffective exercise of human rights. It must enjoyinternational support and solidarity so that development isextended to all human beings  not just to a privilegedminority. For its part  Madagascar has spared no effort tostrengthen its institutional capacities. A National HumanRights Commission and an observer office for human rightshave been established. We have also signed agreementswith the Office of the High Commissioner for HumanRights to assist in promoting human rights.Aware of the revival of transnational traffic in womenand children as well as of modern forms of slavery Madagascar adopted on 25 January 1999 a law designed tocombat paedophilia. Furthermore  we welcome theconventions produced under the aegis of the InternationalLabour Organization on the employment of children andyoung people. Personally  I am happy to have signed theletter addressed to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan from all the female Ministers for Foreign Affairs  a letterthat reiterates our unwavering support for the fight againsttrafficking in human beings  particularly women andchildren.From one year to the next we are beset by the sameconcerns. We do not wish to call it routine  but ouragenda nevertheless reveals that we must experience thesame concerns time and again. The century is drawing toan end without the resolution of two major problems:poverty and the increase in social inequality. One billionpeople live in extreme poverty  while another billion areenjoying a life of increasing luxury. Furthermore  a recentstudy has shown that at the beginning of the next centurywe can expect the ratio of income differential between therich and the poor countries to be on the order of 150 toone.Our claims are therefore as legitimate as ever  whileour efforts at development remain hampered by thecontinuing and ever-growing deterioration of the terms oftrade  by our strict dependence on external capital  and bythe disproportionate concentration of direct foreigninvestment in economic sectors to which access isrestricted.Without wishing to belittle the advantages of theinescapable phenomenon of globalization  our fearsremain profound in the face of the emergence of aunipolar order  which in certain cases promotesmarginalization  precariousness and insecurity; reducesour Governments’ room to manoeuvre or capacity to act;and sometimes even affects our countries’ exercise oftheir own sovereignty.We therefore say “no” to selective globalizationwhen it comes to liberalization  inasmuch as we are beingcalled on to liberalize our trade  investments and financialflows at an accelerated pace  while this impulse toliberalize has not been nearly so strong in the case ofproducts of interest to our countries or in the promotionof access to know-how and technologies.The lack of consistency within the new world systemalso applies to the links between our economic adjustmentprogrammes and the various social and environmentalobjectives: the struggle against poverty  the establishmentof basic social infrastructures  the security safety net andthe protection and development of our environmentalresources.While in no way calling into question thecommitments undertaken to its development partners Madagascar expresses its solidarity with all the7developing countries in calling for improved integrationwithin the world economic system  allowing the promotionof regular and socially harmonious growth with a humanand ecological face.The challenges are numerous and varied. Theelimination of poverty remains our priority. We continue tobelieve that this problem will be resolved only if the paceof economic growth is accelerated and maintained. Theinternational anti-poverty strategy must include concretemeasures to strengthen national efforts in such areas as jobcreation  improved functioning of markets and social andpolitical institutions  and the active participation ofvulnerable groups in development.The problem of external debt is a political question ofthe highest importance in international economic relationsand remains a genuine obstacle to the growth of mostdeveloping countries. Arrangements and accords to datehave provided only limited solutions because of conditionsof eligibility  new conditionalities  selectivity in loan-making  the excessive length of negotiations and constraintsconnected to mandatory circulation.We welcome the debt-reduction plan approved recentlyat the G-8 Summit in Cologne  but the slow pace at whichthe reduction would seem to yield benefits tends to erodeour hopes. This plan should be interpreted flexibly by theinternational financial institutions so that it may benefit alldebtors without exception. The African debt warrantsparticular attention because of these countries’ very limitedcapacity for repayment. Indicators show that the Africancan never be repaid. We therefore call simply for its totalcancellation.We are deeply concerned by the reduction of officialdevelopment assistance  which today represents less thanone third of the international target agreed more than 20years ago. It is urgent that this trend be reversed. Given theimportance of this question  Madagascar is following withparticular interest the preparatory work for the internationalmeeting on all aspects of development financing. Thediscussion on reforming the international financialarchitecture is of the greatest interest to us  the objectivebeing to free additional and foreseeable resources fordevelopment and to strengthen the systems that control monitor and regulate financial flows.With regard to international trade  we support themessage of the Group of 77 addressed to the forthcomingmeeting of the World Trade Organization in Seattle  as wellas the Marrakesh Declaration with regard to the preparationof the tenth session of the United Nations Conference onTrade and Development (UNCTAD X)  scheduled forBangkok early next year.The question of commodities remains a subject ofmajor concern to our countries. We therefore support theefforts of the relevant international institutions  UNCTADin particular  to find more effective machinery that wouldallow us to increase our export earnings.Recognized as a global nature sanctuary because ofthe wealth of its biodiversity  Madagascar remains deeplyconcerned by environmental problems. We follow withinterest all United Nations activities for sustainabledevelopment and renew our appeal for increased supportfrom our partners in the implementation of our nationalenvironmental programme  currently in phase 2.To meet these challenges  we have two options.First  we are convinced that the reform targets we arecontemplating can be achieved only within the frameworkof revitalized international economic cooperation. Thiswould require a resumption of the North-South dialogue.In this context  major international economic meetingsshould be guided by a spirit of solidarity and a sense ofshare responsibility between the various developmentpartners. We must therefore advocate a global andintegrated approach to replace sectoral schemes  whichare necessarily inadequate.The second option  which we feel to be aprerequisite  requires the strengthening of South-Southcooperation. In advance even of the process of integrationwithin the inevitable system of globalization  it isnatural — even imperative — for the southern countriesto organize themselves. Our progress in this area  beingdispersed and isolated  has proved slow. Of course  werecognize that priorities  methods and schedules differ.We must concede  however  that the implementation stageof such cooperation now calls for the much greater unityand genuine political involvement of member countries.In this manner  we envisage a reorganization of theSouth at all levels — subregional  regional  continentaland global — grouping together all developing countries.Madagascar is firmly committed to this approach. That iswhy  at the subregional and regional levels  we areparticipating within the Indian Ocean Commission in theimplementation of a regional sustainable developmentpolicy  to be endorsed by the forthcoming summit ofheads of State and Government on 3 December. As a fullmember of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern8Africa  Madagascar was among the first to decide to apply on a reciprocal basis  a tariff reduction of 80 per cent forthe products of member States. This tariff preference is aprelude to a free-trade zone.At the continental level  we welcome the appeallaunched at the recent fourth Extraordinary Summit of theOrganization of African Unity at Sirte for greater economicintegration in Africa. Indeed  participants in this conferenceclearly affirmed that greater unity is one way to resist thethreat of globalization looming over the continent. Togetherwith all African countries  Madagascar urges theinternational community to lend its material and financialsupport and to share with our continent its own experiencesin its achievement of unity.According to United Nations resolutions  Africa in the1990s has been a priority for action against poverty andinsecurity. In this regard  I welcome the financialcommitment of $150 million  announced three days ago on28 September by Mr. James Wolfensohn  President of theWest Bank  to its Partnership for African Capacity.The contribution of every Member State to forging anew Africa is an obligation. With this in mind  over thepast three years Madagascar has built a structure that willpromote democracy  human rights and multifacetedcooperation. An entire field of activity has opened up today making our big island a major actor in regional  continentaland international life.The principle of sharing has been implicit in theactivities of our Organization since its Charter was written.Whatever reforms it has undergone and will undergo  weagree that it is important to preserve among us this nobleprinciple  a rallying cry for our actions. There is alsosharing to be done to reduce economic discrepancies whichhave been growing over the last two decades; sharing toremedy the asymmetry of trade  if not actually to redefinesuch trade  and to ensure that such progress is immanent;and sharing to put an end to the role of war so as to finallyinitiate the role of peace.We remain convinced that only the United Nationswill be a true instigator of the culture of peace  prosperityand humanism in this world which must be interdependent.We share the wish for success in the forthcoming greatmeetings in the year 2000; at Bangkok for the tenth sessionof the United Nations Conference on Trade andDevelopment  at Havana for the South Summit  and here inthis very Hall for the Millennium Summit."
"108",4488,"MDV",54,1999,"At the outset  I would like tocongratulate Mr. Gurirab on his election to preside over thishistoric session of the General Assembly. It is a tribute tohis rich experience and to his great country  Namibia.His predecessor  Mr. Didier Opertti of Uruguay  alsodeserves our appreciation for the excellent manner inwhich he discharged his important responsibilities.Permit me also to pay tribute to theSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for his dedication andcommitment to the ideals of the United Nations.As we meet for the final session of this century  and indeed  of this millennium  we are faced with a future thatholds for us promises and perils  hopes and fears opportunities and challenges. We cannot secure a betterfuture unless the root causes of the problems of our timesare resolved. The United Nations  as the only truly globalOrganization  is best suited to address these problems. Itsrole  therefore  must be reaffirmed and must remaincentral to our efforts in the reconstruction of a more justworld order where human security is guaranteed.Since the establishment of this Organization  smallStates have earned a legitimate voice in multilateraldiplomacy. I am delighted today to welcome the threenew Members of the United Nations  the Republic ofKiribati  the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom ofTonga. As small States  Maldives and the three newMembers share numerous interests and concerns whichare vital to our common survival and progress.We stand at a crossroads. This is an idealopportunity to review our past performance and to mapout innovative approaches to address existing andemerging problems. As we get ready to enter the newcentury and the new millennium  we in the Maldives havedeveloped Vision 2020 for our country  based on thelessons of the past. The Vision sets out major directionsfor the next two decades. We envision a community thatis just  caring and peaceful. Our country must continue tobe one in which good governance  democracy and thewelfare of the people are given the highest priority. Weseek a society where gender equality is a reality andwhere everyone has the opportunity for self-actualization.We want our children to be happy  creative and safe.These aims can be realized only through a high levelof economic achievement and social progress. However our resources are meagre. We face numerous naturalhazards and are vulnerable to a wide range of man-madethreats. Nevertheless  we remain firm in our determinationto achieve the goals we have set for ourselves. But for36that to happen  our own efforts must be supplemented by asupportive international environment. That much we needand that much we seek.Nevertheless  the withdrawal of that supportiveframework seems  regrettably  to be imminent. TheMaldives has been earmarked for graduation from the listof least developed countries (LDC) next year. We do notfeel entirely comfortable with the LDC label. Indeed  wewould like to enter the new millennium as a self-reliantcountry. National pride  however  cannot transcend harsheconomic reality. Our economy is small and narrowlybased. Capacity for economic diversification in theimmediate future is limited. Graduation would thereforeimpose unbearable burdens on us. The General Assemblyis to review the graduation process and its criteria this year.I appeal to you to consider the realities on the ground. Icall upon you to look beyond abstract indicators to theinherent vulnerabilities of small States. My President hasalready conveyed our concerns in detail to the President ofthe Economic and Social Council. The Commonwealth hasstrongly supported our case.The liberalization of trade and the globalization of theeconomy have created windows of opportunity for increasedeconomic growth. Their impact  though  has created aparticularly difficult economic road for developingcountries. Globalization must progress withoutmarginalization and without further impoverishment. Theseven nations of the South Asian Association for RegionalCooperation (SAARC) are working together to enhance ourprospects in the new international economic climate throughgreater regional cooperation.Yet  ominously  on a global scale the gulf betweenrich and poor nations has reached tragic proportions. Theseharsh economic realities have been accompanied by thefragmentation of the international will to foster greaterequality. Aid programmes had previously supplementeddomestic savings in recipient countries  but today they arenot even adequate to save the destitute  leaving manydeveloping countries with little choice but to replace theirvisions of advancement with those of survival and life-support. The world's present focus on poverty eradicationonly underscores its past failure to narrow the gap betweenthe rich and the poor. It is disheartening to note that thegap has more than doubled since 1950.I am happy that a number of international initiativeson social issues have taken place during this decade. TheMaldives attaches great importance to the fulfilment of theCopenhagen commitments and the implementation of theBeijing Declaration and Platform for Action. We lookforward to their review meetings next year to give a freshimpetus to our action. In South Asia  the Maldives hascalled for the drawing up of a social charter that willinstitutionalize social development in the region. We arealso pressing for a SAARC convention on regionalarrangements to promote and protect child welfare. I hopethat the convention will be adopted as we mark the tenthanniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.The international social agenda is indeed ademanding one. It cannot be addressed by nationalGovernments acting alone. Cooperation among States andpartnerships with inter-governmental and non-governmental organizations are essential for victory onthis front. At the same time  our approach to economicperformance needs to be re-oriented towards humansecurity and ecological safety. We need to temper ourobsession over economic growth with concerns for thequality of life. We all accept the importance ofsustainable development. We all agree on the need foreffective global action to achieve environment-friendlyprogress. Yet  the clear message that has emerged fromthe review of the Barbados Programme of Actioncompleted this week is that of weak commitment andpoor implementation. Our deeds must match thesentiments we have expressed. We must deliver on ourpromises.Small island developing States have few options thatthey can pursue on their own. International cooperation isvital to ensure that sustainable development strategies areviable for them. It is also necessary to help them adapt tothe dangers posed by global warming and climate change.As we have reiterated on numerous occasions  theMaldives could very well cease to exist if the sea levelrises by one metre. Many other low-lying regions wouldsuffer a similar fate. Should the sea level rise by onemetre  the developed countries too would be affectedsignificantly  and the direct impact on biodiversity wouldbe unfathomable. The Maldives is therefore deeplydisappointed by the lack of action in implementing theBarbados pledges.While great Powers may be able to look after theirown security needs  the small States need to rely oninstitutions of collective security. I am happy to recall that10 years ago  the Assembly adopted resolution 44/51 which recognized that the international community has anobligation to make provision for the protection andsecurity of small States. We are grateful for the support37of the international community for our initiative on thisissue  but we remain concerned that time and again theresponse of the United Nations to crises  especially thoseinvolving small States  has been found wanting in speedand in effectiveness.It is a pity that we have to enter the new century andthe new millennium still carrying baggage containing manyunresolved and deep-seated problems that confronted theUnited Nations at its birth.One such problem is the Middle East problem. Peacein the Middle East still remains elusive. Hesitant steps havebeen taken  but many issues remain unresolved. TheMaldives has welcomed the Middle East peace processfrom the beginning. We are disappointed at its slowprogress and look forward to a more earnest and boldsearch for peace. Once again  we express our full supportto the Palestinian cause and call for the full implementationof the relevant United Nations resolutions on lasting peacein the region.Eight years after the Gulf war  there are still manyunresolved issues that affect the security and progress ofthe region. The Maldives calls upon all parties concernedto fully comply with the resolutions of the United Nationson the subject. We regret the suspension of talks betweenKuwait and Iraq on outstanding bilateral issues  includingthat of missing persons  and believe that the resolution ofthese issues should be pursued within the existingframework of relevant United Nations resolutions. TheMaldives reaffirms its unwavering support for theindependence  sovereignty and territorial integrity ofKuwait. We reiterate our belief that the United Nations hasan obligation to uphold the security and territorial integrityof all Member States  including smaller States.The post-cold-war years have seen the bitter betrayalof the promise of greater freedom and development. Ratherthan seeing a celebration of human rights and the legitimaterights of communities to their own identity and culturalvalues  arrogant ethnocentrism and intolerance appear to berampant. Indeed  the violent disintegration of States andcivil wars have led to the most gruesome crimes againsthumanity. Genuine aspirations have often been met withbrutal force  as in Bosnia and Kosovo. Protracted disputes such as in Kashmir  are continuing to exact a high price inhuman lives and constantly endanger security at both theregional and international levels.Strategies of nuclear deterrence which presumably relyon the credible threat of mass destruction cannot bejustified on moral grounds. We welcome the steps that arebeing taken to increase nuclear safety. We continue to bealarmed by the increased risk of nuclear war thataccompanies proliferation. The Maldives is a staunchsupporter of non-proliferation. We firmly believe that theworld will be a safer place without nuclear weapons. Wehope that the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons (NPT) review process will find ways to achieveprogress in all aspects of the non-proliferation regime.The continuation of many conflicts and the flaringup of others call into question the efficacy of thisOrganization. It is not only the passage of time thatdemands the reform and restructuring of the UnitedNations. The most persuasive argument is the urgent needto increase the ability of the United Nations to realize theobjectives for which it has been set up. Whatever reformis undertaken should be instrumental in that sense.Reform must enhance its legitimacy. Reform must makethe United Nations more democratic and transparent  andit must also reinforce the United Nations ability to upholdequality among nations.As we step into the new century  the world hasreached a major turning point. We are bidding farewell toone millennium and are marching with determination intoa new one. It is one in which a stronger commitment tomultilateralism will be essential. Many of the hazards thatwe are faced with do not recognize national borders. Theworld has become closely integrated  and communitieshave become highly interwoven across national frontiers necessitating global approaches to global problems.Advances in science and technology give us cause foroptimism in our efforts to overcome several of thechallenges that confront us today. These are assisted bynew mindsets of cooperation and emotional intelligence.We need to nurture the positive strands and prune thenegative. Yet the new century will not usher in a new ageunless hope and progress become universal.The new millennium will not set an enlightenedcourse for world politics until right can triumph overmight and double standards give way to justice for all.That is the millennium challenge."
"109",4535,"MEX",54,1999,"Mydelegation welcomes the election of the Minister forForeign Affairs of Namibia  Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  to thepresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourthsession. Mexico knows him as an experienced diplomatwhose contribution will guarantee that our work strengthensthe ability of the United Nations to face the challenges ofthe next century. In welcoming his election  we pay tributeto the constructive role Namibia plays on the internationalstage.My delegation would also like to place on record itsappreciation to the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Uruguay Mr. Didier Opertti  for his outstanding guidance of thefifty-third session.I wish also to express the satisfaction of Mexico at theadmission of the Republic of Kiribati  the Republic ofNauru and the Kingdom of Tonga to membership of theOrganization. Their presence among us strengthensuniversality  the very essence of the United Nations.My delegation is participating in this session with thewill to negotiate and the desire to cooperate that havealways characterized Mexico's foreign policy. We areconvinced that the proposals we make and results weachieve will contribute to designing the international orderof the twenty-first century; we shall be an active participantin the debate.Now more than ever it seem essential that we reviewthe system we devised at San Francisco in the light of ourexperiences over the past 54 years and of the progressachieved in the field of international law. In that review wemust ensure that the interests of all Member States aretaken into account in line with the Charter principle of thesovereign equality of States.Mexico is proud of its multilateral outlook. Mycountry has always seen the United Nations as the idealforum to propose  negotiate and agree on solutions andcommon strategies that will enable us to face our collectivechallenges. We Mexicans are convinced that it is imperativeto spare no effort to make our Organization the primaryforum for generating comprehensive policies  policies thatguarantee lasting peace and security  and the developmentand welfare of all peoples on earth.As it does every year  the General Assembly has abroad and complex agenda before it at this session. I wishtherefore to focus my statement on three topics that Iconsider to be of paramount importance for the future ofthe Organization and of the community of nations: worldpeace and security; international cooperation in the fieldof natural disasters; and the financial architecture of thenew century.The Preamble and Article 1 of the Charter state thatfundamental aims of the peoples of the United Nationsare to live together in peace and to solve their disputeswithout resorting to the use of force. The attainment ofthose aims is our only guarantee if we yearn for a stableand secure international community that reveres friendlyrelations and goodwill among all peoples and all nations.We note with growing concern that  far fromdisappearing  conflicts have multiplied and their naturehas changed as a consequence of the reshuffling of forcesin the international arena. Today  these ever-proliferatingconfrontations are to a great extent internal ones presenting formidable challenges to an Organizationconceived to resolve disputes between States. We stilllack clear-cut mandates and a defined consensus on howto address this new state of affairs. This often divides us not on the ultimate goal — peace — but on the means toachieve it. Given the absence of a new political contractthat enjoys the support of all Members of the UnitedNations  Mexico will continue firmly to maintain that thesearch for solutions to conflicts  whether they be internalor international  must be in conformity with the letter andthe spirit of the San Francisco Charter. Its principlescannot be subjected to interpretations varying withcircumstances or to unilateral whims. We cannot allowthe authority or the legitimacy of the Organization to bedamaged. We cannot accept actions that openly contradictthe intentions of the founders and that weaken the rightsof the community of States.Mexico has always maintained that the use of force even when motivated by the loftiest humanitarianimpulses  is no solution; to the contrary  it generatesfurther instability  uncertainty and violence. But mycountry has shown restraint when the Security Councilhas acted in strict compliance with Chapter VII of theCharter. Even so  the Mexican Government reiterates thevalue of the peaceful settlement of disputes and firmlyrejects the existence of an alleged right to intervene particularly when it is proclaimed outside the frameworkof international law.31This is one of the most pressing challenges that wemust face as we move towards the new millennium.Essentially  we are striving to give the United Nations thepolitical underpinning that will enable it to face new threatsto peace and security in line with the thinking that inspiredthe authors of the San Francisco Charter. If we fail  we runthe risk of eroding international negotiating tools and ofdoing precisely what we want to avoid: weakening theOrganization.For these reasons  my delegation invites all MemberStates to begin an exercise in collective thinking that willenable us to solve the dilemma of humanitarian crisescaused by internal conflicts on the one hand and of thecapability of the United Nations to respond on the other.This must be an exercise in deep thinking that will lead usto lasting solutions  which will both preserve peace andprotect the lives and human rights of those involved inconflicts.Allow me now to turn to another topic that I deemcentral to the future of the United Nations: internationalcooperation in the event of natural disaster. In view of theregrettable recurrence of natural disasters  it is urgent tothink about a creative and effective international division oflabour so that responses by countries  regions andorganizations do not constitute isolated efforts or temporaryrelief. They should instead constitute a comprehensivestrategy that will contribute to lasting stability.We have all witnessed the sad consequences of naturalcatastrophes. Recent experiences highlight the urgent needfor an effective machinery to address more rapidly andmore fully the needs of affected populations. Theseexperiences show also that at the very outset of the tragedyit is essential to mobilize broader support efforts tocontribute to full recovery in the shortest possible time.At the regional level  the countries of Latin Americaand the Caribbean have taken important steps that serve asan example of the proposed new division of labour to dealwith natural disasters. In the declaration on technicalcooperation for the prevention and relief of natural disastersadopted at the summit meeting of the PermanentMechanism for Political Consultation and Concertation (RioGroup)  held in Mexico City in May  we undertook thecommitment “to promote permanent measures of technicalcooperation on every phase of natural disasters”. Thismarks significant progress in the field of internationalcooperation. It aims not only to repair the damage but alsoto include preventive measures  and is designed to ensureassistance not only at the time of crisis but also duringthe reconstruction period.Likewise  during their summit  held in June 1999 atRio de Janeiro  heads of State or Government of LatinAmerica and the Caribbean and of the European Uniondecided to launch an important programme of cooperationin the sphere of environmental and natural disasters. Itsgoal is to help improve the capacity of the mostvulnerable nations of both regions so we can prevent anddeal with disasters. To that end  they agreed to establishan appropriate system of international assistance at allphases from prevention and early warning to emergencyassistance and mitigation  without neglecting rehabilitationand reconstruction.My delegation is convinced that these experiencesdeserve to be considered by this Assembly so that theirmerits may be assessed and disseminated throughout theworld. The United Nations must play a central role inmaking this strategy international. It is urgent to havenational listings of civil defence organizations withupdated inventories of available resources to help indisasters  and handbooks to guide us in the effectivemanagement of international cooperation. In other words the Organization must respond in terms of who willprovide international cooperation when natural disastersstrike  what they will provide  and how they will provideit.Lastly  I would like to refer to the financialarchitecture of the new century. A year ago  in this sameforum  I voiced the concern of Mexico about the harmfuleffects that financial crises have on our societies. At thattime  I proposed that the Member States  coordinated bythe Secretary-General  should undertake to reflect on howto improve our early-warning capacity in order to preventand confront in a timely fashion the occurrence andproliferation of financial crises. This initiative foundsupport in resolution 53/172  entitled “The financial crisisand its impact on growth and development  especially inthe developing countries”.Subsequently  we proposed to the Secretary-Generalthe undertaking of an effort at the regional level in LatinAmerica and the Caribbean as part of a broaderendeavour that will have to involve other areas  includingdeveloped countries and the international financialagencies.Earlier this month  in close collaboration with theEconomic Commission for Latin America and the32Caribbean  we held a meeting in Mexico City under theheading “Towards a stable and predictable internationalfinancial system linked to social development.” High-levelGovernment officials of the countries of our regionparticipated  as well as specialists and prominent officialsof multilateral institutions working in financial and socialfields.At that meeting  we undertook an in-depth analysis ofthe international financial architecture and its connection tothe social development of our peoples. We also reaffirmedour conviction that it is urgent and necessary to define anew world financial scheme that includes a socialdimension. The conclusions of that regional meeting havebeen conveyed to the Secretary-General  and I would likerefer to just a few of them.First  we participants expressed our concern over thefact that once the most visible effects of the crisis areovercome  we observe a dangerous attitude of complacency.The countries of the region are convinced that a renewedeffort is required in order to strengthen the global financialsystem  and we reaffirmed our commitment to activelyparticipate in this task.Secondly  we emphasized the need to have a stable transparent  predictable  organized and secure internationalfinancial system. To this end  we  the various participantsmust accept and fulfil our respective responsibilities. Theinternational financial agencies must redesign their policiesin order to respond to the great challenges created byfinancial markets. They must develop early-warningmechanisms and expand their resources to help economiesin trouble in a timely and appropriate way. For their part countries must commit themselves to followingmacroeconomic policies that lead to growth and socialjustice. They must recognize  in order to remedy theproblem  the part played in the crisis by the absence ofadequate supervision and regulation of national bankingsystems. A solid banking system is essential to protect acountry from speculative movements of capital.Thirdly  we recognized the devastating impact thatfinancial crises have on the social situation and theprospects for development of our countries. In this respect we expressed the need to advance towards a financialarchitecture that reconciles the economy with society andinternational finance with sustained social development. Wereaffirmed in this sense our absolute conviction thatsustained growth is the most effective way to reduceinequality and poverty.Fourthly  we agreed that the ultimate goal of theinternational development banks must be precisely humandevelopment. We deemed it fundamental for thoseinstitutions to give high priority to financial support forthe formation of basic networks of social protection intimes of crisis  without losing sight of the broaderobjectives of growth and development.Fifthly  we agreed that the United Nations must playa central role in promoting integrated social developmentthrough forging an international consensus that helpssupport and rebuild the global financial architecture. It isencouraging to learn that in the year 2001 the UnitedNations will sponsor a high-level meeting on financingdevelopment. That will be an ideal opportunity to addresscomprehensively the problem of social and humandevelopment  including its financial aspect.Thus  we will follow up on the conclusions andrecommendations coming out of the meeting in Mexico and on those from other meetings and forums  in order toinclude all actors in the design of the financialarchitecture for the twenty-first century. We will beattentive to efforts in this direction on the part ofSecretary-General.The United Nations must strengthen its position andits mandate as the principal forum of debate and forseeking consensual solutions that guide the work of theinternational community in the face of problems andsituations that affect us all. It is essential to continue thetask of establishing a more democratic and transparentOrganization that fully reflects the interests and objectivesof its Members and that is a forum that truly representsall of them. I am sure that all of us want a UnitedNations where fairness and justice reign.Looking towards the Millennium Assembly  we mustcontinue to foster cooperation and closeness amongnations in order to strengthen peace and security  pushdisarmament ahead  promote development and thestruggle against poverty and ensure full respect forinternational law.If we are really being overtaken by events in theglobal arena  we must strengthen our frame of action. Ifit is necessary to reform our Organization to guarantee itseffective performance  let us do so. But let us do socollectively  with respect for the juridical principle of theequality of States. Let us not allow this forum to lose itsprestige or its influence. Mexico will not retreat from itscommitment to the letter and the spirit of the San33Francisco Charter. To the contrary  it will participateactively in the effort to guarantee the vitality of the UnitedNations in order to build a better world  both for ourselvesand for future generations.This is the aim of the proposals I have made on behalfof the Government that I have the honour to represent."
"110",4560,"MHL",54,1999,"﻿Mr. President  onbehalf of my delegation  I congratulate you on your electionto preside over the General Assembly at its fifty-fourthsession. I bring you warm greetings from His ExcellencyPresident Imata Kabua of the Republic of the MarshallIslands. He asks that I bring to the attention of the GeneralAssembly the various concerns that we wish to seeaddressed this year.As the Assembly knows  the Marshall Islands waschosen for nuclear testing activities for the good ofmankind. It did not turn out to be so fortunate for many ofour people. The testing displaced many  and many wereaffected by the contamination. The Marshall Islandscontinues to be haunted by a legacy of nuclear testing andthe destruction that accompanied it. My own home island Utirik  was severely affected  and as I speak today we feelthat there has not been a full reckoning of this dreadful partof our history. We have spoken about the medical effects the high costs of treating the victims and the costs ofrehabilitating the affected areas. A recent study has provedthat the thyroid cancer rate in the population alive at thetime of the testing is very high. We are experiencing theeffects of these ailments decades after the end of the tests.The medical and social problems that were caused do notseem likely to go away.That being said  there are some positive developmentsarising from our talks with our former AdministeringAuthority. Recent discussions have highlighted the need tomove forward with positive measures  and this is somethingwe fully support. The problems we face are  however  verydifficult  and the international expertise we require issimply not forthcoming. We therefore reiterate the call wemade at the 1995 Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) ReviewConference that such expertise for medical measures  aswell as scientific and technical assistance  must be madeavailable. We have sought to have the year 2000 ReviewConference fully reflect this concern. If these issues arenot addressed  it is our considered view thatnon-proliferation and nuclear disarmament in general willbe a hollow achievement.I am grateful  Mr. President  for the efficient mannerin which you conducted the proceedings of the twenty-second special session. That session will serve as ahighlight among our achievements this year  and I hopethat it will usher in a new dawn of internationalcooperation with the small island developing States.The concerns that were raised at the special sessionneed not be repeated here. However  we must now lookat how to integrate these concerns into other work of theUnited Nations in the field of sustainable development. Itwould be counterproductive if the outcomes from lastweek were not fully reflected in our other deliberations.The full agenda before the Second Committee isindicative of the continued concern with these issues. Wewill seek to ensure full reflection of the special session atthe appropriate time. At the national level we will do ourpart through the National Commission on sustainabledevelopment. At the regional level we will cooperate withthe other organizations of the Pacific island countries.The interlinkages between various conventions andsustainable development efforts have always been clear tomy delegation. We are deeply concerned with climatechange and the devastating effect it may have on ourlivelihood  culture  natural resources  the economy andour very existence. Climate change is with us now. Itmust be stressed that bad weather is not climate change.However  the extreme events that have been observed inrecent years are indications of what is to be expectedfrom climate change. Climate change is the disease  andwhat we are observing are the symptoms.In the Pacific we have experienced a number ofsevere weather events and changes to our normal climate.Kiribati and the northern Cook Islands have becomewetter  while Fiji and Tonga have become drier. In Samoathe difference between daytime and night-timetemperatures has decreased. The southern Cook Islandsand Tonga have also become warmer. The drought thathit the Marshall Islands last year was so bad thathouseholds could not get even two hours of fresh waterper week.36For small island developing States it is not just aquestion of waiting to see what the research will say. Wehave to take action now. What happens to the small islandswill impact on the rest of the world sooner rather than later.We also expect that the industrialized countries will takeprecautionary measures. Anything less is an invitation tothe genocide of island peoples around the world.The industrialized countries should urgently reducetheir emissions  and others should follow suit. We ourselvesare taking steps to limit our already very small emissions.Part of our effort is to develop our renewable energy sector.In this regard  I am pleased to inform the Assembly that theGovernment has approved a solar energy policy. The firststage will be a project to install solar panels on all the outerisland health centres and one of the high schools. With thesupport of the United Nations Trust Fund for New andRenewable Sources of Energy and the Government of Italy we hope to begin implementing this project very soon  aswell as the overall policy. The policy will assist us ingenerating sustainable livelihoods in the outer islandcommunities.The Marshall Islands was honoured to host theAlliance of Small Island States workshop on climate changethis year  and we commend the outcome to allGovernments. We would like to express our appreciation toItaly  Norway  the United States  Canada and Switzerlandfor supporting the workshop and the United Nations TrustFund for providing the experts.As the custodian of three-quarters of a million squaremiles of ocean  the Marshall Islands is continuing itsendeavours to seek equitable solutions for the governanceof the oceans. We are cognizant that the activities that takeplace in our neighbouring seas will have an effect on thesustainable development of the marine resources within ourexclusive economic zone.Unsustainable fishing practices such as the use of driftnets and small mesh sizes must therefore be bannedforever. The Marshall Islands has been working togetherwith the Pacific island countries to develop a regional treatythat would address implementation of fisheries conservationand their sustainable management. Various aspects ofimportance include the need for data collection  vesselmonitoring systems  and greater support for our patrolboats. We also need to look at limiting the fleets permittedto fish in our waters; this would also assist us in furtherdeveloping our domestic fleet.My Government applauds the efforts of the PacificForum  in particular the Permanent Representative ofPapua New Guinea who  in cooperation with the RioGroup  has brought this matter forward. We will continueto seek common-sense solutions to the vexing problemsthat confront us in ocean matters.The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the MarshallIslands has responsibility for and is predominantlyfocused on the social development and improvement inthe lives of our people in the outer island communities.One such example is the solar power project I mentioned.We are constantly engaged in seeking solutions to addressthese concerns  one such event being national economicand social summit. Through the outcome of that summit we are striving to bring about the partnerships that thesecommunities require for their economic and socialdevelopment. Many exciting new ideas have comeforward  especially for the development of agriculture fisheries and sustainable tourism. What is lacking isconcerted donor support  but we are hopeful that withdetailed and pragmatic proposals this situation willchange.Earlier this year  at the Preparatory Committee forthe follow-up to the Copenhagen Social Summit  Ioutlined some of the problems we face and the possiblesolutions we proposed. Those ideas are still valid. Mydelegation will continue to stress the need for support forthese efforts during this session and at the special sessionon social development next year.Women’s rights are a cornerstone of the MarshallIslands Constitution. As a matrilineal society  we have acultural attachment to the promotion of the rights of allpeople  but especially for the women of our society. Wehave in place a unit in the Ministry of Internal Affairs toassist in the implementation of our policy on women andto address the achievements of women in our society. Ican inform the Assembly that a national caucus of womenwas recently established to increase further theirinvolvement in the political decision-making process. Mydelegation will actively participate in the preparatorywork for the special session on the implementation of theBeijing Conference to be held next year.Equally important to the Marshall Islands are humanrights in the general sense. We have tried to give practicalimplementation to the ideals that we all hold dear. TheMarshall Islands Constitution defines respect for humanrights as the fundamental obligation of the Government.It sets out the basic parameters for the holding of free37elections  the right of free speech and thought  and the rightto economic and social development. We hold theseprinciples in high regard  and indeed we are currently in theprocess of holding general elections to the Parliament andto the local governments. The elections are free and fair and open to the most stringent oversight to ensure there isno interference in the free choice of the people.In line with our efforts to consolidate our democracyand our free institutions  we are looking at the opportunitiesin the various human rights instruments of the UnitedNations. I hope to be able to report soon that we willbecome party to the most important of these instruments even though I would contend that our Constitution alreadygives full voice to these rights. In this regard  we were veryheartened to hear what the Secretary-General had to say onthe subject. We think that he pinpointed the real issue here:that it is people who are the most important  that it isadherence to human rights that we must safeguard. We willsupport all efforts to see to it that new initiatives are givenproper consideration.As a small but determined democracy  the MarshallIslands supported the inclusion of the agenda item on theneed to examine the exceptional international situationpertaining to the Republic of China on Taiwan and ensurethat the fundamental right of its 22 million people toparticipate in the work and activities of the United Nationsis fully respected. We hope to achieve a resolution of thismatter in the near future. There is still a need for an ad hoccommittee to be established to examine the matter further.The United Nations has come a long way on the pathto reform  which we all know is an ongoing process  nevera single event. My delegation congratulates the Secretary-General for his outstanding efforts: he deserves our fullsupport and thanks. But the reforms so far made are injeopardy because of the continued non-payment ofcontributions by certain Members. This is intolerable andcannot continue: the support from Member States cannotfalter. We must all pay our dues on time  in full andwithout conditions.As part of this reform process  we too have noted theanomalies in the regional groupings here at the UnitedNations. We think it is high time to review this matter  asAustralia  New Zealand  Papua New Guinea  Fiji andSamoa have all eloquently pointed out.There is also a need to finalize the reform of theSecurity Council. In this regard  I wish to thank thedelegation of Italy for its reasonable and logicalcontribution to our debate on this matter.We must also ensure that the United Nationsagencies are responsive to the special needs of thedeveloping countries. The Marshall Islands has benefitedto some extent from various United Nations DevelopmentProgramme (UNDP) projects. We feel that more can bedone  and we look forward to increasing our cooperationwith United Nations agencies  such as UNDP  the UnitedNations Population Fund (UNFPA)  the United NationsChildren's Fund (UNICEF) and the United NationsEducational  Scientific and Cultural Organization(UNESCO) and others.In conclusion  Mr. President  you can count on thefull support and cooperation of the Marshall Islandsdelegation to assist you in bringing our deliberations to afruitful conclusion."
"111",4584,"MKD",54,1999,"Allow me first of all to congratulateMr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  Minister for Foreign Affairs ofthe Republic of Namibia  for having been electedPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourthsession. At the same time  I would like to express myappreciation of and respect for the President of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-third session  Mr. DidierOpertti  for the results achieved during his presidency.Let me also express my deep respect for Secretary-General Kofi Annan  for his excellent leadership of theOrganization. I wish to assure him that the Republic ofMacedonia is ready to continue to closely cooperate withhim.The Republic of Macedonia welcomes the admissionof the new Members — the Republic of Kiribati  theRepublic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga — andwishes them success in their contribution to UnitedNations activities  and at the same time expresses its41readiness to establish diplomatic relations with them. Also I hope that we shall continue the process of establishingdiplomatic relations between the Republic of Macedonia —of course  using the constitutional name — and MemberStates with which we have not yet done so.On this occasion  I would like to express my deepestcondolences to the people of Taiwan on the earthquake thathit the Republic of China on Taiwan  with which theRepublic of Macedonia has recently established diplomaticrelations.It is with regret that we have to note that one of themain characteristics of the past year was flagrant and highlyrisky disrespect for the fundamental values of democraticsociety. In addition to the major tragedies the world wasfaced with  we witnessed a growing trend of armedconflicts and internal and external tensions. Concerning thearea surrounding the Republic of Macedonia  I would focuson the huge humanitarian crisis that took place in South-Eastern Europe and the heavy consequences whichjeopardized the stability and security of the Balkans andbeyond in Europe.The Kosovo crisis had particularly adverse effects onmy country. We had to cope with an enormous influx ofrefugees  numbering more than 360 000  or 18 per cent ofthe total population. The Republic of Macedonia entered arather difficult economic  social and political situation thattended to destabilize it  particularly against the backgroundthat the international community reacted with insufficientspeed and agility. The damage which the Macedonianeconomy suffered is enormous  amounting to approximately$660 million. A large number of workers were dismissed asa result of lost markets and increased transportation costs.The unemployment rate reached 40 per cent. All of this hasnegatively affected the already poor economic and socialsituation. In these circumstances  the citizens of theRepublic of Macedonia have demonstrated greathumaneness towards the refugees  tolerance and solidarity but also restraint in the conditions of enormous social political and economic pressure they were exposed to andwhose consequences could have been more dramatic.Finally  we should not forget that there are still 30 000refugees in the Republic of Macedonia. I urge theAssembly to continue the joint efforts for their safe returnto their homes.At the same time  the peace forces of the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) for Kosovo weredeployed in the Republic of Macedonia in support of theinternational efforts for a political resolution of the crisis as were a large number of international governmental andnon-governmental organizations.Macedonia has managed to overcome thesehardships  but the consequences are still being felt in thenational economy. Financial assistance and support fromthe international community are indispensable for therecovery of the national economy. It is beyond doubt thatcompensation for the damage we suffered by making ournational capacities available for the resolution of theKosovo crisis should be an obligation of the internationalcommunity.The Macedonian Government highly appreciates theassistance provided by the international community thusfar through certain financial institutions or on a bilateralbasis. The assistance should continue  which is to say  weexpect States to fully carry out the commitments theyhave undertaken. This is the right moment to write offparts of our external debts as a recognition of the effortswe are making to overcome the crisis. Today  the onlything that the Republic of Macedonia requests is thefulfilment of the promises made by the internationalcommunity during the crisis.Even prior to the outbreak of the crisis and theadoption of Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)  mycountry had consistently supported a peaceful andpolitical solution to the Kosovo crisis that would includesubstantial autonomy within the framework of the FederalRepublic of Yugoslavia; respect for the human rights ofall living in Kosovo; respect for the inviolability ofexisting borders; the cessation of hostilities and ofrepression; the deployment of peace forces; the safe andfree return of refugees; the demilitarization of the KosovoLiberation Army (KLA) and other paramilitary forces;and the economic reconstruction of Kosovo and theregion.I would like to take this opportunity to commend theefforts made fully to implement Security Councilresolution 1244 (1999). The Republic of Macedonia  inthis respect  will continue to support the United NationsInterim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK)  theEuropean Union  the Organization for Security andCooperation in Europe  the Council of Europe and allother international governmental and non-governmentalorganizations. In this context  I would like to recall thaton many occasions the Macedonian Government hasdemonstrated its readiness closely to cooperate with theSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  with his Special42Representative  Mr. Kouchner  and with UNMIK  and thatit has offered its good offices.The Republic of Macedonia strongly supports theStability Pact for South-Eastern Europe as one of the mostimportant adopted documents for the wider region and forEurope. Furthermore  it is prepared to take an active part inits implementation and to contribute to the reconstructionand stabilization of the region and its speedy integrationinto European structures. The Stability Pact  through itsthree pillars  or “working tables”  and through the relevantinternational global and regional institutions  is expected tocontribute to a lasting stabilization of the region and to itsfinal integration into European and Euro-Atlantic structures.To this effect  I would like to call upon all of the parties tothis extremely important document to mutually reinforcetheir activities and to enhance their coordination.I would here like to underscore the strong interest ofthe Republic of Macedonia in the prompt implementationof the second pillar for economic development andreconstruction. The most important issue linked with itsunimpeded functioning and the realization of the desiredresults — greater inclusion of the Balkans in Europeaneconomic  political and democratic trends — is the settingup of lasting mechanisms for the necessary fund-raising andthe securing of funds to this end. Many United Nationsprogrammes and activities could be used for this purpose.The Republic of Macedonia is interested in seeing theUnited Nations play a role in this sphere.The Republic of Macedonia will propose a pertinentdraft resolution at this session of the General Assembly thatstresses the importance of the prompt consolidation anddevelopment of South-Eastern Europe  the importance ofthe Stability Pact and the need for the full implementationof Security Council resolution 1244 (1999). We areconvinced that the draft will be supported by all StatesMembers of the United Nations.Let us hope that this will be the last crisis in theBalkans or South-Eastern Europe. But to prevent anyrecurrence of this kind of situation  we will have to defendmore successfully democratic principles and values anddevelop long-term preventive strategies.I am convinced that the beginning of the nextmillennium will mark a new era in the history of this area which has been overburdened with conflicts and thereforeneeds to focus primarily on its own development andprosperity. In the long run  regional stability can beprovided by economic development  democracy  respect ofhuman rights and the rights of national minorities  andbilateral and regional cooperation. However  the best wayto guarantee the security of the region and transform itinto an area of democracy  development  stability andcooperation is for the countries of the region to join theEuropean Union and the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization (NATO) and become fully fledged members.The Republic of Macedonia is among the countriesmost affected by the crisis — economically  socially andpolitically. This has hampered our efforts to build asociety that meets the expectations of our people.Despite the major challenges it has confronted in thepast  my country has managed to implement and advancethe strategic commitments set out in its foreign policy:integration in the European Union  inclusion inEuro-Atlantic security structures and development ofgood-neighbourliness.The success of that policy is reflected in the fact thatthe Republic of Macedonia was able to stay out of thefour armed conflicts which have taken place in the lastdecade on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. For thefirst time in the history of the Republic of Macedonia asan independent country  we have been faced with a waron our borders. In such circumstances  the contribution ofthe peaceful and constructive Macedonian policy toconflict resolution is highly significant. The Republic ofMacedonia is fully committed to carrying out the reformsthat have been initiated  based on European standards  inthe political  economic and democracy fields  withmaximum respect for human rights  including minorityrights.That commitment by the Macedonian Governmentand the results of the reforms have been commended bythe international community. That is precisely why theEuropean Union has decided that the Republic ofMacedonia should be the first partner in thecommencement of negotiations for the conclusion of theStability and Association Agreement.The Republic of Macedonia has a long-termcommitment to the continuing improvement of itsrelations with all of its neighbours. The advancement anddevelopment of these relations  as well as of bilateralcooperation with all of its neighbours  is evidenced byintensive cooperation in the framework of a number ofregional initiatives. Two trilateral meetings have takenplace among the Ministers of Foreign Affairs ofMacedonia  Albania  Bulgaria and Greece  the aim of43which was to coordinate and promote activities aimed at amore successful implementation of the Stability Pact.I would like to emphasize that the policy of theGovernment of the Republic of Macedonia  elected lessthan a year ago  is aimed in particular at improving  assoon as possible  the situation in the region. To this effect many practical steps have been taken  which to our mutualsatisfaction are yielding results.As we approach the new millennium  the last sessionof the General Assembly for this century is undoubtedly theforum best suited to evaluating what has been achieved inthe area of the promotion and protection of human rightsand freedoms. Over the last 50 years  impressive progresshas been made in international humanitarian law. Today  weare proud to note that the United Nations  having adoptedthe fundamental Universal Declaration of Human Rights has managed to affirm the international consensus on thebasic postulates of human dignity and to promote them asa basic standard and objective to be attained by allindividuals and nations.Of no less importance is the promotion andstrengthening of all United Nations human rights bodiesengaged in the protection and promotion of human rights including minority rights. In this regard  the Republic ofMacedonia supports the reform of the mechanisms andfunctioning of the United Nations bodies in this area.This year we mark the tenth anniversary of theadoption of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.Although this Convention has been ratified by almost allStates  its genuine implementation is still a desired aim. Alarge number of children are still victims of disrespect fortheir fundamental rights. We therefore fully and firmlysupport the efforts made at this year's session of theCommission on Human Rights to undertake concretemeasures for the protection of the rights of the child  theaim of which is to promote the next century as the centuryof the universal protection of the rights of the child.The role and efforts of the international community inthe full implementation of currently accepted standards andprinciples are important  but the primary role andresponsibility lies with the States themselves. As is evidentfrom the democratic development of my country  theRepublic of Macedonia completely associates itself with theendeavours of the international community for theobservance and promotion of human rights.In the twenty-first century the maintenance ofinternational peace and security all over the world shouldbe the priority aim of our Organization. As the Secretary-General stated in his report  the world  and ourOrganization in particular  will be faced with the need tobe fully involved in the prevention and peacefulresolution of conflicts and with the development of theaffected States. The elimination of poverty and reducingthe gap between the developed and developing countriesshould be our priorities  as my colleagues have alreadysaid. In the next century the Republic of Macedoniawould like to see an improvement in economicdevelopment and international economic cooperation  aswell as an enhancement of efforts being made within thedisarmament process and greater support for them.We may note that the global community hasachieved significant improvements with regard to livingstandards and the reduction of poverty. The globaleconomy is showing modest but constant growth of 2 percent annually  while the volume of trade is continuing toincrease. However  it seems that  irrespective of theimportant accomplishments  the world community isconfronted with a series of alarming problems that mustbe resolved.Increased world poverty and unemployment are keyproblems  which should be the main preoccupation of theinternational community  the aim being to eliminate them.Half the population of the world lives on less than $3 percapita per day  while the unemployment rate is increasingcontinuously; the international community has to face thechallenge of overcoming that situation. Decisions of theinternational community regarding international economicpolicies are most frequently made in the United Nationsframework. The Governments of the developed countrieshave a leading role to play and the primary responsibilityin this domain.The indebtedness of the developing countries andcountries in transition is mainly a result of inappropriatepolitical circumstances  in the form of armed conflicts;different types of embargoes and factors make itimpossible for them to market their goods; and naturaldisasters. Writing off the debts  or part of the debts  ofthe countries affected by objective external factors wouldhave a very positive impact on diminishing global povertyand unemployment and on economic development. Onlythe economically developed and independent State can betruly politically independent and sovereign and have arole to play in the international community.44Globalization of the world economy and liberalizationof world trade are necessary preconditions for theimprovement of living standards and the reduction ofexisting differences in countries' development relative toglobal development. The role of the United Nations in thisarea is of great importance. The increased globalization andliberalization of the world economy should be accompaniedby a lowering of existing barriers and by facilitating thefree transfer of goods and services and of the work force.This would create a unified world economy in its truemeaning.In the next century more attention will be placed onthe observance of the United Nations Charter. In theinterests of the maintenance of international peace andcollective security  it is extremely important that SecurityCouncil decisions be made on behalf of all the MemberStates of our Organization  without its being possible forthem to abuse the right of veto. The contribution of theRepublic of Macedonia to the promotion of peace andsecurity is well known  and this was confirmed by thedeployment on its territory of the United Nations PreventiveDeployment Force (UNPREDEP)  which was unfortunatelyterminated at the moment when the region may have beenmost in need of it.The importance of the leading role played by thissingle universal Organization is reflected in its skill inadapting to real situations and practical problems. I amdeeply convinced that the new challenges are alreadyreflected in the manner of operation of our Organizationand in its structure. I would like to salute the firmdetermination to continue to implement United Nationsreforms  which have already produced results  as stated inthe Secretary-General's report. The Republic of Macedoniais of the opinion that the reform of the United Nationssystem will be successful only if reform of the SecurityCouncil is followed by reform of the General Assembly andthe Economic and Social Council.We expect the fifty-fourth session of the GeneralAssembly to successfully conclude preparations for theorganization of the Millennium Assembly in the year 2000.In this context  we are anticipating with great interest theSecretary-General's report. At the same time  we join theappeal for all Member States to be represented by heads ofState or Government at that event.United Nations Member States must constantlycontribute to the strengthening of the basic democraticvalues of peace  security  stability  social and economicdevelopment  respect for international law and respect forhuman and minority rights. The United Nations is the trueplace for the improvement of these basic values. Theresolution of each country to persist in that way is ofcrucial importance in determining whether we will jointlymanage to fully implement these commitments and enjoythe fruits of development.I would like to assure the Assembly that theRepublic of Macedonia has already embarked on that roadand will continue to make its contribution to the fullimplementation of those values."
"112",4630,"MLI",54,1999,"I wish first tocongratulate you warmly  Sir  on your election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourthsession. This does honour to your country  Namibia  andis a source of joy and satisfaction to all of Africa  andparticularly to my country  Mali. You may count on thefull support of my delegation  on behalf of which it is myhonour to address the General Assembly today. I amconvinced that with your talent and your experience as anestimable diplomat you will guide the work of theAssembly to a successful conclusion.I wish also to take this opportunity to convey toyour predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Didier Opertti  oursatisfaction at the commitment and skill with which heguided the work of the Assembly at its fifty-third session.Let me also reaffirm the gratitude of the Governmentof Mali to the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. KofiAnnan  for the determination and wisdom he has shownin the quest for solutions to the central concerns of theinternational community.The fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly istaking place at the dawn of the third millennium  at atime when the gap between the developed and thedeveloping worlds is growing ever larger. Imbalances in9the world economy  the unequal distribution of wealth poverty  grave and massive violations of human rights massacres and conflicts of every kind pose a serious threatto international stability.Despite significant progress in many areas  the UnitedNations continues to face daunting challenges. It mustformulate a collective approach with shared responsibilityand greater  more effective solidarity to bring about theeconomic cooperation that is indispensable for lasting peaceand security for all. In that context  many and variedchallenges face Mali  Africa  the world at large  and theUnited Nations at the end of the twentieth century  such asdebt  development financing  security includingdisarmament and international terrorism  democracy  humanrights  international migration and United Nations reform.Last year we spoke out from this rostrum against aglobalization dominated by market forces and a financialapproach  and in favour of a globalization based onsustainable human development. That is the real challenge and our growing conviction is that we can resolve allpresent imbalances if  through renewed  responsible andcandid political dialogue  we tackle them with a global andunified vision  with commitment to genuine partnership  andwith a sense of shared  equal responsibility in the buildingof a better world  a world for mankind. That is theapproach we must take to addressing the problems ofdeveloping countries: indebtedness  their integration as realactors in the world economy  and development financing.The problem of developing-country indebtedness mustcontinue to be a focus of the attention of the internationalcommunity with a view to finding a lasting solution thatwill be acceptable to all. To be sure  the Heavily IndebtedPoor Countries Debt (HIPC) Initiative and the initiativeadopted at the Cologne summit of the Group of Seven inJune 1999 were important steps. But  because it absorbsmore than a third of the export income of developingcountries and because debt-servicing costs imperil thefuture of generations to come  debt is an insurmountableobstacle to any development effort. The debt burden mustnot merely be lightened; debts must be cancelled. Withoutplaying down any responsibility here  debt cancellation hasbecome necessary in order to enable the efforts andsacrifices made by developing countries to yield their fullbenefits for their peoples. Debt cancellation  along with anew  more rational debt policy based on the productivecapacities of these countries  would lay the foundations fortrue  sustainable development financing.Long seen as an act of generosity by the richtowards the poor  development assistance is now viewedas a tangible expression of a solidarity that isindispensable. It has significantly declined in recent years and we must do everything possible to reverse that trendin order to better meet the financing needs of developingcountries. My country  Mali — which has already enactedsignificant political  economic and structural reforms —hopes that special attention will be given to the situationof African countries in any consideration of this matter.I appeal to developed countries completely to fulfil theircommitment to increase official development assistance to build up our economic capacities in the areas ofprocessing and marketing our commodities  and to payproper prices for our products and facilitate marketaccess.The current state of affairs demands a newpartnership based on an acknowledgement thatdevelopment financing is a shared responsibility  whichshould be reflected in more equitable burden-sharingamong donors. Here  the high-level meeting ondevelopment financing is of crucial importance. Mydelegation believes that that meeting should be seen in thetwo-fold context of follow-up to the major summits andinternational conferences of the 1990s and of the GeneralAssembly’s Agenda for Development.More than half a century after the creation of theUnited Nations  there is no further need to prove itsrelevance and contribution to the disarmament agenda andto building international peace and security. Here I stressthe particular importance that Mali attaches todisarmament in general and to micro-disarmament inparticular. The establishment of nuclear-weapon-freezones on the basis of arrangements freely entered intoamong the States of the region concerned  and theextension of such zones to all regions of the world  willmake a significant contribution to international peace andsecurity. In that connection  I would recall that Mali hasratified the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty —the Pelindaba Treaty — to manifest its support for theinitiative to make Africa a nuclear-weapon-free zone.However  let us make no mistake about it  whattoday seriously threatens peace  the security of women men and children in Africa are small arms and anti-personnel mines.As we take stock of the progress made in combatingthe proliferation of small arms since the fifty-thirdsession  while we appreciate the efforts of the United10Nations Panel of Governmental Experts  we totally supportthe appeal for action adopted by the InternationalConference on Sustainable Disarmament for SustainableDevelopment  held in Brussels on 12 and 13 October 1998.We should welcome the historic decision of the membercountries of the Economic Community of West AfricanStates (ECOWAS)  on the initiative of Mali  to declare amoratorium on the export  import and production of smallarms starting on 1 November 1998 and lasting for threeyears  a moratorium that is supported by a code of conduct.The meeting of the ECOWAS Ministers for Foreign Affairsthat was held in Bamako in March 1999  defined themodalities for the implementation of the programme ofcoordination and assistance for security and development and adopted a plan of action in nine priority areas to makethe moratorium operational. These efforts deserve supportfrom the international community so that there will be moreoverall cooperation to stem the proliferation of small armsand mitigate their devastating effects.Also  it is essential to support and extend thismoratorium  to apply more strictly the laws and rules inforce on arms transfers  to improve them and strengthenthem at all levels and to back them up with codes ofconduct. We also need to strengthen the capacity of Statesand increase coordination to deal with this phenomenon.But we also need to work on a progressive and effectiveinternational normative mechanism to control the circulationof small arms. We support very strongly the decision of theAssembly to convene an international conference on thisquestion.Similarly  we must continue our work to free theworld of the scourge of anti-personnel mines  and inparticular we need to rid Africa of them  for they continueto sow death and mayhem even after conflicts end. We willachieve this by working in the context of the MaputoDeclaration and seeing to it that everyone  withoutexception  ratifies and implements the Convention on thebanning of anti-personnel mines. We ratified theConvention very early on  and our country has destroyed itsmeagre stock of these weapons  which we never in factused. Mali is now adopting the national legislation requiredby the Convention on the banning of anti-personnel mines.In the last 50 years  peacekeeping operations havebecome an important tool for resolving conflicts bypeaceful means and for promoting international peace andsecurity. However  I would like to say that in and ofthemselves  they are not a solution to conflicts  but onlyspecial measures to prevent conflicts from getting worsepending a peaceful solution.Our constant quest for peace is reflected in oureffective participation in peacekeeping operations and ourtotal support for the Mechanism for Conflict Prevention Management and Resolution in Africa  to which theinternational community should give special attention. Weask the international community to mobilize quickly  ingood time and to a greater extent to support theimmediate implementation of hard-to-reach and alwaysprecarious peace agreements  as well as peace-buildingprogrammes.Mali also supports any measures to help create aclimate allowing us to confront the causes of conflicts which now relate primarily to underdevelopment  poorgovernance  deficiencies in democracy and badcooperation policies. We pin great hopes on the decisionof the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to make theyear 2000 a year of peace and security in Africa  and wevery much hope that the international community willgive strong support to our continent in its prevention andpeacekeeping efforts.I cannot fail to mention here the close link betweensecurity and development and the consequent need tofinance security as an integral part of development action.Nor can I conclude without mentioning the ghastly appalling question of child soldiers.President Konaré has said in this regard “we have an absolute responsibility for the sad lot ofchild soldiers  which is not acceptable and cannot beborne; we must put an end to it by unambiguouslycondemning all those who use these children andwho instil in them a culture of violence  thus sowingthe seeds of the perpetuation of violence andconflicts ... We must work for a real culture ofpeace. The place of our children is in school; it isour responsibility to put an end to this heinousphenomenon by denouncing it and taking vigoroussteps against it  including international criminalsanctions. Post-conflict programmes must includeamong their priorities the reintegration througheducation of child soldiers; and in a general way itmust make education the heart of the strategy forbuilding peace and sustainable development.”The decision to hold a special session of the GeneralAssembly to follow-up to the World Summit for Childrenin 2001 coincides with the commemoration of the tenthanniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.We must take that opportunity to hasten our attainment ofthe objectives that we have set for ourselves with regard tochildren.We have a unique responsibility towards them. Theleast we can do on the eve of the new millennium is toprovide all boys and girls better health  schools andprotection from wars and famines.Mali is staunchly committed to democracy and humanrights. Observance of human  political  civil  economic social and cultural rights is an integral part of economicprosperity  social equity and the promotion of peace andsecurity. In this context  a certain number of minimumstandards are necessary in any democracy based on law andrespect for human rights. I am referring to values that weall deem to be fundamental and the observance of whichwe are committed to: rule of law  respect for human rights a system of democratic government and the conditions fornecessary changes of government in a republican anddemocratic system. In a democracy  this is the minimumthat we must all  each and every one of us  consolidate build and develop.The situation in the Middle East remains a source ofconcern  despite the revival of the peace process. I wish toreaffirm here the unreserved support of Mali for the juststruggle of the Palestinian people as well as for acomprehensive just and lasting solution based on therelevant resolutions of the Security Council and theprinciple of land for peace.Turning now to the Lockerbie crisis  Mali  basingitself on the progress made in dealing with this question appeals for the complete  immediate lifting of the sanctionsthat have been unjustly imposed on the fraternal people ofthe Libyan Arab Jamahirya  and I am pleased to renew tothem the support and solidarity of the people of Mali.Likewise  we are still concerned at the humanitarian cost tocivilians in other countries that have been unjustly targetedby sanctions.Security and stability are facing new threats  includingthe problem of drugs — which has become worse withglobalization — organized crime  international terrorism money-laundering and corruption. In the face of thesethreats and their adverse effects of them  the internationalcommunity must step up its efforts to put in place themechanisms necessary to eradicate them and cooperatebetter in order to combat them. In regard to internationalterrorism  Mali signed the African convention in Algiers and we support the appeal of the OAU for the speedyconclusion of an international convention in order betterto prevent terrorism and to combat it more effectively.Today  when mankind is preparing for a newmillennium  it is essential to adapt the United Nations tothe needs of our time. The challenges that we will befacing demand that we adopt appropriate measures nowso that the next century will enjoy more peace and morejustice in a new partnership based on solidarity among allnations.If the United Nations is to remain the gatheringplace in which all countries can make their voices heardto find solutions to problems that confront them  it mustnot be marginalized. Therefore  it is necessary today morethan ever to review the functioning of the system of theOrganization in order to adapt it to present and futurecircumstances.My delegation is convinced of the need todemocratize further our Organization through acomprehensive restructuring of its main organs particularly the Security Council  the composition ofwhich reflects the state of the world as it was 50 yearsago and which does not in any way reflect the political economic and social realities of today’s or tomorrow’sworld.In addition  my delegation reaffirms Africa’s demandfor an equitable division among the two categories ofseats. We call upon Member States to reinforce theprestige  the authority  the effectiveness and thelegitimacy of the Council.This session gives the international community aunique opportunity to demonstrate once again that theUnited Nations is an active  dynamic institution  capableof confronting the major concerns of the world. In orderto do this it must prove that  despite the sometimesdiscouraging complexity of the issues involved and theoften divergent national interests of Member States  theOrganization is capable of working with determination creativity and effectiveness for the common good of all.This is what we aspire to."
"113",4671,"MLT",54,1999,"﻿I join other delegations incongratulating you  Mr. President  on your election asPresident of the General Assembly. Your experience anddiplomatic skills will undoubtedly guide us successfullythrough the fifty-fourth session. I would also like to expressour gratitude to your predecessor  Mr. Didier Opertti  whodisplayed such competence and ability in conducting ourwork during the past year. We would also like to expressour deep sense of satisfaction and gratitude to theSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for his incessantdiplomatic intervention to help resolve conflicts in variousparts of the globe.May I also take this opportunity to offer our mostsincere congratulations to the three new Members of thisOrganization  the Republic of Nauru  the Kingdom ofTonga and the Republic of Kiribati. I should also add thatMalta already cooperates closely with these three newMembers through our joint membership of theCommonwealth.For over half a century the United Nations has beeninstrumental in fostering a culture of partnership amongStates. The foundation and survival of a universalOrganization entrusted with the maintenance ofinternational peace and security and the promotion ofsocial justice  freedom and human rights is anunprecedented achievement in the history of mankind.Undeniably  great strides have been made by thisOrganization in helping forge swords into ploughsharesthrough enhanced cooperation between its Member States.We have striven individually and collectively  painfully attimes and imperfectly at others  towards a process ofpolitical  social  economic and technological evolution.Globalization has become a central concept in the way weview the world. Interdependence has consequently becomethe norm.Overshadowing such progress  however  are thearmed conflicts  economic imbalances and socialdislocation that we still face. Events in our days show thatgross violations of human rights and disregard forhumanitarian principles continue to plague us. Theatrocities that human beings are capable of inflicting onone another defy the noble aspirations that inspired thebirth of our Organization. The irony of such a situationcannot be lost on anyone. Even less can the tragedy ofsuch a predicament be ignored.Vicious armed conflicts  such as those we have beenwitnessing in parts of Africa and in the Balkans  not tomention the atrocities recently perpetrated in East Timor continue to destroy an untold number of lives  disruptingentire societies  traumatizing tens of thousands of men women and children and diverting precious resourcesaway from development.The international community cannot afford to becomplacent about the humanitarian crises that we are23witnessing today. It is incumbent on each of us to rise tothe challenge of securing a world free from deprivation fear and oppression. Strengthening the United Nations tobecome better equipped to address contemporary needs andto meet the challenges of the future thus becomes moreurgent. The role of the United Nations in the promotion ofpreventive diplomacy must increasingly assume particularimportance if  collectively  we are to defuse and resolvepotentially destructive situations.Peace and security are intimately intertwined withdevelopment and prosperity. Too often  lack of developmentprecipitates conflict. Promoting development helps preventwars and acts as a means of creating channels ofcooperation within  as well as among  nations. This was theessential message emanating from the InternationalConference on Population and Development in Cairo andthe Copenhagen World Summit for Social Development. Itwas a commitment to consolidate the partnership of nations a commitment restated and underscored during the reviewconferences held within the fifty-third session of theGeneral Assembly.Democracy  good governance  respect for humanrights and the rule of law are essential foundations for theattainment of peace and development and for upholding thedignity of the human person. Where these are absent  ourefforts to implement post-conflict peace-building rehabilitation and reconstruction programmes in war-tornareas must be intensified. The importance of cementingceasefire agreements with stable political and economicinstitutions  while simultaneously creating partnershipsbetween Governments and civil society  cannot beunderestimated.One of the main thrusts of the work of the UnitedNations has been aimed at the equitable and long-lastingreform of the Security Council  especially given theexpanded membership of the Organization. It is in theinterest of all to find a solution to the Council's reform thatwill ensure its smooth functioning  transparency andenhanced relevance.While the root causes of conflicts are complex  theillegal proliferation and trafficking of weapons clearly hasa destabilizing effect on society and only serves to prolongconflicts. Increased global efforts are warranted to monitorand control the illicit transfer of small arms and lightweapons. The emerging global consensus on the issue isencouraging. Malta looks forward to the eventual conveningof an international conference on the illicit arms trade in allits aspects. Addressing this disruptive phenomenon becomesmore urgent when it is compounded by its complexlinkages with other equally destabilizing activities  suchas international crime  drug trafficking and terrorism.Responsibility for the plight of peoples cannot beshirked by national Governments. Accountability byindividuals for their actions must be enforced. Theinternational community's outrage at shocking  massiveviolations of human rights has found expression in theStatute of the International Criminal Court. The adoptionof the Statute last year in Rome constituted an importantmilestone. It is Malta's hope that it is only a matter oftime before the Court begins to function.Heinous crimes against humanity are an affront tothe intrinsic values of civilization. They cannot betolerated. Likewise  the shameless disregard for humanrights that have been enshrined in various internationalinstruments cannot go unheeded. Effective protection ofthose rights should not be allowed to fall victim toexcuses of national sovereignty. This is even morecompelling given that only last year we commemoratedthe fiftieth anniversary of the signing of the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights.The international community has made greatheadway in the way it deals with the world's resources tosafeguard the heritage of future generations. Since itjoined the Organization 35 years ago  Malta has played anactive role in this field. It would be remiss of me todaynot to pay tribute to Professor Arvid Pardo  Malta's firstPermanent Representative to the United Nations  whosadly passed away recently. His diplomatic skills andjudicious acumen  as well as his vision  were instrumentalin developing the concept of the common heritage ofmankind. This concept  so ably launched by ProfessorPardo on behalf of the Malta Government  was the key tothe process that eventually led to the adoption of theUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.In a similar vein  during the last session  mydelegation was active in promoting the idea of a betterand more substantive discussion on oceans throughimproved coordination among the various organs dealingwith the subject. In this regard  it is our hope that aworkable solution to this issue will be reached.Malta's readiness to play an active and positive rolein the furtherance of international peace and cooperationhas led to the reactivation of our application formembership in the European Union. In September of lastyear  following elections and a change in Government 24Malta reactivated its application  which had been frozen forthe previous two years. The application had been submittedin 1990  and by the time it was suspended in 1996  Maltawas widely considered as a prime candidate for earlymembership of the European Union. The 1998 reactivationwas therefore generally seen  both within and outside Malta as a resumption of unfinished business  rather than as a newbeginning.The contractual basis of our present relationship withthe Union remains the Association Agreement signed in1970  as subsequently amplified and amended. Until it issuperseded by membership  we expect this Agreement toremain in force and to continue to be complemented byadditional measures in both traditional and new areas ofcooperation  including the areas of justice and home affairs.We see our objective to join the European Union asthe most appropriate response to Malta's historical andcultural heritage  as well as to the economic  social andsecurity requirements of our national development. Theaccession negotiations that we hope to be conducting in thenear future will be guided by this perception. The outcomeof these negotiations will then be submitted to thejudgement of the Maltese people in a referendum.Since independence in 1964  Malta has beensteadfastly committed to the critical role that multilateralcooperation  as enshrined in the United Nations Charter  isincreasingly playing in the endeavour towards progress justice and stability within and among nations.Over the years  notwithstanding constraints imposedby its size and resources  Malta has engaged itself in manyUnited Nations-sponsored initiatives related to thepromotion of human rights  economic and socialdevelopment  disarmament  the peaceful settlement ofdisputes and safeguarding the environment. As members ofthe European Union  we expect to find increasedopportunities  as well as to benefit from an increasedcapacity to pursue these and related objectives at both theglobal and regional level.This certainty springs from our conviction that theEuropean Union is at the forefront of endeavours tostrengthen international understanding and cooperation. Itspolicies towards enlargement and regional cooperation  thepromotion of economic and social development  conflictresolution and peacekeeping provide a constant gauge of itsrelevance in this regard.Malta views the enlargement of the European Unionnot so much as an option but rather as a fulfilment. Eachenlargement step constitutes fulfilment for the Unionitself  and that contributes to the completion of anhistorical process that reverses the age-old conflict andthe fragmentation of the European continent. It is also afulfilment for a candidate country like Malta in thatmembership assures it of a continuing role in the politicaland economic life of the continent where most of itshistory and culture were  and continue to be  forged.The unfolding of events in Europe over the lastdecade highlights this fundamental dimension of theUnion's enlargement process. As they emerged frompolitical suppression and economic stagnation  the Centraland Eastern European States immediately defined theirnational aspirations within the framework of Europeanintegration. For its part  the European Union recognizedthat the objective of membership for all the Central andEastern European States was a vital ingredient insustaining stability and progress throughout the continentin the shorter and the longer term. Significantly  in spiteof the complexities involved  there is already a markedreadiness by the Union to contribute both assistance andfunds towards reconstruction in the Balkans whilesimultaneously pursuing enlargement through Central andEastern Europe and with the two Mediterraneanislands — Malta and Cyprus.Cooperation with the neighbouring regions andaround the world is  for the European Union  anindispensable accompaniment to enlargement. Be it in thetraditional transatlantic domain  on the still-evolvingEastern border or on its historical southern  Mediterraneanborder  the Union provides a constant and crediblereassurance of the outward-looking dimension embeddedin the European integration process.Straddling  as it does  both the horizontal and thevertical axes of the Mediterranean  Malta attachesparticular importance to the promotion of cooperation inthis area. It is as much for regional and globalgeostrategic reasons as it is in our own national securityinterests for the Mediterranean to be considered as ameeting place  rather than as a dividing line betweenpeoples and cultures.Of particular importance to us is the Euro-Mediterranean partnership launched in 1995 by theEuropean Union in Barcelona. This partnership providesstrong support for our belief that membership in theUnion will reinforce Malta's traditional role in the25promotion of Mediterranean security and cooperation. Oneof Malta's contributions to the Union will be the addedinsight into  and the commitment to  Euro-Mediterraneancooperation that Malta will bring with it. At the regionallevel  as much as at the broader international level  Maltasees its membership in the European Union as an elementof further involvement in the process of multilateralcooperation for peace and prosperity in the Mediterranean.Malta has welcomed  and is wholeheartedly involvedin  the Barcelona partnership because of its intrinsic meritsin promoting a concrete and effective programme ofcooperation in the Mediterranean. In this regard  at theirlast meeting in Stuttgart  the foreign ministers of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership agreed to reinforcecomprehensive stability in the region through the conclusionof the Euro-Mediterranean Charter for Peace andStability — an initiative in which Malta has been activefrom the outset and which it is keen to see take shape.Despite the many challenges faced by theMediterranean  it is our firm view that lasting solutions maybe found. We sincerely believe that an early settlement ofthe Cyprus question along the lines of the relevant SecurityCouncil resolutions can be achieved.Malta has been encouraged by the positive overturessignalled by the major protagonists in the Middle Eastpeace process in recent months. What appeared to be for solong an intractable problem has been slowly but steadilyunfolding towards the path of reconciliation and peace.True cooperation within the region demands that the spiritof reconciliation prevail. Recent events — most especiallythe Wye II Agreement — carried forward by all thoseworking for peace in the region bode well for continueddialogue and cooperation between the parties of the region.It is in this light that we hail the progress achieved onthe question of Lockerbie and the resulting suspension ofsanctions on Libya. The satisfaction expressed recently byboth the Security Council and the European Union GeneralAffairs Council in respect of positive developments inLibya also augurs well for the inclusion of Libya in theEuro-Mediterranean process as soon as it adopts theBarcelona acquis. We welcome this development.May all these efforts lead to widespread cooperationfor the Mediterranean as a whole  bringing peace andprosperity for its people in the years to come.To many the new millennium is a time of promise andexpectation  a period of change and transition. Yet  to manyothers — indeed too many — it is a time of difficulty andtrepidation  of unfulfilled promises. Poised as we are onthe brink of a new era  it is vital that the United Nationsprevails to safeguard the well-being and prosperity offuture generations.Even our best efforts can be brought to nothing in aninstant  by the sheer force of nature. The recentdevastating earthquakes that hit the peoples of Turkey Greece and Taiwan have galvanized the internationalcommunity. Shocked by the loss of so many lives  thedisplacement of whole communities and the pain ofthousands  the international response to alleviate thesuffering was generous and expeditious. It was yetanother instance where the expression of solidaritytowards the victims of a natural disaster unveiled thehuman face of the international community.That same spirit also inspires us when challenged byman-made disasters. It was that same spirit that gave birthto the United Nations.We acknowledge that the United Nations cannot bethe perfect panacea for the ills of the world. Yet itremains the unique platform from which to promote andprotect the inherent rights of all peoples to live in peace freedom and dignity. By focusing on human security inits manifold dimensions — political  economic andsocial — the United Nations will continue to be a beaconof hope to all nations.The General Assembly has always shown that it isfully conscious of the need to invest in the future — aninvestment that also requires the consolidation of a cultureof peace. This was the essence of the resolutions thatproclaimed the year 2000 as the International Year for theCulture of Peace and the next decade as the InternationalDecade for a Culture of Peace and Non-violence for theChildren of the World.It is our fervent hope that the Millennium Assemblynext year will generate the necessary political will andsolidarity to ensure that our efforts on the internationalscene bear fruit to safeguard the values on which thisOrganization was founded. We must move the process ofintrospection and deliberation forward to a process ofcommitted implementation and action. Strong politicalwill and conviction are needed to fulfil our commongoals.26We should not aim for short-term remedies  but shouldrather pool our collective efforts in order to achievelong-lasting solutions to the challenges we face today —the eve of a new era.This is Malta's pledge for the new millennium. Thisis what we aim to ensure — that our efforts  both at thenational and international level will be achieved."
"114",4717,"MMR",54,1999,"Allow me to begin  Mr.President  by extending to you the warmest congratulationsof the delegation of the Union of Myanmar on yourunanimous election as President of the General Assemblyat its fifty-fourth session. Heavy and onerous indeed are theduties and responsibilities that fall upon you at thisparticular session. The task before the President of theGeneral Assembly in any year is by no means easy. It iseven less so this year  as this session has the additional taskof undertaking the preparatory work for the millenniumsession of next year. However  we are fully confident thatyour great wealth of experience and outstanding diplomaticskills will stand you in good stead in the discharge of yourresponsibilities and that you will bring this session to asuccessful conclusion. I pledge my delegation's fullestcooperation for the advancement of the work of theAssembly under your able leadership.I also wish to pay tribute to your predecessor  Mr.Opertti  for his invaluable contribution to the successfulconclusion of the previous session of the GeneralAssembly. Our tribute also goes to the Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  for his untiring efforts in leading theworld Organization so effectively through these extremelychallenging and difficult years.Myanmar consistently supports the principle of theuniversality of membership of this world Organization. Weare therefore most delighted to see in our midst three newMembers this year. On behalf of the delegation of theUnion of Myanmar  I should like to extend our warmestcongratulations to the delegations of the Republic ofKiribati  the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga which have taken their rightful places in the Assembly.We live in a rapidly changing world. With the end ofthe cold war  the old era of the bipolar world has becomea thing of the past. The world is in transition from the oldto the new world order  which has not fully taken shape. Atthis critical juncture  the world is faced with uncertaintiesand unsettling situations. Sometimes  the world has evenfallen victim to this turbulence and chaos.In dealing with such situations  it is our view that anysolutions sought or measures taken  even with the best ofintentions  should be in strict conformity with the purposesand principles of the United Nations Charter. Furthermore universally recognized principles governing internationalrelations and the principle of respect for State sovereigntyshould be taken into account before resorting to measuresof an extreme nature in connection with a particularsituation.One outstanding question relating to the reform ofthe United Nations is the reform of the structure andworking methods of the Security Council. We areencouraged to see that the General Assembly has taken asignificant procedural step by adopting a resolution on therequirement of a two-thirds majority in taking decisionsand adopting resolutions on this question.With regard to the core issue of enlargement of theSecurity Council  there are various proposals on the tableregarding the possible size of the Council. As a memberState of the Non-Aligned Movement  our preference is forenlargement of the Security Council up to 26 members.We favour the expansion of the membership of theCouncil in both categories  permanent and non-permanent.In order to overcome the current impasse on thequestion of permanent seats in the Security Council  acompromise formula  acceptable to all parties  should beworked out through enhanced consultations anddiscussions among the Member States. We are of theview that in the event other options fail to commandenough support  the idea of rotating permanent seatsshould also be considered as one of the options in thepermanent membership category.In the coming year  we are going to convene alandmark Assembly  the Millennium Assembly  and themillennium summit. It is crucially important that theMillennium Assembly and summit should not be mereceremonial events  but should come up with concreteideas and results. As it is clearly evident that the greatestchallenge facing mankind well into the next millenniumwill be economic development and poverty eradication forthe vast majority of people in the world  it is our viewthat particular attention should be given to these issues.Globalization can cut both positively and negatively.It can bring us new opportunities as well as additionalproblems. It is true that the process of globalization canfacilitate economic development and enhance the livingstandards of people. But at the same time  it can makesmaller and less developed States vulnerable to theundesirable negative effects of this process. One suchproblem caused by the process of globalization  istransnational crime  including illicit trafficking in narcoticdrugs  money-laundering  trafficking in persons  arms-smuggling  piracy and terrorism. These crimes poseserious threats to the peace and stability of mankind atboth national and regional levels. The nature of thisproblem is such that it requires national  regional andglobal responses.36I am pleased to inform the Assembly that in a bid tostrengthen cooperation in the regional grouping  Myanmarhosted the second Association of South-East Asian Nations(ASEAN) ministerial meeting on transnational crime inJune this year. The meeting was a success  and itconstituted a significant step in advancing regionalcooperation in combating this menace in the South-EastAsian region.Let me also address the fight against narcotic drugs inMyanmar. My Government is greatly concerned about thedrug menace  and the fight against narcotic drugs isregarded as a national task and the top priority. A masterplan had been adopted to totally eradicate poppy cultivationwithin 15 years  in cooperation with ethnic leaders whosigned peace agreements with the Government. In accordwith the master plan  many areas have been declaredopium-free zones and farmers are now turning to alternativecrops. Law enforcement has been stepped up in the borderareas  resulting in increased seizures of narcotic drugs.While we are quite successful in the suppression ofopium and heroin production  though only scantyinternational assistance has been received  another tide ofdanger has emerged in the form of new synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine. The new drugs are producedaround our porous borders with precursor chemicals suchas ephedrine  unavailable locally  and drug-makingequipment illegally smuggled in from neighbouringcountries. We are redirecting our efforts to deal with thenew problem with the cooperation of the countriesconcerned.Allow me to take this opportunity to apprise theAssembly briefly of the recent developments and trendstaking place in my country. My Government is againstneither democracy nor human rights. As a matter of fact we are taking necessary steps towards the establishment ofa democratic nation.We have a vision of establishing a modern  peacefuland developed democratic State. In order to bring thisvision into reality  we are reconsolidating national unity asthe number one priority. Necessary foundations are beinglaid for the emergence of a nation where a disciplined andmulti-party democratic system fully functions and justice liberty and equality prevail.We fully subscribe to the human rights normsenshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Here  I wish to underscore that the Government does notcondone any violations of human rights  and the type ofdemocracy we envision will guarantee the protection andpromotion of human rights  particularly the right to thesatisfaction of basic human needs such as clothing  foodand shelter. If there is an imperative need forimprovement in areas of human rights  we are willing andready to receive sensible suggestions and take whateveraction we possibly can.For instance  in the middle of this year  we receiveda delegation from the International Committee of the RedCross (ICRC) and made detailed arrangements for themto visit the prisons in Myanmar  as a confidence-buildingmeasure and to enable them to interview the inmates inaccordance with ICRC standard procedures. As a result ofthe full cooperation we extended to the ICRC delegation those visits were successful and productive  enabling bothsides to build mutual trust and goodwill. I consider itpertinent to state here that the ICRC delegation expressedtheir satisfaction with the overall situation regarding therelationship between the prison authorities and theinmates.Also  in August this year  Mr. Chris Sidoti  theAustralian Human Rights Commissioner  visited Myanmarand held discussions with the authorities concerned including myself  on the possibility of establishing anational human rights institution in Myanmar exchangesof views on cooperation between the two countries onhuman rights matters. As a result of this visit  we wereable to identify certain areas of cooperation between thetwo countries.In conformity with our consistent policy ofestablishing friendly and amicable relations with allcountries  we accepted the proposal for the visit of theTroika mission from the European Union to Myanmar inJuly this year. The mission was a fact-finding one  andboth sides expressed their satisfaction with the result. Itis our hope that this mission will further strengthen ourrelations with the European Union and pave the way forenhancing our contacts and dialogue with it towards amore meaningful and substantive level in the future.Similarly  we would also like to seek better relations withthe United States of America. Furthermore  I would liketo confirm our willingness to receive Mr. Alvaro de Soto the Special Envoy of the United Nations Secretary-General for Myanmar  to visit my country in the nearfuture.Myanmar is a multi-ethnic society where manynational races with different and diverse cultural andsocial backgrounds reside together. In addition  primarily37because of the “divide and rule” policy under colonial rule unity between the national races broke down and  as aresult  armed insurrections broke out all over the country.For these reasons  the present Government came to theconclusion that racial harmony was imperative and that  inits absence  various issues would continue to hampernational development endeavours. This rationale led theGovernment to make peace overtures to the armed groupsand establish peace with them.In order to restore trust and confidence between thenational races  the Government has even allowed the ethnicarmed groups to hold on to their weapons until ademocratic government is formally established under thenew constitution we are drafting now. This is a reflectionof our trust in our national brethren. At the same time  theGovernment has launched an ambitious plan for thedevelopment of border areas and the national races there.Despite its meagre financial resources  the Government hasspent over 15 billion kyats on the plan. At present  thenational races are actively working together with theGovernment in their regional development efforts. Thisconscious and willing involvement in national developmenttasks as equal partners has nurtured the Union spirit andsense of togetherness. With 17 armed groups in the legalfold  peace is holding the entire length and breadth of thecountry.As far as the question of national unity is concerned this is the first ever concrete result achieved  and it isunprecedented in the number of armed groups involved andthe extent of peace established. This is a result we achievedthrough sincere  genuine and open dialogue between theGovernment and ethnic armed groups where we first builtconfidence and then convinced each other of our respectiveobjectives. The Government is open to such a dialogue withany remaining groups  including the Karen National Union(KNU)  where we could build confidence and identifycommon ground in the sole interest of the country and itspeople. In this regard  I wish to reiterate that theGovernment's offer of peace to the KNU still stands.As a matter of fact  the same dialogue is going on inthe national convention process  where representatives ofnational races  political parties and delegates representingall strata of life are actively involved in drafting a newconstitution to lay a solid foundation for a new democraticpolitical system. The national convention has been asuccessful process whereby we have agreed on the basicprinciples that will govern the future life of the country andwill allow self-administered zones for certain nationalgroups.At this juncture  we are in the painful and arduousprocess of building a consensus on power-sharing  whichis an extremely sensitive issue for all parties concerned.In view of the delicate nature of this sensitive question it is vitally important for us to proceed systematically and with the greatest caution possible  to safeguard theinterests of all the national races and not to repeat theshortcomings of the previous two constitutions.We firmly believe that there is no better alternativeto the current national convention process if we genuinelywish to transform the country into a peaceful  modern developed  and democratic State. It is therefore essentialfor us to complete the national convention process.In this connection  it is our ardent hope that theinternational community will be supportive of our sincereefforts and appreciative of the positive achievements wehave made thus far for the development of the country.Myanmar is very often portrayed from outside as ifvast violations of human rights are taking place  forcedlabour is rampant  a free flow of narcotics exists andeconomic and social conditions are in chaos. Theseportrayals are in contradiction to the true situation. Letme cite here a widely known teaching of the LordBuddha called “Kalama Sutta”. The Sutta says:“Oh  Ye Kalamas  do not be led by whateveryou are told; do not be led by whatever has beenhanded down from the past generation; do not be ledby hearsay or common opinion; do not be led bywhatever the scriptures say; do not be led by merelogic; do not be led by mere deduction or inference;do not be led by considering outward appearance; donot be led by theory reflected as approval; do not beled by whatever a believable one says; and do not beled by what your teacher tells you is so”.In short  Lord Buddha taught us to accept and practiceonly when we ourselves know which is wrong and whichis right.Everyone who visits Myanmar can see the greennessof the country  peace and tranquillity prevailingthroughout the nation  people leading their normal dailylives with happiness and pleasure and building theirnation with zest and zeal. The people have full knowledgethat they are on the right path to peace and prosperity. Iwould like to invite all of you to come and see foryourselves. Seeing is believing!38Our nation is still in the process of building; solidfoundations are being laid  and infrastructure is beingimproved throughout the country. The Government and thepeople fully understand where we were  where we are nowand in which direction we are moving. We think ofourselves as builders  carpenters and plumbers building ahouse not to enjoy ourselves  but for all the people  whoare its rightful owners. When the building is finished furnished  furbished and fine-touched  it will be handedover to them. The people will decide who will manage thehouse.There are some Myanmar youths who abandoned ourland and took refuge elsewhere. I should like to take thisopportunity to send them a message from this podium thatthey will be welcomed with open arms if they return home and I would like to invite them to join us in building thenation. Our future is in our hands. If we work together  wewill reach our goal sooner rather than later.Religious harmony and freedom are our sharedtradition. Our previous two Constitutions provided forsafeguards against religious discrimination and religiousintolerance. Similarly  the fundamental principles we haveagreed on in the national convention process guaranteereligious indiscrimination and religious tolerance. AlthoughMyanmar is a predominantly Buddhist country  with nearly90 per cent of the population professing Buddhism  theGovernment attaches great importance to harmoniousrelations among the major religions existing in the country.Accordingly  the Government has taken all necessary stepsto encourage the prevailing harmony among the religionsthrough continuous contacts with the respective religiousleaderships and the provision of necessary assistance inboth financial and material terms to enable them to promotetheir faiths effectively. I want to state here that there isfreedom of religion for all faiths in the country. It is alsoworth recalling here that a few years ago Madam Ogata  theUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  remarkedin her capacity as Independent Expert of the Commissionon Human Rights  that Myanmar was a model society as faras religious tolerance was concerned. Though these remarkswere made some time ago  I wish to stress that they remainvalid and true to this day  and that the Government isdetermined to safeguard to the best of its ability all thereligions of the country against intolerance  and to helpthem in all possible ways to coexist harmoniously with eachother.I cannot conclude without mentioning what mycountry is achieving on the economic front. Despite someslowdown in economic growth due to the Asian financialcrisis  Myanmar has enjoyed considerable economicgrowth in recent years. The emphasis of the Governmentis to promote private sector development andprivatization. At the same time  the Government isfocusing its endeavours on the development of theinfrastructure as a precondition for sustained development.Moreover  the Government is carrying out an extensiveprogramme of land reclamation in wet and virgin lands bygranting large land holdings to the private companies. Theprivate sector has been able to reclaim and develop 1.1million acres of fallow land and wetlands for agriculturalproduction  which will not only help domestic foodsupply but will also contribute to regional food security.We have a vision for the new millennium  a visionof building a peaceful  modern  developed and democraticsociety. We will endeavour to realize our vision withwhatever resources we have at our disposal. Therealization of this goal could be accelerated if we receivethe support of the international community. We areoptimistic that we will be able to achieve our vision  andthat the international community will demonstrateunderstanding and appreciation of our sincere efforts touplift the economic and social well-being of the people ofMyanmar."
"115",4774,"MNG",54,1999,"The present sessionprovides Member States with an opportunity to hold aserious and substantive review of world affairs and the roleof the United Nations  with particular focus on theforthcoming twenty-first century. In this respect  I have nodoubt that the deliberations here will be useful in preparingfor the millennium summit and the Millennium Assemblynext year  to which events the Mongolian Governmentattaches great importance.The United Nations is a truly universal organizationcomprising large and small  developed and developingcountries. This year its membership reached 188 with theadmission of three new members: I take this opportunity toconvey the warm congratulations of the Mongolian peopleto the peoples of Kiribati  Nauru and Tonga on thisauspicious occasion.It is gratifying to note that our Organization is notonly enlarging its ranks but is also making tangible effortsto restructure its activities in order to enhance its efficiencyand effectiveness. This is a movement in the right direction.Further promotion of reforms is in the interests of the entireinternational community  especially the small and medium-sized States. Mongolia consistently supports United Nationsreforms aimed at further strengthening the Organization’srole in ensuring international peace and security andpromoting disarmament  development  social progress andthe peaceful settlement of conflicts in various parts of theworld.Increasing globalization and interdependence make itimperative that the international community should redoubleits cooperative efforts to meet existing and futurechallenges and ensure a more secure environment for allnations. Globalization and interdependence also demonstratethe growing importance of multilateralism in world affairsand thus the need to further strengthen and invigorate theUnited Nations and other international institutions. As aresult of its reforms  the United Nations should becomemore viable and effective  addressing the world’s problemsequitably.The 1999 report of the Secretary-General on the workof the Organization (A/54/1) gives  in our view  a clear andanalytical review of United Nations activities  itsachievements and setbacks  and the challenges that lieahead; it contains specific proposals on further measures toimprove the Organization’s performance the better to servethe interests of its Member States. The MongolianGovernment is supportive of the idea advanced by theSecretary-General in paragraph 61 of his report concerningthe need to shift from a culture of reaction  to a culture ofprevention. It is in this spirit that Mongolia will nextweek sign a memorandum of understanding with theUnited Nations on standby agreements whereby it wouldpledge to participate in future United Nations operationsby contributing staff officers  military observers andmedical officers.Mongolia is consistently pursuing its all-embracingdemocratic reforms and its transition to a marketeconomy. Neither is easy. However  the Government andthe people of Mongolia are strongly committed to thechoice they made 10 years ago. From this rostrum  Iwould like to reaffirm that the democratic process inMongolia is irreversible and that Mongolia’s foreignpolicy will remain constant. My Government greatlyappreciates the support and assistance given Mongolia bythe international community of donor countries andinternational organizations. That support and assistancecontinue to be an important factor in our reform anddevelopment efforts.The major thrust of Mongolia’s development strategyis to accelerate economic growth by further advancingmacroeconomic stabilization and development of aprivate-sector-led economy. Mongolia is giving highpriority to creating an economic system that is flexible open  allows a free flow of foreign capital  ensures acompetitive environment and is underpinned by stablegovernment policies and a reinvigorated  modern financialsector that encourages economic growth. In pursuing thispolicy  my Government pays particular attention to thesocial dimensions of economic reforms  namely povertyalleviation  unemployment reduction and protection forthe vulnerable strata of the country’s population.Mongolia’s foreign policy activities aim to create afavourable external environment for implementing thisdevelopment strategy. At the same time  my country isstriving to make its contribution to strengtheninginternational peace and stability generally as well aspromoting dialogue and cooperation in the Asia-Pacificregion. Active participation in regional affairs —integration into regional processes coupled withconsolidation of our bilateral ties with the countries of theregion — is one of Mongolia’s foreign policy priorities.I am pleased to say that this year has been especiallyfruitful in this respect.International developments highlight once again thefragility of peace and stability in certain areas of theworld and the need for concerted actions and for the6increased cooperation of States to prevent the outbreak ofnew conflicts  seek viable solutions to the existing disputesand promote further mutual understanding and trust amongnations.While noting some positive developments ininternational relations  Mongolia is seriously concerned withthe lingering zones of tension  ethnic strife and armedconflict in Africa  Asia and Europe. It calls on the partiesinvolved to display restraint and seek peaceful solutionsthrough political dialogue and negotiations. In this contextMongolia welcomes the resumption of the peace process inthe Middle East  which in our view should lead to acomprehensive  just and lasting peace in the region incompliance with the relevant Security Council resolutionsand the principle of land for peace.Mongolia also duly appreciates the steps taken by theSecurity Council to address the emergency situation in EastTimor and welcomes the cooperative approach of theGovernment of Indonesia regarding the establishment of amultinational force to halt and reverse the escalation of thehuman catastrophe there. The people of East Timor haveoverwhelmingly expressed themselves in favour ofindependence.My delegation stresses the importance of continuingthe intra-Korean dialogue and the four-party talks for peaceand stability on the Korean peninsula and in the Asia-Pacific region in general.We are concerned about the tension in South Asia andadd our voice to that of the international community  whichis calling on India and Pakistan to proceed to politicaldialogue and search for a peaceful solution to their dispute.Peace and stability are essential prerequisites forpromoting economic development and social progress. Thatis why arms control and disarmament  particularly nucleardisarmament  remain at the top of the global agenda.Efforts to achieve further substantive progress in armscontrol and disarmament should be intensified. Agreementsshould be honoured and implemented. Nuclear tests  missiletechnology developments  concerns over the anti-ballisticmissile treaty — all point to the urgent need forinvigorating our activities in this field. International armscontrol efforts need to be comprehensive and include allaspects of arms and military technology. Strengthening ofthe nuclear non-proliferation regime stands out as one ofthe top priorities  due not only to the devastating nature ofnuclear weapons and the enormous existing arsenal of them but also to the negative effect they have on thedisarmament process in general.Mongolia fully supports adopting multilateral normsrestraining the development and possession of medium-range missiles and preventing their proliferation. Webelieve that progress on the START track will be helpfulin advancing disarmament negotiations in all areas.Nuclear disarmament also calls for speedy agreement onbanning fissile materials for nuclear-weapons purposes.Mongolia continues to attach great importance toestablishing effective international arrangements to assurenon-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of useof nuclear weapons.My delegation welcomes the outcome of the 1999sessions of the Disarmament Commission and of thePreparatory Committee for the year 2000 ReviewConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Mongolia attachesgreat importance to the role of the Review Conference instrengthening the international regime of nuclear non-proliferation. It also favours the earliest possibleconvening of the fourth special session of the GeneralAssembly devoted to disarmament.Three years have elapsed since the adoption by theGeneral Assembly of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  which was a landmark event in the field ofnuclear disarmament. Regrettably  this importantinternational instrument has not yet come into force.Mongolia wishes to reiterate its call on those States thathave not done so to sign and ratify the Treaty as soon aspossible and thus contribute to the expeditious realizationof its noble objectives. We sincerely hope that theforthcoming conference of the States that have ratifiedthis Treaty will be conducive to taking the necessarymeasures to this end.It is our belief that all States  irrespective of theirsize and weight  can facilitate the attaining of the overallgoal of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament. Thatis why we believe that the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones in different parts of the world shouldbe encouraged and supported. For its part  Mongolia ismaking efforts in this respect by declaring its territory anuclear-weapon-free zone and taking the subsequent stepsnecessary to institutionalize its nuclear-weapon-free status.Last year the General Assembly adopted byconsensus resolution 53/77 D on Mongolia’s internationalsecurity and nuclear-weapon-free status. This was a7significant and encouraging event for Mongolia  testifyingto the existence of broad international support for ourobjectives and efforts. The adoption of the resolutionconstitutes an important contribution not only to Mongolia’ssecurity  but also — given Mongolia’s strategic location —to regional security. Implementation of the main provisionsof the resolution — in cooperation with other Membercountries  including the five nuclear-weapon States  and theUnited Nations — is one of the major objectives of ourforeign policy. The Mongolian Government has recentlycirculated a memorandum on this issue as an official UnitedNations document  in which it pointed out  inter alia  thatthe Mongolian parliament is considering the adoption oflegislation defining its nuclear-weapon-free status.Recently Mongolia hosted a United Nations regionaldisarmament meeting  one of the agenda items of whichwas the issue of Mongolia’s international security andnuclear-weapon-free status. The meeting proved to beuseful in clarifying the pressing security issues  and itprovided an opportunity for the first in-depth analysis anddiscussion of Mongolia’s nuclear-weapon-free status in thelight of its external security. We believe that identifyingand defining Mongolia’s nuclear-weapon-free status willcontribute to enhancing predictability  stability andconfidence in north-east Asia.My Government fully shares the aspirations to bananti-personnel landmines and welcomes the entry into forceof the Ottawa Convention. The illicit trafficking in smallarms and light weapons is a matter of growing concern forthe international community. Therefore Mongolia supportsthe convening of an international conference to considerthis issue in 2001.Considering that only comprehensive arms-control anddisarmament measures will be effective in ensuringinternational security  we  like many others  stand forprompt agreement on a new comprehensive and non-selective agenda for disarmament that will address therelevant issues in a balanced manner  taking into account among other things  the need to prevent the developmentand use of new weapons as well as to demilitarize theglobal economy by reducing military budgets and shiftingresources towards human-security programmes.Development issues continue to be the focus ofattention of national Governments and internationalorganizations and undoubtedly will be a major challenge inthe forthcoming century. Globalization affects all States though differently and unevenly. Many developingcountries  particularly the least developed  not only fail toenjoy the benefits of globalization  but are being furthermarginalized. Therefore  the adverse effects ofglobalization should be addressed seriously and theUnited Nations should be more actively involved in theissue.The Asian economic and financial crisis has hadsignificant socio-economic and security implications forthe countries of the region. Though the situation issomehow stabilizing and the countries directly hit by thecrisis are showing some signs of recovery  theinternational community should draw the necessarylessons from this crisis and consider ways and means ofpreventing such crises in the future.While appreciating the work done by the UnitedNations in the social and economic fields  my delegationwould like to underline the importance of taking furthereffective measures to ensure the best utilization of theexisting capacities and comparative advantages of theOrganization. Therefore  it seems appropriate to stress thenecessity of closer interaction and cooperation betweenthe United Nations  the Bretton Woods institutions  theWorld Trade Organization (WTO) and other relevantinternational organizations.The financing of development represents a verysensitive and pressing issue that requires special attentionon the part of the international community. Mongoliabelieves that the high-level intergovernmental meeting onfinancing for development to be held in 2001 will betimely in exploring the various options of promotingfinancial stability and development. In this respect relieving the debt burden of the highly indebteddeveloping countries would be a form of contribution totheir development efforts. We also attach greatimportance to the South-South summit and the tenthsession of the United Nations Conference on Trade andDevelopment (UNCTAD X)  to be held next year.Mongolia supports the universality of the WorldTrade Organization. The new round of multilateral tradenegotiations should facilitate the integration of thedeveloping countries into the world economy. Theexpansion of international cooperation for developmentshould place particular emphasis on assisting the mostvulnerable countries  which find themselves more andmore marginalized and insecure. Unfavourablegeographical location serves as a major impediment to thedevelopment efforts of landlocked developing countries.The problems of this group of States demand theincreased attention and support of the international8community. The steps that could ease the hardships of thesecountries were recently examined in New York at thefourth Meeting of Governmental Experts from Landlockedand Transit Developing Countries and Representatives ofDonor Countries and Financial and DevelopmentInstitutions. Its outcome should be endorsed by the GeneralAssembly.In North-East Asia  efforts are under way to concludea subregional agreement on transit transportation as afollow-up to the decisions of the 1997 Ulan Bator meetingon transit transportation. The conclusion of this agreementwill create a legal framework for facilitating transit tradenot only within the subregion  but well beyond it.Sustainable development  environmental degradation illicit drug trafficking  HIV/AIDS  organized crime andother transboundary problems should be adequatelyaddressed at the national  regional and global levels. The“+5” review special sessions of the General Assembly heldor scheduled to be held as follow-ups to the United Nationssummit conferences are important not only for assessing thework done  but also for giving a fresh impetus to theimplementation of their objectives at all levels.At the national level  Mongolia  in close partnershipwith the United Nations organizations and the non-governmental organizations  successfully organized theOne-World Conference Series in 1998-1999. The aim of thesix national conferences was to raise awareness at thegrass-roots level of the commitments made at the globalconferences and to ensure their integrated and coordinatedfollow-up.Mongolia is committed to the promotion andprotection of human rights and supports the strengtheningof the existing international instruments in this field. Webelieve that the approval at this session of the draft optionalprotocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Formsof Discrimination against Women would mark an importantcontribution to the protection and promotion of humanrights and the dignity of women the world over.Continued gross violations of human rights make itimperative to speed up the establishment of theInternational Criminal Court. Mongolia highly appreciatesand fully supports the efforts of the internationalcommunity in this respect. Likewise  Mongolia joins otherStates in condemning terrorist acts that are taking the livesof an increasing number of innocent people in various partsof the world and supports every effort of Member Statesand of the international community as a whole to fight allforms of terrorism and strengthen the relevantinternational instruments.This year  the United Nations Decade ofInternational Law is drawing to a close. The decade hasbeen instrumental in drawing the internationalcommunity's attention to the need for the codification andprogressive development of international law. Today international law is regulating many aspects ofinternational relations. I agree with the Secretary-Generalthat one of the greatest accomplishments of the twentiethcentury is the creation of an international code of humanrights  to which the outgoing Decade has dulycontributed. One of the practical results of the Decadewas the adoption last year  on Mongolia's initiative  bythe General Assembly of a set of principles andguidelines for international negotiations that could beuseful in conducting negotiations to manage internationalrelations  to peacefully settle disputes and to create newinternational norms of conduct for States.Fully conscious of the challenges that lie ahead mankind still looks forward to the twenty-first centurywith great expectations and hope. I believe it is theearnest hope and keen desire of all the peoples of theworld that the next century be far better in all respects more progressive and prosperous  than the outgoing one.Where there is a will  there will surely be a way toachieve it. It is up to Member States to make the dreama reality. As the Secretary-General has underlined in hisreport  we can do it."
"116",4816,"MOZ",54,1999,"On behalf of my Governmentand on my own behalf  I wish to join previous speakers incongratulating you  Sir  most sincerely on your election asPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourthsession. Your election to this high office is a matter ofhonour to all Africans and to the United Nations family  foryou represent a nation whose plight remained on the agendaof this Organization for many years. The attainment of theindependence of Namibia  the last stronghold of colonialismin the African continent  and the subsequent political economic and social developments that have occurred in thelast few years  have indeed paved the way for theconsolidation of the process of political integration ofsouthern Africa. We wish you well in your newresponsibilities  and are confident that this body will bewell served in the months ahead. We shall cooperate withyou in every way we can.A well-deserved tribute is also due to yourpredecessor  His Excellency Mr. Didier Opertti ofUruguay  for the exemplary manner in which hespearheaded the proceedings of the Organization duringthe last session.I would also like to express my high regard to theSecretary-General for his continued commitment tointernational peace and security and for his leadership indealing with an ever-increasing array of challengesworldwide. I wish to encourage him to continue on thispositive path.My Government welcomes the recent admission tothe membership of the United Nations of the Republic ofKiribati  the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom ofTonga. We are certain that the new Members will furtherenhance the universal nature of our Organization.I have come to the General Assembly first as amessenger of a people — the Mozambican people — whohave embarked on a long process of political  economicand social stabilization  following years of instability. Theprocess of consolidating Mozambique’s young  multipartydemocracy is making steady progress. Step by step  ourcountry is returning to normalcy  though we are consciousof the hurdles still ahead.We are currently preparing for the second multipartypresidential and parliamentary elections  to be held on 3and 4 December 1999. Periodic genuine elections constitutean important political exercise  which my Government andI are committed to pursuing vigorously with a view toensuring lasting peace and stability in Mozambique.In the past five years of pluralistic democracy we haveregistered important advances in the consolidation ofnation-building through collective efforts involving alllayers of society. Taking advantage of its diversity andvitality  our Parliament has held fruitful discussion  whichresulted in the adoption of new laws that are contributingpositively to the revitalization of political  economic andsocial institutions as well as to the consolidation of peaceand democracy.More important  this forum has contributed to thecreation among parliamentarians of a new vision andunderstanding of the facts about our country and a vision ofa united nation pursuing peace  progress and prosperity forall Mozambicans  thus consolidating national reconciliation.The period under review has equally witnessed significanteconomic and social progress. We are proud that this hasbeen highlighted and commended by well-advised outsideobservers and by many of the most respected organizationsand institutions as a good example of commitment toimplement economic reforms.The Mozambican economy has grown at encouragingrates  resulting in the allocation of an increased share of thenational budget to the social sectors. The whole network ofschools and health facilities destroyed during the years ofdestabilization has been rebuilt  and most roads and bridgesare under rehabilitation.My Government has succeeded in creating a moreenabling environment for private investment by redefiningits role as facilitator. We have identified and establishedspecial incentive schemes in various areas with higherpotential for development. These incentives are aimed atbringing new investments to a number of areas in order todevelop internationally competitive economic zones  createemployment opportunities and promote sustainableeconomic growth. They are also intended to bring aboutbalanced development of the whole country  bearing inmind that some areas were neglected during colonial times.The streamlining of investment procedures  coupledwith political stability  has contributed to the attraction oflarge investments such as the Maputo DevelopmentCorridor project. The concept of development corridors isan initiative regarded as the cornerstone of the regionalintegration strategy involving the countries of theSouthern African Development Community (SADC).Other transfrontier and national programmes inpartnership with other countries of the region play amajor role in this process. These include strategic projectssuch as the $1.3-billion Mozal aluminium smelter plant tobe completed within one year and the projected $2-billionMaputo iron and steel plant; both are part of the MaputoDevelopment Corridor project. The construction ofanother $600-million iron and steel plant and theconstruction of a new port in Savane are envisaged aspart of the Beira Corridor. Gas projects in the southernand central regions of Mozambique  as well as sugarplants and tourism  are other undertakings of greatimportance being developed in Mozambique with theparticipation of other SADC countries.The ambitious plan for the development of integratedprogrammes and projects in the Zambezi river basin  anextensive and potentially rich part of Mozambique include the construction of a big hydroelectric dam atM’panda M’kua. The Zambezi valley covers more than200 000 square kilometres  nearly one third of ournational territory  and is endowed with a variety ofresources of strategic importance  which we intend todevelop in order to bring about sustainable developmentfor our country and for the SADC region. The CaboraBassa dam is already supplying electricity to Zimbabweand to South Africa.Mozambique will thus be in a position to use itsgeostrategic location to make a greater contributiontowards the integrated development of the southernAfrican region; this is one of the building blocks ofcontinental integration.We believe that cooperative interaction involvingvarious segments of society  including the private sector is the key to the promotion of sustainable developmentthrough a smart partnership in which all stakeholders willbenefit.I come to this Assembly also as a messenger of thepeoples of southern Africa  a region striving to develop asa community of nations and peoples at peace with itselfand with others and working towards balanced andintegrated development. Last month  the people and theGovernment of Mozambique were honoured to host thenineteenth Summit of Heads of State or Government ofour community  the Southern African DevelopmentCommunity. The Maputo Summit was held on the theme2“SADC in the next millennium: working together for peace progress and prosperity”. It brought together heads of Stateor Government and other high-ranking representatives of allits 14 member States and  as guests  the heads of State ofNigeria  Uganda and Rwanda  the Secretary-General of theOrganization of African Unity (OAU)  the ExecutiveSecretary of the Economic Commission for Africa  as wellas other dignitaries representing a variety of other regionaland international organizations.In reviewing the progress made over the previous 12months  the Summit noted with satisfaction that theeconomies of the Community continued to grow at inaverage rate of 3 per cent  thanks to sound macroeconomicpolicies implemented by member States and to theharmonization and coordination of activities towardseconomic integration. However  in order to eradicatepoverty  the region needs to grow at an average rate of 6per cent per year. To achieve this objective we need tomobilize more regional resources as well as to consolidatean enabling environment to increase the share of foreigndirect investment. We have once again resolved to commitourselves to ensure that all of our countries and peoples canbenefit as they must from the globalization process. To thatend  efforts will continue to be made to consolidate peacethroughout the region  to harmonize sectoral policies and toimplement sound economic policies.During the Maputo Summit  the heads of State andGovernment signed three important documents: on wildlife on health and on productivity. They welcomed the recententry into force of the SADC Protocols on SharedWatercourse Systems  on Energy  on Transport Communications and Meteorology  and on Combating IllicitDrug Trafficking  and the charter of the Regional TourismOrganization of Southern Africa. The entry into force of theTrade Protocol on 1 January 2000 will bring additionalopportunities and challenges to our region  and will enhancethe programme initiated a few years ago with the entry intoforce of other protocols. All these legal instruments are indeed  important steps towards regional integration leadingto a better future.In southern Africa  HIV/AIDS is spreading at analarming rate. Governments in the SADC region  aware ofthe far-reaching negative consequences  are seekingcollective and individual strategies to counter the spread ofAIDS. In Lusaka  Zambia  we met at a regional level tolook into advisable approaches that can enhance awarenesswithin each country and to consider measures that can helpGovernments to mobilize financial and human resources toface this global threat. We have no choice: either we stopthe spread of AIDS or we risk putting the viability of oursocieties at stake  because in our region the most qualifiedpeople are the ones at high risk.This scenario foretells our future. Our economic social and political development will remain on thehorizon  and the structures of our societies will beseriously undermined  unless effective  concrete steps aretaken. In this context  my Government very recentlyadopted a national strategy against HIV/AIDS.The resolution on cooperation between SADC andthe United Nations to be adopted this year must reflectthe positive progress that has taken place within SADC and stress the importance of greater interaction with theUnited Nations in all fields of common interest. At thesame time  our Community — which is built ondemocratic principles  equitable and sustainabledevelopment  improved living standards of citizens  freemovement of factors of production  goods and services —remains equally committed to strengthening itsrelationship with other regional organizations.The search for a durable peace is still a constantobjective of the region. It is for this reason that wewelcome the progress made in the settlement of theconflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Thesigning of the agreement by all parties opens a new erafor the region and beyond. What is required now is forthe international community  particularly the UnitedNations  to meet its responsibilities by sending  asexpeditiously as possible  peacekeeping forces with anappropriate mandate and adequate resources  underChapter VII of the Charter  for the achievement of lastingpeace and stability in the Democratic Republic of theCongo.We hope that the progress to which I have referredto above will make a positive impact on the Angolanconflict. The people of Angola must be given theopportunity to live in peace and harmony. Theinternational community has a moral and politicalobligation to assist the Angolans to reverse thehumanitarian tragedy which is unfolding in vast areas oftheir territory. At the same time  the internationalcommunity  while supporting the Government of Angolain restoring peace and stability in that country  must callon Mr. Savimbi to abandon his aggressive andirresponsible action. In particular  the Security Councilsanctions imposed on UNITA must be fully observed  inorder to prevent further suffering in that SADC country.In this context  we salute the positive work already done3by Ambassador Robert Fowler  Chairman of the SecurityCouncil sanctions committee  and we encourage him tocontinue with his work.This is our vision of the future of Mozambique as anindividual country and also that of SADC as a whole.The recurrence of conflicts in Africa has exacerbatedthe plight of children as the main victims. The recentOrganization of African Unity (OAU) summit  held inAlgiers  echoing the recommendations of the AfricanConference on the Use of Children as Soldiers  held inMaputo in April this year  adopted a resolution calling inter alia  for the elaboration of an international conventionoutlawing the use of children under 18 years of age inarmed conflicts. We urge all members of the UnitedNations to adhere to and support this initiative  which  inour view  must be associated with all other rights of thechild.We believe that the implementation of that OAUresolution  together with the concept of “children as zoneof peace” would constitute a valuable contribution to theprotection of children. In this regard  I commend the UnitedNations Children’s Fund (UNICEF)  the SpecialRepresentative of the Secretary General on Children andArmed Conflict and non-governmental organizations fortheir relentless efforts to promote and ensure respect for therights of the child.Moreover  the proliferation of small arms and lightweapons  together with transnational crimes such as moneylaundering and drug trafficking  constitute major sources ofinstability for many countries  including my own. We insouthern Africa are undertaking a coordinated action witha view to addressing these challenges and bringing aboutpeace and stability.In May this year Maputo hosted the First Meeting ofStates parties to the Convention on the Prohibition of theUse  Stockpiling  Production and Transfer of Anti-personnelMines and on their Destruction. The Maputo Meeting washeld when thousands of innocent civilians were beingmaimed in many parts of the world  including my owncountry. The Meeting adopted a Declaration calling upon usto rededicate ourselves in the struggle against theseinsidious weapons  in fulfilment of our obligations underthe Ottawa Convention. More important  the MaputoMeeting offered a unique opportunity to remind theinternational community of the need to meet the targets setby the Convention. In four years we must destroy allanti-personnel mines in warehouses  and in ten years wemust complete the demining process in affected countries.As we concluded in Maputo  these targets arenon-negotiable. What is negotiable is the ways and meansfor the attainment of these objectives. We therefore callupon all States and organizations in a position to do so toensure that these goals are met. Failure to reach thesegoals would undermine the credibility of the internationalcommunity and  above all  the universalization of theConvention. It is our earnest hope that the GeneralAssembly will give additional impetus to the momentumcreated by the adoption of the Maputo Declaration.We in southern Africa are disturbed about the lowlevels of foreign direct investment in Africa. We aredeeply concerned about recent evidence presented by theUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP)showing a drastic reduction in official developmentassistance  in particular for Africa. More worrisome is thefact that the target of 0.7 per cent in official developmentassistance has never been entirely met  and  on thecontrary  it has reached only one third of the establishedtarget.Lack of adequate funding has contributed to poorrealization of the goals set by major internationalconferences  including those contained in the CairoProgramme of Action  which was reviewed during therecently held twenty-first special session of the GeneralAssembly on population and development.Without political will there will be no sustainabledevelopment in the global economy  and the risk of thefurther marginalization of developing countries  with allof its negative consequences  will remain high.In addition  the issue of external indebtednesscontinues to be the single most important obstacle to thedevelopment of many countries  particularly in Africa.Efforts must be made to ensure that the Heavily IndebtedPoor Countries Debt Initiative is accessible to thecountries in need.As I speak on this issue  I must once again thank theinternational community for the assistance rendered toMozambique under this Initiative  as of last June. The factof the matter  however  is that our debt burden continuesto undermine our efforts to achieve sustainabledevelopment. We believe it is high time for theinternational community to start writing off the externaldebt of those countries that have made visible and4sustainable progress in the implementation of toughstructural adjustment measures and political reforms. Sucha course of action would undoubtedly provide moreincentives for other countries to undertake these measuresand to redirect resources to the social sectors  in particularfor the provision of water and better education and to fightthe HIV/AIDS pandemic.My Government wishes to commend the 5 MayAgreement signed by the Governments of Indonesia Portugal and United Nations which culminated in theholding of a referendum in East Timor. We salute thepeople of East Timor for the exemplary and orderly mannerin which they participated in the referendum and for theclear and unequivocal way in which they decided forindependence. We are deeply saddened and gravelyconcerned over the tragic developments that have followedthe announcement of the results of the referendum. We areparticularly distressed over the fact that massacres againstinnocent civilians and indiscriminate destruction of propertyhave occurred  largely due to the failure by Indonesia tosecure order and by the international community to actexpeditiously.The fact that the East Timor tragedy occurred whensimilar situations had been prevented not long ago leads usto believe in the existence of passivity and selectivity indealing with issues that undermine international peace andsecurity. We nevertheless commend the decision taken bythe Security Council to send a mission to Jakarta and Diliand the subsequent actions taken with the cooperation ofthe Government of Indonesia.Along with restoring peace and stability  efforts mustbe made to provide a speedy humanitarian response toassist the people who were displaced or became refugees asa result of the unprecedented levels of violence we havewitnessed in that territory. The tragedy in East Timorunderlines the importance of translating into deeds therelevant recommendations contained in the “Report of theSecretary-General to the Security Council on the protectionof civilians in armed conflict”.Mozambique has given its modest contribution to theUnited Nations Mission in East Timor and stands ready tocontinue to play a role in future efforts of the internationalcommunity.On behalf of my Government and on my own behalf I wish to seize this opportunity to convey our deepestsympathy to those who have lost their loved ones. It is ourhope that their suffering will not be in vain  and that theUnited Nations and all parties will ensure the earlyimplementation of the results of the referendum.The issue of East Timor reminds us of other peoplewho are striving for self-determination. We areencouraged by the latest positive developments that havetaken place in the Middle East. They confirm that  withthe necessary political will  taking into account theinterests of all parties to the conflict  peace is possible inthat region. Our task is to help the Palestinians and theIsraelis take maximum advantage of the momentum thathas been created as a result of the signing of the Sharmel-Sheik Memorandum  on 4 September 1999  followingthe deadlock in the implementation of the Wye RiverMemorandum of 23 October 1998. Success in theimplementation of the current Memorandum depends onstrict observance of the principle of land for peace.Recent incidents along the common border betweenIndia and Pakistan are a source of great concern to allpeace-loving countries. We call upon both Governmentsto exercise maximum restraint and to refrain from takingactions that might jeopardize further the already volatilesituation along their common border.It is our earnest hope that the United Nationsintervention in Kosovo will bring lasting peace andstability to that territory and the region. To this endMozambique is contributing with a small team of policeofficers.We equally hope that now that the Lockerbie issueis in the hands of justice  the Security Council willhonour its undertakings by lifting the sanctions on Libya.Both the final settlement of this issue and the holding ofa referendum in Western Sahara will have a positiveimpact on the development of Africa.We are at the threshold of the next century  and thechallenges ahead are enormous. They require strongercommitment and greater international cooperation. In thisconnection  we wish to commend the Secretary-Generalfor organizing the Millennium Assembly and themillennium summit for the year 2000. Indeed  there couldbe no better way to inaugurate the new era than byassembling all world leaders to reflect on the strategiesand policies that will govern our planet in the nextmillennium. Whatever themes we choose to debate  theyshould include the promotion of a culture of peace withinnations  regions and throughout the world  for this willallow the realization of all other objectives  in particularthe eradication of poverty  promotion of development 5protection of human rights and meeting the challenges ofglobalization.It is therefore our hope that the forthcoming historicgatherings will signal the beginning of the crystallization ofthe process of building a better and safer world byproducing meaningful strategies  actions and policies thatwill guide the United Nations of tomorrow. We agree thatthese high-level events should not result merely in theadoption of declarations that cannot be translated intoconcrete actions for both the United Nations andGovernments.We should therefore aim at pragmatic  action-orientedand implementable decisions. Then  and only then  shall wemeet the aspirations of the founding fathers of our universalOrganization."
"117",4861,"MRT",54,1999,"At the outset  I wish  on behalf of the IslamicRepublic of Mauritania  to congratulate His ExcellencyMr. Theo-Ben Gurirab on his election to the presidencyof the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session. I amconvinced that his experience and his wisdom will enablehim to guide the work of the session to a successfulconclusion. My delegation assures him of its completecooperation in that noble task.I take this opportunity also to express my thanks tohis predecessor  Mr. Didier Opertti  for the distinguishedmanner in which he has conducted the session justconcluded.I would also like to pay a well-deserved tribute tothe Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. KofiAnnan  for his tireless efforts in reforming andrestructuring the Organization  and in improving itsfunctioning and strengthening its role in all areas so thatit can adapt to the requirements and challenges of theday. In this regard  we welcome the valuable report onthe work of the Organization that he presented at thebeginning of these proceedings.Mauritania welcomes the Republic of Kiribati  theRepublic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga to themembership of our Organization. We would like toexpress our readiness to work with them to achieve theobjectives of the United Nations.We have to undertake immediately the reform of theUnited Nations and the restructuring of its organs in orderto serve the world’s common interests. No one can denythat the circumstances in which the Organization wasfounded more than 50 years ago have changed a greatdeal  and that important new changes have occurred in allareas since then. This only makes a re-examination of thestructures and working methods of the Organization moreimperative. It is in this spirit that my delegation supportsthe expansion of representation in the Security Council inaccordance with the principles of democracy  transparencyand equity in order to ensure equitable geographicalrepresentation in that body  and to reflect the universalnature of our Organization  as laid down in the Charter.18As we meet at the threshold of the third millennium a large portion of humanity still lives in conditions that donot enable people to satisfy their legitimate hopes andaspirations to live in a world where peace  justice and well-being reign. In spite of some encouraging indicators incertain developing countries  the general tendency is that ofa widening gap between developed and developingcountries. The latter are going through profound changesover which they have no control  affected by  among otherthings  their debt burden  deterioration of commodity prices poor access to international markets and weakness offoreign investment. This situation should alert theOrganization of the need not to limit its actions to thetraditional maintenance of international peace and security.The situation calls for the Organization to strive to lightenthe heavy burden under which the developing countrieslanguish in the economic and social fields. The UnitedNations must also help these countries step up the pace oftheir economic growth. In this regard  donor countriesshould increase their official development assistance increase their foreign investment and open up their marketsto the products of developing countries in order to helpbring about a new world order based on dialogue cooperation and solidarity.In this context  and since debt constitutes a burden thatthe developing countries are incapable of bearing  it isimperative to give the question of debt the attention itdeserves. We express the hope that initiatives taken to helpthe most heavily indebted poor countries will make itpossible to eliminate the obstacles that are neutralizing andfrustrating their development efforts.Today the world faces many troublesome situations the consequences of which are felt beyond the frontiers ofthe countries immediately involved. Such situations threatensecurity  nationally  regionally and internationally  and callinto question the progress achieved towards economic andsocial development. We are required to find propersolutions for such problems. By way of example  I wouldmention terrorism  human rights violations and poverty.In this regard  my country reiterates its condemnationof terrorism  whatever its origin and form. It calls on theinternational community to strengthen cooperation anddialogue in order to combat this phenomenon withdetermination and firmness.Last year the General Assembly commemorated thefiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of HumanRights  which coincided with the fifth anniversary of theWorld Conference on Human Rights in Vienna. That wasan opportunity to evaluate the results of theimplementation of the Vienna Declaration and Programmeof Action and the remaining obstacles in this area  and toidentify necessary measures for the full implementation ofthe recommendations that the World Conference onHuman Rights had adopted and that my country isstriving to translate into reality.We should also mention the special session onpopulation and development held by the GeneralAssembly in this very Hall at the end of last June atwhich the Programme of Action of the Cairo InternationalConference on Population and Development wasreaffirmed. We hope that the results of that meeting willhelp improve the standard of living of all peoples and willhelp bring about sustainable development thanks to thestrengthening of the correlation between questions ofpopulation and those of development. In this area  Iwould like to point out that my country has stepped up itsefforts to promote the status of women and to combatilliteracy in all its forms  and it has produced programmeswith beneficial effects for the family  for children inparticular and for society in general.The Islamic Republic of Mauritania has adopted aforeign policy based on immutable principles ofpromoting good-neighbourly relations  peacefulcoexistence and the enhancement of regional andinternational cooperation. On the basis of these principles my country attaches particular importance tostrengthening stability and to containing the numeroussources of tension throughout the world  which are likelyto jeopardize international peace and security andcompromise the development efforts of nations.While reaffirming its whole-hearted support for thepeace process  my country believes that no just comprehensive and lasting peace can be brought about inthe Middle East without the application of the principle ofland for peace as agreed at the Madrid Conference  andthe comprehensive implementation of Security Councilresolutions 242 (1967)  338 (1973) and 425 (1978)  whichguarantee Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Palestinianterritories  as well as from the Syrian Golan Heights southern Lebanon and West Bekaa  and the restoration tothe Palestinian people of all their legitimate rights  firstand foremost their right to self-determination and to thecreation of their independent State with Jerusalem as itscapital.Today  as we embark on a new era  the internationalcommunity is looking forward to reviving the peace19process and to restoring it to its proper track. In this regard we believe that a resumption of negotiations on all tracksbetween all parties concerned is a most urgent measure. Wetherefore invite the two sponsors of the peace process toshoulder their responsibilities and to exert greater efforts topreserve the opportunity of a comprehensive  just andlasting peace in this region.In the Gulf region  we hope to see a combination ofregional and international efforts that would restore stabilityand concord to the region. In this regard  my countryreaffirms its commitment to and respect for internationallegality and the resolutions of the United Nations  andrepeats its rejection of anything that may be prejudicial tothe independence and the territorial integrity of Kuwait.We also reaffirm our repudiation of any measurelikely to threaten the unity and territorial integrity of Iraq.We call for lifting the embargo that for eight years now hasbeen inflicted on the Iraqi people  who have sufferedenormously  especially children  women and the elderly.In the Maghreb region  my country is workingtogether with its brothers in the Arab Maghreb Union toestablish cooperation and dialogue in order to fulfil theaspirations of the peoples of the region.As regards the Western Sahara  my country welcomesthe positive steps taken towards the implementation of theUnited Nations plan to resolve the dispute. We reaffirm ourreadiness to do everything in our power to promote theimplementation of this plan.With regard to the Lockerbie incident  my countrywelcomes the efforts undertaken to achieve a finalsettlement of this question  including the suspension of thesanctions imposed against the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya.Although we are pleased by the success of certaindiplomatic démarches  we nevertheless feel that it is timefor the Security Council to take the necessary steps to liftthis embargo once and for all.As regards Guinea-Bissau  my country welcomes thesettlement that was achieved within the framework of theAbuja and Lomé Agreements  and we support thetransitional Government. In particular  we support theimplementation of commitments entered into at the Genevaround table and aimed at organizing pluralistic elections andat the reconstruction of the country.Furthermore  while expressing our profound concernabout the persistence of conflict in Somalia  we hope thatour Somali brothers will engage in constructive dialogueand in a spirit of responsibility and patriotism so that apeaceful settlement can be reached and Somalia will againbe united and will regain its national sovereignty in anatmosphere of stability and concord.My country also welcomes the Peace Agreementreached between the legitimate Government of SierraLeone and the Revolutionary United Front  and ferventlycalls for stability and reconciliation in that country  whichsuffered tremendously during eight years of devastatingwar.My country also notes with satisfaction the gradualreturn of peace to the Republic of the Congo and urgesour Congolese brothers to continue their negotiations with a view to bringing about a peaceful settlement oftheir dispute so that that fraternal country can once againlive in peace and harmony.As regards the Democratic Republic of the Congo we welcome the diplomatic efforts of the fraternalcountries of the region  in particular South Africa andZambia  as well as the important role played by the leaderof the Libyan revolution  Colonel Muammar Al-Qadhafi in containing the crisis. In this regard  we welcome thesigning of the Lusaka Agreement.As to Angola  my country expresses its profoundregret at the resumption of fighting between theGovernment forces and the UNITA movement. In thisregard  we reaffirm our wholehearted support for SecurityCouncil resolutions 864 (1993)  1127 (1997) and 1173(1998) and urge UNITA to respect the obligations itentered into under the Lusaka Protocol to restore peaceand security.On the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea  weurge the two parties to respect the ceasefire and to try tofind a peaceful settlement  on the basis of the plan of theOrganization of African Unity. In this context  we placegreat hope in the good-offices mission of Mr. AbdelazizBouteflika  current Chairman of the OAU  to bring abouta peaceful and equitable settlement of the conflict.On Kosovo  my country notes with satisfaction theprogress achieved in putting an end to the violence restoring confidence and reconstructing what wasdestroyed over the long period of war.The United Nations was created in order to achieveobjectives shared by all humanity: the maintenance of20peace  security and stability throughout the world. The letterand the spirit of the Charter of our Organization provide fora just balance between the rights and obligations of all andaim at achieving these common interests of the internationalcommunity. Therefore  today  as we are about to enter thethird millennium  we are duty-bound to devote our effortsto honouring the commitments laid down in the Charter andto work together to build a new world order based onjustice and directed towards preserving international peaceand security."
"118",4907,"MUS",54,1999,"It is a distinct pleasure toaddress the Assembly with a distinguished son of Africaand a veteran freedom fighter in the presidency. Hiselection to preside over this last session of the closingmillennium is a fitting tribute to his outstanding qualities.I congratulate him warmly and assure him of the totalsupport and cooperation of my delegation.We also thank His Excellency Mr. Opertti for theexcellent manner in which he presided over the work of thefifty-third session. The Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan whose strong commitment to the cause of the UnitedNations needs hardly be emphasized  has continued to leadthe Organization with vision  vigour and great dedication.Mauritius welcomes very warmly the admission of theKingdom of Tonga  the Republic of Kiribati and theRepublic of Nauru to the United Nations.The curtain will soon fall on our eventful twentiethcentury  a century of tremendous achievements by mankind.The wide world has been reduced to a global villagethrough progress in the field of science and technologyduring this century. The political map of the world hasundergone tremendous transformation. It is hardlyrecognizable from what it used to be at this century's outset.Today  our world is made of independent nations  withpeoples themselves in charge of their destinies. On theother hand  we did experience the horrors of wars in thefirst half of the century but decided never to let it happenagain. We created the United Nations in the aftermath ofthe Second World War as a forum for all nations to carryforward together a common pledge for lasting world peaceand promote development and progress for all humanity.During this century man has paradoxically alsocreated weapons of mass destruction that threaten his veryexistence. Disarmament  including nuclear disarmament remains a major preoccupation for all of us as we stepinto the new millennium. The United Nations representing the collective conscience of nations  hasendeavoured to serve humanity and the cause of peaceand development. The United Nations is the solemechanism through which universal peace can be secured.We unanimously agree also that reforms to the Charter ofthe United Nations are necessary — indeed  overdue —as in its present form it does not reflect the tremendouschanges the world has undergone since the Organizationwas founded half a century ago.It is now almost six years since the GeneralAssembly established the Open-ended Working Group onthe Question of Equitable Representation on and Increasein the Membership of the Security Council and OtherMatters Related to the Security Council. Progress hasbeen slow and has taken place on a limited set of issuesonly.What is lacking for the process to move forward ispolitical will on the part of some members. The fact isthat the Security Council in its present form is neitheradequately representative nor sufficiently transparent in itswork for its decisions to be universally accepted.Mauritius supports the proposals of the Non-AlignedMovement and of the Organization of African Unity(OAU) on the reform of the Security Council. We appealto all Members of the United Nations to work togetherconstructively and advance the much needed reformprocess expeditiously.While the international community has largely beensuccessful in averting global wars  armed conflicts havecontinued to endanger national  regional and internationalpeace. In particular  the African continent has continuedto be afflicted with conflicts  the worst being the crisis inthe Democratic Republic of Congo and the continued civilwar in Angola.However  the international community should takecomfort in the fact that the leaders on the Africancontinent have spared no efforts to find solutions andrestore peace in the countries and areas in question.Through tireless and extensive efforts of African leaders the OAU and the United Nations  and all the partiesconcerned in the conflict in the Democratic Republic ofCongo  have signed the Lusaka Agreement in order to8restore peace and stability in the country. One of thefundamental aspects of the Agreement is the deployment ofa United Nations peacekeeping force  with the task ofensuring that all parties respect the terms of the LusakaAgreement. We deplore the fact that the United Nationspeacekeeping force has still not assumed its crucialresponsibility in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Wecall upon the Security Council to give due priority to thismatter so that a peacekeeping force is dispatchedexpeditiously  as delay to do so may imperil theimplementation of the Agreement.The rebellion in Angola continues because of armssupplies from outside to the forces of destabilization. TheSecurity Council is fully apprised of this and confident thatthose guilty of breaking the embargo on arms supply toUNITA will be identified and held responsible. The peopleof Angola have indeed suffered too long. We thereforeappeal to all nations to take necessary steps to ensure thatunscrupulous elements do not channel weapons to theforces of rebellion in Angola out of their greed of monetarywindfalls. The international community needs to intensifyits efforts to end the rebellion in Angola.The armed conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea endedwith the signing recently of an agreement with the help ofthe OAU and several African leaders and friendly countries.We hope that the spirit in which the two countries haveagreed to end their differences will continue and that lastingpeace will return to the region. We are also heartened bythe fact that an agreement has been signed between theparties concerned to end the internal strife in Sierra Leone.We are confident that peace and stability will now return toSierra Leone.In the Comoros  forces of destabilization havecontinued to thwart the return to normalcy. Through tirelessefforts by the OAU and countries of the region  aconference of all the Comoros parties concerned was heldearlier this year in Madagascar with a view to reaching anagreement under which peace and stability would return tothe Comoros and territorial integrity and sovereignty wouldbe maintained. Unfortunately  the military coup derailed thewhole process. We therefore call for the establishment ofdemocratic rule in the Comoros so that the agreementreached at the Antananarivo conference can be fullyimplemented.The Kosovo conflict has distressed us all. We havewitnessed the horrors of ethnic cleansing  massivedisruption of the life of a people and terrible destructioninflicted on a country. We must all remember manymessages from the events in Kosovo. Humanity will notsit idly by when people are flagrantly subjected togenocide for reason of ethnic bigotry or politicalexpediency. Quick-fix military action to resolvedeep-rooted problems is not necessarily the best option.The United Nations remains the most appropriatemechanism for addressing issues that relate tomaintenance of international peace and security.Mauritius is deeply distressed by the violence in EastTimor  the loss of so many innocent lives and the terriblesufferings inflicted on the Timorese people in theaftermath of the recent referendum. We welcome theaction undertaken by the United Nations to send apeacekeeping force to restore peace and security on theisland. The verdict of the referendum must be respectedby the Indonesian Government and all parties concerned.In the Middle East  the determination shown by thenew Prime Minister of Israel  Mr. Ehud Barak  to movethe peace process forward  together with President Arafat is most encouraging not only to the parties concerned inthe region but also to the international community as awhole. This moment of great optimism must be seized inorder to work out a comprehensive and just settlementthat will bring lasting peace and stability to the region.In 1996 our delegation  led by the Prime Minister ofMauritius  The Honourable Navinchandra Ramgoolam drew special attention to the situation in Fiji. We arepleased that the new constitutional process under whichgeneral elections were recently held has removed theiniquities which were written into that nation'sConstitution before. We welcome this change andcongratulate the people of Fiji on their courage anddetermination to bring the change in a democratic andpeaceful manner.(spoke in French)Conflicts and wars  even after they have ended invariably leave serious humanitarian situations behindthem. The humanitarian crises in Africa seem of littleinterest to the cameras of international televisionnetworks. There are more than 12 million people whoneed urgent humanitarian assistance in Africa. Thehumanitarian agencies have received only $352 millionalthough their needs for Africa in 1999 are in the order of$796 million.Peacemaking efforts must be supported by effectivehumanitarian aid  especially for refugees. The host9countries  already faced with their own difficulties  cannottake on this heavy burden. To give lasting peace a realchance  it is also necessary to support the return of refugeesso as to make the stabilization of society possible. A specialfinancing effort on the part of the international communityis necessary to that end.(spoke in English)Respect for human rights is of primordial importancefor the prevention of conflicts and for the maintenance ofdurable peace. We believe that all countries should makestrict adherence to the human rights instruments of theUnited Nations a matter of national priority. We inMauritius always place human rights high on our nationaland international agenda. Mauritius was honoured to hostthe First OAU ministerial conference on human rights  heldearlier this year in the context of the celebration of thefiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of HumanRights. The conference reviewed the human rights situationin Africa and adopted a declaration and plan of actionwhich aim at strengthening the promotion and protection ofhuman rights.We have witnessed gross violations of human rights particularly under military regimes. In this regard  thedecision at the recent OAU summit in Algiers to excludefrom that organization those leaders who assume power inthe continent through military coups is an important stepthat will help the cause of democracy and human rights.Mauritius has welcomed the International CriminalCourt and was amongst the first to ratify the Statuteestablishing it. We look forward to an early conclusion ofthe work of our experts who are currently engaged infinalizing the rules to enable the International CriminalCourt to commence its work.The easy availability of light and small-calibreweapons has given rise to numerous conflicts  particularlyin Africa. These small arms  besides exacerbating conflicts give rise to social disruption  insecurity  instability  violenceand crime. In view of the magnitude of the problem  theOAU summit in Algiers last July decided to convene aregional conference to address the issue fully. We urge theinternational community to take measures to control theflow of small arms.Disarmament is essential for international peace. Itis regrettable that the threat of nuclear holocaust willaccompany humanity into the new millennium because ofthe international community's failure to work out a regimefor the total elimination of nuclear weapons. Under theTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons andthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty we havetaken important steps on the issue of nucleardisarmament  but these alone cannot eliminate the threatof nuclear weapons. Mauritius continues to be firmly ofthe belief that the best way for the internationalcommunity to address the nuclear disarmament issueeffectively is to establish a clear timetable for nuclear-weapon Powers to commit themselves to dismantle allnuclear weapons and for all nations to commit themselvesto not develop such weapons in the future. So far wehave adopted half-way measures only; it is time for abold step to be taken that would eliminate nuclearweapons once and for all.Chemical weapons  as weapons of mass destruction can inflict untold miseries on their victims. TheConvention on Chemical Weapons — a very significantachievement — must be adhered to by all nations particularly countries that have chemical weapons in theirpossession.The lives of many people around the world  inAfrica in particular  continue to be affected by landmines.We believe it is the responsibility of all nations to addressthis problem collectively. We appeal to those countriesthat have not yet acceded to the Ottawa Convention onanti-personnel mines to do so and also to contributefinancially to the efforts to remove all landmines.Peace  security and development are indivisible andmutually reinforcing. As we stand at the threshold of thetwenty-first century we have a historic opportunity tocreate a long-term visionary strategy for the sustainabledevelopment of all countries of the world  in particularAfrican States  and thus promote international peace andsecurity. This is extremely important if we really want toavoid the marginalization in the wake of the irreversibleprocess of globalization and unbridled liberalization. It isincreasingly being realized that market forces alonecannot resolve the problems of poverty  deprivation andmarginalization  particularly in Africa  which comprisesthe largest number of least-developed countries. TheUnited Nations system  in our view  has an important roleto play in this respect as there is a crying need forcoherence in the formulation and implementation ofpolicies in the trade  finance and social sectors.10It is true that globalization brings both challenges andopportunities  but to many developing countries thechallenges are proving overwhelming. But there does notseem to be any alternative  in a world characterized by the“pensée unique”  to making the necessary adjustments tojoin a fast globalizing world economy. Higher levels ofinvestment; technology transfer; and institutional  humanresource and infrastructure capacity-building  will berequired especially for African countries  if they are tomake the necessary transition.The developed world and the major financial andtrading organizations must be not only cognizant of thesituation but also responsive to the constraints on and needsof the developing world in general and the least-developedcountries and vulnerable small island developing States inparticular.The heavy debt burden  the declining level of officialdevelopment assistance — which currently stands at 0.22per cent of gross domestic product compared to the targetof 0.7 per cent — and insignificant private investmentflows into Africa do not allow many African countries toimplement successfully the necessary adjustmentprogrammes to compete effectively in the world market.Only decisive action to resolve the debt problem canprovide the necessary impetus.Although we recognize that the Cologne Summitinitiative represents an improvement over the originalHeavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt Initiative  webelieve that the unsustainable debt of Africa — whichcontains 33 of the 41 HIPC countries — should be writtenoff  for only then can those countries embark on the path ofsustainable growth and development.In that connection  we welcome the recentlyannounced plan to cancel $27 billion of debt owed by thepoorest countries to allow them to use those resources tofinance education and health  which are important indealing with the problem of poverty.We also commend the World Bank for establishing the$400 million Infrastructure Investment Fund  whoseadvisory board will be headed by Mr. Nelson Mandela former President of South Africa.Capacity-building in all sectors of the economy isimportant if developing countries are to benefit from theopportunities arising from globalization and tradeliberalization. But in view of the lack of a level playingfield and the inherent obstacles facing African  Caribbeanand Pacific countries  it is imperative for them to continueto benefit from trade preferences in the European Unionunder the successor to the fourth ACP-CEE Conventionof Lomé for a sufficiently long transitional period beforethey implement any alternative trade arrangement.The euphoria created following the signing of theMarrakesh agreement in 1994 after the conclusion of theUruguay Round has been short-lived; many developingcountries today recognize that they are overburdened withWorld Trade Organization (WTO) commitments andobligations. There is indeed a growing recognition thatimplementation of these commitments is simply beyondtheir capacity  or rather that there is a limit to tradeliberalization and deregulation.It is  therefore  important to allow developingcountries flexibility within the world trading system toimplement policies in harmony with their sustainabledevelopment needs. The provisions on special anddifferential treatment in all areas covered by WTOagreements should be fully and effectively implemented.In this regard  it is also crucial that the multilateraltrading system should facilitate the process of regionalintegration  because for many countries regionalintegration is an important step towards their integrationinto the global economy.We welcome and support the recent OAU decisionto accelerate implementation of the 1991 Abuja Treaty forthe establishment of an African Economic Community.This process could be facilitated by effectiveimplementation of the United States of America-AfricaBlueprint adopted in March 1999 and more importantly of the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act. We urge theUnited States to ensure early passage of this long-standingBill with its original provisions on textiles and clothing.Two days ago  I had the opportunity in my addressto the recent Assembly special session to highlight boththe inherent constraints on small island developingcountries and their development needs. The specialsession gave us an opportunity to review theimplementation of the Barbados Declaration andProgramme of Action for the sustainable development ofsmall island developing States (SIDS): we must take theprocess further to embrace other issues  such asconcessional loans and trade preferences for SIDS.I reiterate my appeal to the international communityto give special attention to the plight of SIDS  in termsboth of providing financial resources  and of encouragingforeign direct investment  and also in the context of thenegotiations for the third WTO Ministerial Conference  inSeattle. We must ensure that the Conference  which is to beheld later this year  addresses the marginalization of smalleconomies and the problems of developing countries thatare net importers of food by adopting specific and practicalmeasures. We must also see to it that the Seattle Round ofmultilateral trade negotiations is a “development round” thatputs the issue of development firmly on the internationalagenda. The WTO negotiations in Seattle should be broad-based and should provide a balanced outcome from whichall countries will benefit.In this connection  it should be emphasized thatagricultural trade is of vital importance to a number ofdeveloping countries  in particular to small economiesincluding small and vulnerable island developing States. Inthe agricultural trade negotiations we should give just asmuch importance to non-trade issues such as food security environmental protection and the viability of ruralpopulations.These are vital issues for Mauritius  and for manyother SIDS and small economics and small economies. Andthat is why we are emphasizing the multifunctionality ofagriculture. Planting sugar cane  which is the only cropsuitable to our difficult terrains  and which is resistant toadverse climatic conditions like cyclones and droughts  alsocontributes to environmental protection by providing arenewable source of energy. Sugar exports earnings assurefood security. Many small island developing countries arein the same situation as Mauritius. We would therefore urgethat this important dimension be fully taken into account inthe WTO negotiations on agriculture.Economic growth by itself does not bring aboutsustainable socio-economic development. Socialdevelopment should continue to be given due considerationby our Organization. We therefore welcome the follow-upconferences on social development and on women  whichwill be organized next year.For the majority of small States  the United Nationscontinues to be the main bulwark against infringements ontheir sovereignty and territorial integrity. We haveconsistently drawn the attention of the Assembly to theissue of the Chagos Archipelago  which was detached fromMauritius by the former colonial Power prior to ourindependence in 1968  and also to the plight of over 2000people who were forced to leave the land of their birth where they had lived for generations  for resettlement inMauritius. This was done in total disregard of the UnitedNations declaration embodied in resolution 1514 (XV)  of14 December 1960  and resolution 2066 (XX)  of 16December 1965  which prohibit the dismemberment ofcolonial Territories prior to independence.Mauritius has repeatedly asked for the return of theChagos Archipelago  including Diego Garcia  on which aUnited States military base has been built  and thereby therestoration of its territorial integrity. The over 2 000displaced Ilois people have been facing tremendousdifficulties in adapting in mainland Mauritius  in spite ofall the efforts that Mauritius has made to assist them inthis process.So far the issue has been discussed within theframework of our friendly relations with the UnitedKingdom  with a view to arriving at an acceptablesolution. Unfortunately  there has not been significantprogress. The United Kingdom has been maintaining thatthe Chagos Archipelago will be returned to Mauritiusonly when it is no longer required for defence purposesby the West. While we continue the dialogue for an earlyresolution of the issue on a bilateral basis  we urge theUnited Kingdom in the meantime to allow the displacedinhabitants to return to the Chagos Archipelago. At thedawn of the new millennium  when we so strongly upholduniversal recognition of and respect for fundamentalhuman rights  the inhabitants of Chagos should notcontinue to be denied the right to return to the ChagosArchipelago.The restoration of the territorial integrity of the Stateof Mauritius will not be complete without the return ofTromelin. We therefore call upon France to resumeconstructive discussions with us on the question ofTromelin.This is the last session of the General Assembly forthis century. When we meet next year it will be a newmillennium. The question that comes to our minds iswhether we want to come back next year and discuss thesame issues and the same problems. Should we not rather  make a pledge here and now that by the time wemeet next year we will have taken the necessary measuresthat will put an end to regional and ethnic problems andto the abuse of human rights  and will instead create thenecessary environment to enable the human race to enjoybasic freedom and basic rights in peace and prosperity?Mauritius is ready to make such a pledge.12"
"119",4944,"MWI",54,1999,"The President of theGeneral Assembly has assumed the mantle of leadership ata critical time  as we are about to enter the newmillennium. We are about to leave a century which hasrevealed positive and negative aspects of the humanexperience. On the negative side  the century has beencharacterized by colonialism  armed conflict  racism andracial discrimination  apartheid  dictatorship  the Holocaust genocide  ethnic cleansing  religious intolerance and otherforms of evil. In their wake many people  particularlywomen and children  have lost their lives and have beenmaimed  traumatized  dehumanized  displaced and forced toseek refuge. Poverty and underdevelopment have wreakedhavoc.On the other hand  humankind has demonstrated asense of magnanimity in overcoming suffering and despair.We have made very strong efforts to wipe out slavery colonialism  racial discrimination and apartheid. We havestriven  through multilateral institutions such as the UnitedNations  to promote the togetherness of humankind andimprove the well-being of all. We realize  however  thatthere is a lot more that can and must be done.As this century comes to a close  Mr. Gurirab’sleadership as President of the General Assembly  and hiscountry  Namibia  represent a beacon of hope for thefuture. His qualities as an outstanding diplomat  freedomfighter and consensus-builder are all well known to us.My delegation wishes him well as he discharges hisheavy responsibilities and leads this esteemedOrganization into the new millennium.In today’s globalized world  the challenges are manyand the opportunities are manifold. With the same spiritthat has enabled us to surmount hurdles in the past together we can make the twenty-first century a centuryfor the prosperity of all. The groundwork  the foundationfor all this  exists. To give credit where it is due  despitemany weaknesses  humankind has never been wanting inideas. The standard-setting strides and intellectualinnovations of this century  particularly since theformation of the United Nations  could have been moreappreciated if only an extra effort had been exertedtowards implementation. Indeed  the twenty-first centuryshould focus on the implementation and concretization ofthe ideas that have made this century worthwhile.The consolidation of human rights  good governanceand human development seems to my delegation a usefulpoint of departure. The country that I represent was for along time under a dictatorship. The people of Malawisuffered and know what it means to be deprived offreedom. They are well aware of the impact that denial ofhuman rights and fundamental freedoms has ongovernance and development. To us the promotion andprotection of human rights and fundamental freedoms arenot optional  but essential prerequisites for the well-beingof humankind.Human rights are universal and indivisible. They areinalienable. When the people of Malawi went to the pollsin June this year  in the second democratic elections  weconfirmed our desire to strengthen further thedemocratization processes that we started in 1994. Theentrenchment of democracy in Malawi has given ourpeople an opportunity to foster unity and commonunderstanding. We now have an environment conduciveto exploiting our full potential and maximizing ourcontributions to the developmental efforts that theGovernment is pursuing. We wish for all people of theworld  regardless of their origin  the same opportunity toenjoy the rights and freedoms that Malawians are proudto enjoy today.Unfortunately  the situation globally does not givecause for optimism  and there is no room for complacency.Inasmuch as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights setforth the yardstick of common achievement and has givenrise to numerous subject-specific binding instruments  everyeffort should be made to assure their effectiveimplementation. The rights of women  children and thedisadvantaged  especially  must be given their fullestpractical meaning.As we commemorate the twentieth anniversary of theadoption of the Convention on the Elimination of All Formsof Discrimination against Women  we should reaffirm ourcommitment to take all practical measures to eliminatediscrimination against women and review all practices thatimpede the mainstreaming of gender in all ourdevelopmental endeavours. Malawi welcomes and looksforward to the review conference of the Beijing Platformfor Action next year. It is our belief that gender equality development and peace in the twenty-first century areachievable.Almost 10 years ago  world leaders assembled in thisvery Hall for the World Summit for Children. They madegroundbreaking commitments to reach certain goals by theyear 2000. The State of the World’s Children 1999 report however  indicates that the benchmarks set are far frombeing realized. Meeting the commitments of the 1990Summit remains one of the challenges that we all face atthe beginning of the twenty-first century.The continued recruitment and use of children assoldiers in most of today’s conflicts is a major source ofworry. The use of children as child labourers and inprostitution is also cause for serious concern. We remainconvinced that investing in children means a secure futurefor us all.Many other conferences have also taken place —particularly during this last decade — including those inParis  Vienna  Rio de Janeiro  Istanbul  Cairo andCopenhagen. In all these conferences  the protection ofhuman rights and fundamental freedoms has been arecurrent and cross-cutting theme. Malawi fully supports theoutcome of these conferences.The time has come to make good the pledges that wemade: personal liberties for all  particularly women andchildren; social development  especially for the leastdeveloped countries; protection of the environment;provision of food and shelter; jobs and income; educationfor all; and secure health  including reproductive rights remain the core of human security. Indeed  theseconferences have brought to the fore the interlinkagesbetween the protection of human rights and the questionsof good governance and development. Quite often  theyseem to give rise to conflicting interests; we aspire to arights-based approach to development  yet the facts arestark: how can our countries  particularly those withfragile economies such as our own  ensure strong publicpolicies aimed at promoting food security  for example when the very interventions intended to provide incentivesfor local production and distribution are put into questionby our efforts to spur economic growth? How do we givepriority to public expenditures for basic social servicessuch as education  health and water when these are thefirst to be cut in an effort to meet structural adjustmentconditionalities and the demands of debt servicing?The challenge for us all is to minimize conflict andaim to strike an appropriate balance to ensure properservices that are human-rights compliant. Malawi supportsthe statement in the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme Human Development Report 1999  to theeffect that national and global governance must bereinvented with human development and equity at theircore. With our concerted efforts  this is achievable. Mydelegation particularly welcomes the positivedevelopments that are taking place in our belovedcontinent  Africa. As democracy blossoms  we areincreasingly witnessing efforts to harness progress inhuman development: Africa’s renaissance is no longer aslogan  but a realistic achievement for the twenty-firstcentury.In Malawi  we remain committed to strengtheninggood governance based on the principles of accountabilityand transparency. Attention is also given to addressingcorruption and strengthening public sector administration in particular enhancing local participation in decision-making processes. We will continue to carry out thenecessary economic and fiscal reforms.Despite unpalatable structural adjustmentconditionalities and the impact of debt servicing  theGovernment continues to give top priority to the provisionof basic social services  particularly in education  health water supply  community development and roadinfrastructure. The Poverty Alleviation Programme andthe Malawi Social Action Fund seek to empower thepopulace so that they can contribute more positively todevelopment. Free primary education for all wasintroduced by the Government to ensure that Malawianchildren  who hold the future of the country in their12hands  are given equal opportunities to grow into productiveand responsible adults.In the health and water sectors  true to the slogan“healthy people make a healthy nation”  the Government isestablishing more health centres in many parts of ruralMalawi: the Bakili Muluzi health initiative  which aims tobring medical services right to the people  was introducedrecently. We are also making remarkable progress inbringing clean and safe water to all rural areas.In order to respond fully to the HIV/AIDS pandemicin the country  the Government  in close cooperation withcivil society  has embarked on highly publicized awarenesscampaigns which we hope will contribute to changingbehavioural patterns. We appeal for more resources:additional funding for research is indeed imperative.Meanwhile  for those already afflicted  it is important forthe drugs that are available now to be made moreaffordable for the majority of our poor.In agriculture  the mainstay of Malawi  the priority isto achieve food self-sufficiency. In this connection  we haveembarked on irrigation programmes to supplement rain-fedagricultural production.The Malawian examples are typical of the importantsteps that Africa is taking  which are positive signs ofrenewal. Africa  however  needs the world in the same waythat the world needs Africa. Africa needs a partnership  onethat is shared and mutually beneficial — a genuinepartnership. We realize that the primary responsibility forAfrican development rests with African countriesthemselves. It is nevertheless important for Africancountries to be given meaningful assistance to enable themto embark on sound economic development. The CairoAgenda for Action adopted by the Organization of AfricanUnity (OAU) in 1995 is an important blueprint for Africaneconomic development: it sets out the broad priority areasrequiring specific attention. Numerous other initiatives havehighlighted the need to help the development of Africa. Thechallenge as we approach the twenty-first century shouldand must be to harmonize these initiatives with a view toadopting action-oriented measures for urgentimplementation.Whatever interventions are made  it has becomeincreasingly clear that a meaningful transformation ofAfrican economies  even after introducing all the necessarydomestic  economic and market reforms  cannot besustained without complementary improvements in tradeflows  improvements in financial resource flows — whetherthrough increased official development assistance  debtrelief or forgiveness  or foreign direct investment — andsupport for regional cooperation. All this must be done ina conducive  secure and predictable environment. Indeed in the globalized economy of today what happens in onepart of the globe has ripple effects and impactsdevelopments elsewhere: the Asian financial crisis and therecent sale of gold are clear examples of thisphenomenon.We must act now if we are to avert a humancatastrophe in the near future. In particular  my delegationwishes to single out the imperative need for theinternational community to address the problem of debt.Although encouraged by the positive responses in recentmonths  we renew the appeal for debt forgiveness whichwe made in this Hall several years ago. The current ratioof external debt to gross national product  89 per cent formy country  is causing enormous economic stress andhardship  particularly for women and children. Thesituation does not augur well for the future  and is havingadverse effects on the Government’s poverty eradicationpolicy; also  the gains we have made politically throughdemocratization and good governance will becomemeaningless without economic development.Malawi is not alone in this predicament. Many othercountries find themselves in similar conditions  wherepoverty is rampant and the disparities between the havesand the have-nots are widening.One of the major issues on which people look up tothe United Nations is because of its concern for nationalidentity. It is in this spirit that Malawi reiterates itsconviction that the question of participation by theRepublic of China on Taiwan in the activities of theUnited Nations deserves consideration on the basis ofrespect for the principle of universality and the sovereignequality of States. The Republic of China  a democraticcountry of over 21 million people  is a reality and cannotbe ignored. It cannot be wished away. Malawi believesthat readmission of the Republic of China to the UnitedNations and to all its specialized agencies would be animportant factor for peace  stability and internationalcooperation.No progress towards improved human developmentcan be sustained without peace and stability. As wecommemorate the centennial of the first Peace Conferenceat The Hague  my delegation wishes to reiterate theimportance that it attaches to the peaceful settlement ofdisputes and respect for international law  including13international humanitarian law. In this connection  Malawialso welcomes the adoption of the Rome Statute of theInternational Criminal Court last year. We have alreadysigned the Statute  and steps are under way to assureratification without delay. We are confident that as the nextcentury nears  the early entry into force of the Rome Statutewill fortify our resolve to bring an end to impunity.Much as the Rome Statute will go a long way inbringing to book those perpetrators of heinous crimes  it isincumbent upon us all to rid the earth of all weapons ofmass destruction. The Review Conference of the StatesParties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons (NPT) next year affords us an opportunity tomake greater strides in the area of nuclear disarmament. Itis worth recalling the words of Albert Einstein: “Peacecannot be kept by force. It can only be achieved byunderstanding.” Indeed  peace cannot be sustained by athreat of use of force. So long as the spectre of a nuclearwar exists  the world will never be at peace with itself. Weurge all countries to sign and ratify the ComprehensiveNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and those countries that havenuclear weapons to destroy them in order to finally realizegeneral and complete disarmament and a nuclear-weapon-free world.We also appeal to those countries that have not yetdone so to become party to the Chemical WeaponsConvention and the anti-personnel landmines Convention.We equally enjoin current efforts to address theproliferation of small arms. In our region  this problem hasassumed frightening proportions  as robberies and theftshave become more and more violent. Urgent action needsto be taken to tackle this problem resolutely. In particular Malawi supports a moratorium on the import  export andmanufacture of small arms and light weapons. We mustalso look for ways of stopping their flow. This Organizationshould prevail upon the manufacturers of these weapons tostop the illegal export of their deadly merchandise toAfrica. Let them stop manufacturing and exporting theseweapons to Africa. That is the bottom line. There is nopoint in inviting us to conferences when  under cover ofdarkness  the manufacturers of those small arms continueexporting them to Africa.The biggest threat to international peace and securityremains humankind. As events in Kosovo  Sierra Leone Angola  the Democratic Republic of the Congo Afghanistan  Somalia  Rwanda  Guinea-Bissau  the MiddleEast  the Korean peninsula and many other parts of theglobe  including  most recently  East Timor  have shown human beings continue to be the main centre of activitywhere armed conflict  tensions and the quest for powerexist.As the Constitution of the United NationsEducational  Scientific and Cultural Organization(UNESCO) reminds us  “wars begin in the minds ofmen”. Only human beings can control their own destiny.Just as those who sat at The Hague Conference 100 yearsago were  we are capable of renouncing violence and ofresolving all disputes through peaceful means. In thisregard  we would like to welcome the Organization ofAfrican Unity (OAU) Summit declaration that the year2000 will be a year of peace  security and solidarity inAfrica. We remain optimistic that the Israelis and thePalestinians; the people of Western Sahara and EastTimor; our brothers and sisters in Angola  the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo  Sierra Leone and Somalia; andmany others whose rights and liberties remain unprotectedwill finally find peace. We can together provide aconducive atmosphere for the provision of all other basicneeds that have an impact on peace and security.In the view of my delegation  the United Nationsremains a singular Organization that is capable ofconsolidating peace and promoting sustainable humandevelopment. The relevance of the United Nations in themaintenance of international peace and security hasbecome even more pronounced in recent years. Mydelegation wishes to pay tribute to Secretary-General KofiAnnan for providing leadership and a renewed sense ofmission to the Organization. Reform of the Organizationsystemwide and of its funds  programmes and specializedagencies has rekindled hopes for a secure world. Effectivecollaboration by all United Nations bodies  each focusingon areas of expertise  is a sure way of reaching our goalsand realizing our aspirations.The task that remains is to make the United Nationsmore responsive to the responsibilities ahead — thechallenges of the twenty-first century. For six years nowwe have been talking about reform of the SecurityCouncil  but without any breakthrough. It is imperativethat the Security Council be made more democratic transparent and accountable. Representation of developingcountries in the permanent category is necessary in orderto ensure the continued legitimacy of  and respect for  theCouncil’s decisions. The United Nations must be properlyresourced in order for it to carry out adequately its nobleactivities.Similarly  the United Nations cannot remain aloof tothe requirements of civil society. Increased cooperation14between the Organization and civil society  including theprivate sector  can only make the Organization stronger.The important role played in particular by non-governmental organizations in the adoption of the RomeStatute and the anti-personnel landmines Convention mustbe acknowledged and ways explored to enhance it. Webelieve that increased contacts between the Organizationand civil society will ensure the continued relevance of theOrganization in the twenty-first century.As the Organization prepares for the MillenniumAssembly next year under your leadership  the role of civilsociety in the consolidation of human rights  goodgovernance and human development might be a subject thatshould be given in-depth consideration within the contextof the overall theme of the United Nations in the twenty-first century.Finally  Malawi would like to congratulate the threenew Members of the United Nations: the Republic ofKiribati  the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga.We welcome them to the United Nations family."
"120",4990,"MYS",54,1999,"Mr. President  allow mefirst to congratulate you on your election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourthsession. It gives me great pleasure to see the internationalcommunity honour both you and your country through yourelection to this high office. I am confident that  given yourvast experience and diplomatic skills  you will be able tosteer the proceedings of the Assembly to a successfulconclusion.I join other speakers in expressing our gratitude toyour predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Didier Opertti  for thededicated and effective manner in which he had guided thework of the General Assembly at the last session.I would also like to take this opportunity to commendthe Secretary-General for his great dedication to theOrganization and the many contributions he has made in theservice of the international community.Malaysia would also like to join other Member Statesin welcoming  most warmly  the Republics of Kiribati andNauru and the Kingdom of Tonga as new Members of theUnited Nations. We look forward to working closely withthem  particularly on issues of common interest to the Asia-Pacific region whence we come.The twentieth century is coming to an end. Before weenter the twenty-first it is useful to review the events of thiscentury so that we may learn from our experience andhopefully we will know how to conduct the affairs of thetwenty-first.This century saw the most destructive wars whichdestroyed billions of dollars of property and killed millionsof people. It saw the most inhuman dictatorship in Germanywhere six million Jews were tortured and killed. Itwitnessed the first nuclear bombs that killed hundreds ofthousands instantly and many more due to the after-effects.When the greatest war in human history ended  thisbody  the United Nations  was founded. We thought therewould be peace as the great Powers worked together in theUnited Nations. But that was not the case. Immediately thevictors divided themselves into two camps and initiated thecold war. However  it was the threat of a hot war that keptthe war cold. Each side built huge arsenals of nuclear andnon-nuclear weapons and glared at the other across deepchasms of misunderstanding as they threateningly fingeredtheir nuclear triggers.For the colonies of European nations there was anup side. Fear of defections to the other side forced thetwo camps to relax their grips on their colonial territories.Countries gained independence  but their survivaldepended on their skills in playing the Western blocagainst the Eastern bloc.Unfortunately this choice to defect to the other sidedid not last. Suddenly the Communist side collapsed.Lured by the apparent wealth of the Western free-marketliberal democracies  the Eastern bloc jettisoned theirauthoritarian centrally planned economies and adopted theliberal democratic free market overnight. They thoughtthat since they would now have a system similar to thatof the Western bloc they would get the friendship cooperation and help from the Western countries.They were naive enough to think that after 70 yearsof command economy and dictatorship they couldovernight switch to the free market economy under theliberal democratic system. They soon found out that theyknew nothing about how to make the system work andthat they would get no help from the Western nations.Instead the Western nations saw in their incompetentfloundering an opportunity to destroy the Eastern bloc  inparticular the principal flag-bearer  forever.Even as the inability to manage a free marketresulted in galloping inflation  destruction of Stateenterprises and massive unemployment  the hedge fundsand the Western financial institutions moved in to devaluethe currencies and make debt defaulters of this oncepowerful enemy. Despite knowing that these people couldnot manage a free market liberal democracyat all  they were nevertheless urged and threatened intocontinuing anyhow. There was no going back for theEastern bloc countries.The destruction of the Eastern bloc was complete. Itcould never again militarily challenge the Western liberaldemocratic free marketeers. Now there would be only onechoice for the world  and no defection would be possiblefor the countries of the world  big or small. With this theliberal democratic free market capitalists saw no moreneed to be gentle in spreading their systems or inprofiting from them. No one would be allowed any otherpolitical or economic system except what was prescribedby the sole dominant bloc. The true ugliness of Westerncapitalism revealed itself  backed by the military might ofcapitalism's greatest proponent.4For the small countries  the demise of the Eastern blocis a major disaster. Now they are exposed to pressureswhich they cannot resist  and very quickly they learned thatthe free marketeers intend to milk them dry. As for theirpolitics  the instability of the liberal democratic system which comes with a lack of understanding of its intricaciesby the leaders as well as the people  meant that they wouldstay in a state of continuous turmoil  verging on anarchy.A few countries apparently managed to grow andprosper  but not for long. The currency manipulators andshort-term investors of the rich soon impoverished thesecountries through devaluing their currencies and shareprices. Impoverished and politically unstable  they wereforced to borrow from the International Monetary Fund(IMF). Whether by design or through sheer lack ofunderstanding  the economic regime imposed by the IMFfurther destroyed their economies. Soon their politicalfreedom was also subverted  and many had to acceptpolitical direction by the IMF  or the loans would not bemade available. For practical purposes  there was no moreindependence.So for the small independent countries of the world the future looks bleak. They are now being told that theworld should be borderless  that capital  goods and servicesshould flow freely between countries. There should be nodiscriminatory taxes to protect local industries or products.Local banks  industries and products must compete on thesame footing as imported products  and their banks andindustries must compete with foreign banks and industriesset up in their countries. No conditions must be attached toforeign banks and businesses which want to set upoperations in their countries. They must have national statuslike those given to local businesses. This way  it is said  alevel playing field will be created and competition will befair.But can competition between giants and dwarfs be faireven if the playing field is level? The giant banks corporations and industries from the rich countries  withhuge local markets  can afford to lose money in a smallforeign country when they make huge profits at home andelsewhere. The small businesses in the small countries willgo bankrupt if they lose money repeatedly. In the end theywill have to sell to the giant foreign companies or closedown altogether. There will be no more big localcompanies; there will be only branches of large foreigncompanies who will indulge in transfer pricing and willrepatriate most of their profit.The efficient may produce better and cheaper goods but if a country does not export its own products to earnforeign exchange it will not be able to pay for imports.Cheap high-quality goods mean nothing if you have nomoney to pay for them.The markets of the poor countries may not be big but impoverishing them would result in lost sales for therich. That was what happened when the currency tradersimpoverished the countries they attacked. These countriescould not buy the products of the rich; that is  the richlost their markets  and world trade contracted. Free unrestricted flow of goods and services across bordersmay be good for a while  but eventually it will destroymarkets and result in contraction of world trade. Theworld would actually become poorer because of freetrade.After the last war  the confrontation between Eastand West led to most of the colonies being liberated andbecoming independent countries. Being independentmeant the right to govern their countries themselves.Unaccustomed to wielding so much power  many of theseGovernments failed. They became hopelessly indebted tothe banks of the rich countries. Their people sufferedfrom incompetent and frequently oppressive rule. But theprinciple that prevailed in the third quarter of thetwentieth century was that no one should interfere in theinternal affairs of a nation. That  in fact  was the essenceof independence.As long as the world was divided into Eastern andWestern blocs  this principle was respected. But then apresident decided that his country had a right and a dutyto see that human rights were not abused anywhere in theworld  irrespective of borders and the independence ofnations. No one conferred this right on this crusadingpresident. But small things like that were not going tostop him.The claim to victory of the West in the Gulf Warwas regarded as a moral endorsement of the right of thepowerful to interfere in any country’s internal affairs.Soon  it was not just human rights. Systems ofgovernment and of the administration of justice and thefinancial and commercial systems came under scrutiny ofthe powerful countries. They insist that there must beonly one way of administering a country  and that is theliberal democratic way. They insist that there can be onlyone economic system for the whole world  and that is thefree market system. They insist that there must beopenness in everything  transparency  separation of the5private from the public sectors  non-discrimination betweenethnic groups  and no discrimination against foreigners infavour of nationals.All these and more sound very good. They haveapparently worked for the developed countries of the West making them rich and powerful  giving their people highstandards of living. But will they work for everyone? Theyseem to have forgotten that they took centuries to maketheir system work. Their transition from feudal oppressiverule was based in copious blood. Both rich and poor weremassacred as reforms were forced by a succession ofuncaring tyrants  many elected by the people.Even today their system has not brought freedom andequity to large segments of their people  yet they insist thatall the countries of the world  new or old  mustimmediately adopt the only system of government — theirsystem  their liberal democratic system. The newlyindependent countries  which knew only the authoritariansystem of government  cannot but fail. The formerCommunist countries in particular found themselves unableto cope with the destabilizing challenges directed atgovernment authority in a liberal democracy.But the new countries are not going to be allowedtime to learn and operate the system. They must changenow  immediately. If their countries are destabilized  if theirpeople suffer  if they regress economically  that isirrelevant. The important thing is that they mustdemocratize and liberalize. If they fail to do so  they willbe forced to do so through arm-twisting  trade sanctions andmilitary action  if necessary.That these measures are more oppressive than those ofthe disapproved regimes and systems does not matter. Theadoption of the approved system would destabilize thecountries further and cause further suffering. All this doesnot matter  because the most important thing is the adoptionof the system  not the benefit to be derived from it.It is the same with economic management. There mustbe liberalization and deregulation. The Government shouldnot help the business sector  should not give it anyprotection. If businesses are attacked by outside forces fairly or unfairly  and they lose  then let them die. Theymust be inefficient if they lose  and the world has no timeor sympathy for inefficient losers.And so giant currency traders  their funds leveragedone hundred times or more  are pitted against central bankswith limited reserves and without leveraging rights. Theeconomies of whole countries and regions are destroyed but the cries for protection by these countries are ignored.The fields are level  and the free movement of capital isa part of the secret free trade. Everyone must acceptwhatever happens because it is free trade. All thecurrency traders are doing is to discipline Governments sothat they conform to the system and do away with theirbad old system.In the financial crisis  Governments may not helpbusinesses to recover. To do that means a bail-out ofcronies. Let them die; let there be blood. Only then willGovernments be considered serious in wanting to reformtheir systems  to adopt best practices  world standards andthe only proper way to administer the economy. If theGovernment becomes bankrupt in trying to do this  thatis all right. The important thing is to do things correctly even if the country is destroyed  the people starve todeath  anarchy reigns and the Government overthrown.There is a touching concern on the part of the Westover human rights. But the definition of human rightsseems limited to an individual’s right of dissent againstthe Government. Millions of people in a country will bemade to suffer through sanctions and even bombings inorder that a few dissenters may enjoy their rights ofdissent. Apparently the rest of the population  hundreds ofmillions of them sometimes  have no rights. Their rightsare not considered human rights. Thus depriving millionsof the right to work as a result of currency trading is notconsidered as a violation of human rights. In the Westernperception only individuals have rights; the masses donot.The concern over child labour and sweatshopfactories is expressive of a sense of caring. Unfortunatelythe concern is shown only when the products of childlabour and sweatshops compete successfully with theproducts of highly paid  high-living four-day-a-weekworkers in the developed countries.Child labour and sweatshops are not somethingwhich anyone would defend  but consider the extremepoverty of the people in some countries. They have nocapital  no technology or expertise  no markets at home no Harvard-trained managers. All they have is low-costlabour. For the workers  the tiny wages that they earn arefar better than starvation and death. If we really care  theninvest and pay high wages. The sweatshops will disappearand adults will earn enough to feed their children. Forcingthem to stop child labour and sweatshops will only causemore suffering for their people. Telling them to stop6producing children is not a solution either. We know thatthe poor have a higher birth rate than the rich. To stop thepopulation explosion which the West is worried about enrich these people. Closing their sweatshops and stoppingtheir children from working will only impoverish themfurther and cause them to have more children.With the end of the East-West confrontation  conflictshave increased instead of decreased. The Palestinianproblem is still not resolved  but the sanctions against andthe bombing of Iraq  the sanctions against Libya  theconflicts resulting from the break-up of the Soviet Union and the stirring up of unrest and rebellions  or near-rebellions  by open support for insurrection go on. Before it was the Communists who stirred up rebellion everywhere including in Malaysia. Now we have the liberal democratsdoing exactly the same in the same manner  complete withsupply of arms. Whether it is a communist or a liberaldemocratic insurrection  the people suffer not one bit less.The United Nations seems helpless. Indeed  it is oftenbypassed by the big and the powerful. Now groupings ofpowerful nations or even one nation by itself seem todecide when to step in and when to step out. While theylike to wield power  they are inordinately unwilling to paythe price. “Tele-wars” are conducted using high technology such as the so-called pinpoint bombings  in order to avoidbody bags coming home. This unwillingness to face theenemy often results in the unnecessary killing of innocentpeople and the destruction of the wrong targets.Unfortunately  no one should expect any change for aslong as the United Nations belongs to the permanent five.The structure of the United Nations will continue to reflectthe glorious victory of these nations 50 years ago. For thesmall countries  yearly speeches and various anniversaryspeeches will be allowed. Occasionally there will bemembership in the Security Council. But despite the factthat at least three of the permanent five are vociferousadvocates of democracy  there will be no democracy in theUnited Nations. The only saving grace is the agencies andtheir good work.Unfortunately  some in the United Nations have ratherunusual principles. Normally a neutral or unbiased personwould be chosen to study  report on and give an opinion orpass judgment on something. But the United Nations chosea person well-known for his virulent attacks against theMalaysian judiciary to report on that institution. The UnitedNations then conferred on him total immunity with respectto the laws of his country without reference to or consentby the country. This immunity apparently extends beyondhis task of reporting his findings to the United Nations.He may publish his opinions and defame people and thesubject of his study anywhere and everywhere. Is there nolimit to a United Nations Commissioner’s or Rapporteur’simmunity?We are told that Governments must not interferewith the judiciary. Yet in this case the Government isexpected to instruct the judiciary not to act against thisUnited Nations Commissioner for breaking the laws ofthe country. I am not blaming the Secretary-General forthis. It is the peculiar system and principles which guidethe choice of the United Nations Commissioner orRapporteur that I find unacceptable. Nor do I think itproper to hint at dire consequences for the Malaysiannation if this man is not freed from court action for opencontempt and defamation. There is something not righthere which the United Nations needs to look into.But small countries lack a public forum to air theirviews freely. The Western media distorts everything thatthey say or do. Again we are expected to give immunityto western journalists; they may break our laws  but nolegal action may be taken against them. I would like topoint out that in Malaysia not even the King and thehereditary Sultans are above the law.This then is the scenario in the last quarter of thetwentieth century. We will carry this baggage into thetwenty-first century and the new millennium. For the poorand the weak  for the aspiring tigers and dragons of Asia the twenty-first century does not look very promising.Everything will continue to be cooked in the West. Justas communism and socialism came from the West  liberaldemocracy  globalization  a borderless world deregulation  unfettered free flows of capital and theirflights to quality  the disciplining of Governments by themarket and by currency traders  and a host of other ideasall come from the West. And what is from the West isuniversal. Other values and cultures are superfluous andunnecessary. If they remain  there will be a clash ofcivilizations. To avoid this clash there should be only onecivilization in the world. Everything should bestandardized according to Western best practices. Theymay change only if the West changes. Thus the globalizedworld will be totally uniform. Variety is equal tointransigence and must therefore be eliminated.Malaysia has just gone through a very traumaticexperience. In a matter of weeks  42 years of hard workto develop the country was destroyed  in particular the7affirmative action to reduce the enmity between races inMalaysia.We have devised our own formula for recovery. Withthe blessings of Allah  we have turned around and are onthe road to recovery. But we are being pressured toabandon our currency control. We do not understand why.It has done us a lot of good. It has done no harm toanybody except a few thousand rich currency manipulators.Foreigners doing real business in our country have profitedfrom the so-called controls. But we are still being urged toconform to an international financial system which hasenabled the unscrupulous to destroy the wealth of manynations.No serious attempt is being made to change theinternational financial system. So far there is only talkabout intentions. But the threat of financial  economic andpolitical destabilization remains.Malaysia wishes only to be allowed to manage thingsin its own way  in the interests of its own people. We willnot harm others. We are not turning our backs on theworld. We have always cooperated with the rest of theworld  in particular with the United Nations. We willcontinue to do our bit for world peace. Just as we acceptcriticism  warranted and unwarranted  we hope others willalso tolerate our criticism of them. Free speech would bemeaningless if criticism could be directed only at the poorand the weak and never at the rich and powerful. Incriticizing others  we are only exercising our right tofreedom of expression.We are not too enchanted by the prospects we foreseefor the next century. But I can assure the Assembly that wewill be a responsible nation  friendly towards all who arefriendly towards us and harbouring no bad intentionstowards anyone."
"121",5017,"NAM",54,1999,"Mr. President  the United Nationsis no foreign territory to you. For 14 difficult andchallenging years  you valiantly waged a diplomaticstruggle at the United Nations for the freedom of ourpeople and the independence of our country. Your sterlingpersonal efforts and unflinching commitment could not bebetter crowned. The people of the Republic of Namibia arevery proud to see you preside over the fifty-fourth sessionof the General Assembly. On their behalf and indeed on myown  I express our deep gratitude to all United NationsMember States for electing you President at this session.Mr. President  as you assume this very importantoffice  you follow in the memorable footsteps of MongiSlim of Tunisia  Alex Quaison-Sackey of Ghana Angie E. Brooks of Liberia  Abdelaziz Bouteflika ofAlgeria  Salim Ahmed Salim of Tanzania  Paul J. F. Lusakaof Zambia  Joseph N. Garba of Nigeria and Amara Essy ofCôte d’Ivoire. These distinguished sons and daughters ofAfrica presided over the General Assembly between 1961and 1994. They did Africa proud and they served theinternational community well. You should heed the viewsof all United Nations Member States  large and small  richand poor. In that way  you will have maintained andadvanced even further the integrity and importance of thismost representative organ of the United Nations  theGeneral Assembly. I assure you  Mr. President  that youcan always count on the loyal and unqualified support ofthe Namibian delegation.During your term of office  you will be flanked byanother illustrious and committed son of Africa  Mr. KofiAnnan  one who hails from Ghana  a country which litthe torch of Africa’s decolonization. To you Mr. Secretary-General of the United Nations  I expressmy Government’s fullest support. The Government andthe people of Namibia particularly commend you for yourdetermined efforts aimed at promoting the peacefulsettlement of conflicts and bringing relief to the needy inAfrica and elsewhere in the world.I wish to add my voice to that of the currentChairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) my brother and colleague  President Abdelaziz Bouteflikaof the People’s Democratic Republic of Algeria. Heplaced the demands and expectations of the Africanpeople before this body  as well as their resolve to faceup to the challenges which confront Africa. Guided by thespirit of the recent OAU summit held in Algiers President Bouteflika talked about a continent which isconfronted by development constraints  but whose peoplehave not lost hope: a people who are industrious  butwhose efforts to make Africa achieve its potential arebeing impeded by social and economic problems. It issome of these challenges that I wish to address.Today  economic disparity  debt burden  socialinjustice  unemployment  refugee problems andenvironmental degradation have become unacceptablehardships in various regions of the world. One may askwhether these burdens of deprivation have become astatus quo for the majority of people in the developingcountries? Have we concluded that there are not enoughresources to educate every woman  man and child in thisworld and to keep them healthy and productive? Can allthe technological achievements that are now at ourdisposal not be put at the service of all humanity? Wordsof reason have been spoken  saying that those who areaffluent today owe their tomorrow to those who live indeprivation.It has been argued that the solution tounderdevelopment is globalization and liberalization ofthe world economy. This forces all of us to be equal while  in fact  we are not. I believe that for globalizationto work it must be transformed from a mere concept intoreality. It must be a collective undertaking for the benefitof all. It is only logical and  indeed  morally right that noman  woman or child should go hungry while others are16basking in prosperity. Globalization should not amount toprotected and selective prosperity. If so  international peaceand stability will be jeopardized. As long as over a billionpeople live in abject poverty  lack access to clean drinkingwater and do not know how to read and write at all  thebenefit of globalization will not be universal. And thereality of inequality of States must be at the centre of anydiscussions of the world economy. The United Nations canand should help developing countries to maximize thebenefits from a globalized economy.The biggest menace of the twentieth century has beenthe unacceptably high and ever-increasing poverty thatdenudes humanity of its dignity. I wish to recall that amongthe commitments made during the World Summit for SocialDevelopment  held in Copenhagen in 1995  was thecommitment to halve poverty levels by 2015. Sub-SaharanAfrica requires a growth rate of 7 per cent annually if weare to achieve those levels. The future looks bleak  but thedetermination is strong to overcome all odds and succeed.Africa carries 10 per cent of the world’s population but produces only 1 per cent of the world’s gross domesticproduct. Foreign direct investment in sub-Saharan Africa isestimated at a meagre 3 per cent of all total foreign directinvestment. With most of the least developed countriesbeing in Africa  this vast  rich but underdeveloped continentcontinues to challenge our Organization. Poverty anddisease have all become much talked about to depict thesituation in many parts of Africa. Armed conflicts invarious parts of Africa continue to strip our continent of itshuman and natural resources. This overshadows the overallachievements that Africa continues to make. Africa todayis democratizing and undertaking economic reform tomaximize social and economic prosperity for its people.And  indeed  some significant economic growth has beenrecorded in a large number of countries.However  political and economic reforms inthemselves will not deliver sustained economic growth.Increased foreign direct investment is very important tocomplement these reforms and to sustain the current growthrate. Only then can the lives of the African people improve.Let me emphasize that foreign direct investment should notreplace official development aid. In the short term  foreignaid will be a necessary complement to Africa’s own effortsfor recovery and development of its people.In 1990 I attended the World Summit for Children here at the United Nations  as the newly elected Presidentof the Republic of Namibia. I feel proud to say that wewere among the first countries in Africa to complete ournational programme of action for the implementation ofthe Summit’s outcome. Our Parliament ratified — and  infact  most of Africa has ratified — the Convention on theRights of the Child  whose tenth anniversary we are aboutto commemorate. This embodies the legal standard withwhich we should comply in ensuring that children reachtheir fullest potential. Yet  to our dismay  too manychildren are being denied their childhood.When a child is subjected to armed conflict  witheach and every right being taken away  then that child isplaced on an equal footing with adults. And when thatcourse takes effect  then  regrettably  society has stoopedto its lowest and the rest of humanity cannot and shouldnot stand idly by. We can and must prevent conflictsfrom occurring  so as to create an environment in whichall children can live  play and grow up under safeconditions. Only through a culture of peace can wecombat all forms of child exploitation and  in particular put an end to the phenomenon of child soldiers.I would therefore like to stress that if every squaremetre of land that is inaccessible because of landminescould once again become productive  many children especially in Africa  would be spared from hunger. Andif every child soldier in Africa carrying a gun can beturned into a student  Africa’s future will have beensecured.On the eve of the new millennium  we can all lookback with pride on the fact that humankind has mademajor strides towards the betterment of the livingconditions of millions across the world. The informationsuperhighway has changed for ever the way we dobusiness. Much of the world is now fully connectedthrough the Internet.Notwithstanding all this  much of Africa is stillstruggling to gain meaningful access to knowledge andinformation. In addition to our efforts to become more“wired”  we are now faced with the enormous challengeof ensuring that our countries are all Y2K-compliantbefore 31 December 1999  in order to avert disaster.Namibia calls on all those countries which have theresources and the necessary know-how to assistdeveloping countries in dealing with this problem. Theinternational community needs to share knowledgebecause it is mutually beneficial. Developed countrieshave nothing to lose and everything to gain by sharinginformation technology with the developing countries.17The HIV/AIDS pandemic is eroding the socio-economic and developmental gains that many Africancountries have made. HIV/AIDS has been rated thenumber-one killer in many countries  including Namibia.My Government adopted a National Strategic Plan onHIV/AIDS for the period 1999-2004. The aim of ournational plan is to reduce the incidence of HIV/AIDSsignificantly by strengthening efforts towards preventionand control. In addition to the existing Southern AfricanDevelopment Community (SADC) regional programmes we have also undertaken other measures to ensure that thereis no discrimination against all those living with HIV/AIDS.The international community should assist the efforts of theAfrican Governments in the implementation of theirnational programmes to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS.Next June  we shall convene two special sessions ofthe General Assembly to review the progress made byGovernments in the implementation of the commitmentsmade at the Fourth World Conference on Women and theWorld Summit for Social Development  respectively. Let ususe those opportunities to make equality among people areality and social integration the norm  so that men andwomen can live together in equality and as partners.In recent years  we have witnessed a number ofpositive developments in the field of disarmament.However  despite these developments  we remain concernedat the lack of tangible movement on the core issue ofnuclear disarmament. The central problem is thedetermination by nuclear-weapon States  despite theirobligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons  to retain nuclear weapons indefinitely.This is being done under the pretext that nuclear weaponsare essential for national security. To make such a claim isa clear invitation to other States to acquire nuclear weaponsunder the same pretext  as by nature every State has itsvital national security to protect. In practice  nuclearweapons have also become a means of exerting pressure onand blackmailing other countries. No State or group ofStates should have a monopoly on nuclear weapons. Thisis a new type of apartheid  which is unacceptable today.In this century  international peace and security havebeen challenged by the barbaric conduct of a fewindividuals who have offended the very conscience ofhumankind by committing heinous crimes. Namibia wishesto record its firm stand against all acts  methods andpractices of terrorism and reiterates its unequivocalcondemnation of such acts. At the Organization of AfricanUnity (OAU) summit in Algiers  the African leadersadopted the OAU Convention on the Prevention andCombating of Terrorism. Its elimination therefore requiresthe close cooperation of all United Nations MemberStates. However  international cooperation in combatingterrorism  and the measures adopted to combat it  must bebased on international law  the relevant internationalConventions and  above all  conducted in conformity withthe principles of the Charter of the United Nations.The reform of the Security Council constitutes oneof the important components in the efforts to strengthen revitalize and democratize the United Nations. Thecomposition of the Security Council does not reflect thesubstantial increase in the membership of the UnitedNations. Furthermore  it does not respect the principles ofequitable geographical representation and the sovereignequality of States. In the existing Security Council particularly in the permanent members’ category developing countries are grossly under-represented. Tomaintain such a situation is to erode the principle ofdemocracy and fairness. Equally  a selective or partiallyreformed Council which overlooks the principles of equityand balance is against the spirit of the Charter.My Government is therefore strongly in favour ofthe position that we must correct the existing imbalancesin the composition of the Security Council. It mustbecome a democratic and truly representative institution unfettered by the unfair tendencies and practices of thepast.We support the expansion of the Security Council inboth categories  permanent and non-permanent.Developing countries must adequately be represented ina reformed and democratized Security Council. Africadeserves at least two permanent seats and additional non-permanent seats in the expanded Council. Namibia  beinga member of the Non-Aligned Movement  supports areformed Council of no less than 26 members. We do notsupport those who advocate a lesser number on theground of effectiveness.Experience has shown that the ineffectiveness orinaction of the Security Council has been due to the threatof veto by those who possess it  and not to the Council’ssize. As a matter of policy  Namibia is opposed to theveto  because of its undemocratic nature. It cannot evenbe overridden by law or by procedures  as is the practicein democratic countries. The exercise of the vetoperpetuates differences between members of the Council.In some instances  it has greatly contributed to divisionand inaction in the Security Council. In other instances it has even prolonged conflicts and human suffering. If18the veto cannot be abolished now  its application should beprogressively curtailed until it is removed altogether.The question of Palestine remains at the core of theproblem of the Middle East. Only when the inalienablerights of the Palestinian people are restored can there belasting peace. We welcome the resumption of the peacenegotiations between the Israeli and Palestinian leaders. Ireaffirm my Government’s unwavering political anddiplomatic support for the Palestinian people under theleadership of President Yasser Arafat.With the end of the cold war nearly 10 years ago  weall expected to share in the peace dividend. In thisconnection  it is regrettable that Cuba continues to besubjected to a cruel economic  financial and commercialembargo  which must be lifted forthwith. Namibia calls forthe end of the embargo so that the people of Cuba can livein peace and prosperity with all their neighbours.The people of East Timor have long yearned for theirright to self-determination  freedom and independence. On30 August 1999 their dream to determine their own futurewas overwhelmingly expressed in a referendum. Theinternational community should assist the people of EastTimor to complete the process towards statehood  peace security and development. We welcome the decision of theGovernment of Indonesia to invite the internationalcommunity  through the deployment of a United Nationspeacekeeping force  to East Timor. We call on Indonesia tocooperate fully to ensure the success of that operation.With regard to Western Sahara  my Government notesthe progress made towards the holding of a free and fairreferendum. We call on the parties  in particular theKingdom of Morocco  to cooperate with the United Nationsso as to enable the Sahraoui people to exercise their rightto self-determination.Despite the difficulties of the United Nations  myGovernment regards the Organization and its variousagencies as the best possible instruments we have topromote world peace  international trade and increasedcooperation. The admission of the Republic of Kiribati  theRepublic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga has furtherstrengthened our Organization. Namibia congratulates themand welcomes them into our fold.In the current international climate  the United Nationsis the only voice which can bring peace to strife-torn areas bring development to those regions where is it needed mostand settle disputes between States. However  to carry out itsmanifold tasks and duties effectively and efficiently  theUnited Nations needs money and resources from allMember States  without exception. In short  the UnitedNations must embody the hopes and aspirations ofhumankind and still reflect the realities of our times."
"122",5062,"NER",54,1999,"I amdelighted to have the opportunity at this fifty-fourthsession of the General Assembly to share with the entireinternational community the concerns — but also thehope — that inspire the nation of Niger in the progress ofworld events.The Niger welcomes the new Member States — theRepublic of Kiribati  the Republic of Nauru and theKingdom of Tonga — to membership of the UnitedNations community.I would also like to say how proud and pleased weare  Sir  over your unanimous election as President of theGeneral Assembly for this session. On behalf of thedelegation of the Niger  I wish to sincerely congratulateyou and the other members of the Bureau. Yourprofessional skills and your well-known human qualities as well as your unceasing commitment to your country Namibia  and to the defence of the noble causes ofhumanity  guarantee the successful outcome of theAssembly’s work.My delegation also has the agreeable duty of payinga well-deserved tribute to your predecessor  Mr. DidierOpertti  for the excellent work done during his term ofoffice.9The presence at your side of Secretary-General KofiAnnan  whose devotion and constant desire to serve thecauses I have mentioned are well-established  reinforces ourconviction that the outcome of this session will make itpossible to lay a sound basis for the future of a world thatis less unjust  more peaceful  more prosperous — and  in aword  more human.The Niger is a landlocked  heavily indebted countrywhich has for almost a decade suffered from chronicinstitutional instability. This situation has seriouslyundermined its people’s efforts to establish a viablepolitical  economic and social environment. Since itsaccession to independence in August 1960 the Republic ofthe Niger has experienced profound upheavals which haveaffected its progress towards the establishment of ademocratic  harmonious and prosperous society.But these upheavals  far from weakening thedemocratic ideal of our people  have strengthened itsresolve to overcome these challenges. Strengthened by thisconviction  the Council for National Reconciliation and theGovernment resulting from the events of 9 April 1999 havemade the strong commitment that the people of the Niger at peace with itself and possessing stable and durabledemocratic institutions  will be able to meet the challengesof the third millennium.On 18 July  in a referendum  the people of the Nigeradopted the Constitution of the Fifth Republic  which willlead to the establishment of lasting democratic institutions.The timetable decided on by our Independent NationalElectoral Commission sets the first round of presidentialelections for 17 October. The second round will be held atthe same time as the general elections  on 24 November.The investiture and assumption of office of the President-elect of the Republic will take place on 31 December 1999.In this respect  every step has been taken to organizethe elections in the most transparent  honest and neutralway possible. The measures taken include a ban on themilitary’s submitting candidates for the presidential andgeneral elections  even if those candidates are on leave ofabsence or have resigned from the military. TheGovernment will ensure that the elections are held in aspirit of impartiality.With this same aim  the Independent NationalElectoral Commission was institutionalized and a nationalcommunications monitor set up to guarantee equal accessto public media and to ensure that the press is free andconstructive.Basically  therefore  our political transition is on theright track  and the instruments for this transition will beactive until power is handed over to the duly  freelyelected authorities.In view of all this  we hope that our traditionalexternal partners will help us establish true democracy inthe Niger. We expect their support  which is necessary tohelp us in the process of establishing dialogue among allparties concerned to guarantee the holding of credible honest elections.But as the Assembly is aware  democracy does notjust mean holding a series of elections. A legal arsenaland a different way of thinking are essential toconsolidate democracy  and this is why we have startedgiving organized  concerted consideration to the draftingof basic texts that will govern the future Republic.Varied and burning issues  such as thedepoliticization of the administration  the electoral code the charter of political parties  the status of the oppositionand the role of the army in a democratic context havebeen tackled.In this context  I call upon interested States to takepart in the national workshop to be held next Decemberon the theme “The army and democracy in Africa: thecase of the Niger”.I wish very sincerely to thank all bilateral andmultilateral partners of the Niger  in particular UnitedNations agencies  and more specifically the UnitedNations Development Programme (UNDP)  for havingcontinued to support my country’s efforts to create theright institutional environment to restore social peace andto enable men and women of the Niger to meet the majorchallenges they face. This highly appreciated assistancewill continue to be necessary in this decisive phase of thedemocratic process and the process of nationalreconciliation.The recurrent theme of post-conflict insecuritydeserves special attention from the United Nationssystem. The Niger  resolutely committed to the process ofcantonment  disarmament and socio-economicreintegration of elements of the former rebel army whichrampaged in the north and far east of the country a few10years ago  fully supports the programme for collecting anddestroying small arms.It is in this spirit that my country submitted to theSecretariat a plan to put an end to the illicit circulation ofsmall arms and light weapons. It endorsed the decisiontaken by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in June1998 and the declaration adopted by the heads of State andGovernment of member countries of the EconomicCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) in October1998 to deal with the destabilizing effects and the threat topeace and security posed by the illicit circulation of smallarms and light weapons for the West African region and forthe entire continent.We welcome the emerging concordance of views andaction regarding the priority nature of this question amongAfrican organizations on the one hand  and otherinternational institutions — including those of the UnitedNations system  the European Union and the Organizationof American States — on the other. This internationalconsensus will make it possible to take effective steps intime for the upcoming international conference on allaspects of the illicit arms trade  to be held in 2001.The Niger has always sought to make its modestcontribution to the settlement of conflicts that threatenpeace and security in Africa and throughout the rest of theworld. Despite our limited resources  we sent troops toLiberia  Sierra Leone and Guinea-Bissau  as well as civilianpolice officers to Haiti. In this regard  my Governmentwishes to reaffirm its constant willingness to send militaryand police contingents to all United Nations peacekeepingoperations when needed.In Africa  thanks to the efforts of the internationalcommunity  we have reason to hope that the processleading to the referendum on self-determination for theSahraoui people will soon lead to a final settlement of thisquestion.The conclusion of the Peace Agreement in SierraLeone under the aegis of ECOWAS and the CeasefireAgreement in the Democratic Republic of the Congo havegiven us a glimmer of hope. These efforts must becontinued and must serve as an example for those involvedin other conflicts  such as in Angola  in Somalia or in thearmed confrontation between Ethiopia and Eritrea.It must be acknowledged that these situations of crisisand insecurity demand first and foremost that AfricanGovernments and leaders of public opinion committhemselves resolutely to dealing with factors of instabilityon a consensus basis. In this respect  my Government andmy people would like through me to welcome theindividual and collective initiatives to create orconsolidate an environment of peace and security inAfrica  which is a sine qua non for development.Outstanding and effective initiatives have been takenin various places and should be welcomed. Among theseis the action initiated by President Abdelaziz Bouteflikaof Algeria  who had the praiseworthy idea of holding on16 September last  a referendum on civil concord  whichwas massively supported by the Algerian people. TheGovernment and the people of the Niger welcome thisgenuine plebiscite and the prospects it ushers in for thatfraternal country.The Niger also welcomes the positive developmentsin the Lockerbie case. We believe that conditions nowexist for the total lifting of sanctions against the greatSocialist People’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya.In the Middle East  the attention of the internationalcommunity is still focused on the Israeli-Palestinian peaceprocess  which  fortunately  seems to have been revivedwith the change in the leadership of the IsraeliGovernment.In Asia  the Jammu and Kashmir conflict remains asource of great tension between two nuclear States  Indiaand Pakistan  and a persistent  serious threat to peace andsecurity in that part of South Asia.The Niger  therefore  as a member of the contactgroup established by the Organization of the IslamicConference  reiterates its appeal to both parties to step uptheir negotiations in order to reach a peaceful settlementof the conflict by recognizing the Kashmiri people’s rightto self-determination pursuant to the relevant resolutionsof the United Nations.In Europe  my Government welcomes the return ofpeace to the Balkans. The establishment of anadministration under United Nations control is a sureguarantee for the safe return of the refugees.It is more essential and urgent than ever to reversethe decline in official development assistance which  itmust be recalled  is at its lowest level in 50 years. Inorder to meet this challenge  the international communitymust consider the possibility of mobilizing additionalresources. It is therefore urgent that progress be madewithin the framework of the initiatives taken at worldsummits. At the same time  we must pool our efforts toincrease the effectiveness of aid by reviewing its modalitiesand through its sound and rigorous management.It is on the basis of this experience that myGovernment adopted a national strategy note and aneconomic recovery programme that clearly defines thecoherent networks for action by our development partners.Furthermore  the crucial problem of African countries’debt — which is wiping out all development efforts —calls for the international community as a whole toimplement  without delay or conditions other than goodpublic administration  appropriate regulatory policies andmechanisms.In this connection  the Heavily Indebted PoorCountries Debt (HIPC) Initiative of the World Bank and theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF)  as well as the recentinitiative undertaken in Cologne at the Group of 7 Summit must be extended to all the least developed countries inorder to produce the effects we hope to see. This must takethe form of an outright cancellation of the debt.Despite the outstanding efforts made by many Africancountries in the area of economic reform  foreign privateinvestment flows are still meagre  notwithstanding theenabling environment that has been established. We verymuch hope that the positive initiative taken by theSecretary-General at Davos will allow greater involvementby the private sector in implementing adequate measures toreverse that tendency. It is in this connection that mydelegation would like to appeal to all development partnersto help reinforce the institutional capacities of our Statesand to create adequate infrastructures  which are guaranteesof balanced development.The second special dialogue between the Economicand Social Council and the Bretton Woods institutions heldhere on 29 April 1999 reaffirmed the need to continue thereform of the international financial system  bearing inmind social imperatives and the external debt situation  thatis to say  the close link between settling debt  povertyreduction and lasting development.Niger belongs to the group of least developedcountries and has a population that is growing at an annualrate of 3.4 per cent. It has a fertility rate of 7.4 children perwoman and a life expectancy of 47 years  and is rankedamong the poorest countries of the world. Despite all theseconstraints  my country has made efforts to design andimplement initiatives in keeping with therecommendations of the population conferences.These various difficulties have exacerbated thepolitical instability I referred to before and have kept ourcountry at the bottom of the human development table.Poverty affects 63 per cent of our compatriots  34 percent of whom live below the extreme poverty threshold.Those people are victims of continued declining maternal childhood and adolescent health standards — a criticalsocial and health situation marked by high mortality andilliteracy rates  one of the lowest standards of educationand insufficient drinking water resources. They even lackbasic social services.The economic and financial crisis that has hit mycountry has  among other things  led to a drastic reductionin public investment  particularly in the social sectors thus depriving 80 per cent of the rural population ofadequate living standards. With the valuable assistance ofinternational financial institutions we have initiated anenormous economic recovery programme to confront thissituation. This programme includes  among other things a series of economic and financial reforms and frameworkprogrammes to restore the macroeconomic balance reduce poverty and stimulate growth.I wish  from this rostrum  to reiterate our greatappreciation for the ongoing support that the UnitedNations Development Programme (UNDP)  the UnitedNations Children’s Fund (UNICEF)  the United NationsPopulation Fund (UNFPA) and other developmentpartners have been steadily providing to implement ournational framework programme to combat poverty. Thisprogramme we are implementing is one of the prioritiesof the first country cooperation framework adopted by theUNDP Governing Council last January.I would like here to make a heartfelt appeal to theUnited Nations system to allocate sufficientsupplementary resources to UNDP  UNICEF and UNFPAso that they can complete their development activities inthe least developed countries. This appeal also goes outto the international community to supply all the necessarysupport to my country so that the major challenges we areconfronting can be met.At the dawn of the twenty-first century  specialattention should be given to making a reality of theuniversality of our world Organization. Peace  securityand development are too important to be the soleresponsibility of a club of military  economic and12financial Powers. Africa  which now figures prominentlyamong international initiatives and hopes to become anactive partner in those initiatives  must play an importantrole within a reformed Security Council. Africa hascountries that can play a decisive role in that regard.A large number of countries  including my own  thatshare the use of French with other States of the world verymuch hope that they can work in all United Nations bodiesand agencies in their official language. The member Statesof the Organisation international de la Francophonie  whichis increasingly establishing itself as an essential actor inworld affairs  will make an additional contribution in thegive-and-take process in the third millennium.In conclusion  I should like to express the confidencethat Niger and its people have in the United Nations  whichis trying very hard to be an institution that embodies hopeon the basis of justice  equity  peace  freedom and progress.These values will build the coming twenty-first century weare expecting if the United Nations is stronger and moreeffective."
"123",5108,"NGA",54,1999,"A little over two decades ago Iaddressed this Assembly as head of a military Governmentin Nigeria. On that occasion the focus of my statement wasthe urgent need to terminate colonial rule in Namibia andRhodesia  now Zimbabwe  and dismantle the racistapartheid South Africa. Today it is a great source of joy forme and my delegation that a distinguished son of Namibiais presiding over the affairs of the fifty-fourth session ofthe United Nations General Assembly. My delegationassures you  Sir  of its full cooperation and unwaveringsupport throughout your tenure.May I also convey through you  Sir  our deepappreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Didier Opertti ofUruguay  for the able and efficient manner in which heconducted the proceedings of the fifty-third session.Our appreciation also goes to the Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  for his visionary leadership and theinvaluable work of the Secretariat under his stewardship.Permit me also to warmly welcome  on behalf of mycountry and delegation  the Republic of Kiribati  theRepublic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga  whichhave just joined this family of nations.I stand before this Assembly today very proud to bethe leader of a Nigeria that has successfully managed thetransition to democracy after a decade and a half ofmilitary rule. I would like to seize this opportunity toexpress the profound appreciation of all Nigerians for theinternational support and encouragement which combinedso effectively with the relentless determination ofNigerians themselves to reconstruct and transform theircountry into a vibrant democracy.Our Administration has raised the hopes ofNigerians  and their expectations are correspondinglyhigh. We are well aware of the enormity of the challengesthat we face. But we are fully resolved to tackle ournumerous social  economic and political problems headon. And  by the Grace of God  we will not fail.Since assuming office some four months ago ouradministration has put in place an institutional frameworkfor the purpose of reconciling competing interests andgroups in our society. Our democratic institutions are nowoperating effectively within the system of checks andbalances enshrined in our Constitution. Furthermore  wehave opted for a policy of inclusiveness in all ourpolitical appointments  with a Cabinet  for instance  inwhich all registered political parties are represented  thusmoving away from the divisive practice of winner takesall.Our Administration has initiated policies aimed atrevitalizing the economy in order to create an enablingenvironment for investment and economic growth. Wehave also put in place an appropriate legal framework for8the protection of foreign investments and repatriation oflegitimate profits.Other measures that we have taken include a vigorousanti-corruption campaign; the promotion of transparencyand accountability in public life; the abolition of decreesand regulations which hindered the inflow of foreigninvestment; the generation of opportunities for employmentand income savings for domestic investment; and theprivatization of key State enterprises  such as electricity andtelecommunications; legislation and other measures toredress obvious cases of neglect and injustice done to ethnicminorities  particularly in the oil-producing areas of theNiger delta region  and to deal with the problems of theenvironment; investigation of past human rights violations with a view to promoting and protecting fundamentalfreedoms; and strengthening the capacity of the lawenforcement agencies to promote law and order  as well assecurity  and to deal more effectively with the problem ofdrug trafficking.Africa is indeed proud and glad to see the end of thiscentury coincide with the total elimination of colonialismand the twin menace of constitutionalized racism in thesouthern part of the continent. The United Nations deservesour warm commendation for the crucial role it has playedin this process.Let me also pay tribute to the thousands who lost theirlives in the struggle for freedom so that those of us alivetoday can proudly say we have the destiny of the continentin our own hands. It is  however  a destiny which posesmonumental challenges in our effort to improve the qualityof life on our continent. We must strive to alleviate thegrinding poverty and material deprivation that haspersistently remained a feature of our political freedom.As we approach the dawn of the new millennium  thedefining feature of our increasingly interdependent world isaccelerated globalization  and the liberalization ofproduction  trade  investment and finance.But for us in the developing world the reality today isquite different. Globalization  in its various manifestations is already experiencing a troubled relationship with theimperatives of development.It is rather tragic that Africa  the least developed of allthe regions and the least able to cope with external shocks has borne the brunt of the adverse effects of globalizationof the world economy. There are grim statistics whichindicate that the well-known marginalization of theAfrican continent has turned into delinkage from theglobal scene.Since 1992 Africa's exports and imports as a shareof world trade has declined from 4 per cent to 2 per cent.Africa's development is presently straitjacketed by a debtburden of around $300 billion. The continent isexperiencing import compression  weak productivity andlow output. On the average  factories that are stilloperating do so at less than 30 per cent of installedcapacity. Africa's share in total foreign direct investmentinflows to developing countries has dropped from 11 percent in the late 1980s to less than 5 per cent in the secondhalf of the 1990s  and to a meagre 1.2 per cent of worldforeign direct investment flows in 1997.This trend has continued  despite the efforts ofAfrican countries to implement far-reaching economicreforms and maintain macroeconomic stability particularly through the introduction of a more open andbusiness-friendly investment environment  and theprovision of incentives to attract foreign investment.In the quest for a better and fairer management of aglobalized world economy  it is now incumbent upon usto direct our searchlight on the unsatisfactory evolution ofthe multilateral trading system. In participating in thehistoric Uruguay Round of Multilateral TradeNegotiations that ushered in the new rules-based tradingsystem  the developing world had hoped that the newtrading regime would enhance their trading fortunes facilitate their effective integration into the worldeconomy  and arrest their marginalization from the globaltrading system.Unfortunately  however  the vast majority ofdeveloping countries  particularly in Africa  have so farbeen unable to reap the benefits arising from theirmembership of the World Trade Organization. Africa'strade prospects continue to be hampered by the non-implementation of the special and differential provisionsthat favour developing countries  and the increasinglyprotectionist measures that are being imposed against theirexport products. Besides  the paucity of technical andfinancial assistance that would have enabled thedeveloping countries to take advantage of the limitedmarket access opportunities that exist continues to deepenAfrica's marginalization in the globalized world economy.Without doubt  the biggest monetary and financialobstacle confronting developing countries is the chronic9debt overhang. According to United Nations figures  theglobal debt of all developing countries stood at $567 billionin 1980  and $1.4 trillion in 1992. In that 12-year periodthese countries made foreign debt payments totalling $1.6trillion. Now  out of the 41 countries which the World Bankdescribes as heavily indebted poor countries  33 are Africancountries  a group that some believe is richly deserving ofits own special category: severely indebted low-incomecountries. Today in sub-Saharan Africa every man  womanand child owes $357. This is a continent where millionslive in abject poverty  earning around $100 a year  or 27cents a day. Some African countries now spend as much asfour times on servicing debts as they do on education andhealth care. Some countries spend up to 40 per cent of theirnational budgets on debt servicing. Furthermore  it isreliably estimated that for every dollar given in officialdevelopment aid  $3 go back to the rich countries in debtservice payments.I make bold to assert that calling for debt relief fordeveloping countries is not a plea for charity  but is anurgent matter of social and economic justice. It has to beredressed if there is to be peace and stability in the twenty-first century. Therefore  we propose definitive debtcancellation  not just reduction or rescheduling of the debtservice regime. Eligibility should be limited to unpayabledebts  which for Africa means the bulk of the $300 billioncurrent stock of debt. There should be debt remission thatis not predicated on the institutionally harsh conditionalitiesof structural adjustment programmes. There should berecognition on both sides of the bargaining table thatlenders and borrowers share joint responsibilities for debtsincurred in circumstances that are morally questionable inthe first place. Debt cancellation should benefit ordinarypeople.Nigerians rightly expect democracy to yieldperceptible dividends in their lives. Our Administration will however  find the task of meeting this expectation virtuallyimpossible without substantial reduction of our debt burden especially as we call on the same citizens to make thesacrifices that are implicit in the recent measures aimed atprudent management of our national economy.I wish to invite the attention of the Assembly to therelated issue of illegal capital flight from Africa. It is anopen secret that much of Africa's wealth has beenillegally siphoned out of the continent by corrupt regimesand unpatriotic individuals working in collaboration withforeign partners. Nigeria and many African countrieswould be able to pay off large portions of their debts ifonly they could recover some of the capital illegallystashed abroad. We thus believe that now is the time tocollectively deal with this issue.In this regard  Nigeria calls for a concerted effort bythe international community  through an internationalconvention  for the repatriation to Africa and thedeveloping world of all capital illegally transferred fromthese countries. Such an international convention oragreement is legally feasible and morally sustainable. Itwill compel participating banks to disclose the source ofthe illegal accounts they hold  repatriate them to thecountries of rightful ownership and subject the guiltyparties to the full weight of national and international law.It is with a heavy heart that I raise the issue of theHIV/AIDS pandemic throughout Africa. Our continent isbearing the brunt of this terrible disease that now killsaround 2 million Africans annually  thus officiallyovertaking malaria as Africa's number one primary health-care problem. This situation is even more frightening inthat it has now left 6 million children orphaned in theeastern and southern parts of Africa. In West Africa thedisease has been spreading just as rapidly. Unlike malaria which is location specific  HIV/AIDS knows neitherclimatic nor regional boundaries. Global cooperation is animperative if we are to succeed in dealing with thisscourge.Among the immediate challenges facing Nigeria andAfrica today is resolving the many conflicts raging on thecontinent. Today  as many as 19 sub-Saharan countriesare engaged in armed conflicts. The negative impact ofthese conflicts in human  social  economic andenvironmental destruction does not need to be describedhere. Nigeria and indeed the entire West Africansubregion have devoted considerable human  material political and diplomatic resources to the resolution ofthese crises in the subregion  starting with Liberia andsubsequently Sierra Leone and Guinea-Bissau. Similarly efforts are being made in the Democratic Republic of theCongo and in Angola towards peaceful resolution of theirconflicts.10Indeed  African leaders at the recent summit of theOrganization of African Unity (OAU) in Algiers  and at theurging of the Nigerian delegation  agreed to declare nextyear as the Year of Peace  Security and Stability in Africa.By this declaration  we have dedicated ourselves to makingthe year 2000 the year when Africans direct all their effortsinto effectively eliminating armed conflicts on theircontinent. We hope to build on the fresh momentum forpeace occasioned by the budding peace initiatives in Congo Sierra Leone  Eritrea  Ethiopia and Angola.We are also agreed on the overriding need to upholdcodes of decency  ethics and minimum standards ofdecorum among African Governments and their leadership.Gone are the days when the OAU turned a blind eye to theexcesses and abuses of power by member Governments.Forceful and undemocratic changes of Governments will nolonger be overlooked or tolerated. We intend to condemnin absolute terms all violations of these codes and toostracize their perpetrators. It is our duty and moralresponsibility to treat our citizens decently and humanely.My country has always believed that the threat tointernational peace and security from any corner of theglobe should be considered a threat to the peace andsecurity of the world as a whole. While the maintenance ofinternational peace and security remains the primaryresponsibility of the Security Council  the Charter provisionfor the complementary role of regional and subregionalgroups has also proved to be critical to the maintenance ofpeace at the regional and global levels. The establishmentof the Economic Community of West African States(ECOWAS) Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) is a cleartestimony of our commitment to subregional peace. As therecord shows  ECOMOG succeeded in putting an end to theLiberian war in 1997  reinstating the democratically electedPresident of Sierra Leone in 1998  and bringing about thecurrent Peace Agreement for Sierra Leone signed in Loméin July 1999.The time has come  however  for the Security Councilto assume its full responsibility  specifically in Sierra Leoneand other conflict flash points in Africa. For too long  theburden of preserving international peace and security inWest Africa has been left almost entirely to a few States inour subregion. The non-implementation of the PeaceAgreement and Nigeria's continual burden in Sierra Leoneis unacceptably draining Nigeria financially. For oureconomy to take off  this bleeding has to stop. The UnitedNations needs to do more in providing logistics andfinancial support to assist regional peacekeeping and peace-building efforts  as well as enhancing the welfare ofrefugees worldwide without discrimination.My delegation believes that it has never been thepurpose of the United Nations Organization to prescribedemocracy and change for its members and yet makelittle or no progress in the democratization of its ownorgans  such as the Security Council. My delegationaccordingly urges the General Assembly  during thissession  to conclude deliberations and reach agreement onthe modalities for the reform and expansion of theSecurity Council so that the Millennium Assembly willadopt them next year — and not later.How can the United Nations continue to perpetuateand justify a situation where Africa is the only continentwithout a permanent seat in the Security Council? Inorder to promote reform and democratization of theSecurity Council  Africa  with 53 Member States  shouldbe allocated at least two permanent seats —commensurate not only with the continent's size andpopulation  but with its track record also of contributingto the maintenance of international peace and security.I wish to reaffirm our belief that the United Nationsis the most universal body ever designed for collectivelyresolving humankind's common problems. OurOrganization has come a long way since its establishment54 years ago. Although created in a different era andunder different circumstances  and in spite of numerousconstraints  the United Nations has continuously sought toadapt itself to the changes in the international politicalarena. It has been able to accomplish this to some degree but it remains an institution whose working methods procedures and administrative structure have in manyrespects become outdated.Yet the world as we know it today without theUnited Nations would be inconceivable. For it has cometo symbolize hope for a better and more secure future formany  particularly in the developing areas of the world.Indeed  though a majority of our countries could not bemembers when the Organization was created  we aretoday its strongest defenders and advocates of the idealsfor which it stands. We believe in the family of nations and within that family the strong members have theresponsibility to protect and strengthen the weakermembers.At the close of the twentieth century and thebeginning of the third millennium  there is a need forstock-taking and for proper assessment of theimplementation of previous resolutions emanating especiallyfrom the major world summits and conferences which tookplace in this decade. Such an effort would bring us closerto the realization of the purposes and objectives of ourOrganization. In this regard  I stand before the Assemblyand pledge Nigeria's continued contributions and positivecommitment to the ideals of the Charter of the UnitedNations."
"124",5153,"NIC",54,1999,"Please acceptour warmest congratulations  Sir  on your well-deservedelection to the presidency of the General Assembly. Wewish you every success  which we are convinced will beforthcoming in your leadership and in the outcome ofthese proceedings.We also wish to convey heartfelt recognition to theForeign Minister of Uruguay  Mr. Didier Opertti  who sobrilliantly presided over the last session  a matter oflegitimate pride for Latin America.I should also like to convey a message of warmsupport and tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. KofiAnnan  for the fruitful work that he has been pursuingwith commendable energy and great vision  to reform strengthen and invigorate the complex and sensitiveUnited Nations system within a comprehensive contextwhile looking towards a new century and a newmillennium that will require all kinds of revisions adjustments and adaptations.5We share and support the initiatives that  among theirother objectives  are designed to make it easier for countriesthat are relatively underdeveloped and engaged in the tasksof economic and social development and combating povertyto achieve the very difficult and painful transition to a newglobalized world with a market economy devoid of barriers where rapidly developing patterns are being imposed withregard to competitiveness  advanced technology  models ofculture and consumption  social and computercommunications  sophisticated systems of financing and avast array of other tools and processes. All of thishighlights with stark reality the great differences andimbalances that exist at the international level.Those are the major challenges that we must confronttogether  using political will  hard work  education  training the transfer of science and technology  investment openness  production  trade  superior skills and activepolicies of participation to ensure that shared benefits willflow out to profit all  fairly and equitably  at every layer ofthe social fabric of our peoples.It would be unfortunate and very dangerous if thesegreat opportunities offered by globalization were nottranslated into positive  innovative and tangible changes toeffectively promote  in the shortest time possible  asubstantive improvement in standards of living  expectationsand opportunities for the vast majority  within theframework of sustainable development.On occasions  at certain stages in these transitionalprocesses  disturbances have occurred as a result oftroubling inequalities between various sectors and socialactors. Such differences exist and are growing both inadvanced countries and in developing countries  which arein the majority.We should anticipate  reverse  mitigate or  at least temper with realism and sensitivity such negative effects which owe their origins and characteristics to specificcircumstances and considerations that were assumed to betemporary. A failure to take adequate measures could putat risk budding democracies  which are precariouslybuilding stability and the institutional structures of law andgovernance.In this primordial task  the participation of citizens andof civil society  in its various forms  is vital. We must makeuse of a constant  open and pluralist dialogue to facilitatechanges of course  reform and consensus  which willcontribute to the strengthening of democratic systems andmake it possible for people to live together in peace.In this context  this year the two main politicalforces in Nicaragua  which together won a little morethan 90 per cent of the vote in the most recent elections have produced an agenda that will be submitted to theNational Assembly for consideration  so that it can bedebated with complete transparency in the nation'sprincipal forum.Furthermore  beginning in 1997  my country begana difficult reorganization and structural adjustmentprocess  taking the decision to deal responsibly with thehigh political and social costs of laying down the stablefoundations for dynamic national reconstruction andtransformation.We must put behind us once and for all the painfulperiod in our history  which lasted more than a decadeand was characterized by destruction and violence in acycle of fratricidal confrontation and which  fortunately has now been overcome. That historical interval left us ina very weakened state that was reflected in thedeterioration of all human development indicators  thegeneral collapse of economic activities and a giganticexternal debt whose unbearable and overwhelming weightwas borne on the impoverished shoulders of the long-suffering people of Nicaragua.This situation of extreme fragility made it necessary from the beginning of my Government  to formulate aneconomic policy that would gain the support andcredibility of the international community and themultilateral organizations. This led to an agreement withthe International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a newenhanced structural adjustment facility (ESAF)programme which  after its projected completion withina period of three years  would have made it possible forus to qualify for the concessionary plan of the HeavilyIndebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative.While we were occupied with the many sacrificesthat we had to make during that tough process of healing reorganization and reconstruction  a little less than a yearago we suffered the ill-timed and devastating effects ofHurricane Mitch  which severely affected our efforts work and plans. However  generous internationalcooperation mitigated to some extent the suffering  theirreparable loss of thousands of lives of our compatriotsand the widespread destruction of basic infrastructures property  natural resources and the environment.The damage inflicted by the tragedy also creatednew challenges and opportunities  encouraging us to6redouble our efforts and to seek the necessary unity  joiningtogether without distinction  in efforts to move forward. InMay this year  therefore  the Consultative Group for theReconstruction and Transformation of Central America convened initially by the Inter-American Development Bankin Washington in December 1998 as a result of HurricaneMitch  met in Stockholm and offered Nicaragua phasedglobal support amounting to $2.5 billion for a period ofthree to four years. This significant support will enable usto give urgent attention to social programmes andinfrastructure projects  with priority being given to thesensitive areas of health  education and housing  as well asto plans for assistance to small producers and agriculturalworkers affected by Hurricane Mitch.The disciplined implementation of the ESAFprogramme and the new set of circumstances ushered in bythe hurricane  led last week to an event that happilycoincided with the celebration of our nationalindependence — a resolution of the International MonetaryFund by which it associated itself with the resolutionpreviously adopted by the World Bank  thereby opening thedoor to Nicaragua for its inclusion in the HIPC initiative.This extraordinary event  which will mean a substantialpardoning of our external debt  was a historical watershed opening up a fresh chapter in our new independence  whichwill transform the economic and social reality of ourpeople  making it possible for them to enter the newcentury relieved of an unbearable burden inherited from thepast  with renewed vigour  great potential and realisticoptimism for a substantially improved quality of life forNicaraguans.We should like to reiterate our eternal gratitude to theinternational community and to the multilateralorganizations that have smoothed our path  enabling us tomarch together  shoulder to shoulder  towards a promisingfuture.Nicaragua appreciates the sustained efforts of theUnited Nations system. Those efforts have been expandedduring this decade to incorporate the great challenges andmain issues confronting the country  including issuesconcerning governance and local development  thepromotion of a healthy environment  the reduction ofextreme poverty  greater access by disadvantagedpopulations to public services  the modernization ofdemocratic institutions  the promotion of populationpolicies  the process of demobilization of ex-combatantsand the search for solutions to property conflicts throughdialogue. Likewise  we acknowledge the special effortsmade by the United Nations with regard to strengtheningthe administration of justice and the penal system  and tothe creation of the Inter-American Court of HumanRights. It is also appropriate to emphasize its support forthe prevention of natural disasters through overcomingsocio-economic and environmental vulnerabilities.Working together with the United Nations  we havegradually been fulfilling the commitments of the EarthSummit of 1992 during my term of office in order tocreate the National Council on Sustainable Development(CONADES). We have also been making stridesconcerning the Conventions on Biodiversity and ClimateChange  as well as participating in the major projects ofthe Meso-American Biological Corridor and theBiological Corridor of the Atlantic.At the same time  we have been making a consistenteffort in the demining of the border zone with Honduras where the last war left more than one 100 thousand anti-personnel landmines in the ground. We thank theinternational community  and especially the Organizationof American States and the United Nations  for thesignificant resources they placed at our disposal toundertake this delicate task.As signatory to the Treaty of Tlatelolco  weunreservedly support initiatives aimed at establishing aninternational mechanism for the total elimination ofnuclear weapons. We are also conscious of the gravemenace to the security of our nations and to peace posedby arms trafficking  including trafficking in small arms which cause the greatest suffering and loss of human life.We join in the world crusade to combat poverty whether that poverty is generalized  focused or in diversestrata of our societies. We are pleased that the last year ofthis century has been designated the International Year ofOlder Persons  who seem increasingly to suffer frompoverty and neglect. We likewise reaffirm ourcommitment to ensure social protection  along with theredoubling of efforts to make more effective both thepersonal security of citizens and the security of theirproperty.I would not want to end without inviting theAssembly to reflect on the hopes of the 22 millionpersons who  at the threshold of the twenty-first century continue to lack representation at the United Nations —the Organization of universal vocation  where the mostimportant decisions having to do with international policyare taken. The Republic of China — founded in 1912 andwhich has been an independent sovereign nation that7maintains official diplomatic relations with Nicaragua andthe other republics of Central America and othercountries — continues  lamentably and unjustly  to beunrepresented in the Organization. This prevents it fromparticipating in the work of the Organization and frommaking its valuable contribution in the various areas ofinternational cooperation  despite the fact that it hascomplied fully with the provisions of the Charter of theUnited Nations  which was signed at San Francisco.My Government has supported and will continue tosupport  with firm and fraternal solidarity  theunquestionable right of the Republic of China — whoseexercise of full sovereignty over Taiwan for half a centuryis an unquestionable reality — to be incorporated as a fullmember of the United Nations. We therefore call anew onthe international community not to deny that friendly progressive and exemplary people the right to be recognizedand allowed effective participation in this great forum thereby affording it the well deserved opportunity ofsharing with us its vocation for peace and its generousspirit of international cooperation."
"125",5200,"NLD",54,1999,"Speaking to theAssembly one year ago  I demonstrated that the Kingdomof the Netherlands qualified for membership on the SecurityCouncil. During the elections two weeks later asubstantial majority of this body supported us  and we aregrateful to them. As the Netherlands has served on theCouncil now for more than eight months and is currentlyits President  I think it is only fair for me to report to allthe Assembly members who showed confidence in us. Iwish to speak on Africa  on the Council  and on shiftingour attention from the State to the people.Most of today's armed conflicts are in Africa. FromSierra Leone to Eritrea and from the Sudan to the Congoand Angola  Africans are fighting Africans. Fightingaccompanies all the plights and pains that are known tohumankind  from poverty and pestilence to famine  fearand flight.Africa is not a land of troubles alone but also ofhappiness  not a continent only of catastrophe but alsoone of hope. The sheer mass of Africa's problemsobscures our view of its promise and its potential. In thepublic mind  an unbalanced view of Africa prevails. Thatview  I feel  needs to be corrected: we need to ridourselves of prejudice and think positively. Instead ofdejection  we need a deepening commitment. Africa despite the odds  has come a long way already.Personally  I was struck  at the opening of the generaldebate  by the sight of an African President of SouthAfrica  speaking in front of an African President of theGeneral Assembly  seated next to an African Secretary-General. It is hard to miss the symbolism of that image.It is one image the founding fathers of this Organizationmight not have had  one image that by itself already holdsa promise for the future: the next century may well be thecentury of Africa.The Secretary-General  in his report on Africa  hasmade a link between conflict and prosperity. For thisreason  my delegation felt that members of the Councilwould be well advised to consider this question in somedepth  and  in our presidential capacity  we have thereforeorganized an open-ended public debate  to be held nextweek  in which the Secretary-General will brief us on thestate of Africa.Let me now turn to the question of how to improvethe effectiveness of the United Nations  and the SecurityCouncil in particular  in coping with crisis situations. Onmany occasions in its lifetime  I have admired the UnitedNations for the way it intervened in emergencies. Inparticular  the Office of the United Nations HighCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)  the UnitedNations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the World Food21Programme have enjoyed a long tradition of being in theforefront. Many non-governmental organizations  such asMédecins Sans Frontières and the International Committeeof the Red Cross (ICRC)  have stood there right besidethem.Let me pose a number of questions on how theSecurity Council performs in emergencies. First  do we notsee a crisis coming before it breaks? Do we not have earlywarning systems? Of course we do. The call forestablishing early warning systems has been around fordecades; it has become a buzzword used whenever theinadequacies of the United Nations response machinery arebeing discussed. But in fact  given the level ofcommunications in modern times  policy planners haveplenty of information to be forward-looking. It is not thefailing of an early warning system that can be put to blame nor the lack of data. It is  instead  the failure of decision-makers to react adequately.Second question: Why  then  does the United Nationsreact inadequately? Do we not have preventive diplomacy?We do  not only in terms of bilateral efforts of majornations or of the good offices of the Secretary-General; theCouncil itself can be proactive. The recent mission itdispatched to East Timor is a good example of how theCouncil can be more assertive. Missions are an existinginstrument that is  in my opinion  in need of an upgrade. Inaddition  the open debate on East Timor in the Council  atwhich everybody spoke plain language  fuelled themounting international pressure on Indonesia.Third question: Is the problem  perhaps  the veto? Iknow this is a popular view  but it is also a tenuous one.True  we cannot ignore the veto as a factor in the Council'sperformance record. True again  in our discussions onreform of the Council  the veto is a core element we willone day have to come to grips with. Yet  the problem is anintractable one. Tampering with the veto may itself createthe risk of dissolution for the United Nations as a whole.The very fact that a single Member State can hold theentire world community in limbo in the face of harrowingbrutalities is affecting the stature and moral force of theOrganization. That  too  may be spawning dissolution. Itmay be argued that  without the veto  the United Nationswould not have survived its first 50 years. It may also beargued that  with the veto  the United Nations will notsurvive the next 50 years. In the first 50 years  theOrganization might have fallen apart if the veto had notbeen there as a buffer against the push and pull of a bipolarworld. In the second 50 years  in a multipolar world repeated inaction by the Security Council would result inparallel actions outside the United Nations framework pushing the Organization  as a custodian of world peace more and more into the margins.No matter when or how the debate on the veto willend  this Assembly should meanwhile call on those whopossess it to exercise maximum restraint  particularly inhumanitarian emergencies. I concur with my Germancolleague that the permanent five are duty-bound toexplain to the world why they are blocking action by theCouncil. Moreover  we might consider a situation inwhich a negative vote by a permanent member does notin itself block action.Fourth question: Does the problem lie in the politicalwill  perhaps? To simply say that the political will hasbeen lacking is not only a platitude  but also a very partialview of reality. For part of that reality is that images ofall the conflicts on the globe travel around the world withthe speed of light. The media broadcasts live images ofhuman suffering. Understandably  such images rouseindignation and horror among millions of viewers. Theyexpect instant action. As people are being better informedabout current events  their level of expectation rises. Thegap between what is expected and what is possiblebecomes more visible and more acute. By contrast diplomacy comes with tools that may be old andrespectable  but are also solid and slow. And so  while ina globalizing world human misery is disseminated alongthe electronic highway  diplomacy today still proceedsalong a footpath.This leaves me with the central question: Why is theCouncil often running behind reality? How can we makeit catch up with developments?As I look back at the general debate this week  Ithink that we are getting very close to identifying themain obstacle. I know that many interventions share acommon element — they compare the notion ofsovereignty to that of human rights and territorial integrityto humanitarian intervention. To be sure  the question perse is as old as the Charter itself. What is new is thevenue. I cannot recall that Foreign Ministers at theGeneral Assembly have talked about this question at anylength before. I strongly believe that this issue was boundto surface at this level at some point or another.In 1945  the architects of this Organization includedtwo contradictory premises: respect for territorial integrityand political independence  on the one hand; and respectfor human rights and fundamental freedoms  on the other.22The world in those days was ruled by Governments alone and so the United Nations was made up of States. At thetime  the notion of human rights  although grafted onto theCharter with much conviction  was essentially at odds withclassical legal thinking. In a way  the tension became evenmore pronounced at the adoption of the UniversalDeclaration. After all  for half a millennium the notion ofsovereignty had served as the basis of our global politicalarchitecture. As the idea was enshrined in the Charter  thefounding fathers believed it would stand the test of time.By contrast  the idea of human rights in internationalrelations was  for the most part  a post-war novelty. Indeed the Charter is much more specific on respect forsovereignty than on respect for human rights.Since 1945  the world has witnessed a gradual shift inthat balance  making respect for human rights more andmore mandatory and respect for sovereignty less and lessstringent. An elaborate body of international human rightslaw has come to counterbalance the dictates of paragraphs4 and 7 of Article 2. Today  human rights have come tooutrank sovereignty. Increasingly  the prevailinginterpretation of the Charter is that it aims to protectindividual human beings  not to protect those who abusethem. Today  we regard it as a generally accepted rule ofinternational law that no sovereign State has the right toterrorize its own citizens. Indeed  if the Charter were to bewritten today  there would be an Article 2.8 saying thatnothing contained in the present Charter shall authorizeMember States to terrorize their own people.Let me go one step further. The blurring of theboundaries of sovereignty does not stop at human rights. Inthe future  the notion of sovereignty is going to be testedbeyond that. Think of decrepit nuclear installations  massivedamage to the environment  lack of water or massmarketing of narcotic drugs. Can responsible statesmenafford to wait until the damage is actually done? Or do theyin fact have a duty to prevent it? These are questionswhich  at some point  the Security Council will have to beinvolved in.It is not the lack of early warning  not the absence ofpreventive diplomacy  not the veto per se. I call on everypolitician and every diplomat in this room to accept that thetraditional balance between sovereignty and human rights between the State and the people is shifting. I amconvinced this is one of the paramount issues of our time.Momentum is building  and we should seize it. Let us putthe issue squarely on the agenda: the agenda of theUnited Nations  of the Council and of our parliaments athome. I ask the legal community to keep a keen eye onthe groundswell that is developing and to be innovative inits thinking. We politicians have a vast responsibilityhere. We should steer the discussion towards the peopleinstead of the State.The Security Council should be stronger  not weaker.It should be a credible leader in the maintenance ofpeace. In order to be credible  it must be consistent  swiftand proactive. It must show courage  drive and vision. Itmust keep changing with the times. It must put peopleover politics. That is a tall order. Its decision on EastTimor gave us hope for the Council's potential."
"126",5245,"NOR",54,1999,"The tragedy in East Timorshows us again that when war and violence erupt the worldcommunity turns to the United Nations for the resolution ofconflicts and the preservation of peace. We welcome theSecurity Council’s action to endorse the multinational forcethat is now moving in to bring security and aid to thepeople of East Timor. Norway will contribute withpersonnel and financing.We look to the United Nations for hope and solutions and for the protection of human dignity and shared valuesin a world of injustice and conflict. That is why the UnitedNations is indispensable. And that is why we  the MemberStates  must make use of the United Nations for peace anddevelopment  whether it be in East Timor  in Kosovo or inthe Congo. In preparing for the Millennium Assembly  letus together address global challenges in a new spirit  witha new sense of purpose.I would like to congratulate you  Sir  upon yourelection to the presidency of the General Assembly.Norway looks forward to working with you. I also warmlywelcome the three new Members of the United Nations  theRepublic of Kiribati  the Republic of Nauru and theKingdom of Tonga.At the end of this century  globalization presents uswith political and moral dilemmas. There has beenremarkable progress in technological innovation and ineconomic and democratic development. But at the sametime  while the rich are getting richer  the poor are gettingpoorer. Poverty and pollution  violent conflict and violationsof human rights continue to haunt far too many peoplearound the world. Combatting poverty  preventing conflicts promoting human rights: these are the main challenges atthe top of our common global agenda for the next century.We must ensure that globalization benefits all  not just thefew  and we must protect the environment.To achieve this  we need to strengthen the multilateralsystem. We must support the United Nations and its workfor global peace  security and sustainable development. Wemust put the United Nations first.Together we possess the knowledge and the resourcesneeded to eradicate poverty. But still  1.3 billion people livein extreme poverty. This is unacceptable  morally andpolitically. It is an injustice and an obstacle to economicand democratic progress. For all Member States  in theNorth and in the South alike  changing this situation mustbe our priority. And the United Nations must be theprimary instrument. There is no alternative. Let us builda global partnership aimed at eradicating poverty. Let usstart by mobilizing the political will and the financialresources needed to meet the target of cutting globalpoverty in half by the year 2015. It is a matter of politicalwill; it can be done now.National Governments have the primaryresponsibility for sustainable development and for meetingsocial needs. They must promote and protect the rule oflaw  human rights and democracy. They must fightcorruption and pursue sound economic policies. There isno doubt that development assistance is most effective incountries where government is based on the principles ofgood governance.The international community must also do more tocreate economic opportunities for the developing world.The following steps would have a major impact.First  we need to increase the transfer of officialdevelopment assistance from the North to the South.Norway has been well above the United Nations target fortwo decades. We intend to increase our developmentassistance further  up to 1 per cent of gross domesticproduct.Secondly  we need partnerships that enable nationalGovernments to lead the way and determine their ownpriorities. The private sector and business interests mustbe brought into the development process  as theSecretary-General has underlined.Thirdly  development assistance and debt relief mustgo hand in hand. Creditor nations must now give thepoorest members of the world community a new start.Norway’s national debt-relief strategy is particularlydesigned for this purpose. We also support the momentumcreated by the Group of Seven States to give highlyindebted poor countries substantial debt relief.Fourthly  the entry of developing countries into theglobal market must be facilitated  not obstructed. Thismust be focused on during the new round of multilateraltrade negotiations in the World Trade Organization.In recent years  we have seen an increase in civilwars  often with an additional element of foreigninvolvement. The root causes can often be linked toethnic tension  as well as to inequity in the distribution of17resources - economic  social  natural and political. Duringthe 1990s  the activities of the United Nations have beenmore extensive than ever before in the conduct ofpreventive diplomacy  in the deployment of peacekeepingforces and in the provision of humanitarian aid to thevictims of war.But at the same time  there are critics who claim thatthe United Nations has failed. Of course  many things couldhave been done better  but we must not forget the manysuccesses and we must not forget that it is we  the MemberStates  who are responsible for giving the United Nationsthe mandates to act and the money and the means tosucceed. Let us not make the United Nations a scapegoatfor our own shortcomings. Instead  we must make sure thatthe Security Council can fulfil its primary function ininternational peace and security. We must act in accordancewith the United Nations Charter and international law. Wemust put the United Nations first.This means enhancing the capacity of the UnitedNations for conflict prevention  crisis management andlong-term development. All Members must meet theirfinancial obligations to our world Organization and itspeace operations. Creating common security is not cost-free. In particular  it is the duty of the most powerfulmembers of the United Nations to set an example forothers.The United Nations must develop further itscooperation with regional organizations. As Chairman-in-Office of the Organization for Security and Cooperationin Europe (OSCE)  Norway has been working to buildcloser relations with the United Nations system. We needconstructive interaction between all international governmental and non-governmental organizations involvedin peacekeeping and post-conflict work in Europe andelsewhere.Kosovo is a tragic example of the complex conflictsthat we have seen in recent years. Building lasting peacethere will require the concerted efforts of all actorsinvolved: the United Nations  the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization (NATO)  the OSCE  the European Union andothers. Our immediate concern is to secure a safeenvironment for all the people of Kosovo through a credibleinternational presence.We must promote integration between all the peoplesand nations of south-eastern Europe. We must includeeveryone and isolate no one. This summer  at the SarajevoSummit  we pledged to make the Stability Pact a keyelement of our efforts to ensure that democracy  peaceand prosperity become firmly rooted all over south-eastern Europe.At the same time  our efforts to build peace in theBalkans must not be made at the expense of the poorestpeople elsewhere in the world. They should not pay thebill.The United Nations and its agencies play a centralrole in providing emergency aid to victims of wareverywhere. Humanitarian assistance should becomplemented by efforts to promote reconciliation democratic development and respect for human rights.Compliance with international instruments is neededto protect civilians in armed conflicts. We welcome theSecretary-General’s report and the Security Councilresolution adopted last week. At the forthcoming RedCross Conference in Geneva  we must generate themomentum needed to secure the protection aspects ofinternational humanitarian law. The early entry into forceof the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Courtwill be a vital contribution to the rule of law.We must focus on human security  taking individualsand their communities as our point of departure.Combating poverty is crucial to human security.The proliferation of anti-personnel mines and smallarms and the use of child soldiers pose a threat to humansecurity. They inflict deep wounds on society andindividuals. Recently  in Russia  we have seen howterrorism strikes innocent people. We strongly condemnsuch terrorist acts  for which there can be no excuse.International efforts to deal with these serious issues mustbe intensified.We must vigorously pursue nuclear disarmament andnon-proliferation. The principles and objectives set outunder the process established by the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) must behonoured. The early entry into force of theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and ratificationof the Treaty on Further Reduction and Limitation ofStrategic Offensive Arms (START II) are crucialpriorities. So are START III negotiations to lower nucleararsenals  and so is a cut-off treaty. These are all crucialelements in a global agenda for sustainable humandevelopment.18When natural disasters strike  the poor are the mostvulnerable. The recent tragedies in Turkey and Greeceaffected us deeply. Increasingly  man’s pressure on theenvironment seems to be a contributing factor to naturaldisasters  which often cause extensive destruction indeveloping countries. We must step up our efforts to assistdeveloping nations so that they become less vulnerable. Inthis regard  Norway attaches great importance to the specialsession of the General Assembly  to be convened nextweek  on the Barbados Programme of Action for theSustainable Development of Small Island DevelopingStates.Conflict prevention  humanitarian aid and developmentefforts must go hand in hand. We must deal with theunderlying causes of poverty and need  not just thesymptoms. Political and economic reform should run inparallel with humanitarian aid. We must close the gapbetween relief and long-term development. This calls forcloser cooperation and the involvement of the whole UnitedNations family as well as the Bretton Woods institutions.The Secretary-General’s reports on Africa (A/52/871-S/1998/318 and A/54/133-E/1999/79) clearly demonstratethat poverty  underdevelopment and violent conflicts areclosely linked: we cannot address one without addressingthe others.The Secretary-General has pointed to the need for acomprehensive approach and better coordination of conflictprevention and post-conflict peace-building in the UnitedNations system. The Secretariat has already embarked onthe process of implementation and follow-up. Norway fullysupports the Secretary-General’s initiative and is ready toprovide practical and financial support for this importantendeavour. We will set aside $3 million for the Secretariatto use for this purpose.The situation in Africa gives rise to concern. Armedconflicts are hampering development in many countries.AIDS is also taking a heavy toll. There are positive signstoo: we are witnessing the growth of democracy  transfersto civilian rule  free elections and economic and politicalreforms in many African countries. But poverty remains amajor challenge.Norway remains firmly committed to peace anddevelopment in Africa. We will work with our Africanpartners for conflict management and developmentcooperation. We will work with the United Nations  theOrganization of African Unity  subregional bodies such asthe Southern African Development Community  theEconomic Community of West African States  and others to achieve our common aims.The Middle East peace process is at a criticaljuncture. The vision that the parties had in 1993  whenthe Oslo Accords were signed  is still valid. The fact thatIsrael and the Palestinians have now embarked on finalstatus talks is a very positive sign. Strong support for thepeace process must remain a high priority for theinternational community. We must work together with theparties to achieve a just  lasting and comprehensive peacethat will guarantee prosperity and security for allinvolved.The world needs an effective multilateral machineryto cope with common challenges. For the next century we must  first  build a stronger United Nations in thefields of global security and economic and socialprogress; secondly  use the United Nations as the primaryinstrument for peace and development  democracy andhuman rights; and thirdly  tackle poverty and conflictprevention as the main challenges at the top of ouragenda. It is up to us  the Member States  to make thispossible. Together  we must make it happen."

It defines andprotects the basic tenets of parliamentary democracy inNepal  and it identifies the purposes and principles of theCharter of the United Nations as the fundamental plank ofthe foreign policy of the country. Standing today beforethis Assembly of nations  I wish to reaffirm Nepal'scommitment to the principles and objectives of the UnitedNations and to share  in brief  our hopes  aspirations andviews.Last year we observed the fiftieth anniversary of theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights  a milestone inhuman history. The fiftieth anniversary of anotherhistorical milestone — the Geneva Conventions of1949 — this year provides the international communitywith another opportunity to reiterate its deepeningcommitment to democracy  human rights and improvedliving conditions for peoples. At the national level  weregard the protection and promotion of human rights as asine qua non for the all-round development of the people.Democracy and development  I believe  are two sides ofthe same coin  hard to guarantee and secure except in a13state of peace and stability under a system of participatorygood governance.Nepal is a nation with a young democratic setup andan ever-deepening commitment to human rights and the all-round development of the people  who are beset with thenumerous unique and onerous challenges characteristic ofa small land-locked and least developed country withdifficult Himalayan and mountainous terrains and thegreatest of contemporary problems — poverty. At no pointin history have we witnessed poverty eating up sosystematically the spiritual richness of peoples in manycountries  including Nepal — the land of the Buddha.Nepal's development efforts are driven by anoverriding objective of poverty eradication throughemployment and income generation  social mobilization andthe strengthening of social capital within a democraticvalues-based system. The country has almost unlimitedpotential for hydropower development and tourism  and wehave created legislative conditions for the participation offoreign investors in these sectors as well as in other tradeand services-generating sectors in Nepal. Our commitmentto sustainable development has been translated into severalmeasures aimed at the preservation of the environment andecological balance  including the earmarking of a large partof our land area for the development of wildlife parks andnature reserves. I want at this stage to reiterate ourcommitment to the development of Lumbini — thebirthplace of the Buddha — as an enduring peacemonument  a holy shrine for pilgrimage and one of theworld's greatest cultural heritages.I am disheartened that despite several world summits conferences and international commitments  absolutepoverty  hunger  disease  illiteracy and hopelessness shouldstill remain the lot of the bulk of the world's population.One billion adults  the majority of them women  cannotread or write. Almost a billion people are underfed andmalnourished  and a similar number have no access to cleanwater  shelter or health care. Many millions die before theyreach the age of 40.Equally threatening is the ever-widening gap betweenthe haves and the have-nots. The conclusion of this year'sHuman Development Report is the unbelievable polarizationbetween peoples and countries  which the United NationsDevelopment Programme (UNDP) characterized asgrotesque and dangerous. The one fifth of the world'spopulation in the highest-income countries commands 86per cent of world gross domestic product and 82 per centof world export markets  while the bottom fifth  in thepoorest countries has just 1 per cent of both categories.How long can the world go on like this  with a small partof its people living in freedom and prosperity while thelarger segment is living in fetters under abject conditions before calamity engulfs us all?A few years ago  at the request of the heads of Stateor Government of the South Asian Association forRegional Cooperation  I undertook the task of chairing theIndependent South Asian Commission on PovertyAlleviation as part of a regional endeavour to work outregional strategies and programmes of action for theeradication of poverty from South Asia. My ownexperience as Chairman of that Commission leads me tothe inescapable conclusion that the goal of povertyeradication requires  among other things  sustainedpolitical will and commitment of the highest order  anintegrated and coordinated approach and decisive nationalactions  with the participation of all  including grass-rootsorganizations and civil society  backed by enhancedinternational development cooperation.But the fast-dwindling official developmentassistance flows and ever-increasing resource constraintsof United Nations development agencies  such as theUnited Nations Development Programme  make our taskof poverty eradication and development harder and harderwith each passing year. This is particularly true in thecase of least developed and landlocked countries such asNepal. While we deeply appreciate the help of ourdevelopment partners  we urge developed countries  whichare undoubtedly in a position to do so  to generouslyincrease the volume of their official developmentassistance so as to attain the target set by this Assembly.Reallocation of official development assistance in favourof the less developed countries is another area whichdeserves attention.As we are a democratic nation  women — whomake up half of every country's population — are thebackbone of Nepalese society. We can hardly remainoblivious to the urgent need for their empowerment andadvancement. We have made legislative arrangements toguarantee their participation in the national polity byreserving exclusively for them as many as 40 000 seats inthe local elected bodies. In the three general electionssince 1991  the number of women parliamentarians hassteadily gone up. But we are aiming for more. Theirliteracy rate is also improving. The Committee on theElimination of Discrimination against Women  to whichNepal recently presented its country report  hasacknowledged the progress made in raising the status of14women in general and in increasing understanding ofgender issues and the human rights of women among theNepalese population. We know we have to do a lot more and I am personally committed to this.We are equally committed to the protection andpromotion of the rights of the child as well as the rightsand interests of other vulnerable and disadvantaged sectionsof society. In short  we have before us a large agenda fornation-building  for the consolidation of gains in democracyand human rights and for living up to our internationalcommitment to peace  cooperation and development in theworld. We are dealing with the agenda with a sense ofpurpose and commitment  although there are severalobvious difficulties  including the economic  social environmental and political problems created by 100 000refugees from Bhutan. We seek the continued support andunderstanding of the international community in thecreation of an environment conducive to the resolution ofthis problem through bilateral negotiations. We also seek itssupport for their sustenance until they are repatriated.I wish to place on record our appreciation of andgratitude to Secretary-General Kofi Annan  the world'sforemost public servant  for his efforts and successes indefusing tensions around the world and solving manyseemingly intractable problems  such as those of Libya andthe popular consultation in East Timor. I am impressed withhis impassioned call for the transition from a culture ofreaction to a culture of prevention in the United Nations.He has drawn our attention to the benefits and risksprovided by globalization and to the need for strengthenedinternational cooperation to offset the vulnerability of manycountries  particularly the least developed and landlockedones  and the marginalization of Africa.We have noted his emphasis on the maintenance ofinternational peace and security as the primaryresponsibility of the Security Council. We thank him alsofor his dedication to comprehensive United Nations reformand for his package of reform proposals. Reform is acontinuing process. It will be neither meaningful norcomplete unless we arrive at a ratifiable global consensuson the functioning and composition of a reformed SecurityCouncil. The statement of the Foreign Ministers of the fivepermanent members that any attempt to restrict or curtailtheir veto rights would not be conducive to the reformprocess is a matter of deep disappointment. Nepal supportsthe common position evolved at the Durban Summit of theNon-Aligned Movement on the question of SecurityCouncil reform. We are also firm in our view that noreform measure should curtail the authority of the GeneralAssembly  which is the nearest thing to a worldparliament.The United Nations cannot continue to functioneffectively without a fair and sound financial base.Assessed dues must be paid in full and on time.Peacekeeping is a unique and most useful instrument forthe United Nations in the maintenance of internationalpeace and security. Nepal has participated in UnitedNations peacekeeping for over 40 years in all parts of theworld. Some 35 000 of our troops and 800 of our policehave served with many peacekeeping operations  39having been martyred and several more wounded in theline of duty. It is the firm policy of Nepal not only tomaintain but also to increase our contribution to UnitedNations peacekeeping.It is disappointing that for three years in a row theprincipal United Nations forum for disarmamentnegotiations  the Conference on Disarmament  has notbeen able to agree on an agenda of work. Some importantarms control and disarmament measures have beenadopted without reference to the Conference onDisarmament. As host to the United Nations RegionalCentre for Peace and Disarmament in Asia and thePacific  Nepal's commitment to general and completedisarmament  including total nuclear disarmament remains undiluted.In the summer months of this year  South Asiawitnessed a flare-up between two of our close neighbours.Disquieting because it broke a peace that had lasted fornearly three decades  it also exposed the myth fostered ina bygone era that countries possessing nuclear weaponswould not go to conventional war against each other. Therisk of an accidental nuclear war engulfing other countrieswas magnified by the close proximity of the twocountries. Leaving aside the causes of that flare-up  Iwould like to commend the Prime Ministers and theGovernments of the two countries for their restraint  goodsense and wisdom in containing the conflict anddisplaying a high degree of responsibility to their peoples to the rest of South Asia and to the peoples of the entireworld. May I take this opportunity once again to appealto the Prime Ministers of those two countries to resumetheir dialogue  begun in Lahore last February.Nepal welcomes the Sharm el-Sheikh accordbetween Prime Minister Barak and President Arafat as anirreversible step forward in the Middle East peaceprocess. It opens the way to a just  lasting andcomprehensive peace. We hope  for the sake of peace 15that negotiations between Syria and Israel and Lebanon willsoon resume in accordance with relevant United Nationsresolutions.Let me conclude with a brief mention of the SouthAsian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) which consists of the seven countries of the region representing one fifth of humanity. We are united in acommon effort to enhance the quality of life of all ourpeoples. I am looking forward to hosting the next summitmeeting of heads of State or Government of the SouthAsian region in two months' time at Kathmandu. Ourimportant agenda will deal with such issues as free tradeand a SAARC social charter. We will also be signing aregional convention on combatting the crime of traffickingin women and children. This will be another landmark inthe work of SAARC  a regional association dedicated topeace and cooperation in South Asia."
"128",5355,"NZL",54,1999,"First let mecongratulate you  Sir  the Foreign Minister of Namibia  onyour election as President of the General Assembly thissession. I certainly recall my meetings with you and yourPresident in your country last year.I also wish to welcome three new Members to theUnited Nations — Kiribati  Nauru and Tonga — all veryclose friends and neighbours of New Zealand. I trust thatthe faith they have shown in the United Nations will befulfilled in the years ahead  and we certainly look forwardto working closely with them.When addressing this Assembly  especially as arepresentative of a smaller Member State  one is reminded10that the United Nations must remain the fundamental pointof reference in international relations. Indeed  that is a truththat all Member States have an obligation to acknowledge.Furthermore  it is of course sound policy for all who needand rely on the rule of international law in place oflawlessness. And it is particularly important to restate it atthis time. The United Nations collective securityframework  which is one of the fundamental elements ofthe Charter together with cooperation on economic andsocial problems and promoting respect for human rights has perhaps never been more severely tested than in thislast year of the twentieth century.Armed conflicts  many of them internal and ethnicallybased  have continued to present a serious moral challengeto the international community  and they are likely to do sofor the foreseeable future. The Security Council's responseto these problems does not always increase our confidencein the Organization.The Secretary-General's remarks in his statement at thebeginning of this debate about the need to reconcileuniversal legitimacy with effectiveness in defence of humanrights were most timely. New Zealanders place a very gooddeal of faith in the United Nations: when we see on ourtelevision screens evidence of violence and inhumanityagainst the vulnerable  and we are told that the SecurityCouncil cannot reach an agreement on collective action  weare left worried  and wondering whether our trust in theSecurity Council is well placed. A Council which loses thetrust of the people is a Council which will becomeirrelevant.I want to talk to the Assembly about two extremelyserious challenges the Council faced this year: Kosovo andEast Timor. Both highlight the importance of the actions ofthe Security Council.In East Timor  following President Habibie'scourageous offer to the East Timorese people  prompt andeffective action was taken by the Security Council to set intrain the popular consultation process. The ballot —undertaken in extremely difficult circumstances by highlycommitted United Nations workers  international and local all of whom deserve acclaim — produced a resounding andincontrovertible expression of the will of the East Timoresepeople. This was the essential basis for the internationalcommunity's response since the ballot.Post-ballot events were appallingly tragic and haverightly provoked a strong reaction around the world. Thedispatch to Jakarta and Dili of the Security Council missionled by Ambassador Andjaba of Namibia was a key stepin addressing this grievous situation. The efforts made byrepresentatives of all countries present at the time of themeeting of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Councilleaders in Auckland  joined by the British ForeignSecretary representing the European Union  reinforced theSecretary-General's urging that Indonesia accept the offerof international help. The assistance could not have cometoo early.New Zealand is proud to be a contributor  alongsidethe forces of other nations from the region and fromfurther afield  and under the leadership of Australia  to theUnited-Nations-authorized multinational force that is nowoperating in East Timor. Our soldiers from New Zealandare on the ground in East Timor right now. We areprepared also to take part in the United Nationspeacekeeping operation foreshadowed in Security Councilresolution 1264 (1999)  and we urge the Council to takeprompt action — next week would not be too soon — toestablish this operation  which would be part of theUnited Nations transitional administration in East Timor.We are contributing to the efforts of humanitarianagencies to provide support to the hundreds of thousandsof ordinary people who have been displaced in EastTimor; those currently in West Timor should be speedilyrepatriated. New Zealand has added its voice to those whobelieve that the people responsible for crimes againsthumanity in East Timor should be brought to account.The overriding objective must now be to ensure therealization of the 30 August ballot outcome and EastTimor's transition to independence. It is clear that inlaying the basis for East Timor's future  the UnitedNations will be the indispensable organization.It is inevitable that comparison will be madebetween East Timor and Kosovo. In Kosovo the worldsaw a grave humanitarian crisis with the Security Councilunable to act. In New Zealand's view  collective action totry to put a stop to a humanitarian disaster involvinggenocide and the most serious crimes against humanityshould never be held hostage to the veto. When it is  theSecurity Council loses its credibility and its relevance. Ineed hardly reiterate New Zealand's continuing oppositionto the veto  voiced since San Francisco in 1945. While itis understandable that national interests will influencehow members vote in the Security Council  we havenever accepted that some narrow interests of any one offive countries should be able to override the will of aclear majority of members.The adoption by the Security Council of its resolution1244 (1999) of 10 June  which provided the internationalcommunity's endorsement of a political solution to theKosovo conflict  was certainly greeted with much relief inmost quarters  including in New Zealand. The resolutionwas proof  if any were needed  that the United Nationsremains  as in East Timor  the indispensable organization.And as the Secretary-General observed at the time  it alsogave strong legal underpinning to the task ahead  a taskwhich  he noted  is daunting. The contribution of thededicated United Nations and specialized agency staff whoare now working with little fanfare in Kosovo certainlydeserves our recognition.Both Kosovo and East Timor have put the SecurityCouncil to the test. In their own ways they have challengedthis Organization's capacity to take effective action in theface of severe difficulties. The world must never againwitness horrors such as those in Kosovo whilst the SecurityCouncil remains impotent. The case of East Timor showsthat the Security Council can react swiftly and effectivelywhen the will exists. For this to be possible  the fullestcommitment to support those humanitarian ideals that arethe basis of the United Nations Charter remains essential.The adoption of the Rome Statute of the InternationalCriminal Court shows such a commitment. Theinternational community must now deliver on its promise with signature and early ratification of that Statute.As we know  the United Nations also has before it thepressing demands of the various and sometimes interrelatedconflicts throughout Africa with  of course  their appallinghumanitarian consequences. Who can put out of their mindsthe images of atrocities we have seen from Sierra Leone for instance? Yet the Council's response has until veryrecently been low-level. Once again  the credibility of theSecurity Council depends in large part on its being seen aseven-handed in its attention to crises  wherever they mayoccur  and whether the Cable News Network (CNN) isthere or not.For much of the past year we have seen the Councilvirtually paralysed on the important question ofdisarmaming Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction. In themeantime  this potentially very serious threat to the securityof the region remains unresolved. The reason again hasbeen the very sharp divisions among the permanentmembers  which by virtue of the veto power can block anyaction. This situation remains unacceptable.New Zealand's awareness of the importance of therole of collective action has also been heightened byrecent events in our own immediate region. Here  theUnited Nations demonstrated its ability to respond to thedifferent demands of supporting the regionally inspiredpeace process on the island of Bougainville  part of PapuaNew Guinea  and of assessing the needs created bydisruptions to the population on Guadalcanal in theSolomon Islands.The United Nations must be capable of respondingeffectively. Small and vulnerable nations in particularneed confidence in the United Nations  as it may be theironly hope in times of trouble. I am very concernedtherefore by the apparent trend away from financing newpeacekeeping operations by means of assessedcontributions and an increasing reliance instead onvoluntary funding. This  of course  poses a threat to thecollective responsibility that is at the heart of thisOrganization. In practical terms it is likely to mean thatthose regions which fail to attract donor support will notreceive the response they are entitled to as Members ofthe United Nations. This trend must be urgently reversed;all operations must be put on an equal financial footingby means of assessed contributions.In addition  as I noted here last year  the largestcontributor's arrears to the peacekeeping and regularbudgets continue to cast a long shadow over theOrganization. Outstanding dues and very slow paymentsto troop contributors affect us all  and can severelyconstrain the ability of countries to contribute to pressingpeacekeeping needs. We call again on those MemberStates who are in dereliction of their obligations to makepayment on time  in full and  of course  withoutconditions.Reform of the Security Council remains one of themost important items on our agenda. Further usefulprogress has been made this year. While the issue ofenlargement continues to be complex  we believe therehas existed for some time wide agreement on the equallyimportant areas of reforming the Council's workingmethods and the curtailing of the veto. The linkagebetween the veto and enlargement was also explicitlyrecognized in this year's report to the General Assemblyof the Open-ended Working Group on the Question ofEquitable Representation on and Increase in theMembership of the Security Council and Other MattersRelated to the Security Council.12As for the task of providing more equitablerepresentation  I am not convinced that we will be able toachieve this while the regional groups in the United Nationscontinue to reflect the political geography of the 1960s.Quite different and far more sensible arrangements havebeen adopted in other multilateral forums  as  for example in the context of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-BanTreaty (CTBT). The present system here in New Yorklocks in very great disparities in representation. Smallcountries that can make an excellent contribution are oftenseverely disadvantaged  especially where a political blocinside a regional group may coordinate closely on electoralmatters.I would  therefore  wish to add my voice to those ofthe Prime Ministers of Fiji and Samoa and the ForeignMinisters of Papua New Guinea and Australia  who spokeearlier in this debate on the need for reconfiguration.Reconfiguration of the regional groups may well hold oneof the keys to an overall package on Security Councilreform.New Zealand still looks forward to the day when wecan join a regional group here in New York which includesour Asia-Pacific neighbours. In the meantime  we willcontinue to build linkages in our region and developing themany areas of our common understanding.One of the great strengths of the General Assembly isthe equal status ascribed to each Member. All Members large or small  rich or poor  have a right to be heard here.Each has a single vote. While we must all from time totime temper our own national ambitions in the interests ofreaching a common understanding  we respect the point ofview of each individual member. The special session onsmall island developing States over the last few days wasa very good opportunity to do just that. New Zealand isfirmly committed to assisting the small island developingStates SIDS in the spirit of common purpose andpartnership envisaged at Barbados five years ago. We arevery pleased that all participants in the special session havereaffirmed their commitment to implement fully theBarbados Programme of Action.In April New Zealand  represented by my colleague the Honourable Simon Upton  had the privilege of chairingthe seventh session of the Commission on SustainableDevelopment. We were pleased to be able to helpreinvigorate debate and build consensus around the need fora more coordinated approach to stewardship of the world'soceans and the need to recognise  in an ongoing way  thespecial characteristics and needs of small islanddeveloping States.The Commission faces the great challenge ofpursuing the implementation of Agenda 21. Two othergreat challenges we as a world face on the environmentalfront are the threat of global climate change  caused atleast in part by human-induced emissions of greenhousegases  and the need to maintain an approach tointernational trade and environmental issues which isbased on sound scientific analysis and agreed rules andprocedures. It is vitally important that we should continueto act in concert to face these international challenges.International cooperation in addressing economic social and humanitarian problems is  and always will be one of the cornerstones of the United Nations Charter.The substantial decline in official development assistanceflows over the last decade is of great concern to manyMember States. In this connection  I am concerned tonote that the core resources of the United NationsDevelopment Programme (UNDP) have been greatlyreduced over the past five years  to the point where itsuniversality is seriously threatened. I applaud the effortsthe new administrator is making to turn this situationaround and to put UNDP on a more secure footing  withmore clearly defined priorities.Private capital flows to developing countries haveshown major increases. There is a tendency  however  forsuch investment to be heavily concentrated on a fewcountries where investment prospects seem brightest.Many developing countries remain vulnerable and can beall too easily marginalized. Official developmentassistance continues to be an essential tool to help buildthe capacity of countries in sectors such as education sothat they can benefit from the unstoppable phenomenonof globalization. It is certainly a matter of particular pridefor me  as New Zealand's Foreign Minister  to haveoverseen increases in New Zealand's official developmentassistance funding effort — up by some 40 per cent sincethe time of the Rio Summit in 1992.I welcome  also  the positive steps that are beingtaken on the financing for development and debt-reliefinitiatives. It is vital that we continue the dialogue amongMember States and with the international financialinstitutions to ensure a sounder basis for meeting thechallenges of international development.Last year I referred to the important role the UnitedNations has to play in shaping the moves towards13globalization and the opening up of opportunities for worldtrade. Later this year  in Seattle  we expect to launch a newround of multilateral trade negotiations. This will clearlyprovide a forum in which to advance trade liberalizationand the rules-based trading system. The role of thesenegotiations in promoting the development prospects of allcountries and in fostering the integration of least developedcountries into the global system will be a particular focus.Deliberations in this Organization at many levels will helpto advance our people's understanding of the value andpurpose of the global trade agenda and their ability tobenefit from it. However  I would emphasise theimportance of major trading partners in continuing to playa leadership role. The adoption of trade restrictions anddistortions by wealthy economies does much to erode theirmoral authority in the broader debate.New Zealand continues to attach the utmostimportance to seeing all countries work together to bringabout a world free of nuclear weapons. For this reason wewere a cosponsor last year of the so-called New Agendaresolution  which called for faster progress towards theelimination of nuclear weapons. The cosponsors will bepresenting this moderate resolution again this year  and weurge all countries to look carefully at it.The Conference on Facilitating the Entry into Force ofthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty will meet inVienna in a week's time. I would urge all those countrieswhich have not ratified the Treaty to do so  so that it canenter into force without further delay.Strengthening the United Nations remains an importantgoal for New Zealand. I take this opportunity to commendthe forward-looking management reforms introduced by theSecretary-General. They have greatly improved policycoordination among senior management and have producedpositive  tangible effects throughout the Secretariat.Improving the way the Organization plans its programmesand expenditures is a critical next step  where work isalready under way. There must be a greater focus on resultswhen budgets are prepared in order to promote the best useof the resources of the Organization  and in turn the bestreturn for Member States.This year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the GenevaConventions  and last year we commemorated the fiftiethanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Events over the past 12 months have shown that challengesto the values and principles embodied in the UniversalDeclaration remain as daunting as ever. In thisinterdependent world in which we live  New Zealandcontinues to see the United Nations as central tointernational efforts to work together to protect andpromote  for all our people  those fundamental humanrights and freedoms to which we are committed under theUniversal Declaration.Next year the United Nations will host themillennium summit. This symbolic event will provide anexcellent opportunity for Member States to reaffirm theircommitment to the ideals of this great Organization.Recognizing the frailties of our collective performance todate  and the critical importance of finding workablesolutions for the future  I call on all Member States totake the opportunities offered by the millennium summitto enter into open and constructive dialogue and step intothe next millennium with an unequivocal recommitmentto the visionary principles enshrined in the Charter.It is nine years since I first addressed this body in1991 as the Foreign Minister of New Zealand. For theUnited Nations  and particularly the Security Council  ithas been a tumultuous period. After the cold war thenumber of problems multiplied; the world's expectationsof what the United Nations could deliver were raisedabove the possible; and the solutions demanded requireddetermination  resolve  tact  understanding andimagination. The demands on the United Nations will notlessen  but each year must see a better performance thanin the past. However  as this may well be the laststatement I make to this body  I want to thank all UnitedNations officials and peacekeepers everywhere: those Ihave met here in New York; in Cambodia and inSomalia; in Mozambique; in Bosnia  Croatia and Albania;in Papua New Guinea and  of course  now in East Timor.I thank them for their continuing  often unsung and heroicefforts. They are much appreciated."
"129",5400,"OMN",54,1999,"﻿Mr. President  it gives me great pleasure at the outset to offeryou my warmest congratulations on your election asPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourthsession. Your election to this high post reflects the valuethe international community attaches to the role played byyour friendly country. We are confident of the friendlyrelations between our two countries. We also know thatyour expertise and commitment to international issues willenrich the discussions of this session of the GeneralAssembly. My delegation pledges its full cooperation andsupport to you to make your presidency a success.I also take this opportunity to express my warmestthanks and appreciation to our colleague Mr. DidierOpertti  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Uruguay  for hisgreat efforts as President at the previous session. I wouldalso like to salute Secretary-General Kofi Annan for hisgreat efforts in enhancing the administration andperformance of the United Nations and its mission toserve international peace and security.The Sultanate of Oman welcomes the admission atthis session of the Republic of Kiribati  the Republic ofNauru and the Kingdom of Tonga to the membership ofthe United Nations. We are confident that theirmembership will reflect positively on the United Nationsand will help us further consolidate our efforts as aninternational community to achieve the progress andprosperity we all aspire to  in a way that promotes the23noble goals for which this important international forumwas created.The unanimous decision to hold the millenniumsummit during the fifty-fifth session of the GeneralAssembly is clear proof of the importance of that lastsummit of this century. This is an essential and importantstep that will enable our leaders to issue a declaration thatmay be considered a plan of action. That declaration couldreformulate a new concept for economic success anddevelopment for all peoples.As we approach the next century with confidence  wemust focus our attention on restructuring the work ofinternational organizations in order to enrich and developthe work of the United Nations and its relevant agencies such as the World Bank  the International Monetary Fundand other international and regional institutions  so that theyare able to function effectively for the future welfare andprosperity of humanity.We recognize the importance of the effectivemanagement of these international institutions through thegenerous and special financial and technical contributionsof developed nations and institutions. These contributionsmust always meet the needs and priorities of reforming theeconomies of developing nations  which form the largestpart of the global market and which provide a large part ofthe world's natural resources and raw materials. Thedevelopment of these economies will undoubtedly bringabout a more stable world economy.We call for the establishment of balanced rules andregulations between the developed nations of the North andthe developing nations of the South in order to effect aqualitative change in their relations. While bold change andreal sacrifices are needed to restructure the economies ofthe developing world so that they can meet therequirements of the global free market  there is a greaterneed for the economically developed nations to take boldand decisive steps in cancelling more debts  restructuringthe costs of manufactured goods and establishing a neweconomic mechanism to provide loans and to re-regulatethe size of industries and lower global rates of inflation. Wealso call for the establishment of an international reportingsystem that will draw up periodic regional plans to enableall regions to achieve the economic advances necessary toovercome their economic difficulties.We look with admiration and great interest to theEuropean Union's experience of economic integration as apilot project that aims at serving the economic prosperity ofthe peoples of the European continent  the integration oftheir cultural heritage and the elimination of their socialand political differences. Indeed  such a qualitative leapin European society would undoubtedly contribute to amore stable and balanced world  especially if it werebased on moral norms of international transparency. Itwould surely be an excellent model which could beemulated in other parts of the world in keeping with thespecific requirements of these regions and in a way thatresponds to their traditions  their heritage and theparticularities of their culture. We believe that economicdevelopment and trade are a bridge for communicationbetween civilizations.Therefore  negotiations leading to the admission ofthe rest of the developing countries to the World TradeOrganization (WTO) must be fair and just. Suchnegotiations must recognize the importance of givingdeveloping nations an opportunity to see their trade andtheir infant industries grow and an opportunity also toconsolidate their competitive edge  in the context of ageneral commitment to the free market principles ofsupply and demand.Our world needs to rid the large markets of thedeveloped nations of dumping policies  market constraintsand other obstacles to free trade: free trade should not bea way to destroy the economies of the developingcountries. A realistic balance between the interests of thedeveloped and the developing nations should be the aimof the forthcoming WTO Ministerial-level conference inSeattle. Such a balance should draw on the world'sexperience since the end of the cold war and theemergence of the new world order.In the present international climate  the UnitedNations bears the huge responsibility of creating the rightsocial and economic circumstances for better  moreharmonious coexistence and for peace and stability. Thatresponsibility creates an urgent need for more consultationand dialogue between Member States  especially at theregional level  towards restructuring United Nationsbodies and expanding the membership of the SecurityCouncil.We must encourage serious  realistic and flexiblethinking about the Council's role  responsibilities andmandates in the service of international peace and securityto enable the Council to be more receptive andrealistically responsive to cultural and educationalpluralism and to the various political schools of thoughtin human society. Expanded membership would also24enhance the role of the new forces that are currentlybecoming more important through their influence oninternational events.Since the end of the cold war  we have heard the callsfor democracy  free trade and the free market economy asways of establishing greater harmony among humankind.We believe that the road towards this objective must beginwith dialogue between civilizations on an internationalplatform of cultural norms  and based on the soundprinciples of balanced political relations  interests andmutual benefit in keeping with the needs of every cultureand civilization. The new ideas emanating from thisdialogue could be used as a new moral gateway to relationsbetween people in the new millennium and as a bond oftrust and fruitful cooperation between all cultures andcivilizations. It would certainly create a new and commonharmony in all patterns of life.We support this human endeavour in the context ofGeneral Assembly resolution 53/22 proclaiming the year2001 as the United Nations Year of Dialogue amongCivilizations. We support any regional or multilateral actionthat seeks to solve the political disputes still outstandingbetween States  especially between neighbouring States which share common interests along with a commonborder.The Sultanate of Oman believes deeply in theimportance of quiet and meaningful dialogue between allStates and between all parties. Oman works alongside itsbrothers in the Gulf Cooperation Council to consolidate apositive climate and extend our common ground withneighbouring countries. We do so in order to ensure thatcommon principles and rules are adopted and accepted toform the basis for bilateral or collective dialogue onoutstanding problems.Iraq is still subject to the sanctions regime imposed bythe Security Council in the aftermath of Iraq's invasion ofKuwait in August 1990. Although the Security Council through the United Nations Special Commission(UNSCOM)  has tried to enforce its resolutions on thedestruction of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction over thelast eight years  it has not yet been able to agree on aunanimous policy towards Iraq. Consequently  the Iraqipeople are suffering greatly from the continuing sanctions.Although the oil—for—food programme has beenimplemented  it cannot satisfactorily meet the basichumanitarian needs of the Iraqi people. In this context many international organizations and agencies working inthe field of health and other humanitarian services haveexpressed their fears about the dire effects that threatenthe future of the Iraqi people.The Council of the League of Arab States  in itsconsultative session of 24 January 1999  adopted a callfor the economic sanctions imposed on Iraq to be lifted.The Council appealed to all Arab Governments to makeevery possible effort towards this end through cooperationwith the United Nations.The Sultanate of Oman emphasizes the importanceof lifting the economic sanctions in order to end thesuffering of the Iraqi people. We call on the SecurityCouncil to put its differences aside and adopt a positiveand unanimous policy towards Iraq. We also call on theIraqi Government to cooperate positively and fully withthe United Nations in implementing the remainingresolutions  especially those relating to Kuwaiti prisonersof war and missing persons.The early signs of the long-awaited peace in theMiddle East  to which its people have long aspired fortunately coincide with the end of the century and thebeginning of the third millennium. All parties  especiallythe Israeli Government  must take this opportunity towrite a new history based on coexistence and cooperationamong the peoples of the region  a region that so urgentlyneeds to enjoy the fruits of stability and development.The establishment of an independent PalestinianState will undoubtedly be an important pillar for theconclusion of a comprehensive and just peace in theMiddle East. It will also serve as a real tool for thedevelopment of cooperation and coexistence between theArab States and Israel.We call on the Israeli Government to respondquickly and implement the various obligations andagreements concluded since Madrid. We also call uponthe Israeli Government to implement Security Councilresolutions on Lebanon: resolutions 425 (1978) and 426(1978). We call upon Israel to resume negotiations on theSyrian track at the point where they left off and to makeevery effort to withdraw from occupied Syrian territory tothe established border of 4 June 1967.Mutual security requirements between the Arabs andIsraelis on both sides of the border are of primeimportance. The legitimacy of such requirements justifiesnegotiations on the basis of the principle of land forpeace. Israel must feel secure and comfortable about thegeneral Arab attitude towards peace.25Peace agreements signed with Egypt and Jordan haveoffered the clearest proof of the Arabs' commitment topeace and their absolute willingness to participate  alongwith Israel  in the establishment of a secure  peaceful anddeveloped Middle East. Arab positions across a range ofinternational activities and forums have demonstrated theseriousness of their desire to live in peace and security withIsrael.We are about to enter a new century. We feel hopefuland ambitious for a future in which the security andstability of human life will improve. However  a number ofconflicts and hotbeds of tension continue to cause concernfor the international community.In Africa  conflicts and confrontations among countriesremain the biggest source of suffering for the Africanpeople. Therefore  the United Nations is required to exertgreater efforts in support of the Organization of AfricanUnity in its endeavour to mediate in the various conflicts including those between Ethiopia and Eritrea  in the GreatLakes region  in West Africa and in Somalia. We hope thatAfrica will thus be able to free itself from the vestiges ofthe past and enter a new era of freedom  economicdevelopment and security for its people and for the worldat large.The giant continent  Asia  continues to offer the mostdynamic current force for human development. Despite thesuccesses achieved by the Asian people in various spheresof life  unrest  civil wars and sources of instability are stillabundant.The Muslim Asian country of Afghanistan still suffersfrom deep and complex internal conflicts. Therefore wesincerely hope that all the Afghan leaders will takeadvantage of past lessons and use the world community'sdesire to help them to end their crisis and to give theAfghan people the opportunity to heal their painful wounds.In East Asia  we call on all parties in the Koreanpeninsula to work towards ending the conflict and theachievement of peace. Then the Korean people in Northand South Korea can express their desire for a secure andpeaceful future.We have a deep sense of pain for the human tragedyin the Balkans. Reckless policies led to instability  a hugewaste of resources  the flight of defenceless people and lossof life and destruction of property. We are thankful for thetimely intervention by the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization in Kosovo  especially after the failure to carryout the Rambouillet Agreement  to put an end to the painand suffering of the provinces' inhabitants.As we praise the human role assumed by the worldcommunity in helping the displaced and the refugees inthe Balkans  we hope that those great efforts will continueand thus conclude this noble task. We also appreciate theefforts of the Secretary-General to restore peace andstability to the region.The world still faces the nuclear threat as a result ofthe proliferation of nuclear weapons technology and theefforts of many States outside what is known as thenuclear club to acquire the technology for this dreadfulweapon. The States seeking these weapons still feelthreatened politically and militarily and are worried abouttheir security  sovereignty and future capabilities.Making a realistic and careful assessment of thissituation would definitely lead us to conclude that theremust have been fundamental and legitimate reasons whysuch countries would choose to spend large amounts ofmoney to secure such weapons at a time when theseassets could have been spent on the economic and socialdevelopment of their people. Among the principal andlegitimate reasons for this choice is that the major Stateswhich already possess nuclear weapons and technologydid not do enough to guarantee the non-proliferation ofthis technology.The phenomenon that the major Powers alone canshape choices about peace and war in areas of thedeveloping world may be one of the strongest reasons forthe sudden eruption of conflagrations in such areas.Therefore nuclear States  especially the permanentmembers of the Security Council  should undertake thenecessary measures that will guarantee the security ofnon-nuclear States and deter the use or threat of use ofnuclear weapons. The United Nations  through theSecurity Council  must adopt binding resolutions inaccordance with the Charter to protect the world from thethreat of nuclear weapons and other weapons of massdestruction. The arms control conference which is stilldebating secondary issues of technical dimensions musttherefore seek to reach positive conclusions as soon aspossible.At the last session we expressed our concern overwhat had befallen the economies of the Asian countries.We also expressed our faith in the ability of thesecountries to overcome the economic crisis and the crashthat hit the financial markets.26Today we witness an encouraging recovery in theAsian economies — a result of the determination of thesecountries  especially the States of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)  to protect their economiesthrough exemplary solidarity.We would like to applaud the important role played bythose States which provided financial assistance. We paytribute to the role played by the world financial institutions especially the World Bank and the International MonetaryFund. They halted the danger of deterioration in the worldeconomy and restored confidence in Asian markets.However  these two institutions should review theirconditions for providing loans to developing nations to helptheir economies. In most cases  these conditions fail toachieve their planned and targeted goals primarily becauseof the enormous social and political problems which theycreate.The Earth Summit for the environment anddevelopment  held in Rio de Janeiro  Brazil in 1992  set anagenda for the twenty-first century that is now viewed asthe basis upon which international partnership andcollective responsibility can work to put an end to poverty hunger  ill health and the deterioration of ecosystems  andto achieve sustainable development the only way forhumanity to ensure progress and prosperity for present andfuture generations.My country takes a comprehensive view ofenvironmental issues. We believe that the protection of theenvironment is a responsibility for everyone to share. Inthis context  my country devotes a great segment of itsresources to continuing to implement the Rio agenda andeffective and objective participation in environmental anddevelopment forums on many international  regional andnational levels. We also continue to enact and updateenvironmental laws in order to assure adaptation to the beststandards of environmental protection against the dangersof pollution and to guarantee the implementation of theinternational and regional environmental agreements thatmy country has signed.My country looks forward to joining the World TradeOrganization (WTO) soon. We hope to participate in thework of the Organization as a fully fledged member and toplay our role effectively. We thank all our trade partnerswhich have expressed encouragement and understanding forour application for membership. We are determined to workhand—in—hand with all members to consolidate themultilateral trade system and help it flourish.Next November the American city of Seattle willhost the third ministerial conference of the World TradeOrganization. The Sultanate of Oman attaches specialimportance to this conference because it will be a preludeto the new phase of multilateral trade negotiations  theMillennium Round  which should contribute to openingthe way for free and prosperous global trade.Probably one of the most important issues facingdeveloping countries is the issue of the liberalization ofthe service sector. Although its liberalization may havesome benefits for developing countries in terms of theflow of foreign capital  technology and modernadministrative and technical expertise  it will inevitably beaccompanied by huge challenges. This is particularly truein the light of open competition from the service sector indeveloped nations. Oman expects the world community totake measures that would help developing nations developtheir service sectors in order to guarantee them acomparable and viable share in the global servicesmarket.We appreciate the admirable international efforts andgood intentions to establish an original global legislativestructure as a basis for international relations in differentareas. However  we always return to the clear truth thatin the Charter of the United Nations are enshrined thepurposes and principles that we must all work to preservein the interest of the future security and wellbeing of allhumanity."
"130",5446,"PAK",54,1999,"Mr.President  it is an honour toaddress the General Assembly at this session  the last to beheld in the twentieth century.May I begin by welcoming the Republic of Kiribati the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga to thefamily of the United Nations. We look forward to workingclosely with the new Members.The twentieth century has been described as the age ofextremes. In this century  human civilization made quantumstrides in progress and prosperity. We discovered the oceandepths  travelled into the outer space and landed on themoon. We have witnessed the technological andinformation revolutions transforming the wide world into aglobal village.The twentieth century has also been a violent andtragic century. Millions died in the two world wars andhundreds of other conflicts. Millions perished as a resultof poverty and disease.This session of the Assembly offers an opportunityto identify the major global challenges which humankindis likely to confront in the next century. The UnitedNations should therefore devote the next year to evolvingways and means to address these challenges and topromoting an agreed approach next year at theMillennium Assembly.Peace remains the foremost challenge of our times.The end of the cold war and the triumph of the principlesof democracy and free markets created hope for the dawnof universal peace. This  unfortunately  turned out to beelusive. Instead  conflicts have continued to ravage theworld.Long-suppressed national aspirations  as well asfrustration with continuing inequity and deprivation  haveled to widespread violence and wars  between and withinStates. The several conflicts afflicting Africa  the Balkansand the Caucasus  as well as Palestine  Kashmir andAfghanistan  are painful reminders of the ascendance ofwar and the absence of peace.The United Nations  under the wise leadership ofSecretary-General Kofi Annan  has endeavoured to copewith these conflicts and crises. Unilateral approaches accompanying the centralization of global influence  havenot always ensured just and durable solutions to complexproblems rooted in history  religion  politics andeconomics in various parts of the world.In the final and decisive confrontation of the coldwar  1.5 million Afghans were killed  a million weremaimed  and a whole country was destroyed. Ten yearsafter the foreign intervention ended  almost 3 millionAfghan refugees are still in Pakistan and Iran. With noreconstruction and no development in that poor country the new generation knows nothing but war. Rehabilitationand reconstruction are the right of the valiant Afghanpeople. Economic development  accompanied byeducation and modernization  is the best way to endviolence  promote human rights and improve socialconditions in Afghanistan.Peace in Afghanistan is vital for Pakistan. Turmoilin Afghanistan creates turbulence on our frontier. Thepreservation of Afghanistan’s territorial integrity is pivotal28for peace and stability throughout Central Asia. Peace inAfghanistan will open vast opportunities for commerce andeconomic interaction between Central Asia and South Asiaand beyond.Pakistan has persisted in promoting peace andreconciliation in Afghanistan. We support the efforts of theUnited Nations as well as the “six plus two” process.Pakistan is constantly endeavouring to bring about an endto the fighting and promote reconciliation and politicalaccommodation between the Taliban Government and theNorthern Alliance.The world has welcomed the resumption of the peaceprocess in the Middle East. We earnestly hope that it willproceed smoothly to culminate in the establishment of a justand durable peace based on the fundamental rights of thePalestinian people  including their right to their own State and the withdrawal of Israel from the Syrian Golan Heightsand southern Lebanon.We are glad that the tension between morality andlegality has been overcome in Kosovo. We are happy theKosovar refugees have returned home. Yet Kosovo’stravails are not over. Pakistan will continue to support theefforts of the United Nations for peace in the Balkans.In East Timor  we trust that the human tragedy hasended  even as the United Nations peacekeepers arrivethere. I wish to pay tribute to Secretary-General KofiAnnan and my compatriot  Ambassador Jamsheed Marker who were greatly challenged in the process of fosteringfreedom in East Timor while safeguarding stability.We have learned valuable lessons from Kosovo andEast Timor: a people’s aspiration for freedom cannot besuppressed indefinitely; a free exercise of the right ofself-determination is indispensable for peace; self-determination can be best exercised in an environment freeof fear and coercion; and the United Nations is best placedto oversee the exercise of self-determination.These conclusions were already accepted for Kashmir50 years ago. The Security Council decided that the finaldisposition of the disputed State of Kashmir should bedetermined by its people  in a free and impartial plebisciteheld under United Nations auspices. India resiled from itsacceptance of this agreement and from its own pledge toallow the Kashmiri people to decide their own future. Onone pretext or another  it refused to implement theprovisions of Security Council resolutions.India's repression in Jammu and Kashmir has killedthousands of Kashmiris  forced hundreds of thousandsinto exile  led to three wars between Pakistan and Indiaand consigned the two countries to a relationship ofendemic conflict and mistrust. Pakistan and India can andmust overcome this unfortunate legacy.To this end  Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif  soon afterassuming office two and a half years ago  proposed theinitiation of a comprehensive  structured and sustaineddialogue between Pakistan and India to address Kashmir peace and security and other outstanding issues. Indiaagreed  after one year  to a dialogue on Kashmir. Toprovide political momentum to the bilateral dialogue Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif invited Prime MinisterVajpayee to visit Pakistan.At the Lahore summit  India and Pakistan committedthemselves to intensify their efforts to resolve Kashmir build mutual confidence and peace and pave the way forbroader cooperation. In Lahore  the Pakistan PrimeMinister urged his Indian counterpart to ease therepression in Kashmir. He cautioned that without progresson Kashmir political dynamics could compromise thegood intentions reflected in the Lahore Declaration. ButIndia displayed no desire to genuinely address  let aloneresolve  the Kashmir issue. Its cruel repression of theKashmiri people continued unabated.The Kargil crisis was a manifestation of the deepermalaise spawned by the unresolved Kashmir problem andIndia's escalating repression of the Kashmiri people. Indialaunched a massive military operation in Kargil andthreatened a wider conflict by mobilizing its armed forcesall along the Pakistan-India international border. Pakistanacted with restraint. We believed that war between twonuclear-armed neighbours must be avoided. We offeredimmediate de-escalation and negotiations to addressproblems along the Line of Control  including India'sviolation of this Line and occupation of Chorbatla Siachen and Qamar. Pakistan's efforts led to thedisengagement by the Kashmiri freedom fighters from theKargil heights and offered a renewed opportunity fornegotiation and dialogue.Pakistan is ready for the resumption of the Lahoreprocess with India. However  instead of reciprocatingPakistan's willingness to pursue negotiations  India hasposed preconditions for resuming the talks. The Indianmilitary deliberately shot down an unarmed Pakistannaval aircraft on a routine flight within our airspace killing 16 of our naval personnel — mostly young29trainees — in cold blood and without any warning. India isalso continuing hostilities along the Line of Control and hasrepeatedly launched attacks across the Line in severalsectors.Kashmir is not a dispute over land. It is about thedestiny of a people; it is about implementation of theresolutions of the Security Council; it is about respect forthe fundamental rights of the Kashmiri people  especiallytheir right to self-determination. The complete boycott bythe Kashmiris of the sham elections in Kashmir organizedby India earlier this month is clear testimony of their totalalienation from India. No settlement can be durable if it iscontrary to their wishes.The Kashmir issue cannot be frozen while its peopleare determined to secure their freedom; while the blood ofKashmiri martyrs is being shed by the bullets and bayonetsof the 700 000-strong Indian occupation force. Humanrights must be upheld not only in Kosovo and Timor  butalso in Kashmir. To make progress towards a settlement the world must demand that India take immediate steps tohalt its repression of the Kashmiri people.For this purpose  India must: first  stop the cruelcrackdowns against Kashmiri villages and urban areas;second  release the thousands of Kashmiris held indetention centres and jails; third  remove military picketsand troops stationed in Kashmiri towns and villages; fourth allow the presence of international human rightsorganizations in Kashmir; fifth  agree to the stationing ofimpartial human rights monitors in Jammu and Kashmir;sixth  entrust the International Committee of the Red Cross(ICRC) with a larger role in Kashmir  including theprovision of relief and help to the thousands of Kashmiriwidows and orphans; and  seventh  agree to a progressivereduction of the 700 000 Indian troops deployed inKashmir.The international community is increasingly consciousof the imperative for a just resolution of the Jammu andKashmir dispute. The risk of a wider conflict cannot becontemplated in a nuclear environment. Kashmir remains onthe Security Council's agenda. The Council's resolutionsremain to be implemented. The promise of self-determination made by the United Nations to the Kashmiripeople remains to be fulfilled. Therefore  while we will hopefully  soon resume bilateral talks with India  Pakistanwould welcome the association of the genuinerepresentatives of the Kashmiri people with the negotiatingprocess to promote a solution consistent with the UnitedNations Security Council resolutions.India's ambitions threaten to further propel ourregion towards a dangerous nuclear and conventionalarms race. For decades — even after India's first nuclearexplosion in 1974 — Pakistan sought to exclude nuclearweapons from South Asia. Ironically  the advocates ofnon-proliferation imposed discriminatory restrictionsagainst Pakistan while ignoring India's steadydevelopment of nuclear and missile capabilities. Last MayIndia put the final nail in the coffin of South Asian non-proliferation when it conducted five nuclear tests anddeclared itself a nuclear-weapon State. Its leaders thenproceeded to threaten Pakistan. Confronted by anaggressive nuclear India  Pakistan was obliged todemonstrate its nuclear capability and thus restore nucleardeterrence and strategic balance in South Asia. Theresponse of the major Powers  to penalize not only theoffender but also the victim  was patently unfair.Even after our tests  Pakistan proposed nuclearrestraint to India  consistent with our conviction thatnuclear deterrence can and should be maintained betweenPakistan and India at the lowest possible level. In ourseparate dialogues with the United States and India  weproposed a strategic restraint regime outlining specificmeasures for nuclear restraint and stabilization conventional arms balance and the resolution ofoutstanding disputes. Hopes for restraint have beenshattered by the announcement of India's nuclear doctrine setting out plans to acquire and operationally deploy ahuge arsenal of land-  air- and sea-based nuclear weaponsand to further build up its conventional forces  almost allof which are deployed against Pakistan. Even the Indianoffer of non-first use of nuclear weapons is designed togain it acceptance as a nuclear-weapon State and tojustify the acquisition of a massive nuclear arsenal as asecond-strike capability.India's pursuit of this doctrine will destabilize SouthAsia. Pakistan will be compelled to enhance its nuclearand missile capabilities and operational readiness topreserve deterrence. India must test again to developwarheads for its missiles. This would subvert theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). India'squest for its large nuclear arsenal could jeopardizeprospects for the conclusion of a fissile material cut-offtreaty. India's ambitions threaten peace and stability notonly in South Asia  but also in adjacent regions  includingthe Gulf and the sea lanes of the Indian Ocean.The international community must act — and it mustact immediately — if it is to avoid a hair-trigger securityenvironment in South Asia  with grave implications for30global peace  security and disarmament. To this end  theAssembly should endorse the concept of strategic restraintin South Asia.For this purpose  it should urge India to do thefollowing.First  India should disavow the proposed nucleardoctrine. Secondly  it should refrain from any furthernuclear tests and adhere to the CTBT. For its part  Pakistanremains committed to adhering to the CTBT in anatmosphere free of coercion. Thirdly  it should undertakenot to operationally deploy nuclear weapons on land  air orsea. Fourthly  it should open negotiations with Pakistan foran agreement to achieve balance in fissile material stocks while both India and Pakistan participate in the fissilematerial treaty negotiations  expected to commence earlynext year in Geneva. Fifthly  India should eschew theacquisition of anti-ballistic missile systems and anymilitary-related capabilities in space; and sixthly  cut backdrastically on its plans to purchase and develop variousadvanced and destabilizing conventional weapons systems.In this context  Pakistan appeals to those countries whichintend to supply these conventional weapons to India toreconsider their policies.Pakistan believes that it is now essential to convene aconference  with the participation of all the permanentmembers of the Security Council and other interestedPowers  as well as Pakistan and India  to promote the goalsof strategic restraint and stability in South Asia.The threat of nuclear war does not emanate only fromSouth Asia. Although the strategic confrontation of the coldwar is over  the major nuclear Powers  even while pressingfor non-proliferation by others  have asserted their ownright to possess nuclear weapons indefinitely. Theimplementation of strategic arms reduction agreements isstalled. If the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty isrescinded or revised  and missile defence plans areimplemented  the nuclear-arms race may well be revivedamong the nuclear-weapon States. And heightened tensionsamong them  over new or old disputes  could once againmove the nuclear doomsday clock closer to midnight.Pakistan supports the endeavours to achieve nucleardisarmament and the early elimination of all nuclearweapons. Multilateral negotiations can evolve agreed plansto realize these vital objectives. We also support the call forpreserving the ABM Treaty and avoiding the developmentand deployment of anti-ballistic missile systems.Negotiations to prevent the further militarization of outerspace should be initiated forthwith in the GenevaConference on Disarmament.In a globalized yet divided world  with modernweaponry and communications available to almosteveryone  terrorism has emerged as a pervasive challengein many parts of the world. It is a complex phenomenonwith many manifestations  a lethal tool used by ruthlessindividuals  groups and States.Pakistan condemns terrorism in all its forms andmanifestations  wherever it occurs. For a decade  duringthe Afghan war  Pakistan was the single largest target ofterrorism from across our borders. Even today  ouradversaries foment fear in Pakistani cities by sponsoringand financing terrorist bomb blasts and random violence.Our eastern neighbour has mastered the black art of stateterrorism in Kashmir  utilizing the tactics of crack-downs custodial killings  disappearances  arson  torture and rape as tools of repression against the Kashmiri people'sstruggle for freedom and self-determination. It is withgood reason that the non-aligned countries havedenounced the repression of peoples under foreignoccupation as the worst form of terrorism.Pakistan condemns the reprehensible tendency incertain quarters to link manifestations of terrorism withIslam. We welcome the resolution adopted earlier thisyear by the Commission on Human Rights whichdenounced attempts  including in the media  to defameIslam and link it with terrorism.Free markets and free political systems  accompaniedby breath-taking technological advances  are rapidlyintegrating our world across frontiers and continents.Unfortunately  most developing countries have beenbypassed by the benefits of globalization. Incomeinequality has increased among and within countries. And as the Asian financial crisis showed  growth has oftenbeen fragile.Market forces alone will not yield an equitableeconomic outcome for all peoples. At the tenth UnitedNations Conference on Trade and Development(UNCTAD X) and other international conferences  weneed to rethink current development strategies andformulate new approaches for broad-based development guided by the need for economic equity for individualsand nations.Action is required in three main areas. First  in thearea of trade  we need a truly level playing field to31encourage greater balance in the benefits of a rules-basedmultilateral trading system for the developing countries.The World Trade Organization (WTO) MinisterialConference in Seattle can advance this goal by resolvingproblems involved in the implementation of the UruguayRound agreements on textiles and agriculture andaddressing priority issues for developing countries in futurenegotiations — not by insisting on premature liberalizationin sectors where they are unable to compete. In Seattle  wemust also oppose the forces of protectionism disguised asmovements to promote environmental and social standards.Secondly  in the financial area  we need a more stablefinancial order which can control the volatility of capitalflows  make available adequate liquidity  especially for thedeveloping countries  alleviate their debt burden  and ensurecoherence between global financial and trade policies. Thehigh level “event” on financing for development could helpto build agreement on these issues.Thirdly  technology: in an increasingly knowledge-based global economy  the technology and knowledge gapbetween the developed and developing countries must berapidly narrowed. To this end  it would be useful to evolveglobal principles and guidelines for access to and transferof technology.In our globalizing yet fractured world  marked by starkcontrasts between prosperity and poverty  betweentranquillity and turbulence  the hopes of hundreds ofmillions of people lie in the United Nations  the mostuniversal global institution. The United Nations must playits role  as prescribed in the Charter  as the centre for theharmonization of the policies of Member States and as thecentral instrument for collective security. The SecurityCouncil's procedures must be made more transparent anddemocratic  to reflect the collective will and views of allStates Members of the United Nations.The Assembly must also agree on the objectives andprinciples and the approaches and instruments which willenable the international community to respond to theemerging challenges posed by conflicts  arms proliferationand unequal globalization. It is here  at the United Nations that we must seek consistent respect for the principles andpurposes of the United Nations Charter  and respect for itsbinding decisions. Only thus can we realize the vision ofpeace and prosperity for all peoples in a global environmentof freedom and democracy."
"131",5489,"PAN",54,1999,"The delegationof Panama is particularly gratified to welcome yourelection  Sir  to the presidency of the General Assembly atthis session. We are pleased that the noble people of Africa whose aspiration to progress is shared by Panamanians  areso well represented in this forum  with you at the head ofour deliberations and another distinguished African Mr. Kofi Annan  leading the Secretariat. We join in thecongratulations conveyed to you in recognition of yourcapacity and your skills  as well as in the expressions ofgratitude addressed to the Secretary-General for hisdedication to the Organization and his tireless efforts tomaintain international peace and security.To your predecessor  Mr. Didier Opertti  theMinister for Foreign Affairs of Uruguay  I also wish toconvey our appreciation for the outstanding way in whichhe conducted our debates and his contribution to thesuccess of the deliberations of the Assembly.My warmest congratulations  on behalf of the peopleand the Government of Panama  go also to therepresentatives of Kiribati  Nauru and the Kingdom ofTonga  States which were admitted to the United Nationson the first day of this session. This event confirmsbeyond question the universal and inclusive nature andpurpose of this body devoted to fostering world peace andpeoples' well-being.Today I am speaking on behalf of a young  proudnation that has written some illustrious pages in thehistory of the Latin American peoples' struggle to achievenationhood. I am the spokesperson of a country where according to the design of the liberator  Simón Bol'var the first congress of the new nations of the continent tookplace.Here before the Assembly  I represent a State whosegeographical location has given it an extraordinary role asa transit route  a country that has devoted itself heart andsoul to the service of inter-oceanic transport and that  asa result  has had to wait until the end of the twentiethcentury to recover dominion over the whole of itsterritory.Along with my compatriots  I am filled withenthusiasm at the approach of the far-reaching event that isthe handing over of the Panama Canal to Panamanianhands. On the eve of this tremendous event that arousessuch great expectations  we must recognize the efforts ofthe many Panamanian men and women who  from the timewe became an independent State  began the nationaliststruggle to free ourselves from the burdens imposed on usby the first Canal Treaty  which was signed in 1903. Theirpatriotic deeds have been indelibly engraved in the historyand the tradition of our people.Since its opening in 1914  the Canal has been animportant symbol of our nationhood and the centre of thehopes of the Panamanian people to attain its developmentas a nation. The Canal  which turned us into the world'sbridge and the heart of the universe  has given impetus tothe economic progress of the international community in thecourse of eight and a half decades. The Panamanian peoplewill now be able to participate fully in the prosperity thatthe inter-oceanic waterway generates because  at thethreshold of the twenty-first century  Panama hasdetermined that the Canal will be operated not only topunctually serve international trade  but also to promotesustainable human development. The administration of theCanal is therefore not simply a right  but also aresponsibility that obligates all Panamanians to administerthe waterway responsibly  efficiently and with absoluteprobity. We have prepared ourselves for this with redoubledcare.The process for the legal transition of the Canal beganin 1977 with the signing of the Panama Canal Treaty. Thatagreement recorded the commitment of the United States totransfer to Panama the administration and total control ofthe inter-oceanic waterway on 31 December 1999. Sincethen  the Governments of Panama and the United States ofAmerica have worked in harmony to bring about a seamlesstransition. Furthermore  and particularly since the 1989restoration of constitutional rule  we Panamanians haveagreed on the need to place the Canal above and beyondpolitical differences. The fruit of this consensus was thefact that our political Constitution incorporates a provisionfor the Canal that stipulates how the waterway is to beadministered from 31 December 1999. On the basis of thatconstitutional provision  adopted in 1994  and with the wideparticipation of society  we developed the Panama CanalAuthority Act  which was adopted unanimously in theLegislative Assembly.Those two legal instruments  the constitutionalprovision and the Act  provide the necessary legalmechanisms to ensure proper operation of the inter-oceanic waterway. In recent years  the Canal has handledunprecedented volumes of traffic and cargo and has dealtwith them with exemplary care and efficiency fundamentally thanks to our precious human resources who are almost all of Panamanian nationality.In order to guarantee its future operation  Panama iscurrently implementing an intensive programme ofinvestment at an approximate cost of one billion balboasin order to modernize and improve the inter-oceanicwaterway and to ensure that it is ready to cope withdemand and to maintain the quality of its services. It ishoped that this modernization and improvementprogramme will augment the capacity of the Canal by 20per cent.One of the priorities of the Canal Authority is toprotect the environment. As the Act establishes  as of 31December 1999 the Authority will have the responsibilityof vigilance over and conservation of the Canal basin  aswell as for coordinating the administration  conservationand use of the natural resources of that immense region.I should like to recognize the faultless way in whichsuccessive United States Governments have fulfilled theprovisions of the Canal Treaty since it was signed in1977. Thanks to them  it has been possible to overcomethe obstacles that have been encountered over a longperiod of 20 years in the transfer of the inter-oceanicwaterway and in the hand-over of the military bases thatwere established on our territory. Although there areseveral matters remaining for both Governments toconfront  such as decontamination of certain areasdesigned for military use by the United States Army  myGovernment trusts that the differences that continue toexist on this point will be resolved satisfactorily in areasonable period of time.The handover of the Canal to the jurisdiction of theRepublic of Panama is an event of far-reachingimportance not only for Panama and the United States but for the international community as well.Consequently  Panamanians hope that the representativesof the international community will join in celebrating thecommemorative events associated with the transition.Panamanians also hope that from now on the relationsbetween Panama and the United States will be based onmutual respect  cooperation and equity in trade  in viewof the tremendously strong nature of the historical  social political and trading bonds that have joined the twonations since the last century. The benefits that control2over the Canal have yielded for the economy and thepolitical standing of the United States determine that thatnation should value the feeling of brotherhood that itsleaders have for decades professed and truly act on them inorder to begin a new period of relations with Panama thatwill enable us to boost sustainable human development which is something the Panamanian people very muchaspire to.In recent years  my country  like many others  hassuffered the imposition of an economic orthodoxy appliedmore with an eye towards the interests of the majorinternational economic sectors than to the true developmentof peoples  without any consideration being given to thevalues that underpin our nationhood. This is the real stateof affairs that obliges my Government to review theorientation of our economic policy in order to promote thedevelopment of our people.We are particularly concerned with the developmentof rural communities. These communities make aninvaluable contribution to the strength of our nationhood but they are also the ones that have the greatest difficultiesin the struggle to ensure their survival. The fundamentalconcern of my Government is bound up with improving thequality of life of the neediest. That objective depends to alarge extent upon our efforts  but it also depends on oursucceeding in opening new markets for our products andachieving greater participation for private investment in ourcountry and greater cooperation with developed nations.At a time when the rights of women to equality andparticipation in the public life of nations are constantlybeing reaffirmed  I am proud to be the first Panamanianwoman ever to receive from her people  in anunmistakeable manifestation of confidence  the mandate toserve the Republic as President. I interpret this mandate asa challenge calling on me to promote sustainable humandevelopment honestly and devotedly  in accordance with theuniversal political values that for half a century theOrganization has been upholding with admirablepersistence: the democratic system of government andrespect for human rights.Consequently  I bear the heavy responsibility infollowing in the steps of my predecessors — exceptionalleaders elected in democratic elections  such as Golda Meir Indira Ghandi and Corazón Aquino  among others; and  inthe western hemisphere  Eugenia Charles  Violeta Chamorroand Janet Jagan. They helped to realize the warrantedaspiration that society should recognize women's skills andmerits to share on an equal footing in the great politicalresponsibility of presiding over a nation.For Panamanian women I represent a dream cometrue. In this respect  my election is a significant advancein the campaign to ensure political equality for thewomen of my country and the rest of the continent.However  many Panamanian women are being hard hit bypoverty and destitution  an unacceptable situation thatthey share with children  older adults and men  whom so-called globalization takes no account of.If we wish to secure the sustainability of human lifeon this God-given earth  and if we wish to keep ourpromises as leaders  we must strive to eradicate hunger poverty and destitution  which in my country afflictalmost two-fifths of the population.If we wish to achieve these goals — which is whatwe were elected to do — we must root out corruption which is the major obstacle standing in the way ofachieving the lofty results that our societies expect of us.In this respect  I am pleased to assure the Assembly thatPanama is doing everything in its power to put an end tothe use and trafficking of drugs as well as to the money-laundering that is the result of that heinous phenomenon.We the leaders of nations have the opportunity toundertake measures that will significantly help to fashiona more just  more humane and fairer world governed bythe fundamental principles of democracy  justice andliberty  for which my people  together with all the peoplesof the world  have fought throughout history.I urge dignitaries and the representatives of MemberStates to embark resolutely on the struggle againstpoverty  destitution and corruption  which so adverselyaffect the living conditions of humankind. I would askthem to come with us to the rescue of the weak  of thosewho suffer unspeakable injustice and those whose way oflife is threatened by invisible forces that they can neitherunderstand nor control.My presence here is evidence of the Panamanians'firm belief in the order provided by this Organization whose struggle to achieve equality among peoples andpeace among nations dates back more than 50 years. ThisOrganization has wholeheartedly championed humanrights and battled against discrimination on all fronts.That is why we believe in the need to strengthen it because the United Nations is the court in which the3voice of smaller States can be heard  as well as the ultimatechampion of all of our rights.On account of the trust that my people have in theUnited Nations  I invite all of the dignitaries andrepresentatives of Member States to join with us incelebrating the recovery of the sovereignty that we neverresigned ourselves to losing. At this historic moment  whichPanamanians wish to share with the whole of humankind the bells of the world will ring out in jubilation because theprinciple of sovereignty  so often proclaimed in this andother international forums  will have been translated intoreality in my country.May God  the source of all authority  guide thedeliberations of the Assembly."
"132",5536,"PER",54,1999,"Thedelegation of Peru is greatly pleased  Sir  at your electionto the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourthsession  especially since Peru was an active participant inNamibia’s independence process  which was advanced bythe United Nations. As the first speaker at this morning’smeeting I am particularly pleased to congratulate you andthe other officers of the General Assembly.The arrival of the new millennium is a great historicopportunity to initiate an era of peace  progress and well-being  from which no people on Earth should be excluded.That requires a greater commitment on the part of theinternational community to create conditions that willenable developing nations properly to channel their ownenergy and potential with a view to achievingcomprehensive national development.At the height of the twentieth century  the majorityof the world’s peoples remain mired in the social  culturaland technological conditions of the nineteenth century —or even of earlier centuries. We shall be able truly tospeak of a new era only if our aspirations for the twenty-first century and the third millennium become tangiblereality for those peoples and if those peoples succeed infulfilling their own legitimate aspirations: in other words if a globalized world can globalize well-being and dignity.The conversion of our economies to adapt them toglobalization has social costs which we can bear providedthat this process assures us a future of development andwell-being  not one of additional frustrations. Suchfrustrations could arise if our national economies  ratherthan growing stronger  are weakened by economicopening based on unequal or unjust terms of trade. Thereaction  which no one wishes to see  could be a return todefeated economic ideas.In speaking of my own country  Peru  I can say that like other peoples  it inherited a heavy burden of injusticeand backwardness  but it also has an extraordinary future-looking calling that has made it possible over the past 10years for our country to become an emerging economy.That future-looking calling has enabled us to defeatthe totalitarian  terrorist designs of the Shining Path andof the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement. It was thelatter group that seized the residence of the JapaneseAmbassador in 1996.The destructive capacity of such criminal activity is onthe increase thanks to access to new technology  and todayit threatens every region and every continent. If it is notduly stopped  it will undoubtedly become the nightmare ofthe twenty-first century. Both internal and external peaceare essential for the coming of the new era that we arechampioning.In 1998  Peru and Ecuador were at a crossroads: eitherto pursue the path of armed conflict  the situation typical ofthe entire century  which has led to the destruction ofpeoples; or to follow the path of peace  the only possibilityfor development. Peru and Ecuador chose peace. The 1998peace agreement between Peru and Ecuador was theproduct of two equally important factors: the political willof two Governments taken to its ultimate conclusion; andthe capacities  energy and awareness of two peoplesdetermined to overcome old prejudices and work towardsa future of development. Ecuador and Peru intend to reachthe twenty-first century without the baggage of thenineteenth. Peace has opened up possibilities for thedevelopment of Peru and of Ecuador thanks to savings inresources once earmarked for defence  and it has shownagain that Latin America is a mature region that rejectswarlike tension.But tranquility in our region has been disturbed by thealliance of drug trafficking and terrorism. In some cases these criminal activities have created power sufficient tochallenge States as well as to upset the world economy:illicit drug money may have infiltrated productive commercial and even political activities. Terrorism and drugtrafficking therefore represent a threat to modern societyand to good governance.In general terms  poverty  terrorism  drug traffickingand racial discrimination are the main barriers to ourglimpsing the new era that as civilized peoples we proposeto reach. Our task and our commitment is to overcomethese obstacles with firm political will if we want thistransitional period in which we live to mark the thresholdof a new era for mankind.The concepts of democracy and fairness must prevail.It is important to promote democracy within countries  butalso to promote it between countries and between peoples.Democracy applies not only to the internal structure ofStates  but also to the international relations that willdetermine the fate of the world.Human rights raised to their maximal power andhighest expression are the rights of peoples  and allpeoples have a right to the future."
"133",5583,"PHL",54,1999,"Mr. President  I wouldlike to congratulate you as you take on the honour andresponsibility of leading the Assembly at its fifty-fourthsession. Allow me to express our deep appreciation to HisExcellency Minister Didier Opertti  who led us last yearwith admirable efficiency  insight and  on occasion  goodhumour. I take this opportunity also to commend theSecretary-General for his dedication and inspiringleadership in the service of our Organization.I would also like to welcome Presidents TeburoroTito  Rene Harris and King Taufa’ahau Tupou IV  theirdelegations and the people of Kiribati  Nauru and Tonga all fellow members of the Asia-Pacific family  to theUnited Nations. Their membership in our Organizationshould further bolster the global consensus on peace andprogress in the world.Almost a decade ago the cold war ended and we aretoday at the doorstep of a new century. Over those years we achieved much as individual nations and as Membersof this Organization. Yet  our collective search for peaceand progress for all continues. After many years ofeloquent debates  after hearing many persuasive proposalsand formulations  how well indeed have we mastered thelanguage of peace. But the wars and strife that afflict ourworld  even as we speak  show that we have neither fullylearned nor lived the ways of peace. As at its founding our Organization is faced with the dire spectre ofcountless multitudes living in utter dread and misery.The much-touted new global order  where nationslive in harmony and peace  where growth and sustainabledevelopment are rights and not privileges and wherejustice rules and human rights are upheld remains apromise. We encounter newer threats to the peace  andold threats are re-emerging. Poverty stalks many lands.Far too many people have their human rights ignored orviolated. Our very Earth protests decades of unbridledabuse.One of the clear victors at the end of the cold warwas the free market. For most of our lives  the assaultupon the very idea and practice of the free market camefrom an ideology. Today  even that ideology embraces themethods  if not the spirit  of the free market. It nowseems that the growing reach of the free market  or9globalization  is held back only by our inability to adapt toit fast enough.For so many years  East Asia was admired for itssuccess with globalization. The so-called East Asian miraclewas little more than our region’s economic response to it.Our fast growth doubled our incomes and moved tens ofmillions of our people out of poverty. Up until July 1997 we thought all was well.Now we know better; we have learned our lessons.Our difficulties could have been less severe or avoided withbetter public and corporate governance  with bettermanagement of financial systems  with greater transparencyand accountability; in other words  with greater openness which is the heart and spirit of the free market or any trulyfree system.Happily  the crisis did not destroy the conditionsunderpinning East Asia’s growth formula ofoutward-oriented industrialization. A propensity for highsavings  abundant highly educated human resources  higherproductivity and economic reform policies remain.Today  East Asia is on the road to recovery. Consumerconfidence is rising. Exports are booming. Inflation hasbeen tamed. Investors are coming back. Japan  the Republicof Korea  Singapore  Thailand and Malaysia are all growingagain. The Philippine economy will grow by more than 3percent this year and over 5 percent next year. Yet  there isno retreat on our core reform agenda. Economicrestructurings continue. Greater economic integration goeson. The Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)countries  for instance  took extraordinary steps tounderscore their commitment to free trade and investment.During its Hanoi summit last year  ASEAN resolved toaccelerate  not retard  the establishment of the ASEAN freetrade area to the year 2002. We are accelerating theimplementation of the ASEAN Investment Area andASEAN Industrial Cooperation schemes. We have alsomoved towards greater financial cooperation by establishingat the Asian Development Bank a regional economicmonitoring and surveillance mechanism. It shouldencourage transparency  institute better coordination ofeconomic policies and help ward off future financial crises.However  internal reforms cannot be enough. Thecrisis also exposed the weaknesses lurking in theinternational system. Realizing early on that thephenomenon of globalization should be addressedmultilaterally  the United Nations has sought thecooperation of other multilateral organizations to strengthennormative  legal and institutional frameworks in the hopethat the global economy can be managed more effectivelyand  perhaps more importantly  more equitably. For theyawning gap between poor and rich nations continues towiden  and the pace and level of development of countriesare  alas  more uneven.In a fast-globalizing and interdependent world augmenting the ability of developing countries toparticipate fully in the global economy is the win-winsolution for all. Insecure market access  high levels ofprotection and support of agriculture in industrializedcountries and the continued high tariffs on industrialproducts from developing countries obviate greaterprogress for all.The international trading system must adopt a newparadigm in which sustainable development should be thecentral theme. The World Trade Organization MinisterialConference to be held in Seattle late this year should benot only an opportunity to launch a new round ofmultilateral trade negotiations. It should also be anoccasion to imbue the process with a sense of directionthat responds to the development needs of developingcountries.The global financial architecture must bestrengthened. There is urgent need  as the Committee forDevelopment Policy pointed out in its 1998 report to theEconomic and Social Council  for the coherentdevelopment and effective monitoring of internationalstandards and codes of conduct for private financialmanagement and capital flows. There is also need to curbdestructive competition and inconsistency in nationalregulatory frameworks.More and more  countries and regions need to reachout to one another in the spirit of cooperation andpartnership for development. The ten-year-oldAsia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Council  or APEC  isfounded on this conviction. So is the much youngerAsia-Europe Meeting  or ASEM. And it heartens us thatthe East Asia-Latin America Forum  having recently takenits first steps  may soon join in the more sustained andstructured effort to link up for global progress. ThePhilippines anticipates a similar region-to-region initiativewith Africa and will contribute its utmost to any suchinitiative.From a historical perspective  we are still at the veryearly stage of globalization. With globalization having thepotential to grow exponentially  as do the revolutions in10technology and information that fuel it  this early stage isperhaps the most critical one. Only earnest internationalcooperation can ensure that this process does not lead to themarginalization of any nation.But  as our recent experience in East Asia shows economic progress alone cannot and does not engender theoptimal well-being of nations or peoples. Progress inensuring political stability and security should accompanygrowth. Any asymmetry in the pace  breadth and depth ofchange in these facets of the political economy is a seed offuture instability. Moreover  just as our economic prospectsare determined by our participation in the global economy our future peace and security will depend not only on ourinternal resilience  but also on the active cooperation ofothers.In East Asia the most urgent undertaking for ensuringpeace is the reconfiguration of the strategic securitystructure in the region. The holes left gaping by the end ofthe cold war must be filled; the new parameters of theregional security equation must be defined. The situation inthe Taiwan Strait is a concern to us all. So are the issues ofmissile development in the Korean peninsula and nucleardevelopment and uneasy peace in South Asia.The South China Sea remains a potential flashpoint.We are hopeful that  in addition to measures advancingregional economic and financial cooperation  a regionalcode of conduct in the South China Sea can be adopted atthe summit of leaders of ASEAN  China  Japan and theRepublic of Korea that we are hosting in Manila inNovember.East Asia has clearly not yet settled all its great issuesof war and peace. But we are trying hard and succeeding insome important ways. At the sixth ASEAN RegionalForum — the only forum on security that includes all themajor Powers with a stake in our region — we agreed todraft rules of procedure by which preventive diplomacycould bolster and complement regional confidence-buildingmeasures. Last December we agreed to move closer to thefull activation of the ASEAN High Council and the disputesettlement mechanisms mandated by the Treaty of Amityand Cooperation in Southeast Asia.The 5 May 1999 Agreement on East Timor and thefree  fair and orderly conduct of the 30 Augustconsultations there are truly significant developments forlasting peace in our region. For the Philippines  it is of theutmost importance that the chaos there be quickly resolvedand the horrendous human suffering be stanched. Wetherefore welcome Indonesia’s decision to invite theassistance of the United Nations and of a multinationalforce  and its creation of a national commission of inquiryto investigate and bring to justice persons responsible forthe atrocities and human rights violations in East Timor.We also commend the Secretary-General and theneighbouring and other countries for responding quicklyto restore order and facilitate humanitarian relief in EastTimor. As a fraternal neighbour of the peoples ofIndonesia and East Timor  we will contribute all we canto ameliorate the humanitarian situation and put back ontrack a peaceful transition.Elsewhere  the Sharm el-Sheikh Agreement is apositive development for the Middle East peace process.We are also heartened by the agreements reached recentlyin Sierra Leone and the Congo  and between Eritrea andEthiopia. We hope that the resolution of the immediatecrisis in Kosovo will soon create the conditions conduciveto the establishment of lasting peace there.It is true that we have avoided major inter-Stateconflicts of late  and that States are more willing toresolve disputes peacefully. But the continuing tensions invarious regions of the world could still draw nations intoconflict and divert attention and resources away fromdevelopment. For the Philippines  regional cooperationprovides a key to managing potential and actual conflictsituations. We have seen this in the efforts of the ASEANtroika  the United Nations and the internationalcommunity to restore political stability in Cambodia  andin the dispatch of a multinational force to East Timorwith authorization from the Security Council and upon theinvitation of the Indonesian Government.We agree with the Secretary-General that it isnecessary and desirable to provide support for regionaland subregional arrangements and initiatives on matters ofinternational peace and security. The United Nations lacking the capacity  resources and expertise to address allissues unique to each region of the world  shouldcomplement rather than supplant regional peace efforts.This  however  will require significant investmentfrom all of us. In the first instance  we need to invest alot of goodwill and build trust in one another so thatclearer criteria and a more predictable basis can guideSecurity Council authorization for all types of peacemissions. We realize that no two situations are the same but inaction due to stalemates in the Council  in the faceof serious threats to peace and human life  threatens thecredibility  legitimacy and future effectiveness of ourOrganization.Secondly  the Organization and its Member Statesneed to invest in practical steps that can be taken in theareas of training assistance  joint peacekeeping exercises greater participation in standby arrangements  partnershipsbetween countries whose contingents require equipmentsupport and those able to provide it  and closer cooperationbetween the United Nations and regional organizations.And thirdly  perhaps more important  we need toinvest our work and way of thinking with greater flexibilityand innovation. The nature of conflict has changed. Crisesand humanitarian situations now involve many more actors from Governments and international organizations to non-State players. And their effects  just like their causes  aremore complex and far-reaching.Let us face it  much of what was considered before asthe internal affairs of a State is not so any more — or ever.Humanity is indivisible. Peace is indivisible.State sovereignty is important; it will always be. So isindividual sovereignty. That the redefinition of one shouldcoincide with the renewed consciousness of the other is  tomy delegation  not an accident. These developments neednot even be seen as parallel  as in they do not meet; for intruth  they converge.But we agree with the Secretary-General that the moreimportant question is how the United Nations — the onlytruly universal  if imperfect  arm of the internationalcommunity — is to respond to the political  human rightsand humanitarian crises affecting so much of the world. Wehave to be more innovative in our approaches to problemsrelating to massive and systematic human rights violations.We agree that empowering the United Nations enough tomatch its Charter mandates in today’s and tomorrow’sworld requires that we  the Member States  update ourconcept of national interest.Last year  before this Assembly  I articulatedPhilippine policy  thus:“Like all other States  the Philippines pursuesforeign policy to promote national security anddevelopment. But we view national security beyondthe traditional concerns of sovereignty and territorialintegrity. For in a global regime characterized byevolving multipolarity of political and military powerand by growing economic and financialinterdependence  with all their attendantopportunities and risks  my nation’s peace andprosperity increasingly depend on stability andgrowth abroad. As President Estrada has said: Ourway of life  our fundamental values and ourinstitutions can flourish and find true expressiononly if we enjoy political stability  economicsolidarity  socio-cultural cohesion  moral consensusand ecological balance  at home and with ourpartners in the world. Our national security anddevelopment” [or in short  our national interest]“demand that we actively advance the internationallyshared goals of freedom  openness  peace  prosperityand justice.” (A/53/PV.17  p.6)After the events of the last year  we are moreconvinced that the collective interest  our commoninterest  is my country’s national interest.The need to reform the United Nations is ourcommon interest. Reforms should not only seek to makethe United Nations more efficient; they should make ittruly responsive to the new demands of internationalpeace  security and development.The Security Council  with its wide mandate andleadership role  should be at the centre of change andreform itself. It should be truly representative  democratic transparent and accountable. The use of the veto shouldbe rationalized.The day may come when we shall have achievedconsensus on the reforms that we wish for ourOrganization. The day may also come — and soon Ihope — that the financial morass our Organization is inwill have passed.But while these are critical to the very survival ofthe United Nations  the continued existence of ourOrganization would be far more meaningful if we couldinvest it with a new openness and greater trust. ThePhilippines believes that to achieve this  we must start athome  in our own regions. We must  in appropriatecircumstances  be more open to hearing the views ofothers and offering our own  even on issues deemed toocontroversial. A new openness would reflect the boldnesswith which we should renew the promise of a new era.The United Nations proved its great worth in thiscentury. Its continued success in the next will dependentirely on us  on the goals we hope to achieve with it  on12what we are willing to invest in it. After all  we are theUnited Nations."
"134",5602,"PLW",54,1999,"Let me first congratulateyou  Sir  on your unanimous election as President of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-fourth session. We likewiseextend our appreciation to Mr. Didier Opertti  thePresident of the Assembly at its fifty-third session. Wewish also to convey our appreciation and thanks to HisExcellency Mr. Kofi Annan for his leadership inpromoting the objectives and the mission of the UnitedNations.I wish to convey the warm greetings of PresidentKuniwo Nakamura  the entire leadership and the peopleof the Republic of Palau to the Assembly on the occasionof the fifty-fourth session. On behalf of the Governmentand the people of Palau  I extend our sincere appreciationto the members of this body for their assistance.Since attaining membership of the United Nations in1994  the Republic of Palau has benefitted greatly froma variety of United Nations-sponsored programmes andfrom international cooperation  which have helped us playour role in promoting peace and democracy in our region.This year  on 1 October  we proudly celebrate the fifthanniversary of our independence  which came about as aresult of a unique and very successful political treaty withthe United States of America under the Compact of FreeAssociation. Diplomatic relations and economiccooperation with a growing number of members of thisbody assure stability and promise great economicpotential for the future.Before I proceed  let me take this rare opportunity towelcome three of our regional neighbours — the Republicof Kiribati  the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom ofTonga — and to congratulate them on joining thisimportant Organization.Palau also expresses its appreciation and support forthe efforts of the Security Council in promoting peace security and the protection of human rights and democracythroughout the world  and especially in troubled areas inneed of United Nations intervention.Today we have less than 100 days left before enteringthe new millennium — 97 days to be exact. There areindeed many global issues and problems that certainlydeserve our attention. The existence of the Earth in the nextmillennium may  however  be in great jeopardy if theenvironment and nature's forces can no longer support thehuman population. Global warming or climate change maymerit the upmost attention and our concerted effort. I callupon every Member State  large and small  developed anddeveloping  rich and poor  to work cooperatively to findmeaningful solutions and preventive actions for thisgrowing international problem and challenge. I amconfident that through sharing information on climatechange we can learn from one another and take thenecessary steps to meet this very dangerous global problem.Let me share a Palauan proverb with the Assembly one that foreshadows climate change. In Palau the windsare mainly from the east or from the west. When there areeasterly winds  the sky is not so telling before the rain. Asthe rain commences  one may think it is just a light shower.However  it actually comes in a downpour. In the old daysour raincoat was simply several leaves sewn together andput over our heads. So we would get soaked through andthrough during this downpour. The message is: do notunderestimate the easterly winds  or you will get delugedwith water.That is our message from yesterday  and it is ourmessage today: do not take climate change lightly  or therewill be dire consequences. Climate change for small islandnations such as the Republic of Palau has greatconsequences because of our fragile ecosystem. To expandon just a few examples  the El Niño phenomenon  whichimpacted many communities throughout the globe  had far-reaching and devastating effects in Palau as well. At leastone third of all our hard coral communities died. Our reefsare home to over 500 species of corals and 1 500 species offish  and are vibrant with marine life. The loss of our coralcommunities effects our entire ecosystem and eventuallyour people and their economic livelihoods. The El Niñophenomenon also caused extreme drought that dried upour main water reservoir and destroyed over 1 400patches of our most important root crop  taro  which ofcourse added another burden to our daily lives.Palau and our Pacific region are also suffering fromunusually high rises in tide tables  causing our farmlandsto be infiltrated with salt water that eventually will havedire effects on our crops. This high sea level rise hasliterally caused islands to disappear  and others are inimminent danger of disappearing. Abnormally warmocean temperatures have also caused extensive coralbleaching  and rising atmospheric temperatures devastateagriculture. According to the 1999-2000 WorldDevelopment Report  a 1 metre sea level rise due toclimate change would force about 70 million people tomove  and would have a dramatic effect on food securityin central Asia and the Pacific. Many other examplesexist  I am sure.These few examples  and examples in othercountries  beg for global cooperation on climate change.The Republic of Palau recognizes the link betweenclimate change and biodiversity  and is committed topreserving our biodiversity. Protecting our forests is oneof the most effective mechanisms to slow climate change.Forests  as we know  are carbon sinks  which absorbcarbon dioxide rather than releasing it as a harmfulgreenhouse gas. Because of this  the destruction of foresthas a dramatic impact on climate change. The Republicof Palau has taken responsibility for its forests throughthe National Forest Act and Mangrove Management Plan.Progress is being made on national regulations requiringprotective vegetative zones along our wetland and coastalareas. The Republic of Palau sponsors a summer treeplanting programme for our children in order to teach ouryouth the importance of our natural resources. We aretaking steps necessary to ensure that our forests and reefsare available for future generations.The Republic of Palau has incorporated the graveissues of climate change and rises in sea level into long-term strategic planning. Instruments for accession to theUnited Nations Framework Convention on ClimateChange and the Kyoto Protocol are in transmission  andwe humbly request international assistance to develop acomprehensive vulnerability index that encompasseseconomic and environmental factors like climate change.We enthusiastically support efforts to adjust energyprices to accurately reflect the environmental2consequences of fossil fuel use. Alongside climate change energy conservation is critical to Palau's economy and theenvironment. We have established a national policy  theNational Energy Goal  to subsidize renewable energyprogrammes  and have audited all Government facilities forenergy efficiency. At our national hospital we replacedstandard incandescent lights with energy efficient compactfluorescent lamps. Solar panels provide lights for our outerislands and isolated villages. Solar beacons light our reefchannels. Our national energy programme and public utilitycorporation are in partnership with the Million SolarRooftops initiative to educate the public about renewableenergy applications. Let us start off the new century witha dynamic move away from fossil fuels and towards acommitment to environment friendly energy alternatives.Entering into relevant agreements and conventionswhich target international response to environmental issuesis another responsibility that our Republic has to its peopleand this world community. It is one that we are fulfilling astime goes on  being a signatory and party to eightinternational agreements  including the United NationsConvention on the Law of the Sea.The Republic of Palau views climate change as beingin the forefront of issues that need to be addressed  and thatcan only be effectively addressed if all Member Statesmeaningfully contribute on the basis of common butdifferentiated responsibilities. The use of the Kyotomechanisms is an integral component of a global solutionto the issue of climate change. Therefore  it is critical thatno artificial restrictions be placed on the use of thesemechanisms. If we can all come to terms with the intent ofthe Kyoto mechanisms and develop a fair and realisticapproach to their use  there will be no sufficient reason whywe cannot enter the new millennium with positive remediesto the issue of climate change. Maybe we can even enterthe new millennium with a breath of fresh air.As we travel towards the new millennium  let us moveforward with the tools that we have developed as aninternational family  so that the benefits  although they maygo unseen in our generation  may be fully appreciated byour children and their children. These initiatives shall beour imprint  our assurance of a healthier environment forgenerations to come."
"135",5643,"PNG",54,1999,"Onbehalf of the people and the Government of Papua NewGuinea  I wish to join previous speakers in congratulatingHis Excellency Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab on his election tothe presidency of the General Assembly. His unanimouselection shows the esteem in which the internationalcommunity holds him personally  and his country Namibia. The Papua New Guinea delegation is confidentthat he will guide the fifty-fourth session of the GeneralAssembly to a successful conclusion. My congratulationsgo also to the other Assembly officers.May I also take this opportunity to express mydelegation's sincere appreciation to his predecessor  HisExcellency Mr. Didier Opertti  for his outstandingstewardship in facilitating the work of the fifty-thirdsession.We would also like to place on record ourappreciation to the Secretary-General for his diplomaticskill and for the leadership he has provided on majorissues of international concern. I must also congratulatethe Secretariat staff for the tremendous work they put intothe discharge of their functions and duties  at times undervery difficult and dangerous circumstances.Like others who have spoken before me  I toocongratulate on behalf of the people and the Government17of Papua New Guinea the three new Member States  allfrom the South Pacific Forum region — the Republic ofNauru  the Republic of Kiribati and the Kingdom of Tonga— and welcome them into the United Nations family. Iwould also like to pay tribute to all Member States whichmade their admission possible. This is an Organization inwhich smallness in terms of population or size should notbe a handicap. I am confident that the work of the UnitedNations will only be enhanced through the sharing of theparticular experiences and knowledge that these three newMembers will bring.It has only been a little over two months since the newGovernment  of which I am a part  was elected to office inmy country. But this time has been hectic and verychallenging. The Government has been confronted withproblems inherited from previous Governments over the last23 years of our independence and especially over the lasttwo years. These have been compounded by other problemsassociated with the recent downturn in the global economy with the economic crisis in the Asia-Pacific region and withnatural disasters  all of which we have little control over.This experience  together with my country's locationand its close relations with other countries in the region defines my Government's foreign policy focus onpartnerships in the Asia-Pacific region. This point has beenbrought home by a series of natural disasters which haveaffected Papua New Guinea over the last 10 years. Therehave been 30 of them in that decade. The droughts  floods bush fires  cyclones  frosts  volcanic eruptions  earthquakes tsunamis and landslides have shown that peoples and Statesthroughout the world have to be partners in dealing with thecauses and consequences of such disasters  and mustmanifest preparedness to take responsive and remedialmeasures. There must be a global partnership in developingappropriate mechanisms for disaster prevention and disasterreduction.When my Government came into office on 14 Julythis year  it had five main priorities. These are: restoringintegrity to the institutions of the State; stabilizing theexchange rate of our currency  the kina  and containinginflation and reestablishing constructive dialogue withPapua New Guinea's development partners; restoringstability to the national budget  focusing on fewer and moreimportant priority areas and advancing the privatization ofsome of our public institutions for a fair run; creating betterconditions for the private sector by removing barriers toinvestment growth; and continuing the Bougainville peaceprocess.My Government has addressed these challenges including a comprehensive programme of structuraladjustment through the mini-budget recently adopted byParliament. In doing so  we are working hard to makesure that a strong and efficient private sector cancontribute to public welfare and national development. Bythe same token we are also reviewing the size andeffectiveness of the public sector to make it moreresponsive to the desires and aspirations of our people.The results  together with other measures we haveadopted  will  we hope  stabilize the economy  therebystimulating economic growth. The signs are veryencouraging.I know that as a small open economy  my country'sdevelopment is directly influenced by global factors including world market prices for our products. Currently my country is suffering from the economic crisisexperienced by our major trading partners in Asia  and weare forced to undertake significant reform programmes toprotect our economy and our people. In this regard  weturn to international financial institutions to help usrestructure our economy. The World Bank  theInternational Monetary Fund and the Asian DevelopmentBank have been very positive in their responses to ourpolicies  especially my Government's recent mini-budgetlast month.I held bilateral discussions with friends such asAustralia  China  Japan and New Zealand two weeks agoduring the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Councilministerial meeting in Auckland  New Zealand. Theyindicated their support for the current structuraladjustment programmes my Government has introduced.For Papua New Guinea to realize and sustain its currentreform programmes  it has to secure external financialsupport.I see my Government's foreign policy of partnershipin the Asia-Pacific region as a building block for theglobal partnership on which the future of my peopledepends. There is really no other alternative.On peacemaking and peacekeeping  the Bougainvilleconflict involves substantial commitments of personneland funds by the Government of Papua New Guinea  byneighbouring countries and by the United Nations. MyGovernment acknowledges and is deeply grateful for theconstructive role played by Australia  Fiji  New Zealand the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu as well as by theUnited Nations Development Programme and a number ofnon-governmental organizations including churches and18the Red Cross. We are also grateful that the SecurityCouncil found it possible to answer our request to send anobserver mission to ensure that the parties involved in thepeace process continue to honour the Lincoln Agreement.We note the reference to Bougainville in the Secretary-General's report on the work of the Organization.As peace continues to be consolidated on the ground so the role and size of the neutral regional PeaceMonitoring Group can be expected to change. Re-establishment of police  courts and correctional services willprovide important supports and benchmarks for progresstowards lasting peace on the island. In the event that theBougainville parties are unable to resolve the constitutionalarrangements before the end of this year  we hope that atthe appropriate time the Security Council will agree to anextension of the mandate of the United Nations mission onBougainville.I pay tribute to all United Nations Member States  andespecially to those current and immediate past members ofthe Security Council  for responding positively and for theircontinued support for a peaceful resolution of ourBougainville crisis.Consistent with our commitment to peaceful dialoguebetween nations  Papua New Guinea condemns those whoemploy terrorism against innocent people and who finance recruit  train and deploy terrorists and mercenaries.In 1975  when I addressed this forum from thispodium at the time of our admission to the United Nations I committed Papua New Guinea to the principles andpurposes of the United Nations Charter. Now  some 24years later  we recognize that like any other institution  theUnited Nations has limitations. We believe that after 50years the time is right to review the Charter  taking intoaccount today's realities.The Charter should be a document that puts the peopleof the world on centre stage  and at the same time it mustrecognize that the Governments are here to represent themas well as to serve them. In this respect  there cannot beany distinction as to colour  creed  race  sex or religiouspersuasion.My delegation welcomes the Secretary-General'scurrent and ongoing reform programme. As a member ofthe Non-Aligned Movement  my delegation reaffirms theposition that the Security Council should be reformed andexpanded in both categories  taking into account today'srealities. My delegation believes the numbers in the Councilshould reflect the increased United Nations membership and therefore I concur with the majority of MemberStates who have advocated a Security Council of the newmillennium consisting of 26 or more members.Papua New Guinea believes that all permanentmembers of the Security Council  including newpermanent members  should have similar privileges andrights. The use of the veto power should be done awaywith  or curtailed and applied only to Chapter VII issues.The working methods of the Council should be moretransparent.The reforms of the Organization would not becomplete without the reconfiguration of the regionalgroupings within the United Nations structure. MyGovernment believes that an effective Security Councilshould be composed of a representative from eachsubregion of the world. In this regard  due considerationshould be given to current realities  especially to thegeographical location of each Member State. For example in the reformulation Australia and New Zealand should beconsidered as part of the South Pacific subregion of theAsian group. The reforms in the Security Council shouldtherefore take account of this change.Changing the world  through decolonization  from asystem of relations between imperial powers and thecolonized to a partnership between sovereign States isamong the United Nations greatest achievements. Theprocess  however  will not be complete until theremaining 17 non-self-governing territories have exercisedtheir inalienable right to self-determination and/orachieved self-government and  where appropriate independence. Neither small size nor remoteness shouldbe allowed to qualify or limit this inalienable right.On the regional front  Papua New Guinea is pleasedto note the progress made in implementing the MatignonAccords  culminating in the recent agreement containedin the Noumea Accord  which confirms the way forwardfor the exercise of the right of self-determination by thepeople of New Caledonia  especially the indigenousKanak people. The Noumea Accord will  we believe provide a sound basis for the future fulfilment of alllegitimate political aspirations. We urge all parties tohonour both its letter and spirit.We acknowledge that the United Nations Decade forDecolonization will come to an end next year. We urgethe administering Powers and the members of the Special19Committee to work together to develop a new programmeof action for the year 2000 and beyond.On East Timor  my Government welcomed theagreement between the Republic of Indonesia  thePortuguese Republic and the United Nations on 5 May1999  which enabled the United Nations to organize theballot on 30 August. The overwhelming 98.6 per centturnout at the ballot and the 78.2 per cent vote in favour ofindependence are very clear.My Government calls on all parties to respect theresults of the United Nations-supervised ballot and thewishes of the East Timorese people. Although since theballot there have been deaths  massive destruction ofproperty and the undemocratic and forced displacement ofpeople by the militias and certain members of theIndonesian military who did not accept the results  we arepleased that this has changed after the recent announcementby the President of the Republic of Indonesia  B. J.Habibie  reaffirmed by Foreign Minister Alatas yesterday.Democracy is all about the will of the majority. It is notabout unanimity  nor is it about enforced application ofrules by a minority.We are also pleased that the Government of Indonesiawas able to recognise its obligations — not only as a partyto the 5 May Agreement  but also as a Member of theUnited Nations — to permit the deployment of a SecurityCouncil-sanctioned multinational peacekeeping force in EastTimor.At the same time  however  it is our fervent hope thatin the interests of the long-term security and stability of theregion  the leaders and the people of East Timor will alsomake peace with their neighbours. It is important for themto acknowledge the fact that it was the Government ofIndonesia that made it possible for the people to exercisetheir right to self-determination.We are firmly committed to the Barbados Programmeof Action for the Sustainable Development of Small IslandDeveloping States  including issues of climate change andthe consequent effects of rising sea levels. We strongly urgeits full implementation. My Government will continue tofollow and support the future work on these issues including the special session of the General Assembly onsmall island developing States to be held on 27 and 28September 1999. The world's leading scientists haveconcluded that the rise in global temperatures poses seriousthreats  including sea-level rise and an increase in naturalcatastrophes such as the El Niño and La Niña phenomena.The greatest challenge for the United Nations is tostrengthen the global community's capacity to respondpromptly and effectively to natural disasters. Thedevastation caused by the recent earthquakes in Taiwanand Turkey and by the floods in the United States and inthe Bahamas resulting from hurricane Floyd makes it allthe more imperative for the international community totake positive action.On the question of the management of the oceansand seas  Papua New Guinea joins others in calling onMember States at this session of the General Assembly towork together on a resolution to establish a consultativeprocess to improve coordination and management of theprogrammes for the protection of the oceans and seas. Atthis Assembly session we should formalize this process.We are concerned that at the recent meeting of theCouncil of the International Seabed Authority in Jamaica a number of States appeared to be more preoccupied withreducing our potential to prosper from prospecting exploring and exploiting the deep seabed. The debate inJamaica clearly reflected that the States with stringentenvironmental guidelines no longer endorse the principleof a global commons. They now find themselves caughtup in a conflict of interest in which their role as guardiansof the global commons is now being overshadowed bytheir desire to grab the benefits for themselves  with littleor no sense of obligation to the world community atlarge.We have also noted a tendency by countries thathave co-sponsored pioneer investors in deep-sea miningto try to avoid their international obligations towards theenvironment. We are particularly concerned that they haveplaced the interests of investors above the interests of theglobal community. We make particular mention of thetrend to withhold information from the InternationalSeabed Authority under the guise of “confidentiality” “proprietary interests”  and “information of a scientificallysensitive nature”: these are merely codes for denyingglobal communities access to information that mightallow them to prepare better for disaster prevention andother actions needed to protect the environment.Regarding nuclear issues  Papua New Guinea consistent with our shared commitment to a stable peaceful and environmentally safe world  supports theobjectives of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Together with our partners in the SouthPacific Forum  we continue to reaffirm our commitment20to maintaining the South Pacific region as a nuclear-weapon-free zone. We also express our support for theother regional nuclear-weapon-free zones in Africa  South-East Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean  and alsofor the proposed new initiatives for Central and South Asia.We call on all nuclear-weapon and threshold States tostop all testing  manufacturing and stockpiling of theseweapons and to take steps towards the destruction of allnuclear weapons. Indeed  the same principle should applyto all weapons of mass destruction.The South Pacific Forum members have alwaysmaintained that we have a right to ban transboundarymovements of radioactive and other hazardous wastes within and through the region. We also continue to sharethe position that appropriate compensatory mechanismsshould be established to compensate victims of past nucleartests and provide compensation for damage resulting fromany accidents.In conclusion  I wish to reaffirm that Papua NewGuinea is firmly committed to the United Nations Charter;to the reforms initiated by the Secretary-General  especiallythose relating to the Security Council and thereconfiguration of the regional groups within the UnitedNations system; and to the United Nations decolonizationprocess and the Nouméa Accord for the Kanak people ofNew Caledonia. We support the determination of the UnitedNations to work towards a global mechanism for natural-disaster preparedness and prevention; the special session ofthe General Assembly for the review and appraisal of theimplementation of the Barbados Programme of Action forthe Sustainable Development of Small Island DevelopingStates; and the management of the oceans and seas.Partnership in promoting change is the key toaddressing the challenges that the world will face in thetwenty-first century. I believe that the challenge for allMember States is to join together to bring abouttransparency  accountability and good governance as thebasic tenets of this Organization  its organs and subsidiarybodies. If this is achieved  the “people first” sentiment ofthe United Nations Charter will be truly embraced."
"136",5689,"POL",54,1999,"Please accept mycongratulations  Sir  on your election to the presidency ofthe General Assembly at its current session. We are indeedglad to have a distinguished statesman from Africapresiding over important deliberations on global securityand development. I am sure that your personal attributes  aswell as your diplomatic skills  will ensure the success thatis expected from the Assembly. The delegation of Polandwill do its best to assist you in your important functions.My compliments go also to the President of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-third session  Mr. Didier Opertti ofUruguay  for the outstanding commitment he demonstratedduring his presidency.It is with satisfaction that we welcome in our midstthe new Members of the United Nations: the Republic ofKiribati  the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga.It was with the utmost attention that we listened to theSecretary-General's introduction of his report on the workof the Organization. His interesting and highly stimulatingideas will guide us throughout the whole fifty-fourth sessionof the General Assembly. May I assure theSecretary-General of our deep respect and support for allhis endeavours.In my statement today  I wish to focus on the threeissues which  in my view  are at the centre of discussionswithin this Organization. These are  first  humanfreedoms  and in particular the question of rethinking theprinciple of national sovereignty and non-interference;secondly  current challenges to the United NationsCharter-based system of international security; andthirdly  coping with contradictions of globalizationthrough better international cooperation.We have recently been witnessing new  painfulmanifestations of ethnic hatred in Kosovo. Armed clasheshave again shaken the north Caucasus. East Timor isanother example of intolerance and the folly of violence.We pay homage to the victims of this violence. But thepeople in all the crisis-stricken areas expect more from usthan just words of sympathy.We should pose ourselves some questions: couldthese new outbursts of conflict have been prevented? Isthere a political will to head them off in the future? If theanswer is positive  then what should be done to translateour political commitment into action in a concerted andeffective way? How should the system of internationalrelations be improved to give people the hope that theywill not be left defenceless in the face of genocide andpersecution?The United Nations Charter-based system ofinternational security was born of the lessons of adevastating world war which started with blatantviolations of sovereignty of States. To address this reality the system of international law and institutions wasrightly geared to give those nations a sense of securityand to prevent inter-State conflict. Most of today'sconflicts  however  are of an intra-State nature. They stemfrom human rights abuses  social tensions or the collapseof State structures. Can we tackle the new challenges withexisting concepts and notions only?We have come to understand that absolutesovereignty and total non-interference are no longertenable. There is not  and there cannot be  a sovereignright to ethnic cleansing and genocide. We have learnedthat what should not be repeated is the unacceptableinaction which occurred in the past  such as in theRwandan crisis. Rwanda demonstrates what Kosovo mighthave become had we not intervened in 1999. Kosovodemonstrates what Rwanda might have been had weintervened in 1994. The burden of responsibility isenormous  the lesson clear.5At the same time  we should follow the principle thatour responsibility is the same for all ethnic groups. InKosovo the ethnic cleansing of Albanians by Serbs hasbeen stopped and reversed  but now we witness that thepresence of Serbs and Roma in Kosovo is under threat.In this decade the international community has throughits actions — recently in Kosovo and in East Timor —recognized the universal political and moral imperative toact in order to stop gross and systematic violations ofhuman rights.This recognition  setting aside the distinction betweeninter- and intra-State conflicts  reflects the spirit of theCharter of the United Nations.Indeed  the central figure of the system of the UnitedNations must be the human being — his or her right to apeaceful life  to personal freedom  to a decent existence anddignity. When human life and freedoms are assailed andindividual rights brutally violated  then we must not remainindifferent and unconcerned: we cannot stand idle.The imperative to act raises the question of the rightto act. We have recognized that the walls of sovereigntycannot be used to conceal and legitimize the abuse ofhuman rights and fundamental freedoms. Sovereigntycannot mean impunity for genocide and human rightsabuses.Let us all remember that it remains one of thefundamental objectives of the United Nations“to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights  in thedignity and worth of the human person  in the equalrights of men and women and of nations large andsmall”.The primacy of the human person and human rights however  has to be adequately reflected in the applicationof international law. This is not an easy task  first  becausethere are still too many cases where behind hypocriticallip-service to human rights there exist practices of curbingand limiting those rights for the sake of preserving politicalpower; secondly  because the legal framework ofintervention  which should ensure the possibility of quickand effective action  is too often distorted by selective andsubjective interpretations.On the one hand  the banner of humanitarianintervention should not be used as a pretext for imposingpolitical control and domination from the outside. We wantto make the walls of sovereignty surmountable  but notfor all purposes. On the other hand  the principle ofhumanitarian intervention has to be fairly and consistentlyapplied to avoid double standards.The development of international law should thusuphold the basic truth that a sustainable  lasting andsecure order in international relations can be built only onthe freedom of the human being.The principle of solidarity in international relationsshould grow in importance  since it also provides the keyto the effectiveness of the mission of the United Nations.Acting for universal observance of human rightswhile preserving the necessary content of the notion ofsovereignty raises the question of the best strategies forhumanitarian intervention. We have but to agree thatintervention by force is an instrument of last resort. Whatis preferable is an early and cooperative engagement tocorrect the practices that give rise to concern. There is nodoubt that armed intervention is a sign of the failure ofcooperative methods.We support wholeheartedly the efforts to foster anew culture of prevention. The basis for this philosophyshould be the universal recognition that internationalcommitments undertaken by States in the field of humanrights are matters of direct and legitimate concern to otherStates as well  before their abuse degenerates into a threatto international peace and security. Human rights do notbelong exclusively to the internal affairs of States.The present session of the General Assembly willlead us into the year 2000. Let this symbolic date inspireus to reflect upon the mission of the United Nations  tomake the millennium summit a truly meaningful event.On the eve of the next millennium  the world still needsthe United Nations  while the United Nations needs a newvision. Faced with new and more demanding challenges we are of the opinion that the solutions to them requirejoint and concerted actions by the whole community ofStates. The United Nations needs a reinforcedcommitment by its Member States to the purposes andprinciples enshrined in the Charter.Let us try to find new strength for the Organizationby reaching back to the intellectual and normative originsof the United Nations. Contrary to some assertions  webelieve that the Charter is not outdated in its basicmessage. What it needs is a new  fresh and visionaryreading in the context of new international realities and6challenges. For example  with respect to Chapter VIII ofthe Charter  we note that many of today's conflicts are localin nature. It is for this reason that the relationship betweenthe United Nations and regional security needs to be furtherexplored.Those actors who are closer to events and have alarger stake in regional stability might be the ones whowould be willing to react more promptly and with greaterdetermination. This is why Poland supports increasedresponsibility of regional organizations for conflictprevention and crisis management. In regions where suchorganizations exist and have the necessary potential  theyshould be involved more actively in solving substantialproblems. One possible example of how to use themconstructively is the Organization for Security andCooperation in Europe.Thus  the key to effective use of the principle ofsubsidiarity is closer political and operational cooperationbetween the Security Council and regional organizations.A debate on United Nations reform has been going onfor a number of years. The fiftieth anniversary of theOrganization stimulated the discussion  which resulted in auniversal understanding of the need for changes. Many ofthose changes have already been implemented  thanks to thetireless efforts of the Secretary-General. This processshould  however  be deepened and accelerated. The SecurityCouncil offers a case in point.The Security Council  upon which primaryresponsibility has been conferred for the maintenance ofinternational peace and security  occasionally finds itdifficult to act in situations of inter-State or local armedconflicts  even when those situations have a dangerousspillover potential. Whether for reasons of broad ideologicalmotivations or narrow national interests  members can blockvitally needed decisions  and adversely affect the securityof certain regions. How are we to eliminate situations inwhich the Security Council is prevented from taking up itsresponsibilities? How are we to increase the effectivenessof the Security Council  combining effectiveness withenhanced representativeness? Reform of the SecurityCouncil is long overdue: let us undertake a decisive effortto make it a reality. Let us think anew of how to strengthenthe authority of the Council and preclude the possibility thatits decisions will be ignored or misimplemented byindividual States.(spoke in French)A few weeks ago  two young Africans froze to deathon their flight between Conakry and Brussels. They hadstowed away in the landing gear of the aircraft. They leftbehind a moving appeal addressed to the people andpoliticians in charge in Europe that has already beenquoted in this Hall. In view of the special nature of thatappeal  I should once again like to quote from it. Theywrote:“Help us. ... We are suffering enormously in Africa.... We have war  disease and we lack food. ... Wewish to be educated and we ask you to help us sothat we can study and be  in Africa  just the same asyou are”.There is no more eloquent appeal to people's hearts andconsciences than those words of despair written bychildren.We must find the right solutions to the social andeconomic failures  to the threats and to the lack ofprospects that people and societies face and consider theurgent need to change the present framework ofinternational cooperation. Frustration and the lack ofsocial action cause conflict and a lack of stability. Wemust think about how to integrate our social andeconomic programmes with the general imperative of thenew culture of prevention.Poland is prepared to participate in these efforts  theaim of which is to build a world based on theseprinciples. However  our resources are limited. Ourcountry is only just emerging from a period of majoreconomic crisis caused by the communist system and itscentralized planning  with its waste and bad management.Even so  we are now creating a complex and effectivesystem of cooperation for development that willdemonstrate our commitment in poverty eradicationactivities. At the same time  we are prepared to share withother countries the development experience we ourselveshave acquired during the process of reform of ourpolitical and economic systems over the last 10 years oftransformation.Globalization must become a process with a humanface. Certain basic principles must be better integratedinto the development machinery: specifically  solidarity;combating marginalization; responsibility; and equalopportunity. Combating marginalization: that of the leastdeveloped countries  which do not yet enjoy the benefits7of globalization. Responsibility: that of Governments inimplementing policies of good governance  in respectinghuman rights and in being aware that the well-being of allpeople everywhere is just as important as the well-being oftheir own nations. Equal opportunity: for the poorest  andthose who are still sidelined by society. And solidarity: infacing our common challenges — terrorism  organizedcrime  environmental threats  natural disasters  AIDS —together.Unfortunately  we still have much left to do before weattain these goals. The 1999 United Nations DevelopmentProgramme (UNDP) Human Development Report providesfresh  shocking evidence of social breakdown and threats tohuman security. The challenges I have just mentioned arejust part of a more universal question: how can we respondto the new realities of the world? Global policies have notbeen fully adapted to cover the increasing number ofcomplicated and contradictory phenomena that cannot betackled with traditional diplomatic instruments. The processof designing policies is still basically the job of individualnations  whereas the challenges we are facing requirecreative cooperation at the global level. It is for this reasonthat  Governments must further integrate the idea ofinternational cooperation into their national policies  whileavoiding the temptation of authoritarianism. This  however highlights the urgent need to revise and strengthen ourinstitutional arrangements regarding the design of globalpolicy  particularly with regard to the most complexproblems of trade  finance and the environment.International cooperation must be more open to otheractors in civil society by reflecting the rich network ofrelationships. While several countries are re-evaluating theirnational policies  democratizing their societies  privatizingtheir national economies and decentralizing economic andpolitical power  at the international level we are  broadlyspeaking  still confining ourselves to conventionalintergovernmental actions. The United Nations mustpromote active international cooperation wherebygovernments and the various sectors of civil society acttogether towards common goals.In this connection  we welcome the “Partners forDevelopment” initiative of the Secretary-General of theUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development(UNCTAD). By breaking from normal practice  this willallow more active participation by the public and privatesectors and by representatives of government and thebusiness and intellectual worlds in resolving variouscomplex development problems.(spoke in English)As someone who has witnessed the atrocities butalso the tremendous progress that the twentieth centuryhas brought us  I look towards the coming century withmuch optimism. This optimism is justified first andforemost by the liberation of nations and peoples  thewave of democratization  the market reforms all over theworld and the universal understanding of human rightsideals. Fewer people live in constant fear of arbitraryarrest  torture or worse. I also look towards the comingcentury with hope because I see the predominant will toconsolidate those recent achievements."
"137",5715,"PRK",54,1999,"At the outset  please allow me to express  onbehalf of the delegation of the Democratic People'sRepublic of Korea  our pleasure on congratulating you Sir  on your election to the presidency of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-fourth session. We believe that yourdiplomatic skill and rich experience will greatly contributeto our work at this session.I avail myself of this opportunity to extend mygratitude to Mr. Didier Opertti  Minister for ForeignAffairs of the Republic of Uruguay  for his tangiblecontribution to United Nations activities during his tenureof his office as President of the General Assembly at itsfifty-third session. I also express appreciation for theefforts of the Secretary-General towards strengthening thefunctions and the role of the United Nations.The current session  which is being held at thehistoric turn of the century  has an important mission togive new hope to humankind. The challenges and thedifficulties facing international society are growing evermore complex and intricate. The cold war has ended butdomination and hegemony continue to exist. High-handedness and arbitrariness continue to pose majorthreats to international peace and security. Because of thehigh-handedness and arbitrariness  so prevalent ininternational relations  the principles of justice andfairness are often disregarded and the principle ofsovereign equality — a lifeline to United Nationsactivities — is shaken to its very foundation.Moreover  we have recently seen grave situationswhereby the internal affairs of sovereign States areinterfered in by force. Today international society mustchoose one of the two following options: whether thetwenty-first century will be a century of independence equality and peace  or whether it will be a century ofhigh-handedness and arbitrariness. If we choose the latter all countries with weak national defence capabilities willbe vulnerable to bombing  as was the case in Yugoslavia.As we are all well aware  the Korean peninsulastands at the centre of international peace and security.Therefore  as a party directly concerned  I wish to takethis opportunity to present the details of views andpositions regarding the present situation there. This will 6we believe  be a most effective contribution to the work ofthe current session.At present  the Democratic People's Republic of Koreais being blatantly portrayed as a dangerous area of nuclearweapons proliferation and a source of missile threats. Forexample  an empty tunnel is suspected of being anunderground nuclear facility and a satellite is labelled aballistic missile. These are now being used as pretexts forreviving a “star wars” plan  a phantom of the cold war  ina variant named “the missile defence system”. Meanwhile the attempts of a defeated State to rearm and to re-emergeas a military power are being accelerated at the fastestpossible speed and even a debate calling for nucleararmaments has come to the fore.Pursuant to operation plan 502798  aimed atpreemptive attacks against the Democratic People'sRepublic of Korea  large-scale strike forces have beensurreptitiously amassed in and around South Korea. Theyare entering into actual combat readiness through variousjoint military exercises. It is becoming almost a reality  notsimply an assumption  that the Korean peninsula willbecome a second Balkans. In the Balkan region  ahumanitarian crisis served as a pretext for war  whereas onthe Korean peninsula  the so-called missile issue is likely tobe used instead.Our satellite launch is an exercise of equal rights inthe use of outer space that is recognized by the UnitedNations. Strengthening our national defence capabilities isan exercise of our sovereign right of legitimate defence: itdoes not constitute a violation of any obligations theDemocratic People's Republic of Korea has under existinginternational treaties. Nevertheless  the Democratic People'sRepublic of Korea has become a target of United Stateshigh-handedness and arbitrariness. The reason is very clear:placing the entire Korean peninsula under its control is atop priority of the Asia strategy of the United States. AsYugoslavia becomes an impediment to United Statesdomination over the Balkan area  so the adherence of theDemocratic People's Republic of Korea to socialism isconsidered an obstacle to its Asia strategy.Much the same can be said about why Japan is sohysterically resorting to a campaign against the DemocraticPeople's Republic of Korea. Japan has not liquidated itspast crimes against the Democratic People's Republic ofKorea  alone amongst countries. Japan is miscalculatingthat  if the Democratic People's Republic of Korea werestifled  the issue of liquidating its past crimes would fadeaway by itself. Not only that  Japan is fabricating threats one after the other  as an excuse to become a militaryPower.Our people love peace and aspire to it even morethan others: they lived for the first half of this centuryunder the colonial rule of Japan and they have been livingfor the second in a state of belligerence with the UnitedStates. Nevertheless  we do not beg for peace: we want apeace in which we can enjoy an independent life  not thepeace of slaves denied all freedom.Sovereignty is the lifeline of the Democratic People'sRepublic of Korea and socialism is the life of our people.It is the unshakeable will of our people  and State policyof the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  to defend consolidate and develop to the utmost our own style ofsocialism  chosen by the people themselves. This is anexercise of the right to self-determination and freedom ofchoice recognized by the United Nations. The present-dayconfrontation on the Korean peninsula is in essence aconfrontation between those who are masters of their owncountry trying to defend all that is theirs and the foreignforces attempting to harm them. This is the main factorunderlying the continuing instability on the Koreanpeninsula.Herein also lies the answer to the question of who isposing a threat to whom. It is not easy for our people whose territory and population are small and who stilllack almost everything  to defend their sovereignty single-handedly in the face of the collective  hostile powerpolitics of the United States and its forces ofsubordination. We have no alternative but to strengthenour national defence capability ourselves  although thismeans we must tighten our belts. Because of our lack ofcapacity  Comrade Kim Jong Il  the great leader of ourpeople  is employing an “army first” policy. This policyis our own unique way of uniting the whole people withthe army into a bulwark  thus enabling us both to defendthe country and develop its economy. Despite thepersistent political  military and economic moves ofhostile forces to suffocate us  up until now we havesucceeded in defending our sovereignty and preventinganother war on the Korean peninsula. This proves thestrength of the “army first” policy  for defendingsocialism and ensuring peace with weapons.The way to ensure lasting peace and security on theKorean peninsula is to end the hostile relations betweenthe Democratic People's Republic of Korea and theUnited States and reunify Korea. The Democratic People'sRepublic of Korea and the United States are still in a7state of temporary armistice. Easing tension on the Koreanpeninsula and eliminating the danger of war will bepossible when the United States discards  among otherthings  its hostile policy against the Democratic People'sRepublic of Korea and concludes a peace agreement withit. There is no convincing reason why the United Statesmust continue to antagonize the Democratic People'sRepublic of Korea alone in north-east Asia  almost 10 yearsafter the end of the cold war. We do not want war  but wedo strive to achieve the peaceful reunification of ourcountry.We have already made it clear that we would notregard the United States as a permanent enemy. We havealso fully shown our good faith through our sincereimplementation over the last five years of the AgreedFramework between the United States and the DemocraticPeople's Republic of Korea. We have also made it clearthat  while we will make continued efforts to catch up withneighbouring countries in the field of peaceful spaceactivities  we are ready for discussions on the missile issueat any time  if hostile nations are sincere in their intentionsto dispel our concern. Now it is the turn of the UnitedStates to prove its good faith to us with deeds  if it does notharbour ill intent towards the Democratic People's Republicof Korea. It is fortunate that the United States has recentlydecided on a partial lifting of economic sanctions againstthe Democratic People's Republic of Korea  but we lookforward to a comprehensive and genuine lifting of them all.If the United States stops pursuing its hostile policytowards the Democratic People's Republic of Korea andmoves towards improved relations  we also will respondwith good faith. For the present  we are to have high-leveltalks towards a settlement of outstanding issues between theDemocratic People's Republic of Korea and the UnitedStates. These are to be held in response to the request fromthe United States  and missile launches will be suspendedwhile the talks are under way.The United States should not attempt to test thestrength of our military capability or frighten and subdueour people with military threats and provocations. Recklessacts such as these will surely result in a strong self-defenceresponse with possibly catastrophic consequences.The United Nations should fulfil its responsibility forensuring peace on the Korean peninsula by implementing as early as possible  General Assembly resolution 3390(XXX) B  calling for dissolution of the United NationsCommand.The early achievement of national reunification isthe long-cherished desire of our nation. At the same time it is a prerequisite for ensuring durable peace and securityon the Korean peninsula. As long as Korea remainsdivided  the situation on the Korean peninsula and itssurrounding areas will never be stable. This is detrimentalto peace in Asia and also in the rest of the world.We have already established national reunificationprinciples. The three principles of independence  peacefulreunification and great national unity  which the Northand South of Korea confirmed and made public at homeand abroad  in the 4 July joint statement  constitute thegrand reunification programme. They form thecornerstone of national reunification  which the UnitedNations officially welcomed in the resolution adopted atthe twentieth session of the General Assembly.The most above board and reasonable way toachieve reunification is the confederal formula  by whichthe North and South of Korea would be able to realizenational reunification fairly and smoothly on the basis ofpreserving each other's ideas and systems as they are.Any attempts by one side to change the other  to makeclaims about the “sunshine policy” and engagement  whileignoring the reality that two different ideas and systemsare existing in the North and South  will only meanconfrontations and conflict.In order to eliminate confrontations between theNorth and the South  and to promote nationalreconciliation and unity  the South Korean authoritiesshould abolish  inter alia  the national security law  whichhas identified fellow countrymen as the enemy. The factthat delegates of patriotic organizations for reunificationin South Korea who visited Pyongyang last August wereimprisoned  because of their participation in the grandreunification festival  shows a clear picture of anti-reunification acts and human rights violations by SouthKorean authorities wielding the national security law. TheSouth Korean authorities are now talking aboutreconciliation and cooperation with the North. But behindthe scenes  they are criminalizing contacts and exchangesamong the people and other personages of the North andSouth of Korea and are suppressing patriotic reunificationforces by invoking the national security law.Therefore  as long as the national security law andanti-national and anti-reunification law remains in place it is impossible to achieve national reconciliation andunity and realize contacts and exchanges between theNorth and South of Korea. Only when the South Korean8authorities take an attitude of national independence andpatriotism  instead of depending upon foreign forces andcollaborating with them  will North-South relations becomecharacterized by trust and reconciliation and will a decisivebreakthrough be opened for reunification.On 18 April of last year  the respected General KimJong Il put forward the five point policy of great nationalunity to hasten the independent and peaceful reunificationof the country. That policy is  first  to base oneself on theprinciple of national reunification; secondly  to unite thewhole nation under the banners of patriotism and nationalreunification; thirdly  to improve North-South relations;fourthly  to struggle against alien domination and anti-reunification forces; and fifthly  to develop exchanges contacts and dialogues and to strengthen solidarity andcoalition throughout the entire nation.Great unity of the whole nation would be nationalreunification. Even though there are still numerousdifficulties and obstacles in the way of nationalreunification  we are optimistic about its prospects. Ournation is one  and so is our motherland. Under the bannerof national reunification  our nation will achieve greatnational unity without fail.The twenty-first century should be a century ofindependence  in which “dominationism” and high-handedness are eliminated and the sovereignty of all Statesis equally respected. In order to bring about a new centuryof independence and of durable peace  a just internationalorder that never tolerates high-handedness and arbitrarinessshould be established.To this end  the principle of respect for sovereigntyshould be strictly adhered to as the supreme principle ininternational relations. The assertion that disarmament human rights and humanitarian issues should be placedabove sovereignty should be firmly denounced as adangerous attempt to justify both high-handedness andarbitrariness. Disputes cannot be properly settled by high-handed and arbitrary measures  such as sanctions and theuse of force. They should be resolved through dialogue andnegotiation on all accounts.Countries of Africa and the Middle East that areinsisting they should be responsible for resolving theirissues through dialogue and negotiations are enjoying thesupport of the international community. What is importantin establishing a just international order is to ensure fairnessin the formulation and application of international treatiesrelating to disarmament  human rights and so forth. Inparticular  the double standard of abusing internationallaw as a pretext for interference in the internal affairs ofsovereign States and the use of force against sovereignStates should be strictly rejected.In order for the United Nations to fulfil itsresponsibilities and its role in accordance with theCharter  democracy should be practised in United Nationsactivities. Without enhancing the authority of the GeneralAssembly  and without an early restructuring of theSecurity Council  the United Nations will be unable tomeet the demands of a rapidly changing situation and tocope with new challenges. The authority of the GeneralAssembly  where all Member States are represented andinteract democratically on an equal footing  should beenhanced.If the General Assembly is empowered to deliberateon crucial issues  such as ensuring international peace andsecurity  and finally examines important Security Councilresolutions concerning sanctions and the use of force  thiswill be conducive to ensuring fairness in United Nationsactivities and preventing arbitrariness by individualcountries. The Security Council should be reformed insuch a way as to have all regions equally represented inits composition and to ensure full transparency in all ofits activities.In this regard  we oppose under any circumstancesthe permanent membership of a defeated nation that hasnot liquidated its past crimes. We are of the view that theproposal put forward by member countries of the Non-Aligned Movement to first increase non-permanent seats which is relatively easy to agree upon at this stage deserves sincere consideration. Since the Security Councilis taking its actions on behalf of the general UnitedNations membership  its working methods and particularly  decision-making processes should be mademore transparent for all of the Member States.The Government of the Democratic People'sRepublic of Korea will continue to maintainindependence  peace and friendship as the fundamentalideals of its foreign policy.We are convinced that attaching importance toindependence  peace and friendship in internationalrelations conforms with the purposes and principles of theUnited Nations and makes a contribution to peace andsecurity on the Korean peninsula  in Asia and in the restof the world.9In conclusion  I assure the Assembly that thedelegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Koreawill make sincere efforts for the success of the currentsession and will extend its active cooperation to the workof the presidency."
"138",5760,"PRT",54,1999,"Allow me  Sir  tocongratulate you on your election to the presidency of theGeneral Assembly. Your election is a well-deservedtribute to the role that Namibia is playing in theinternational arena. Your human  professional andintellectual qualities will certainly ensure positiveguidance of our work.Allow me also to take this opportunity to pay tributeto the outgoing President  Mr. Didier Opertti  for thededicated and competent manner in which he conductedthe work of the fifty-third session of the Assembly. Ireserve a special word of appreciation and esteem for theSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for the notable wayin which he has been fulfilling his difficult task at amoment when so many and such complex challenges facethe United Nations and so many hopes are placed on theOrganization’s capacity to act.I address the Assembly still under the impact of thewave of emotion  indignation and revulsion that sweptover the entire world as a result of the tragedy that befellthe people of East Timor after the announcement of theresults of the popular consultation on the future of thatTerritory  which was conducted in an exemplary mannerby the United Nations on 30 August.Anyone who saw the pictures of the Timorese onvoting day — clutching their registration cards  waiting inorderly lines for the long-awaited moment to expressfreely their will — must have reacted with strong emotionand surely perceived  on those faces and in those gestures the universal appeal of democracy  freedom and justice.The striking contrast between the example of silentcourage and civic sense given by the Timorese whenmassively participating in the ballot and the barbaric actsof revenge that followed clearly reveals what was at stakein this process.I do not wish to dwell on the history  unfortunately solittle known  of the struggle for independence waged by thepeople of East Timor over the last 24 years. Nor will Irecount the procession of horrors they had to suffer and unfortunately  are still suffering to win their freedom.History teaches us that the birth of a new nation is usuallya conquest by its people  achieved as a result of a painfulprocess. The case of East Timor is not an exception. Bytheir courage  determination and willingness to fight andsuffer  the people of East Timor have earned the right tobecome an independent nation. I wish to pay tribute tothem  as well as to their leader  Xanana Gusmao  whosehuman and political qualities have commanded the respectof all who have met him. And on behalf of the Portuguesepeople  I would like here to bow before the memory of allthe Timorese who paid with their lives for the dignity oftheir people.The events of the last few weeks in East Timor haverocked the conscience of the international community andforce us to reflect on the responsibility of the UnitedNations  as the representative organ of that community  forthe construction of a more just and humane internationalsociety. As universal awareness of the inalienable value ofthe dignity of the human being takes hold at this end of thecentury  an increasingly heavy responsibility is falling tothe members of the international community to articulateprinciples and interests  in the knowledge that for intereststo be legitimate principles must be upheld. That awarenessdemands  from all those holding public office  prompt andfirm responses to moral and juridically unacceptablepolitical behaviour  as well as to the humanitarian tragediesand cycles of regional instability that these provoke.World public opinion  which takes shape before oureyes as a result of the globalization of the means ofcommunication  expects those answers from us and hastrouble understanding why double standards are so oftenused in situations where identical principles are at stake.We all know that the international community has notalways been able to rise to meet these challenges. Sufficeit here to recall the tragedy of Rwanda  the cases of theSudan and Somalia  the delay in reacting to the conflicts inBosnia and Kosovo  and so many other situations of humansuffering that  tragically  were inadequately addressed.We should therefore pay tribute to the energeticreaction of the international community to the wave ofviolence and terror that struck East Timor in recent weeksand to the resulting mobilization of a multinational forcetasked with guaranteeing the peace and security of thatterritory  protecting and supporting the United NationsMission in East Timor and facilitating the humanitarianassistance operations for the people of that territory. Letme offer my thanks to all those who have contributed tothis outcome and  in particular  to the countries that havebeen willing to constitute this force.In this instance  and beyond the dramatic humanaspects  the very credibility of the United Nations was atstake. How could the United Nations  having organizedthe popular consultation  betray the confidence placed init by the people of East Timor? Although the reaction wasnot as prompt as the Timorese deserved and Portugalwould have wished  the adoption of Security Councilresolution 1264 (1999) shows the world that the Councildoes not remain indifferent to challenges to its authority nor does it allow them to go unanswered.Let this case be not an exception  but rather anexample for the future. Swiftness of reaction by theSecurity Council is a condition of its authority andeffectiveness.Much of what has happened is irreparable andcannot be forgotten. I say this with great bitterness  andmay I add that in this as well as in other cases  we cannotencourage a culture of impunity.Nevertheless  the arrival of the multinational force inEast Timor is opening up a horizon of hope  and now wemust take care of the living and attempt to save whatevercan be saved.I consider the following to be immediate priorities.First  guaranteeing security in East Timor is the prioritytask before us so as to ensure respect for the individualrights of the Timorese and to allow them at last to live inpeace without the threat of violence and persecution.Without security we will not be able to undertake with allthe necessary vigour and amplitude the urgent tasks ofhumanitarian assistance to the population of East Timor.Secondly  we must channel humanitarian aid to EastTimor with the utmost urgency  to feed  to treat and toprovide shelter to the tens of thousands of displacedpeople scattered all over the territory; to take care of allthose whose belongings have been systematicallyplundered; to bring comfort to those who have lostmembers of their families and friends and who helplesslywitnessed scenes of horror that will be forever engravedin their memories; to reunite families — in brief  to cometo the rescue of a population traumatized by an orgy ofviolence to which it fell victim.12Thirdly  we must attend to the situation of thoseTimorese  well over 100 000 of them  who have beendeported to Indonesia or have fled the Territory and whoare now mostly in West Timor. The continuous access ofhumanitarian assistance to those populations is urgent andindispensable  including by the Office of the United NationsHigh Commission for Refugees and other institutions forthe protection of human rights  to safeguard the life and thedignity of the refugees and to ensure their unimpeded returnto East Timor.Fourthly  we must accelerate the transfer of effectiveauthority in the Territory to the United Nations  as foreseenby the Agreements of 5 May  as a consequence of the resultof the popular consultation held on 30 August. Any delaywhatsoever would be unacceptable. It is also important todefine a timetable for the complete withdrawal  in theshortest possible time  of the Indonesian forces in theTerritory. That is the only way to restore peace and stabilityin the region and to lay the foundations of a healthyrelationship between the future State of Timor andIndonesia  a country which we hope will be able toconsolidate the democratic promise heralded by its currenttransition process.Finally  there needs to be an enormous reconstructioneffort in the Territory  which was totally devastated bypillaging  looting and destruction during recent days. Tothis end  the generous commitment of the internationalcommunity will be indispensable.Portugal has expressed its full willingness to contributeto all of these tasks. Owing to the responsibilities it hastowards the brotherly people of East Timor and theunconditional solidarity that unites both peoples  Portugalhas expressed  from the first hour  its readiness to join themultinational force. To avoid any delay — since everyminute counts  in terms of lives and in terms ofsuffering — we agreed  while ready to participateimmediately  to defer our presence in the force to a laterstage.With regard to humanitarian assistance andreconstruction for East Timor  we are doing  and willcontinue to do  our utmost. I would like here to appealvigorously to the international community  to thespecialized agencies of the United Nations and to the non-governmental organizations to contribute to this effort.With the Territory under occupation  and the attemptat annexation by Indonesia never recognized by the UnitedNations  the people of East Timor waited a quarter of acentury to exercise the right of self-determination towhich they were entitled as the people of a Non-Self-Governing Territory  as prescribed by the United Nations.Within the framework of resolution 37/30 of 1982 Portugal  as the administering Power of the Territory Indonesia and the United Nations at last arrived at anAgreement on 5 May.The popular consultation was agreed upon  withexplicit reference  both in the Agreement of 5 May and inSecurity Council resolution 1236 (1999) of 7 May  to theresolutions of the General Assembly that have representedand continue to represent the Magna Carta of the right ofcolonial peoples to self-determination: resolutions 1514(XV)  1541 (XV) and 2625 (XXV).In spite of all the intimidation  the people of EastTimor democratically exercised on 30 August their rightto self-determination and chose  by a clear andunequivocal majority  their collective future  therebyacquiring  unconditionally and irrevocably  the right toconstitute an independent State at the end of thetransitional administration period that the United Nationswill soon initiate.East Timor is reaching freedom with wounds andscars of past suffering; but it is carrying the embryo ofhope  and it will now  I sincerely hope  arrive  free ofresentment  as a member of the community of States.(spoke in English)The question of East Timor is about a people andabout fundamentals: human dignity  international law andmoral and universal conscience.In spite of all the terrible events of the past  let ussalute  at the end of the International Decade for theEradication of Colonialism  the self-determination of EastTimor.Allow me to end by formulating a vow and a hope:that as soon as possible the General Assembly of theUnited Nations may hear the free and sovereign voice ofTimor Lorosae."
"139",5806,"PRY",54,1999,"Atthe outset  I wish to greet the President of the GeneralAssembly  His Excellency Theo-Ben Gurirab  Minister forForeign Affairs of Namibia  whom I congratulate on hiselection and offer all the cooperation of the delegation ofParaguay in his work.In greeting Secretary-General Kofi Annan  Icongratulate him on his excellent work for theOrganization and reaffirm the full support of the Republicof Paraguay for his efforts on behalf of world peace.At the same time  the delegation of Paraguay wishesto welcome the Republics of Kiribati and Nauru and theKingdom of Tonga to membership of the United Nations.We are convinced that their work will contribute tointernational peace and development and that theirpresence among us is further evidence of theuniversalization foreseen under the Charter.This regular session of the General Assembly findsParaguay at a crucial moment in its political life and forits expectations for economic and social development. TheParaguayans have very recently overcome internaldestabilization. However  a rapid  broad and heroicmobilization of the citizenry  in particular the members ofParliament  youth  workers and peasants  formed animpenetrable barrier against an attempt to foment aconstitutional collapse and provided support for theresistance to this attack on democracy.As a result of the crisis of March 1999  the gravityand importance of which caused it to be followed by themedia throughout the world  a Government of nationalunity was established in the framework of the NationalConstitution. That Government  which I have the honourto represent before this Assembly  is composed of allpolitical parties through democratically electedparliamentarians. Today  it faces the great challenge of5pulling Paraguay out of chronic economic stagnation andgreat social inequity.In various international forums  and yet again in thisarena of brotherhood among the States of the world Paraguay appeals for the solidarity and cooperation of themultilateral and bilateral organizations in carrying out itseconomic reactivation programme and the implementationof social and anti-poverty policies. This activity will be thebasis and guarantee of the survival of our democracy.In this context  for the first time in my country's recenthistory  the political parties  the authorities of the State andthe representatives of civil society have agreed in a patrioticconsensus on policies and strategies to rechannel economicgrowth  alleviate poverty  combat social exclusion andachieve well-being for our people. Democracy  as an idealform of organization and coexistence  will be insured forhistory by sustainable development  which will guaranteethe material well-being of the impoverished majority.In this respect  my country has subscribed to and fullysupports the principles  objectives and measures adopted atthe United Nations Conferences on social development population and development  and women. We areunswervingly committed to political democracy because weknow that we must consolidate it with justice  social equity economic growth and sustainable development. MyGovernment is firmly decided to participate and act jointlywith other countries of the world at all levels to enhancenatural resources and preserve the environment as anirreplaceable framework for human development.In a significant response to the requirements of theCairo Conference  Paraguay has adopted a national plan anda Council for Reproductive Health. With the establishmentof the Women's Secretariat  we have strengthened women'spresence in government and made available a programmefor women's equality in education. This measure hasallowed us to incorporate gender equality into educationalreform and to adopt a women's equal-opportunity plan.We have attributed equal importance to theConvention on the Rights of the Child and to thecommitments made at the Children's Summit. In thisrespect  the Executive Power has submitted a code forminor's for parliamentary approval.Clearly  these important steps have had a positiveeffect. Paraguay today  according to the most recent reportof the United Nations Development Programme  is in acomparatively improved position that favours its humandevelopment indicators.The dynamic of today's world is an unavoidablechallenge demanding not only domestic democraticcooperation  but also negotiations that will raise countriesto a level of development at which they can work withother regional and multilateral partners.Convinced of this  Paraguay  freely and in fullsovereignty  has decided to join the great Southern ConeCommon Market (MERCOSUR) project  a regionalexperiment that has proved to be a useful instrument foraddressing the challenges of an ever-changing worldeconomy. Thus  we look forward to the opening ofnegotiations to establish a free-trade zone betweenMERCOSUR and the European Union. Similarly Paraguay is actively participating in the ambitious FreeTrade Area of the Americas  an undertaking that willhave enormous repercussions for the American continent.In its decisive struggle for comprehensive progress my country is participating with renewed hope and greatfaith in the ideals that formed the basis for theestablishment and existence of the United Nations. Wetherefore reaffirm our full commitment to the principlesof multilateralism  equal sovereignty of States and respectfor the legal order that support the essential principles ofthe Organization.In this respect  Paraguay is examining the process ofchange and the strengthening of this Organization. Wewill support all efforts to improve its efficiency andoperational capacity to maintain peace and contribute tothe human development of all peoples.Nevertheless  my country believes that the structureof the United Nations must be made less costly and moreefficient. The Organization should strengthen theEconomic and Social Council  continue to streamline theSecretariat and reduce the overlap of its specializedagencies  through efficient rationalization of the flow ofresources for cooperation for sustainable development.Given the challenges facing the United Nations  weattach considerable importance to the adoption ofmeasures to ensure the good financial functioning of itsorgans  and we therefore urge Member States  particularlythe most developed  to meet their financial obligations asan essential prerequisite for the reform of theOrganization.6Similarly  the Government of my country does notconsider that the present composition of the SecurityCouncil reflects the presence of all the main actors of theinternational community  nor that its numbers are inproportion to the totality of Members. Only an increase inthe number of permanent and non-permanent Members willensure more equitable participation within the SecurityCouncil and  thus the necessary political balance. In thatrespect  the progressive process of internationaldemocratization must conclude with the elimination of theright of veto of its permanent members.Therefore  Paraguay supports the aspiration of LatinAmerica and other continents to have greater representationin the Council  where the presence of Brazil as a permanentmember  could represent the great interests of our region.Paraguay is convinced that maintaining internationalpeace and security must continue to be one of the prioritiesof the United Nations  in particular in those areas ofconflict where its intervention can contribute decisively tostabilizing the situation on the ground and achieving peace.As proof of its commitment to these noble purposes the Government of Paraguay has officially offered theSecretary-General the participation of members of its armedforces in United Nations peacekeeping operations  adecision which will contribute to this noble humanitarianpurpose. To that end  a battalion of elite officers of theParaguay army is receiving special training to participate inthose operations  in accordance with the memorandum ofunderstanding to be signed between the Republic ofParaguay and the United Nations.However  we truly believe that the best guarantee ofpeace  together with the monitoring of human rights andequal opportunity for development  is to reduce armamentsprogressively and in a sustained manner until they aretotally eliminated.Paraguay strongly condemns terrorism in all its forms regarding it as one of the most serious threats to oursocieties. In that respect  we have supported all the UnitedNations initiatives to counteract this scourge  making clearour resolve to prevent it  combat it and eliminate it. It istimely to recall that my country has itself suffered from theeffects of this terrible scourge; in this very year we havesuffered the horrendous assassination of the Vice-Presidentof the Republic  Luis Mar'a Argaña. I take this opportunityfor the President of the Republic of Paraguay to thank theGeneral Assembly for the tribute which was paid to him.Paraguay will not cease its struggle to eradicate terroristbands  which are alien to our tradition and our history.With regard to other scourges which afflict oursocieties  I must emphasize with great satisfaction theefforts which my country is making in the crusade againstillicit drug-trafficking and related crimes  a struggle whichis carried out with the greatest cooperation. The twentiethspecial session of the United Nations  on the question ofdrugs  held in New York in June 1998  conveyed in itsdecisions that spirit  which should lead us inexorably tothe final destruction of the merchants of death  a victorywhich will be achieved with the shared responsibility ofthe nations committed to the crusade.These purposes will be achieved with the faithfulfulfilment of the commitments undertaken with regard tohuman rights and fundamental freedoms. In this respect my country has followed the recommendations of theUnited Nations with regard to signing  adhering to andratifying those commitments  whose purpose it is tostrengthen the framework for the promotion andprotection of the rights of the individual. Internationallegal instruments in this regard form part of the law in theRepublic of Paraguay.For that reason  my Government accepts verificationand monitoring by organizations concerned with theprotection of human rights  thus complying with theprovisions of the covenants which it has ratified  as acommitment of its will to fulfil them. We must note herethat Paraguay has just received a visit from the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights  which arrivedin the country in response to an invitation by theGovernment.With regard to the priorities of justice concerningcrimes of international scope  we find it very satisfactoryto note a most promising event: the approval in 1998 ofthe Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court  topass judgement on individuals accused of the crimeswhich most offend the human conscience. Paraguay being one of the signatories  has submitted this documentfor parliamentary approval.Furthermore  Paraguay  whose population includes15 per cent of foreigners  the majority of whom live inborder areas  free of segregation or discrimination  noteswith satisfaction that the problem of the Balkans ismoving back to its natural ambit  the United NationsSecurity Council  which must necessarily approve anydecision.7Our permanent  determined support for the Conferenceon Disarmament is one of the pillars of our internationalpolicy. Paraguay  which supported the process ofdecolonization and the autonomy of peoples from the timethe United Nations was established  has followed with greatconcern the events in East Timor. I sincerely hope that withthe efforts of the United Nations  the best solution will befound to the problem  with the consecration of the rights ofthis people  legitimized in the referendum and encouragedby our Organization.My country has firmly decided to keep to the essentialprinciples of coexistence and civilization; this is a necessaryresult of its belonging to the international community.Following the principle of universality  Paraguay supportsthe right of all the peoples of the world to make theirvoices heard at the United Nations.Paraguay believes that the situation in the China Straitmust be resolved within the framework of international law non-aggression and peaceful coexistence of nations.I cannot fail to state here that we share the sorrow ofthe people of the Republic of China at the catastropheafflicting its territory. We must all commit ourselves tooffering cooperation and help to achieve its full recovery.In my country there is an unswerving commitment todemocracy and the belief that this can be consolidated onlythrough justice  social equity  economic growth andsustainable development. That is why my Government hasresolved to participate and act together with other countriesin all efforts aimed at preserving natural resources and theenvironment  an indispensable task for comprehensivedevelopment. For the same reasons  in this year whenhumanity will achieve the surprising figure of six billioninhabitants in the world  we  the Heads of State andGovernment and political leaders and officials have thehistoric responsibility to respond to the needs andexpectations of this huge world population. But let us notdo it with hunger  thirst  wars  terrorism  discrimination genocide  tyranny and injustice — let us do it withresponsibility  with positive actions  and with security forthe human person.On the threshold of the new millennium  Paraguay isprepared to participate in this urgent task of improvinghuman civilization."
"140",5825,"PSE",54,1999,"Mr.President  it gives me great pleasure to see you presidingover this new session of the General Assembly after yourlong struggle to gain freedom  along with Sam Nujoma Nelson Mandela and others who fought to bring an end tothe era of colonialism  apartheid and foreign occupation.Your presence here today leading this session of theGeneral Assembly attests to the victory achieved by thepeople of Namibia in the battle for freedom andindependence. It strengthens the hope of the Palestinianpeople that the dawn of their freedom and the independenceof their homeland  Palestine  is near. Furthermore  thevictory of your friendly country  Namibia  affirms theconstructive role played by the United Nations in theeradication of the colonialism that has burdened oppressedpeoples and in enabling them to gain their nationalindependence. I call upon the United Nations to continue toundertake this historic role to eliminate all forms ofoccupation and colonialism and to strengthen thefoundations of peace throughout the world.As I congratulate and welcome you  Sir  I would beremiss if I did not extend our gratitude to your predecessor Mr. Didier Opertti. It also gives me great pleasure toexpress our deep appreciation to Mr. Kofi Annan  theSecretary-General  for his distinguished role in leading thisinternational Organization and promoting for world peace.I also want to congratulate the three new members ofthe United Nations: the Republic of Kiribati  the Republicof Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga. Their membership isan important step towards the realization of the universalityof the Organization.I address the Assembly today — the representatives ofthe international community — for the second consecutiveyear  seeking the continuation of support for the realizationof the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people particularly at this crucial and sensitive stage that liesbetween us and the declaration of our independentPalestinian State and sovereignty over our liberated land.This requires the strengthening of international efforts inorder to really achieve a just solution to the question ofPalestine  the crux of the Middle East conflict. Thecoming millennium summit  with all the renewed hopeand promising beginning it represents for all people  mustbe a decisive deadline for the achievement of peace in theMiddle East. We should work collectively and vigorouslyto achieve this. I look forward to the participation ofPalestine  as a Member State of the United Nations  in thedeliberations of the coming millennium summit  and Ihope for and trust in the Assembly's support for thisPalestinian determination to achieve independence so thatPalestine can assume the position it deserves within thefamily of nations.As the Assembly is aware  we concluded the Sharmel-Sheikh Memorandum with Mr. Barak  the new PrimeMinister of Israel  on 4 September  under the auspices ofPresident Hosni Mubarak  and in the presence of KingAbdullah II  Secretary of State Albright  Mr. Moratinos representing the European Union  and Mr. Larsen representing Mr. Kofi Annan.The Memorandum is aimed at the implementation ofall the obligations of the interim period under the Osloagreement  the Wye River Memorandum and the HebronProtocol  and at the resumption of the final statusnegotiations. This was done with the hope of bringing toan end the policy of protraction and freezing that waspursued by the former Israeli Government  whichcompletely paralysed the peace process and almost dashedthe ambitious hopes created by this process for all thecountries and peoples of the Middle East.The Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum serves as asource of new hope for putting the peace process back onthe right track  as it reaffirms the implementation ofexisting agreements and of all the obligations within aspecific time-frame. In this connection  I extend mygratitude and thanks to all those who contributed to theconclusion of the Memorandum  particularly our host inSharm el-Sheikh  President Hosni Mubarak  as well asKing Abdullah II and Secretary of State Albright  whoundertook tangible and concrete efforts as a representativeof President Clinton  and the European leaders  theirrepresentatives and their envoys to the peace process. Thecontinuous involvement of these friends in this processwas essential and necessary for pushing the processforward. International sponsorship of the Middle Eastpeace process is the guarantee for its definitive and finalsuccess.24The absence of such an international role would sendthe fragile situation in the region back to square one. Itherefore call upon the international community toaccelerate and strengthen its efforts and participation topush the peace process forward and revitalize it on alltracks. A just and comprehensive peace in the Middle Eastcan last only if it is protected by international legitimacyand if efforts are undertaken to implement all of theresolutions pertaining to the Middle East conflict on thePalestinian  Syrian and Lebanese tracks.We should work hard so that the signing of thisMemorandum will succeed in ending the stagnation of thepeace process and in opening the door that the formerIsraeli Government closed in the face of all serious effortsaimed at achieving real peace.As we reaffirm once more our commitment to thepeace process and the implementation of the signedagreements  we hope that this time the Israeli side willimplement these agreements scrupulously and honestly including the phases of redeployment agreed upon in theWye River and Oslo agreements  the release of prisonersand the other obligations of the transitional period  such assafe passage between the West Bank and the Gaza Stripand the construction of the Gaza seaport.The Israeli Government is called upon to immediatelyand decisively cease all measures that violate internationalresolutions  laws and covenants and thus destroy thechances of peace. At the forefront of these are thesettlement activities and the confiscation of land  especiallyin AI-Quds Al-Sharif  and its vicinity  and the siege of thecity of Bethlehem and the rest of the Palestinian territories.The continuation of these settlement policies and practiceswill quash the hopes and expectations generated by thesigning of the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum and destroyprospects for the final settlement negotiations  which beganon 13 September. The cessation of all such measures isneeded in order that we can  together with my new partner Mr. Barak  continue the march of the peace of the bravethat we began with two other partners — the late YitzhakRabin  who gave his life for this peace  and ShimonPeres — for a new Middle East.Hence  we look forward to seeing new  real andtangible changes in the positions and actions of the Israeliside that will open the door  in word and in deed  for theachievement of a just and comprehensive peace — a peaceof the brave that will lead to the realization of the right ofthe Palestinian people to self-determination and to theestablishment of their independent State  with Al-Quds Al-Sharif (Jerusalem) as its capital  and the realization of theright of the Palestine refugees to return to their homelandin accordance with resolution 194 (III) which affirms theright of the refugees to return to their homes and the rightto compensation for those who do not wish to return.The realization of the right of the Palestinian peopleto establish their independent State with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital will provide the definitive guaranteefor the establishment of a permanent peace in the MiddleEast. It will also be a validation of the Charter of theUnited Nations and its numerous resolutions over 50years  beginning with resolution 181 (II) which called forthe establishment of two States in Palestine  one Jewish which is Israel  and one Arab  which is Palestine. Therights of peoples do not diminish because of a statute oflimitations or under oppression  and our people haveproved through the years that they deserve life  freedomand their own independent State. The time has come forthe international community  represented by the GeneralAssembly  to reaffirm this right and to work for itsrealization.The goal of the current peace process is theimplementation of Security Council resolutions 242(1967)  338 (1973) and 425 (1978) and the application ofthe principle of land for peace. The latter means totalIsraeli withdrawal from all Palestinian and other Arabterritories occupied since 1967  including Al-Quds Al-Sharif — the Holy City of Jerusalem  which is the first ofthe two Qiblahs and the third Holy Sanctuary of Islam the place from which the Prophet Muhammad ascendedto heaven  and the cradle of the birth of Jesus Christ.The catastrophe that befell our people 51 years ago uprooting them from their homeland and dispersing theminto exile — thereby stripping them of their dreams andrights as human beings in an attempt to negate theirexistence — is one of the greatest human tragedieswitnessed by the twentieth century. The question of therefugees of Palestine is the oldest and greatest refugeequestion in our contemporary world. We must recognizethe legitimate right of those refugees to return to theirhomeland  in accordance with United Nations resolutions.Four million Palestinians live in exile and in refugeecamps awaiting the time of their return to their homeland from which they were forcibly expelled. There is no wayto achieve peace  stability and security in the Middle Eastwithout a solution to the question of the refugees ofPalestine and the implementation of resolution 194 (III) which declares their right to return to their homeland.25Two essential things must occur for peace to becomplete. First  it is necessary to reach a final settlement onall tracks — the Palestinian  Syrian and Lebanese — on thebasis of the complete and precise implementation ofinternational legitimacy  especially Security Councilresolutions 242 (1967)  338 (1973)  and 425 (1978). Thesecond is the provision of economic support and assistanceby the international community sufficient for theachievement of a better economic situation and forachieving prosperity in the region. What is requiredforemost in this regard is raising the Palestinian economyup from the miserable situation in which it finds itself as aresult of the long years of occupation  so that buildingcooperative economic relations in the region will becomepossible.Here I wish to thank the donor countries that haveprovided and continue to provide important assistance to thePalestinian people and to the Palestinian Authority. Thisassistance is necessary to enable us to overcome theimmense difficulties that we have been confronting sincethe establishment of the Palestinian Authority  as a result ofthe closures and sieges imposed by the previous IsraeliGovernment on the Palestinian territory for long periods which worsened further the total destruction of thePalestinian economy. The shadows of poverty andunemployment still threaten our economic abilities andplans to reconstruct  build and develop.The achievement of all of this necessitates thecontinuation of the constructive efforts of the UnitedNations  which has permanent responsibility towards thequestion of Palestine until that issue is resolved in all itsaspects. We will also remain in need of our Arab brothers the Islamic countries and our friends in the Non-AlignedMovement. We will remain in need of the two co-sponsorsof the peace process  the United States and the RussianFederation  and also of the European Union  China  Japan Norway and our other friends around the world.We must heighten all our efforts until the arrival ofthe new millennium in many areas and spheres  and notonly in the Middle East. In this respect  we have observedsome positive developments which are quite reassuring.There is tangible improvement in the area of conflictresolution on the African continent and on the path towardsachieving better economic and social development in thatgreat continent. There is the international attention given toKosovo  as well as other measures carried out in theBalkans. There is also the adoption of the Statute of theInternational Criminal Court  as well as the additionalconsideration being given to the four Geneva Conventionson the occasion of their fiftieth anniversary. We referhere  with appreciation  to the convening of theConference of the High Contracting Parties to the FourthGeneva Convention last July regarding the Israelioccupation of our land. There are also the follow-ups andreviews of a series of international conferences five yearsafter their convening  in addition to the preparations beingmade with regard to such important issues as the cultureof peace and the dialogue among civilizations.All of these things are important developments  butperhaps not enough for us to be able to begin the newmillennium under new circumstances. This is particularlyso if we look at some of the events and worrisomedevelopments in different areas. There is the continuationof the state of siege in Iraq and the profound suffering ofits brotherly people. There is also the continuation ofinternal conflicts in many countries  such as Afghanistanand others. Recently there have also been worrisomedevelopments in East Timor. But I would like  inparticular  to refer to the rise of extreme poverty and tothe widening gap between the haves and the have-nots onthe individual  national and regional levels.Perhaps it is we  the poor people of the South  whoare most concerned about how to bridge the gap betweenus and the North  particularly in this era of globalizationof the world economy  whose challenges andconsequences we must all face. Here we must exertserious efforts and seek creative means beyond hasty andtemporary measures. While it is time for the South to bemore prepared to realize such an achievement  the Northshould also be more prepared for partnership and morerealistic  effective and just sharing.In addition to economic matters  we must also striveto achieve some needed improvements at the politicallevel  particularly with regard to international politicalrelations. It is imperative in this connection that we allgive greater significance to the United Nations. This mustbe done in order for this body to truly and urgentlybecome the effective centre of international and politicalrelations and the source of international legitimacy. It isalso necessary to be wholly committed to upholding theprinciples and provisions of the Charter of the UnitedNations and of international and humanitarian laws  aswell as ensuring that they apply to all. We should applyto others the same moral values as we accept forourselves. There should be one set of criteria and onestandard for all cases and in all places. All of this willlead to a more credible system of international relations in which the incentive to commit wrongs will be lessened26and the collective capability to confront and prevent thosewrongs will  in turn  be enhanced.It is with great pride that I would now like to speak ofthe Bethlehem 2000 celebrations. The Palestinian city ofBethlehem  the birthplace of Jesus Christ  is the placewhere we are making preparations to celebrate the end ofthe second millennium and the beginning of the third. It isalso there  in Palestine  that the past  the present and thefuture will meet in a global vision of hope for all peoples.It is a religious and spiritual occasion of high importance not only for our people and the other peoples of the region but also for all the faithful around the world and for theentire international community. I appreciate the unanimousadoption last year of the resolution concerning this greatand important matter  and invite the Assembly to continueto grant it its attention and consideration this year.Here  I wish to extend once again the Palestinianpeople’s invitation to the Assembly and to all the leadersof the world to visit us during this important spiritual andreligious occasion in Bethlehem  Jerusalem and the otherreligious and spiritual places  so that we can proudly livetogether in peace at this special  historic time.I should like to extend my gratitude to theCommittee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights ofthe Palestinian People  to the Committee’s Chairman Ambassador Ibra Ka of Senegal  to the SpecialCommittee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting theHuman Rights of the Palestinian People and other Arabsof the Occupied Terrotiries and to all the staff membersof this international Organization working in programmesrelating to the question of Palestine. They have allprovided immeasurable support to the just cause of thePalestinian people and have most certainly contributed toadvancing the peace process towards the achievement ofa just  permanent and comprehensive peace — a peace ofthe brave that will secure justice and freedom for thePalestinian people and their sovereignty over their land along with security  stability and peace for all countriesand peoples of this region.Once again I express my congratulations to you  Mr.President  and my gratitude to all the members of theinternational community  reiterating to you the appeal ofPalestine — an appeal of right  justice and peace."
"141",5871,"QAT",54,1999,"I extendmy congratulations to Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  on hiselection as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session. I wish him success in guiding the work ofthe Assembly.It gives me great pleasure to extend my thanks to hispredecessor  Mr. Didier Opertti  for his effective work asPresident of the Assembly at its previous session. I wishhim similar success in his future endeavours.Allow me on this occasion to congratulate the threenew Members on their admission to the United Nations.4Allow me also  on behalf of my Government  to expressappreciation to the Secretary-General  for his tireless workand laudable efforts in the midst of an internationalsituation that can be described — at best — as difficult andcomplicated.Of course the international situation is truly difficultand complicated. It is no coincidence that as we meet inthis forum to discuss the affairs and state of the worldtoday — at this  the last session of the century  thebeginning of a new century  a new age that we once hopedwould be different from the old — we find ourselvesobliged to discuss the same problems and the same disputesthat we have been facing for over half a century. Is this nottruly deplorable and even outrageous? Does not this realityconstitute categorical evidence that all of us — States peoples and regional and international organizations —have failed to learn enough from the lessons of the past that we have not benefited from our past experiencesenough and that we have not sought as much as we shouldhave  to overcome our past limitations and shortcomings?What do we see when we look at our world today?We see bloody conflicts that we have not yet been able tostop and chronic crises that still await solutions that wouldend the spiral of violence and suffering. Moreover  we findthat the world remains reluctant or even unable to addressproblems and crises that are far removed  in terms ofcontent  from the course of daily politics but whose effectsand ramifications are no less dangerous than the topicalcrises and conflicts that threaten our existence. We mustask ourselves: What have we done  as we stand on thethreshold of the third millennium  to prepare ourselves tomeet the challenges of poverty  misery  unemployment illiteracy  disease  the spread of epidemics and theexploitation of children?What have we done to prepare ourselves to cope withthe dangers of organized crime  international terrorism anddrug trafficking? Have we really understood the threat ofthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and thepossibility that they may be used at any time andanywhere?What of the real dangers besetting our planet as aresult of environmental degradation  climate change  thescarcity of water resources  the shortage of raw materials the deteriorating phenomena of drought and desertificationand the increasing frequency of natural disasters?Have we at least begun to draft guidelines andcomprehensive universal plans to confront these globalthreats  which do not differentiate between nationalities races  colours or creeds and which most certainlyrecognize no political  geographical  economic and socialborders among nations and peoples?Simply put  have we  as States  Governments andinternational organizations  begun adjusting our prioritiesso as to place the goals of development  progress education  health  high living standards and decent life forour peoples ahead of the aims of conflict  disputes andvengeance  no matter how historical  profound orsensitive?I cannot answer yes to any of these questions. Thereis nothing in this statement to criticize anyone or detractfrom their resolve or intentions. It is a sad universalreality that requires our cooperation and joint efforts if wetruly hope to prepare ourselves for the future and its tasksand changes. To that end  I see no better or morecomprehensive framework for this mission than thisinternational Organization  which we believe to be thequalified and appropriate institution for defining the futureof our world. All of us  regardless of our interests andour narrow  topical political calculations  must provide theUnited Nations and its agencies with all the meansnecessary for it to play such an important role.We are convinced that this can be achieved onlywith universal will  for in the final analysis  the UnitedNations is the sum total of its Member States. We arealso convinced of the need to reform the United Nationsand to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of itsbodies and agencies. Similarly  it is incumbent upon us the States Members of the Organization  to assume ourpolitical responsibility and respect our moral and financialcommitments to it. Furthermore  in this context  wesupport the idea of expanding the Security Council tomake it more democratic and representative of theinternational community in the modern world. We alsosupport the idea of expanding the permanent membershipof the Council so as to ensure greater universalrepresentation on it. The same applies to restricting theuse of the veto by the permanent members and toregulating the capacity to use this right under agreed andspecific terms and conditions.It is perhaps not exaggerated optimism orexpectation on my part when I say that we consider thisto be an essential and vital step towards consecrating thesound concept of globalization  as we see it and as itmust be in the twenty-first century. We believe thatglobalization must be a comprehensive mechanism in the5service of the general welfare of all nations and peoples. Ifits benefits are confined to certain States and societies  tothe exclusion of others  it will fail to achieve its objectives.On this basis  we believe that globalization should bethe means by which we promote cooperation  interactionand openness among the peoples and societies of the world.We can thus steer globalization away from the pitfalls ofnarrow exploitation and short-term profit and towards auniversal scope whose benefits and returns reach everyone.It is here that we feel that a new and extremely vital rolewill emerge for the United Nations in the twenty-firstcentury — a role in which the Organization will assumeleadership of the trend towards globalization and consecrateit  especially in the fields of cooperation  cultural andeducational exchanges  social and economic development the defence of human rights  strengthening peace andstability and consolidating the bases of cultural opennessamong nations and peoples.We will thus have taken the first essential stepstowards the establishment of the new international orderthat we thought we had achieved at the end the cold warand the age of international polarization  which lasted 50years after the end of the Second World War. The newinternational order to which we aspired did not materialize.Unfortunately  and in spite of the many initiatives andindications that had once seemed encouraging  the worldinstead soon fell into a new spiral of disagreements disputes and regional  bilateral and internal conflicts. Theseseemed to be the direct results of the political vacuum leftin the wake of the cold war. At the same time  newconflicts and disputes have joined the series of historicallychronic crises that have plagued our world for decades andfor which no effective solutions have been found.We may discuss the future and a new world in whichwe seek to achieve the aspirations of all peoples toprosperity  progress and stability  but the priority ofspending on arms and military purposes still prevails overall others  especially in the developing and poor regions ofthe world  where the need for resources for social andeconomic growth and development is paramount. In themeantime  economic conditions in these regions continue todeteriorate  social crises are exacerbated and livingstandards are plummeting ever faster.Naturally  these are not the only problems. In themidst of such a vicious circle  the political crises facingthese societies are intensified in turn and soon evolve intosignificant threats  not only to their security and internalfabric  but also to their neighbours. Particularly disturbingis the fact that this phenomenon has spread and expandedinto several regions of the world. In this regard  and onbehalf of my country  Qatar  I cannot but expresssatisfaction at the results of the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization (NATO) operation in the Balkans.In the same context  my Government has followedwith concern the events that have unfolded in East Timorin recent weeks. Qatar hopes for the success of theinternational efforts currently under way to restore peaceand security. At the same time  we stress the hope thatthe Republic of Indonesia will transcend this difficultordeal and reclaim its prominent position in South-EastAsia and in the ranks of the international community asa whole.While some recent developments have providedrelatively reassuring indications of the possibility ofsettling regional and internal conflicts  given the resolveand the international will to do so  we find it necessary torecall here that we would have preferred that suchinternational endeavours had taken place in a pre-emptivecontext that would have prevented the crises and theensuing tragedies and suffering  instead of subsequentefforts aimed at salvaging whatever remained to besalvaged.We express this concern and call for furtherinternational efforts to settle crises and to put an end towars and conflicts because we in the State of Qatarprofoundly believe in the right of peoples to live infreedom and peace. We also believe in the need toestablish international relations on the basis of friendship cooperation  mutual respect  common interests and good-neighbourliness. Proceeding from this  my country standsfirmly and unambiguously in support of the settlement ofdifferences and disputes in the Gulf region by peacefulmeans and through dialogue  negotiations  or internationalarbitration in order to consolidate security and stability inthe region.We also wish to place on record my Government'ssatisfaction at some of the positive developments andencouraging signs that we have noticed during the pastmonths regarding the settlement of a number of questionsthat have long been a source of concern in our region.We welcome the progress made in settling the Lockerbiematter and congratulate our Libyan brothers on that hoping that this file will be closed and this matterconcluded as soon as possible and in a way that willensure the rights and interests of all parties.6Notwithstanding the positive indications and trends which we welcome and hope will be strengthened  thegeneral regional situation is still  to our great regret  farremoved from the comprehensive peace  the lasting stabilityand the modes of cooperation  development and progressthat we seek and desire for our region. The Iraqi crisis andits continuous repercussions on security and stability in theGulf and the Middle East  and the cruel suffering of thefraternal Iraqi people  are all elements that cause greatconcern and prompt us to do our utmost in order to put anend to this crisis. We believe it is high time that weovercame the Iraqi crisis and found effective solutions to itso that the sanctions imposed against Iraq can be lifted andthe cruel suffering of its peoples can be terminated. Wehave always resorted to diplomatic solutions  in accordancewith international resolutions  in order to ensure thepreservation of the territorial integrity and national unity ofIraq and to spare it and the entire region further dangersand agony.There naturally remains the essential question  whichin our view has been the main source of tension and crisesin our region for more than half a century  and that is thequestion of Palestine and the Arab-Israeli conflict. I mustsay that we in the State of Qatar  together with our Arabbrothers  have committed ourselves to peace as a permanentstrategic option  a commitment which still stands. However the peace process has regrettably failed to attain itsenvisaged results. Rather  this process has suffered setbacksover the past years  the responsibility for which  in ourview  lies with the former Israeli Government  which optedto retreat from its commitments and pursued policies thatprevented any progress in the peace process and innegotiations on its various tracks.We welcome the changes that have taken place in theIsraeli Government as a result of the recent generalelections and in light of the formation of the newGovernment under the leadership of Mr. Ehud Barak andhis stated intention to pursue peace more earnestly.However  we feel that such gestures must be coupled withconcrete steps that would demonstrate good faith on theIsraeli side and sincere readiness to meet its obligations byimplementing the agreements concluded on all tracks duringthe previous stages of the negotiations  and to seek aresumption of the negotiations on the Syrian and Lebanesetracks as soon as possible  on the basis of the resolutions ofinternational legitimacy and the principle of land for peace.Perhaps it suffices here to recall the recent affirmationby His Highness  Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani  theEmir of the State of Qatar  in explaining my country's firmposition on this matter. In our view  there can be nosolution to this conflict nor peace in the Middle Eastexcept through a permanent  just and comprehensivesettlement  based on the established principles that formthe foundations of the peace process. This means theimplementation of Security Council resolutions 242(1967)  338 (1973) and 425 (1978); full Israeli withdrawalfrom the occupied Syrian Golan Heights to the border of4 June 1967 and from southern Lebanon and its westernBekaa valley  to the internationally recognized borders and the regaining by the Palestinian people of theirlegitimate national and political rights  foremost amongwhich is their natural right to self-determination and tothe establishment of their independent State  withJerusalem as its capital: the city of peace  the land oftolerance and the cradle of divine revelations  wherereligions have always coexisted in harmony and concord.We must express concern over the continuedpresence of weapons of mass destruction in the region especially nuclear weapons that are available exclusivelyto one side  the Israeli side. In our view  this constitutesa strategic imbalance and a threat to peace and security.Therefore  we believe in the need for the completeelimination of weapons of mass destruction from ourregion  as an integral and complementary part of thepeace process. We also call on Israel to accede to theinternational treaties providing for the limitation and non-proliferation of such weapons.Peace  in our view  cannot be one-sided  nor can itsbenefits accrue exclusively on one side. Therefore  wesincerely look forward to the day when a balanced  just comprehensive and genuine peace reigns in our region.Then we can speak of such advantages and benefits ofpeace as security  cooperation  stability  prosperity andprogress for all the States and peoples in our regionwithout exception.We look forward to that day because we truly yearnto see a new Middle East  which enters the newmillennium in a climate of peace  security anddemocracy; a climate in which we all respect pluralism ofopinions  diversity of approaches and the right of peoplesand States to self-determination  to better living standardsand to living in freedom  prosperity and dignity  inconformity with their lofty beliefs and values. This is oneof the basic human rights we cherish. Our belief stemsforemost from our profound belief in God Almighty andin His divine revelations with which He blessed allmankind.7This process of working for a better future and for ourpeoples imbues us with the utmost hope that we will beable to achieve the objective of building a new worldworthy of our young generations which will inhabit it in thethird millennium. As we are about to draw the curtain onan old century and welcome the dawn of a new one  wemust pledge to our children that we will do our utmost sothat their world will be a better world  more capable andbetter equipped to respond to their ambitions andaspirations."
"142",5917,"ROU",54,1999,"I am greatly pleased to extendmy warmest congratulations to our newly elected Presidentof the fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly. Also I join previous speakers in expressing our debt of gratitudeto the outgoing President  Mr. Didier Opertti  for his ablestewardship of the proceedings of the Assembly during thepast session.I welcome the newcomers to the United Nationsfamily  Kiribati  Nauru and Tonga.It has not been an easy year for our Secretary-General.We all appreciate his wisdom and sense of balance insteering the reform process of the United Nations itself witha firm hand at a time of profound change on theinternational scene.Whether we like it or not  globalization is upon us. Asatisfactory definition of the term may not be yet available but we all feel the effects of it: pervasive; subtle or less so;disturbing; sometimes perverse; and  above all  challenging.The end of a millennium and the advent of a new oneis a good time for reflection. It is not just coping with themillennium bug  which may cause our computers to goawry; it is — to use the Secretary General's well polishedphrase — a “symbolically compelling moment”. It is notfor me to answer the question of where we are and wherewe are heading: the collective wisdom of the UnitedNations Member States  assisted by academia and  wehope  by civil society too  will take charge of that at themillennium summit next year. I think we must take thatevent seriously: although we may have a lot to celebrate we still have a lot more to do  earnestly  pragmaticallyand effectively.Like all good things  globalization producesbeneficial effects; then again  as happens with most goodthings  those benefits are not evenly distributed: thosewho are better equipped to face the challenge of goingglobal will reap its fruits sooner  while those who are notwill have to try harder. What I mean is that as we talkabout globalization we do not have to indulge ourselvesin slogans or idolatry: globalization involves greatbenefits  but also great risks. We should not forget thatour century first experienced the dark side ofglobalization: world war. Luckily  it is alsoglobalization — this time in its good sense — that canmake it impossible for conflicts to become chronic because the whole world instantly learns about any localdispute and mobilizes all available energies to identifyand implement solutions.The moral underpinning of globalization is calledsolidarity. One could say that in its very structures andgoals the United Nations anticipated contemporaryglobalization: the United Nations is all aboutinstitutionalized solidarity  and to belong to thisOrganization means making solidarity the norm of bestconduct. Social  political and economic solidarity;cultural  inter-ethnic and regional solidarity; solidarityborn out of respect for values  and fostered by goodwilland good faith — these are the ethics that we wish for theforthcoming millennium.It should be clear that the individual mustnecessarily be the beneficiary of any form of solidarity:international organizations  States and governments do notacquire legitimacy and cannot be judged otherwise thanthrough their impact on individual destiny. The real manor woman  rather than generic mankind  and the valuesembodied by the human species  rather than self-servingprojects  are the true subjects of politics.This way of thinking has lately brought up the issueof humanitarian intervention  human rights and reform ofthe system of international law. This is a sensitive issueand one full of pitfalls. There are those who say that weshould not tolerate legal injustice under the pretext of39humanitarian intervention. That is true. Similarly  some saythat we should tolerate either social injustice nor crimeunder the pretext of non-interference in domestic affairs.Undoubtedly respect for human rights is primarily theresponsibility of national Governments and Stateinstitutions. However  if they do not fulfil this task  thereshould be an instrument capable of enforcing respect forinternational standards and there is no better instrument fordoing so than the United Nations.Preventing conflicts is a complex undertaking.Unfortunately  we do not always have time to act subtlyand imaginatively. We are not doing enough in the field ofeducation in the sense of cultivating values of respect forthe integrity of the individual and for his or her right to bedifferent. We do not always understand in time that themost efficient way to fight war and violence is to fightpoverty. We do not always know how to distinguishbetween political manoeuvring and public interest  betweennational pride and universally valid principles. We mustreflect on these things not only when crises are unleashedbut instantly calmly and clear-mindedly. There is no simpleway of coping with complexity. It requires vision enlightened foresight  careful planning and hard work.The revolutionary changes of ten years ago in Centraland Eastern Europe and the ensuing process of transitionwere essentially focused on values — political pluralism parliamentary democracy  separation of powers  individualfreedom  market economy and human rights  including therights of people belonging to ethnic  religious or otherminorities. Those values prevailed because they were right because they survived in our hearts and minds throughdecades of totalitarian communist oppression  and becausethey were embraced by the vast majority of people in ourcountries.But shared values themselves are not enough to builda truly prosperous democratic society: they have to beunderpinned by an equally coherent set of institutionsdesigned to serve and actually implement those values. Thetwo — values and institutions — are inextricably linked ina functioning democracy  and it is precisely from thislinkage that the indispensable ingredient for further progressarises: leadership. That  in a nutshell  is the substance ofgood governance. We are reminded here of the idea that:“The important thing for government is not to dothings which individuals are doing already  and to dothem a little bit better or a little bit worse  but to dothose things which at present are not done at all.”[John Maynard Keynes  “The End of Laissez-Faire”]We in Romania  much like those in many other Centraland East European countries  have been and still arelearning that simple truth the hard way in a difficult andsometimes painful process of transition.It is in that spirit and in recognition of theinternational dimension of good governance at a time ofglobal change that the Romanian delegation has submitteda draft code of democratic conduct (A/54/178  annex) forexamination by the Assembly this session. The text beforethe Assembly is the result of extensive consultations andincludes meaningful contributions from many quartersbased upon the original framework from the Conferencesof New or Restored Democracies. The important — andI would say  novel — thing about this document is that in addition to listing principles and stating general aims it also spells out practical modalities for carrying themout in the political  legal  administrative  economic andsocial spheres. Last but not least  it emphasizes the crucialrole of non-institutional players — business communities unions  non-governmental organizations  civil society  themedia — in shaping policies and in building consensusfor implementation.In a changing world  the world Organization itself isalso changing. The scope and pace of its reform andadaptation to the new realities and requirements may havebeen uneven  patchy in some respects and evendisappointing  but the process has gained momentum andthere are hopeful signs for steady progress in the future.The United Nations is uniquely equipped by its structureand acquired expertise to seek specific rather thanstandard solutions to specific problems. Every crisis wehave had to face in recent years and months had aphysiognomy of its own. To be effective  the responsemust match the challenge in terms of innovativecomplexity.In relation to the enlargement of the SecurityCouncil membership and its improved performance  webelieve that proper consideration should be given to theinterests of all regional groups  including the Group ofEastern European States  which has seen the mostspectacular rise in numbers over the past three decades.Romania welcomed the initiative to create the UnitedNations Stand-by Forces High-Readiness Brigade andtakes part in it. Recent events across the world havedemonstrated the urgent need to make it operational assoon as possible. We have been reminded of this in amost dramatic fashion by the recent events in East Timor.Romanian contingents took part in several United40Nations-led and other peacekeeping  peace support andpolicing operations and are further prepared to improve anddiversify their contribution to such activities.Our cooperation with the United Nations agencies hasbecome better focused and more effective. I should like tomention the importance we attach to the support of theUnited Nations Development Programme in designing andmanaging specific  high-priority projects for Romania notably in public administration  in the preparation of anational strategy for sustainable development and of a localAgenda 21 programme. Further useful work is expected tobe done jointly with the World Bank for the formulation ofa comprehensive development framework at both thenational and the regional level.The Balkan tragedy has been in the headlines for thewhole of this past year. We all had an object lesson on theharm that ethnic and religious intolerance compounded byrabid nationalism can do to an entire region. As so manytimes in history  it was the innocents that had to suffermost  individuals and nations alike. But we have alsolearned that determination and prompt action by theinternational community can make a difference. It isgratifying to note that trans-Atlantic solidarity again passeda crucial test in these past few months. In fact  if we areable to look into the future of the region with a reasonabledegree of optimism  it is because we have seen concertedaction at work.The Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe is suchproof of a new  bold approach — a comprehensive  forwardlooking programme which proposes to deal with the entireregion with specific action envisaged on three tiers:international security  economic development anddemocracy and institution-building. Romania has welcomedthe plan from the very beginning  is part of it and seriouslymeans to do its utmost to bring it to fruition. It is stillearly  but three preliminary observations may be in order.First  the actual participation of the countries in theregion and of its immediate neighbours  such as Romania is crucial for its success.Secondly  in focusing on the eventual integration ofthe region as a whole into the European and Atlanticstructures  the sequence and content of the steps to be takenshould realistically differentiate among the actualrequirements and capabilities of each participating country.Thirdly  besides action at the governmental level  it isvital to secure the active involvement of business interestsand the various organizational expressions of civil societyin order to give substance and continuity to the wholeprocess.Almost as an afterthought  I think I should alsomention the need for a watchful eye on transparency applying equally to political decision-making and toprocurement procedures  including those practised by theagencies of the United Nations family. This is alegitimately sensitive subject for the countries of theregion  particularly for the companies registered there  andought to be duly considered as such.Romania's commitment to its strategic goals ofEuropean and Atlantic integration is steady andunwavering. It has passed the acid test of the Kosovocrisis. We are looking forward with confidence and hopeto the major decisions which are due to be taken beforethe year's end and thereafter.The United Nations may not be perfect  but isperfectible and  after all  is the only world forumavailable. It is up to us to make it live and deliver. We the Member States  have to deliver in order to live in apeaceful world. For this I hope and pray."
"143",5963,"RUS",54,1999,"There is no doubt that the twentieth century  which is nowcoming to a close  will leave a deep imprint on the historyof the world. This has been an epoch of globaltransformation and social change  scientific discoveries andachievements. The realization of the idea of a universalworld Organization  which has become the foundationuniting the entire international community  has indeed beenone of the positive things about this century.However  the twentieth century has witnessed the mostsevere upheavals. Millions of people have perished in theflames of world wars  revolutions and civil and ethnicconflicts. On a few occasions  humanity teetered on thebrink of self-destruction  and the burden of outstandingproblems it has left for the new era is a heavy one. Wecannot resolve all these problems before the advent of thethird millennium  but we are indeed duty bound to laydown the foundations for resolving them in the long-termand to start moving in that direction.The most important thing we should do is to definethe parameters of the world in which we are going to live.This lies at the core of the initiative put forward by thePresident of the Russian Federation  President Yeltsin  todevelop a world concept for the twenty-first century. As aworld Power and permanent member of the SecurityCouncil  Russia is fully conscious of its special role in andresponsibility for world developments and stands for theestablishment of a multipolar world built on a solidfoundation of international law. Our country is pursuing inpractice a multifaceted foreign policy with a view toestablishing equitable and mutually beneficial bilateral andmultilateral relations with all the countries of the world andto strengthening international security and stability.The world concept for the twenty-first centuryinvolves establishing a new culture which would aim toform a common system of values and models ofbehaviour. A world without wars and conflict  a world ofdemocracy and prosperity must be the highest priority forall peoples and States. Every nation is entitled to itsrightful place among other nations and to security on anequal footing in all its aspects  including in the political military  economic and social areas.How and through what mechanisms can this beachieved? Is there a body which can reflect the interestsof all States in a balanced manner? The answer isobvious: it is the United Nations. From the outset  theUnited Nations Charter put the Organization at the serviceof all humankind. There is simply no other universalmechanism to regulate international relations.We are fully aware of the danger posed by thethreats and challenges facing our world today: the variousmanifestations of militant nationalism  separatism terrorism and extremism  which know no borders. This isa common challenge which is claiming countless victimsand wreaking destruction in various parts of the globe.Aggressive separatism  which has become a growthmedium for various extremist forces  has become one ofthe main sources of domestic conflict and regionalinstability. No one is immune to it. The internationalcommunity and  above all  the United Nations  mustdecisively clamp down on any manifestations ofseparatism and strictly and consistently defend theprinciples of the sovereignty and territorial integrity ofStates and the inviolability of their borders. Outsideencouragement and support for separatist forces must betotally eradicated.Recently  separatism has been increasingly mergingwith the monster of terrorism. We could even now  duringthis session  take a number of specific steps to stimulatepractical international cooperation in combating terrorism.We must finalize the draft international convention on thesuppression of acts of nuclear terrorism. I thereforesuggest that we should develop and adopt a declaration ofprinciples for cooperation between States on combatingterrorism more vigorously. It is the States’ bounden dutyto protect their citizens against terrorist attacks and toprevent activities from taking place in their territory thatare aimed at organizing such acts against the citizens ofother countries. Russia therefore supports the initiative toconvene  under United Nations auspices  a conference ora special session of the General Assembly next year on13combating terrorism. Such an event would give a powerfulpolitical impetus to the struggle against terrorism at a globallevel.The capabilities of the United Nations should also beused more efficiently in the fight against drug-relatedthreats and organized crime. Only through joint efforts thatare also in strict compliance with the rules of internationallaw can we defeat this evil.The founding fathers of the United Nations madeprovision for a law-based response to violations of peaceand security. The international community can take alsocoercive measures  but this should be done in accordancewith the Charter and following a decision by the SecurityCouncil. Unlawful means can only undermine rightful ends.It is from this very perspective that we assess suchdoctrines as that of humanitarian intervention. In general we should take an extremely careful approach to coercivemeasures; what is more  we must not allow them to turninto a repressive mechanism for influencing States andpeoples that are not to the liking of some.Of course  evolution of the international situationmeans that it is appropriate for existing rules ofinternational law to be developed and adapted to prevailingconditions  but this should be done through collectivediscussion and the adoption of appropriate decisions  not asa fait accompli and not working from scratch: it should bebased on valid rules of international law. This is preciselywhat Russia had in mind with its initiative to consider atthe Millennium Summit legal aspects of the use of force ininternational relations in the era of globalization. We inviteall countries to a broad and open dialogue on this issue.Much has been said in recent years about the reformof the United Nations  which is only natural. Life is anevolving process and  as times change  any system willneed to be updated. What objectives future reform shouldpursue is another matter. In our view  reform means  firstand foremost  the adoption of a package of measures toenhance the role of the United Nations in the world arena.The Organization should be ready to respond in a timelyand appropriate way to the challenges that globalizationpresents to mankind. We must give serious thought to howto enhance the efficiency of the Security Council and howto make that principal organ of the United Nations morerepresentative through the inclusion of influential newmembers  including — and this is absolutelyindispensable — developing countries. This would helpmaintain the overall balance in the system of internationalrelations  especially when the use of force  bypassing theSecurity Council  continues. It is also beyond doubt thatpreservation of the right of veto of permanent membersis indispensable for meaningful and efficient work in theCouncil.Generally speaking  the entire system of internationalorganizations needs sensible and responsible reform. Atthe same time  the United Nations must remain a focalpoint of the international community’s efforts to settle themost burning problems of the day. The issue ofstrengthening the authority of the United Nations after ithas been seriously and painfully tested by the Balkan andIraq crises is at the very top of the agenda at the currentsession of the General Assembly. First of all  we mustcontinue strenuous efforts to restore the role of theSecurity Council in world affairs.We have managed through joint efforts to bring thesettlement of the Kosovo problem back within the legaland political framework of the United Nations. Now weneed jointly to strive for strict and consistentimplementation of Security Council resolution 1244(1999). We cannot afford to let the re-emerging politicalprocess be undermined again  since that could become atragedy for all of Europe and could once again bring theworld to the brink of catastrophe. Equally urgent is theissue of post-conflict rehabilitation in the Balkans. TheUnited Nations has an important role to play in meetingthese challenges as well.We all should draw serious lessons from recentcrises. Non-legitimate methods of exerting power onlyexacerbate problems and result in even greater deadlock.Developments in the Middle East  where the peaceprocess has of late acquired a new positive impetus clearly exemplify the optimal alternative  that ofnegotiated settlement.Also on the agenda is the issue of improvingsanctions regimes  to which the international communityhas frequently resorted over the past decade. Sanctionsare an extreme measure. They must be applied only whenother means of political influence have been exhaustedand when the Security Council has established theexistence of a threat to peace. The Council  for its part should be guided by clear criteria for the imposition andthe lifting of sanctions  and should not permit any freeinterpretation of the decisions it has adopted  much lesspermit the use of its decisions by anyone for selfishpolitical or economic ends. It is necessary to take veryserious account of the humanitarian implications ofsanctions both for the population of the States subject to14such sanctions and for third countries. The punishment ofentire nations  especially for an indefinite time andindiscriminately  is inadmissible.Peacemaking is one of the key areas of United Nationsactivities. During the past 50 years the Organization hasacquired vast practical experience in this field. Havingsuccessfully survived intense disputes and ideologicalbattles  peacemaking has proved its vital power andimportance for securing world and regional stability. Theevolution of the theory and practice of present-daypeacemaking confirms that there is no alternative tomaintaining the central role of the United Nations in thissphere. The encouragement of peacemaking and thestrengthening of its legal basis in strict conformity with thefundamental principles of the Charter should become animportant component of the concept of the world in thetwenty-first century. Building up and modernizing the anti-crisis capability of the United Nations is a key prerequisitefor tackling these tasks successfully. The top priority hereis to begin truly using the system of stand-by agreementswith the United Nations.Taking into account the limited resources of the worldOrganization  and given the high demand for peacekeepingoperations  cooperation and division of labour between theUnited Nations and regional structures has become apriority. It is of fundamental importance that suchcooperation should be in strict accordance with ChapterVIII of the Charter and should be fully consistent with theprerogatives of the Security Council.For Russia  the question of peacemaking cooperationbetween the United Nations and regional organizations isfar from theoretical. For many years  Russian peacemakerswithin the peacekeeping forces of the Commonwealth ofIndependent States (CIS) have contributed to stabilizing thesituations in Abkhazia  Georgia  in Tajikistan  and in Trans-Dniestria  Moldova. This testifies to the fact that thesettlement of conflicts within the framework of the CIS isa priority for Russia. As before  we do not see anyreasonable alternative to political settlement of these crisissituations  for which political will  patience andcommitment to one’s obligations are needed. We considerit important for the United Nations to continue to play aprominent role in finding solutions in Tajikistan and inAbkhazia  Georgia.The Organization for Security and Cooperation inEurope (OSCE)  which is called upon to play a central rolein ensuring European security and stability  can and shouldbe the main United Nations peacemaking partner in Europe.When this arrangement fails to work  not only do specificEuropean countries suffer  but providing for global andcontinental security becomes complicated. In a broadsense  OSCE peacemaking parameters  ranging fromconflict prevention to peacekeeping operations and post-conflict rehabilitation  should be defined in a charter onEuropean security. Russia proposes too that the chartershould also reflect such principles important for the futureof Europeans as ensuring the security and the foundationsof the relations between European and Euro-Atlanticorganizations in this area. Then the charter will indeedbecome a kind of political constitution for the Europe ofthe twenty-first century. As the Istanbul summit of theOSCE  which is expected to adopt the charter  isapproaching fast  we should press ahead with theformulation of a substantive document.The Conference on Interaction and Confidence-building Measures in Asia may become an importantfactor for stability on the Asian continent after the newpositive impetus it received at the recent Almaty ForeignAffairs Ministers’ Meeting of the founding States. TheAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)Regional Forum  a venue for active dialogue on a broadspectrum of urgent international issues  is yet anotherexample of the focus of the Asian countries on theformation of solid structures for security and cooperationon the continent.It is necessary to enhance the potential of Africanregional and subregional organizations  which are actingin close cooperation with the United Nations to curb andcope with conflicts and humanitarian catastrophesemerging in Africa. It is the duty of the internationalcommunity to render every possible support to theAfrican peoples.While strengthening the legal and practical basis ofpeacemaking activities  special attention should be paid towhat is commonly called the human rights dimension.This relates not only to measures to minimize humansufferings caused by armed conflicts  but also to effortsaimed at preventing humanitarian crises.In this connection  I cannot fail to mention theunacceptable situation of countless thousands of people inthe centre of Europe who  due to arbitrary actions byauthorities  have found themselves deprived of theircitizenship and of the right to use their native languageand enjoy full rights in their State of residence. Civilizedintegration  rather than latent assimilation — this is theway out of the prevailing humanitarian situation in these15countries. We welcome the efforts of the Organization forSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)  the Councilof Europe and the Council of Baltic Sea States (CBSS)aimed at eliminating violations of human rights andfreedoms of the non-indigenous population of Latvia andEstonia. We hope that the United Nations HighCommissioner for Human Rights will make her contributionto these efforts.The risk of losing positive dynamics in the sphere ofdisarmament as a result of attempts to rely on unilateralpower methods cannot but cause concern. If the politicaland legal fabric regulating international relations continuesto disintegrate further  then trends to ensure nationalsecurity through an arms race will become even stronger.Russia has consistently advocated the reduction andlimitation of nuclear arsenals and strict compliance with thenon-proliferation regime. For without this  ensuringstrategic stability would prove impossible.We realize the importance of early ratification of theSTART II Treaty and of the initiation of START IIInegotiations  under which Russia would be prepared  on areciprocal basis  to agree to considerable further reductionof strategic offensive armaments. Naturally  this processwill be feasible only if the existing agreements in this field first of all the ABM Treaty  are strictly observed. Webelieve that the General Assembly should come out clearlyin support of the preservation and observance of the ABMTreaty  which is a cornerstone of strategic stability  becauseunilateral actions aimed at undermining the time-testedregime established by this Treaty are fraught withextremely dangerous consequences. A collective search forpolitical and diplomatic solutions is the alternative tomilitary responses to the problems of proliferation. This isprecisely the target of Russia’s initiative concerning theglobal system of control over proliferation of missiles andmissile technologies.Substantive discussions on threats to internationalinformation security must also be continued within theframework and under the auspices of the United Nations.The time has come to reach  through joint efforts  acommon understanding of such threats and of measures toreduce them.The twentieth century has brought about economicglobalization. All economies have become open and closelylinked as a result of advances in science and technology.All these factors have provided a powerful impetus tosocial and economic development while creating their ownspecific problems. The gap between the industrial and theformerly colonial worlds has not only persisted but hasbegun to widen. Development assistance should remain aprincipal focus of future United Nations activities. Crises primarily financial ones  have assumed an internationalcharacter. We must draw the appropriate lessons andmodernize the architecture of the world financial system.The United Nations and its specialized agencies shouldplay a role here.The expansion of human economic activities hasbrought about a globalization of both natural andman-made disasters  and this has become a majordestabilizing global factor. The challenges related to theprevention of such disasters and the elimination of theirconsequences require that the most advanced technologiesbe used for the benefit of the world community as awhole. Why not consider  therefore  the establishment under the auspices of the United Nations  of a specializedinternational emergency agency which would assumerelevant functions?A widely known saying reads: ""It is much easier towin a war than a peace."" The United Nations founderswon the war and laid the foundations for peace. It is ourduty to win this peace and to make it comprehensive andirreversible."
"144",6010,"RWA",54,1999,"Iwish first of all  on behalf of my delegation  to join otherspeakers in congratulating you  Sir  on your unanimouselection to the presidency of the General Assembly at itsfifty-fourth session. The tact and insight you have displayedfrom the outset bode well for the success of our work.I also pay tribute to His Excellency Mr. Didier Opertti who guided the work of the Assembly at its fifty-thirdsession  and to His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan for histimely report on the work of the Organization and for theimportant statement he delivered to the General Assembly.On behalf of my country  I welcome the newMembers of the United Nations: the Republic of Kiribati the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga. Wecongratulate them warmly on joining the great UnitedNations family.During the twentieth century  which is now drawing toa close  the world has been profoundly affected by manystriking events. In the sphere of technology  for example we have seen great progress leading to the expansion ofcommunication to the point where the world has become aglobal village. The world rejoices at its liberation fromapartheid and from colonialism in nearly all countries.Here  my delegation welcomes the endeavours of theUnited Nations  including its focus on the solidarity that isthe foundation of our Organization  which led to thatsuccess.But those positive achievements do not mean that allhas been perfect in the twentieth century. In fact  a varietyof disasters and tragedies inflicted on humans by humanscontinue to ravage mankind. Despite scientific progress epidemics continue to take human lives by the thousand.Two particularly dreadful world wars devastated the world.Hateful acts of genocide have been committed.In that connection  my country  Rwanda  had themisfortune in 1994 to be the victim of a genocide that tookmore than a million lives. Planned and organized by thegovernment machinery of the day  that genocide wascarried out in full view of the international community which was unable to stop it. The people of Rwanda appealsto the conscience of the international community neveragain to permit such a tragedy anywhere in the world. Wehave every right to expect this.As we express that wish  investigations have beencarried out by countries such as Belgium and France  andothers  by the Organization of African Unity and the UnitedNations  are under way to identify those responsible for thegenocide in Rwanda. We want those responsible to besubject to punishment throughout the world.Further  we welcome the General Assembly addressby President Clinton of the United States  in which hereferred to the creation of an international coalitionagainst genocide  an idea that had been put forward at thefiftieth session by His Excellency Mr. Pasteur Bizimungu President of the Rwandese Republic.In the wake of the genocide  nearly the entirepopulation of Rwanda was displaced. Most Rwandesewere widows  of whom 34 per cent had become heads ofhousehold. There were thousands of orphans  most ofwhom had also become heads of their households. Manychildren were involved in these acts of genocide; theydeserve to be reeducated in an appropriate setting. MyGovernment has an ambitious programme to take up thechallenge of helping survivors of the genocide coexistwith the perpetrators.We are fortunate today that thanks to the vigorousmeasures which have been taken and to the support of theinternational community  my Government has been ableto ensure security throughout its territory  bring therefugees home and house them  get the economy back ontrack and ensure food security.After the genocide of 1994  Rwanda found itselfwith its judicial system completely destroyed and itsprisons crammed with suspects. The Governmenttherefore began rebuilding the national judicial systemand collaborated in establishing international judicialmachinery to deal with that heinous crime againsthumanity  genocide.I must pay a tribute here to the internationalcommunity  which came to my country’s assistance byestablishing the United Nations International CriminalTribunal for Rwanda (ICTR). But we must highlight thatalthough we welcome the establishment of the Tribunal we regret the slowness of its trial procedures and itssometimes secretive way of choosing suspects to try. TheGovernment of Rwanda states that it is neverthelesswilling to collaborate with the Tribunal and to doeverything possible to speed up its proceedings.One of the difficulties involved in arresting thecriminals who committed genocide in Rwanda is thatwhen the Government that organized the genocide fell  allits various acolytes scattered throughout the world.Fortunately  some of them have been arrested with the27assistance of the countries that took them in. We wish topay a ringing tribute to the fraternal countries that havearrested and extradited criminals sought by the Tribunal forRwanda. We urge them to continue their cooperation andcall on those that have not yet been able to do so to fulfilthis obligation to humankind.We note with satisfaction also that in his report(S/1999/957) on the protection of civilians in armedconflict  the Secretary-General recommends to the SecurityCouncil that it should make full cooperation obligatorybetween Member States with the International CriminalTribunals for Rwanda and for Yugoslavia. We note alsothat this recommendation by the Secretary-General is in linewith the wishes of the several speakers who have spokenup either in the Security Council or here in the Assembly against the culture impunity. In this we find hope that therewill never again  anywhere in the world  be a genocide.I would mention another very important programme bymy Government: for national reconciliation and to establishthe constitutional rule of law. As part of the programme my Government has established two commissions: theNational Commission for Human Rights and theCommission for National Unity and Reconciliation. Themission of these two commissions is to promote thepositive values of mutual respect and national reconciliationwhich  along with education in participatory democracy  arethe top priorities for the people of Rwanda.Concerning the democratization of our institutions  itis a pleasure for me to announce from this rostrum that thedemocratization process has started  with local elections which should ensure  more than before  participation by thepopulation in managing the business of the State. Thisprocess also has on its agenda the purpose of giving youngpeople and women a greater role in that management.The United Nations has a Charter whose principlesand purposes serve to guide us towards a world ofsolidarity  of harmony and security. But there have beenmany failures despite our common aspirations to peace.This is sufficient proof that the way in which ourOrganization is functioning betrays its very reason forexistence. That is why  during this session  manydelegations — and particularly the current President of theOrganization of African Unity (OAU)  Mr. AbdelazizBouteflika — have shown that reform of the UnitedNations and  more particularly  of the Security Council isboth necessary and urgent. We join those delegations thathave already spoken in favour of this long-awaited reform.A few moments ago I referred to the greatachievements of science. Here  I could not fail to mentionthe concept of globalization. Convinced of the benefits oftrade and between peoples  we in Rwanda believe thatthis new system brings with it new hopes. Nevertheless we fear that the structural differences between our variouseconomies will require altering the expectations of ourpeoples  whom globalization is supposed to serve. Wetherefore believe that the effectiveness of globalizationwill be measured in terms of how it contributes toresolving such sensitive questions as the povertyeradication  the debt burden  and peace and security.Another factor for the success of globalization is theestablishment of viable regional economic arrangementsthrough integration based on cooperation betweendeveloping countries. We are happy that Africa hasalready started to move in this direction  whether withinOAU or the African Economic Community or insubregional organizations. We are very pleased also tonote the contribution of the economic organizations inAfrica  not only to the development effort but also toconflict prevention and resolution.In this connection we applaud the role the SouthernAfrican Development Community (SADC) countries haveplayed in preventing and resolving conflicts in thesubregion. We likewise applaud the regional and bilateralinitiatives that have given rise to such great hopes forpeace  particularly in West Africa  in the Horn of Africa in the Middle East between Israel and Palestine  in EastTimor and in the Balkan region. We do earnestly requestthe international community to support these efforts.I particularly applaud the efforts of the Secretary-General and the resolve he has shown in increasing theefficiency of the United Nations in the area of peace andinternational security. The delegation of Rwanda  for itspart  contributed to the discussions of the SecurityCouncil on 17 and 30 September this year (S/PV.4046(Resumption 1) and S/PV.4049 (Resumption 2))  onconflict in Africa. In this respect  my delegation trulyappreciates the very important contribution of thePresident of Zambia  Frederick Chiluba  in SecurityCouncil discussions (S/PV.4047).The Agreement on a ceasefire in the DemocraticRepublic of Congo signed in Lusaka on 10 July 1999(S/1999/815) is a commitment by the signatories torespect and participate fully in the peace process. Twoimportant clauses support this agreement: first  the clauseon inter-Congolese political negotiations towards a new28political order in the Democratic Republic of the Congo;and secondly  the clause on pursuing and disarming thearmed groups  including former Rwandan soldiers and theInterahamwe militias who perpetrated the genocide of 1994and later became integrated into the army of theDemocratic Republic of the Congo. The Agreement alsoprovides for various methods by which it is to be put intoeffect  and also contains clauses that will help preserve it inboth spirit and letter.In this respect  I recall that subparagraph b ofparagraph 2 of article 1 of the Agreement requires thesignatories parties to cease hostile propaganda; the goal isto ensure that the Ceasefire Agreement is respected.Nevertheless  the Minister for Foreign Affairs of theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  Mr. Ndombasi  fromthis rostrum  violently attacked my country  Rwanda. Thereis no need for me to revisit those outrageous accusations because our representative has had the occasion to explainour intervention in the crisis in the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo. I simply wish to respond to one of his concerns many times repeated in his statement.The Minister for Foreign Affairs of the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo several times over asked thisAssembly to intercede with Rwanda so that Rwandawithdraws from the Democratic Republic of the Congo.By way of response  I declare before this Assemblythat Rwanda welcomes and supports the outcome of theAfrican initiative and urges the international community togive its unconditional support to the implementation of theterms of this Agreement by all the parties  which mustrefrain from any violation of the ceasefire. Unfortunately we are receiving news that the contrary is happening  forthose who call for implementation of the ceasefire are thefirst to violate it.Nr. Jusys (Lithuania)  Vice-President  took the Chair.For two years already  the Kinshasa Government hasbeen training  equipping and enrolling in its own army ex-officers of the former Rwandan armed forces whocommitted acts of genocide and should be prosecuted.Furthermore  these officers  who directed the genocide  areon the headquarters staff of the army of the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo. As the representative of Burundihas just said  these armed elements are fomenting insecurityand propagating the idea of genocide throughout the region.Now that the Lusaka Agreement has been signed byall the parties to the conflict  we dare to hope that a UnitedNations peacekeeping force will be deployed as soon aspossible  and that soon peace will reign in our subregion.May this Agreement enjoy the full support of the entireinternational community."
"145",6053,"SAU",54,1999,"It ismy pleasure to express my sincere congratulations toMr. Gurirab on his election to the presidency of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-fourth session. His electionto this eminent position reflects the appreciation of theinternational community for him personally and for thepositive role played by country  Namibia  in theinternational arena. I am confident that his presidency atthis session will be an effective factor in achieving theobjectives to which the international community aspiresunder the present critical circumstances.I would like to take this opportunity to convey toMr. Didier Opertti  Foreign Minister of Uruguay andPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-thirdsession  our appreciation  esteem and praise for hiseffective  wise and objective conduct of the Assembly’swork. I am also pleased to express my appreciation andesteem to Mr. Kofi Annan  the Secretary-General of theUnited Nations  who manages the affairs of thisinternational Organization with great competence born ofexperience and who makes continuous efforts andpersistent endeavours to achieve peace  security andstability in our modern world.The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is also pleased towelcome the admission of the Republic of Kiribati  theRepublic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga to themembership of the United Nations and hopes that theiradmission will further enhance the effectiveness of theOrganization in achieving the noble goals it was createdfor.Some years have passed since we celebrated thefiftieth anniversary of the United Nations. Thatcelebration was a glorious occasion on which wereviewed the purposes and principles of this internationalOrganization and the opportunities and challenges it hadfaced over the previous decades. We also reviewed itsachievements in maintaining world peace and security andthe difficulties and obstacles that it managed to deal withand overcome through the belief of its Members and thenobility of its ideals and objectives. The existence of thisOrganization  and its ability to find solutions to many of32the problems that have rocked our turbulent world  despiteall the challenges it has faced  makes us all the moreconvinced of the vitality of its role  a role that has becomemore pressing and urgent due to recent developments in theworld.The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  as a founding Memberof this Organization  continues to hold the same ideals andvalues that motivated it to join this universal effort with theother founding Members. The founders called for therejection of war and the establishment of peace and forconstructive cooperation among all peoples of this world.This was after a series of disasters and catastrophes hadoverwhelmed the human race during two destructive worldwars that claimed millions of lives and left behinddevastation and ruin.Wars and military confrontations are no longer thoughtof as politics or diplomacy by other means. Violence andwarfare with modern lethal weapons can never be aneffective means to attain political ends  nor a viableapproach to achieving diplomatic gains. In today’s worldthere is no victor in any military confrontation.Our Organization’s objective of achieving cooperationin social and economic areas among peoples of the worldis no longer a mere wish or luxury; in fact  it has becomean unavoidable necessity as a result of recent political andeconomic developments  as well as of major advances andrevolutions  unprecedented in human history  in technologyand communications. As a result of these changes anddevelopments  the world has been transformed from a vastcollection of entities and multilateral trends and patternsinto a village in which every part is affected by what ailsthe other part. These parts are interdependent as regardsmany of their vital needs and environmental conditions. Theconcept of globalization  which has become an integral partof our daily discourse  is nothing more than a condensedformula for the intellectual and existential changes that haveovertaken the lives of our people and the work of States inthe last two decades. If we are going to deal with thisphenomenon in a way that emphasizes the positives anddiscards the negatives  we must adjust to it by developingour institutions and procedures.The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia confirms  as it alwayshas in the past  its steady commitment to the purposes andprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations and wouldlike to reiterate the need for supporting this Organizationand its specialized agencies. They provide a viableframework for cooperation between countries and peoplesfor facing the tidal wave of globalization. The Kingdom ofSaudi Arabia also emphasizes once again that the abilityof this international Organization to resolve globalproblems and to fulfil its basic responsibilities dependsvery much on the political will of the Member States toimplement the principles  ideals  visions and expectationsembodied in the Organization’s Charter. What is meantby political will here is the degree to which each MemberState is ready to carry out its commitment  adhere to theletter of the Charter of the United Nations and submit itsconduct to the rules of the Charter. In this regard  myGovernment is quite cognizant of the importance ofmodernizing the agencies of our Organization in a mannerthat enables the Organization to play its required role andto deal with the new developments that are taking placein contemporary international relations.The Security Council  being responsible forpreserving international peace and security  remains thepivot around which different kinds of ideas for reform arebeing expressed. In this regard  my country’s point ofview continues to be based on a deep conviction that anyrestructuring of the Security Council must endeavour toimprove its capabilities to perform effectively its roleunder the Charter and to be more active in implementingits own resolutions and in dealing with internationalcrises. In addition  the policies of the Council shouldharmonize with the will of the General Assembly in amanner that achieves the required balance and the desiredobjectivity.The General Assembly resolution declaring 2001 theUnited Nations Year of Dialogue among Civilizationsmanifests the desire of the international community toenter the third millennium firmly resolved to seeharmony  justice and equality prevail among nations. Italso shows the Assembly’s desire for everyone toparticipate in building a world that is balanced in terms ofinterests and mutual benefits in which people enjoyequitable living conditions free from fear  terror  hungerand poverty; a world in which the principles of justice triumph and peace and prosperity are available to all. Thedialogue among civilizations is the ideal alternative totheories of conflict and of the inevitable clash ofcivilizations. This compels us to affirm the importance ofdialogue and harmony among nations and the need toobserve differences in the nature of societies and in theirbeliefs  and to respect peoples’ and nations’ freedom ofchoice  as well as the need to abide by the rules ofinternational law.This Organization  in both the Security Council andthe General Assembly  has been preoccupied throughout33its history with the Middle East question and theachievement of a permanent and comprehensive solution tothe Arab-Israeli conflict. When  in Madrid at the end ofOctober 1991  the peace process was launched — with allits bilateral and multilateral tracks and on the basis ofprinciples accepted by all parties to the conflict — everyonebelieved that a new era of peace  stability and growth waslooming and that this era would put an end to the phase ofwars and conflicts that had exhausted the energies andcapabilities of the peoples of the region. In fact  the peaceprocess in all its aspects did move forward and someprogress has been achieved  especially on the Palestinianand Jordanian tracks. The multilateral talks relating toregional cooperation also gained some ground. The peaceprocess then suffered from paralysis and reached animpasse due to the policies and practices of the formerIsraeli Government  and in spite of the fact that the Arabshad declared peace an irrevocable strategic choice.However  this did not change the practices of the formerIsraeli Government and its disregard for the principles ofthe peace process  nor remedy its failure to fulfil itsobligations under the agreements signed with thePalestinians  including the Wye River Memorandum.At present there is an attempt to revive the peaceprocess. Assurances issued by the new Israeli PrimeMinister indicate that he intends to activate the peaceprocess on all tracks. The Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum signed on 4 September of this year  could be a good step iffollowed by similar steps to move the process towards thebases and principles that were established at the MadridConference — the principle of land for peace  first andforemost.On the Palestinian track  peace requires withdrawalfrom the occupied territories and the restoration of all thelegitimate national rights of the Palestinians  including theirright to establish their own independent State withJerusalem as its capital. The final status issue of Jerusalemshould be addressed in accordance with Security Councilresolutions 242 (1967) and 252 (1968). Jerusalem is part ofthe occupied territories  and Israel should refrain fromundertaking any unilateral measures that prejudice the statusof that sacred city. It is imperative and natural that anycomprehensive and permanent settlement address the issueof the return of the Palestinian refugees  in accordance withGeneral Assembly resolution 194 (III). It should alsoaddress the issues of the release of prisoners  settlementsand water resources  among others.As for the Syrian track  negotiations should resume atthe point where they left off because of a decision of theprevious Israeli Government. It is well known that Syriaremains willing and prepared to reach a comprehensiveand permanent solution based on the principle of land forpeace.The Lebanese track is subject to Security Councilresolution 425 (1978)  which calls for the immediate andunconditional withdrawal of the Israeli forces fromsouthern Lebanon and western Bekaa.More than nine years after Iraq’s aggression againstthe State of Kuwait  it is still procrastinating on theimplementation of crucial parts of the relevant SecurityCouncil resolutions. The Iraqi people are still paying theprice for crimes committed by their regime and for itscontinual challenges to international legality. In spite ofall Arab and international initiatives and proposals aimedat finding an effective mechanism and process to lift theeconomic sanctions imposed on Iraq and to end thesuffering of the Iraqi people  the Iraqi Government hasnot responded in a manner that might help move mattersin the right direction.What encourages the Iraqi Government to continuemanoeuvring and procrastinating is the fact that theSecurity Council itself is unable to take action due to theinability of its permanent members to agree on a commonapproach and on the proposals under discussion. Theseproposals are aimed at finding a way out of the currentcrisis by reviving the inspection and monitoring of bannedIraqi weapons and at regulating the present and futurerelations between Iraq and the United Nations. No matterwhat the circumstances  Iraq should be required to fullyimplement all international resolutions relating to itsaggression against Kuwait and to cooperate seriously withthe International Committee of the Red Cross to achievethe release of all Kuwaiti and non-Kuwaiti prisoners anddetainees  as well as the restitution of Kuwaiti property.It should also refrain from all provocative oraggressive acts against the State of Kuwait and otherneighbouring countries  in compliance with SecurityCouncil resolution 949 (1994)  and prove its peacefulintentions towards its neighbours in word and deed. Thisis the proper way to put an end to the human sufferingfor which the Iraqi regime bears sole responsibility. Thepain which the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and its sisterlycountries in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) feeltowards such human suffering is commensurate only withtheir keenness to preserve the independence  unity andterritorial integrity of Iraq.34Relations between the Islamic Republic of Iran and theGulf Cooperation Council member States have lately beenbuoyed by the positive attitude of the Iranian Government.Yet  there remain outstanding issues to be resolved particularly that of the three United Arab Emirates islandsof Greater Tunb  Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa. The GCCForeign Ministers  with the approval and blessing of theUnited Arab Emirates Government  decided to refer thematter to a tripartite committee entrusted with creating aclimate conducive to direct negotiations between the UnitedArab Emirates and the Islamic Republic of Iran. This trendreflects the desire of the United Arab Emirates to resolvethe outstanding issues in a positive spirit. We feeloptimistic about this issue in the light of the demonstrateddesire of President Mohammad Khatami to open a newchapter in Iran's relations with the Gulf countries characterized by good-neighbourliness  non-interference ininternal affairs and constructive cooperation to the benefitand interest of both sides.Just when it seemed that the problem of Bosnia andHerzegovina was resolved in accordance with the provisionsof the Dayton Accords — which laid the ground forBosnian independence and sovereignty  paved the way forthe return of refugees  provided for the pursuit and arrest ofofficials responsible for the crimes of ethnic cleansing andgenocide  and the establishment of domestic peace — theBalkan region witnessed a crisis in Kosovo no lessdevastating in its human dimensions than that in Bosnia.Like the Bosnians  the Kosovars were exposed to ethniccleansing  genocide  repression  intimidation and forceddeportation at the hands of Serbian forces as the worldwatched. Once again  the United Nations faced the problemof dealing with a dangerous situation that threatened theentire Balkan region. This situation was reversed only bythe intervention of the North Atlantic Treaty Organizationforces after Serbia refused to accept the provisions of theRambouillet agreement.Resort to military force without a United Nationsmandate to resolve such problems might not be the idealway to settle international crises  but it becomes anunavoidable necessity whenever the Security Council  dueto disunity and disagreements between its permanentMembers  fails to fulfil its role in maintaining world peaceand security. We hope that this pattern will not be repeated so that the United Nations may preserve its dignity andintegrity.Many regions of the world remain plagued by wars regional and ethnic conflicts  border disputes and nationaland tribal conflicts. Fighting between the Afghan factionsstill rages  denying Afghanistan and its people the fruitsof liberation from foreign occupation. It is regrettable tosee that some have exploited the current situation inAfghanistan to turn the country into a terrorist haven andtraining base  thereby contributing to the country'sinsecurity and instability and exposing the Afghan peopleto more suffering. My country supports the efforts of theUnited Nations and the Organization of IslamicConference to re-establish peace and security throughoutAfghanistan.The Pakistani-Indian conflict over Jammu andKashmir remains a source of tension and instabilitybetween the two neighbourly countries  especially afterthe recent military escalation between them. We call onboth sides to exercise utmost restraint and to settle theconflict through negotiations in compliance with UnitedNations resolutions  which recognize the right of thepeople of Jammu and Kashmir to self-determination.The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has been followingwith great concern the latest developments in East Timor.While it welcomes the positive stand taken by theIndonesian Government  especially its cooperation withthe United Nations  it wishes to affirm the need to respectthe regional sovereignty of the Republic of Indonesia andthe importance of peace and security throughout theregion.The scenes of fighting and armed conflict betweenbrothers in Africa  especially in the Horn  are a source ofpain to us. These conflicts will only deepen wounds andenlarge the circle of poverty and distress. In this regard we still have high expectations in the wisdom of theleaders of that great continent to consider the ultimateinterests of their nations and to resolve conflicts throughpeaceful means.The international community was pleased to put anend to the Lockerbie issue  which caused much sufferingfor Libya and its people. We look forward to a SecurityCouncil resolution that would lead to a final lifting of allsanctions imposed on Libya by virtue of its positivereaction to international appeals and its adherence to allconditions related to this issue.I would also like to praise the people of Algeria forthe great mandate they gave their new leadership to moveforward with the suggested reconciliation plan that aimsat ending the era of differences and violence  which wasextremely painful for the fraternal people of Algeria.35The Government of the Custodian of the Two HolyMosques is keenly interested in the ongoing efforts toeliminate weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East including the Arabian Gulf region. This is demonstratedthrough its support for the efforts of the Arab League at its101st session  which called for making that sensitive part ofthe world a zone free of all weapons of mass destruction be they nuclear  chemical or biological. In this respect  weare greatly concerned about Israel's continued refusal toaccede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons (NPT)  thus keeping its nuclear programmesoutside the range of international inspections andconstituting a serious threat to the region's security.We believe in the urgent need to increase theeffectiveness of the NPT through the activation anduniversalization of the International Atomic EnergyAgency's safeguards system. We also find it extremelyimportant to establish the necessary controls and measuresthat would assist in achieving progress in all areas of thecomprehensive disarmament of all weapons of massdestruction  in conformity with General Assemblyresolution 1 (I) of 1946.The scourge of terrorism  which strikesindiscriminately throughout the world  has become aninternational phenomenon with grave consequences requiring systematic international efforts to contain andcombat it. The Government of the Kingdom of SaudiArabia has regularly condemned terrorism in all its forms lending its voice to international efforts aimed at combatingthis dangerous phenomenon. What needs to be emphasizedhere is that violence and terrorism are universal phenomenanot restricted to a certain people  race or religion. Preciselybecause of the comprehensiveness and universality ofterrorism  the only way to combat it effectively is throughunified and collective international action within theframework of the United Nations  which alone can put anend to terrorism  save the lives of innocent people andpreserve the independence and sovereignty of the countriesof the world. Fighting terrorism calls for internationalcooperation against sheltering terrorist groups andindividuals  thereby preventing them from exploiting theterritories and laws of the States where they live to pursuetheir destructive activities  regardless of their pretexts andarguments.The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia considers environmentalissues and environmental protection of key importance  asevidenced by their prominent place in our domestic andforeign policies. This is because we believe that a safedecent life for mankind is directly connected to theenvironment. That is why the Kingdom has activelyparticipated in all relevant conferences and internationalgatherings  symposiums and arrangements. We have alsobecome party to several regional and internationalagreements that are geared towards this cause. We onlyhope that international efforts related to the problems ofthe environment will be formulated in a balanced andobjective manner based on serious scientific facts andstudies that take into account development needs in thedeveloping world. We call upon all States to abide byAgenda 21. We also urge the industrialized States inparticular to live up to their obligations regarding thetransfer of environment-friendly technology to thedeveloping nations.The emerging phenomenon of globalization  whichis forcing geographic borders to recede and sovereigntyand political barriers to disappear  has become an issue towhich all nations must adjust. We are required now  morethan ever before  to address this phenomenon in a waythat brings about a world of balanced interests  mutualbenefits and equal opportunities for all. If we are toachieve this goal  the developing nations must redoubletheir domestic environmental efforts in order to catch upwith the global economy. They are further called upon tointensify their efforts to remove the barriers that hindertheir integration into the multifaceted world trade system.They are also required to adjust their economic policiesand to establish the infrastructures necessary for theirmanufactured goods to meet the standard specifications ofthe importing countries.In return  industrial and economically developednations should contribute to the fulfilment of the desiredgoals in the following ways: first  by displaying greaterflexibility in the conditions of admission to the WorldTrade Organization (WTO) by giving developingcountries longer interim periods that are in line with theirdevelopment needs and to help them adjust their systemsand laws to the requirements of membership; secondly  bygiving developing countries enhanced opportunities tobenefit from the system of general preferences  to expanddistribution of their products and to provide guaranteesfor greater stability and transparency in the regimesgoverning those products; thirdly  by limiting theimposition of protective measures by industrializednations on major imports from developing nations thathinder their integration into world markets and reducetheir ability to compete  and removing the obstacles facedby developing countries; and fourthly  ensuring thatindustrial nations carry out their obligations to developingcountries  as set forth in the Uruguay Round and in the36WTO agreements  by providing direct and indirectassistance and restructuring or forgiveness of debts. Theindustrialized nations should also open their markets to thedeveloping nations’ exports and refrain from adoptingunjust procedures to limit the size and flow of such exports.In this context  it is worth noting that the Kingdom ofSaudi Arabia has been at the forefront of contributions tothe promotion and development of developing countries whether bilaterally or multilaterally. In the same vein  andin view of the Kingdom’s desire to shape future trends inthe world economy  the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia hasapplied for admission to the WTO and hopes  God willing to gain the support of friendly nations in order to finalizethe admission procedure as soon as possible.As we prepare for the third millennium  we areoverwhelmed by different feelings and emotions. In view ofthe conflicts and the social  economic  cultural andenvironmental challenges that we currently face  optimismis mixed with pessimism about the future of our world inthe coming historical period. If the purpose of creating theUnited Nations was to convert the logic of war andconfrontation into the language of dialogue and cooperation at a time when the cost of using military force has becomeexorbitant and the outcome uncertain  we now live in a newperiod full of signs that require us to work together as hardas possible and to cooperate not only in the face of politicaland military challenges  but also in confronting the newchallenges of contemporary life  with all its complexitiesand complications  which can only be solved or managedthrough organized collective efforts.Our firm belief that the United Nations can play amajor role in dealing with current issues and enhancinginternational cooperation in order to resolve and containthese issues makes us more determined than ever to supportthis Organization and endorse its constructive role. One ofthe valuable lessons we have learned from United Nationsactivities is the need to enable our Organization to detectcrises and to move to contain them before they erupt byapplying preventive diplomacy to the fullest extent. Movingto manage crises before they grow is the best way to avoidtheir harmful consequences and repercussions.In conclusion  I must re-emphasize a basic fact: inorder to solve today’s problems it has become vitallynecessary for us to cooperate in a spirit of total disinterest objectivity and responsibility. The future of the UnitedNations  which is also our future  depends on this.Allah says in the Holy Koran:“Help ye one anotherIn righteousness and piety But help ye not one anotherIn sin and rancour”.(The Holy Koran  V:2)"
"146",6092,"SDN",54,1999,"Allow me atthe outset to extend to Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab the sincerecongratulations of my delegation on his election to thepresidency of this session. We are confident that his well-known experience and abilities will lead this session to asuccessful conclusion. We assure him of the fullcooperation of our delegation to achieve that objective.We also wish to express our appreciation to hispredecessor for his valuable efforts  which led to thesuccess of the previous session. By the same token  ourappreciation also goes to Mr. Kofi Annan  the Secretary-General of the United Nations  for his efforts at the helmof the Organization.I also wish to welcome our newest Members — theRepublic of Kiribati  the Republic of Nauru and theKingdom of Tonga.Mr. President  heeding your appeal to be very brief I will not touch on all the points detailed in my statementbefore the Assembly  and I ask that the edited version beplaced on record.Since I last spoke before the Assembly one year ago the Sudan has witnessed numerous developments in thepolitical  economic and social fields. A permanentconstitution was endorsed by an overwhelming majorityof the people in a popular and free referendum. Thisconstitution guarantees for the Sudanese people allpolitical and civil freedoms and rights  including the right27to form political parties and social and culturalorganizations.Despite the difficulties faced by Sudan  as a result ofboth the war and natural disasters  it has been able  throughits own efforts  to restructure its economy to meet therequirements of the free market. All this took place in thenear-total absence of foreign aid. The Sudan has alsostarted to exploit its natural resources  both agricultural andmineral  in particular oil  which we started exporting on 30August last. Oil revenues will contribute to strengtheningnational efforts for socio-economic development.In the economic field  these endeavours havecontributed to reversing a number of the short-termnegative effects of the economic liberalization policies.These reform measures have so far helped to achieve an 8per cent total growth rate and to reduce the rate of inflationto 13 per cent  and have led the International MonetaryFund to commend this remarkable achievement. In order toalleviate the economic burdens resulting from economicreform policies  our Government has adopted a number ofmeasures to assist the more vulnerable groups and low-income citizens through social assistance funds  theprovision of “soft” loans and the establishment of smallproductive projects for youth and women.In the search for peace in southern Sudan  theGovernment accepted the Declaration of Principles as abasis for its negotiations with the rebels within theframework of the Intergovernmental Authority onDevelopment (IGAD). It also declared a partial ceasefire as it had repeatedly done  in order to ensure the delivery ofrelief assistance to its citizens affected by the war.Subsequently  we came to the conclusion that the mosteffective way to show our seriousness about arriving at agenuine and lasting solution to this humanitarian tragedywas to ensure the cessation of all hostilities. TheGovernment therefore took its recent initiative to establisha general and comprehensive ceasefire while continuing thenegotiations through IGAD  with the assistance of ourIGAD partners. However  those efforts by my Governmentwere met by prevarication and were not taken seriously bythe other side. The failure of the rebel movement to accepta comprehensive ceasefire is proof of its lack of interestand seriousness in searching for a solution to the problem which has enriched its leaders at the expense of theSudanese people in general and of our southern citizens inparticular.The Sudan looks forward to a more effective role byIGAD  the partners of IGAD and the Egyptian and Libyanconciliation initiative  in support of the peace efforts. Thecall for a comprehensive ceasefire has also been endorsedby the United Nations and the international community.We are grateful for and appreciate that support. Yet theprocess needs to be given further impetus and support ifan environment conducive to the establishment of peaceis to be created and all the obstacles in its way are to beremoved.In this context  we call upon the internationalcommunity to take punitive measures against the rebelGarang similar to those taken against Savimbi in Angola in order to persuade him to join the peace effort. We alsocall for continued support for the Government initiativeaimed at achieving a comprehensive ceasefire  throughbringing pressure to bear on the rebel movement to acceptthat initiative and to show some seriousness in thenegotiations in order to find a solution to the problem.Furthermore  demands must continue to be made for thehanding over of the remains of the four relief workersmurdered by the movement last April.With regard to the practices of the rebel movement I should like to speak about developments in thehumanitarian situation  which continues to deteriorate inthe south of the country despite relative improvements inBahr el-Ghazal and other areas. From this rostrum  Iwould like to express our thanks and appreciation to thecountries and organizations that continue to provide reliefand humanitarian assistance to those affected in theSudan  whether directly or through Operation LifelineSudan. We believe that there is a need for the gradualtransition from relief to development in the areas thatenjoy stability  security and peace now that the Khartoumpeace agreement and the Fashoda accord have beensigned.We call upon the donor countries and organizationsto make contributions to the consolidated appeal for theSudan for 1999  in view of the noticeable decline in itsresources  which last June amounted to only 31 per centof requirements. We also emphasize that it is importantnot to allow political posturing to get in the way ofhumanitarian and relief work. There is also a need toavoid selectivity in dealing with humanitarian issues which affect the lives of peoples and individuals.The Sudan would like to inform the Assembly of itsfull commitment to a general and comprehensive ceasefirethroughout southern Sudan for humanitarian reasons andas a means of paving the way for peace negotiations. Wehope that the other party will respond positively so that28we can begin to take practical steps to disengage the forcesand monitor the ceasefire. The Government will allocate alarge part of its oil revenues for humanitarian anddevelopment needs in the south. It will also allocate part ofthis year's grain harvest for distribution by United Nationsagencies to the needy population in the south. The war hascontinued for a long time  and we appreciate the roleplayed by the international community in extendinghumanitarian assistance. That situation cannot go onforever; the one and only solution to the crisis is a peacefulone.The conflicts in Africa have brought untold sufferingand hardships  to the peoples of the continent. One of thegreatest problems is that of the more than 8 millionrefugees who live under extremely difficult circumstances.In its search to put an end to the suffering of the refugeesand to find radical solutions to the problem  theOrganization of African Unity (OAU) decided to convenethe first ministerial meeting of the committee on refugeesand internally displaced persons. That important meetingwas held last December in Khartoum with the activeparticipation of the sisterly African States  the relevantUnited Nations bodies  the regional organizationsconcerned  the International Committee of the Red Crossand other non-governmental organizations. The meetingadopted the Khartoum Declaration  which contained anassessment of the problems facing refugees and displacedpersons with a view to addressing the underlying causes ofthese problems and to establishing favourable conditions forthe restoration of peace and stability in order to encouragethe voluntary return of refugees and internally displacedpersons to their homes in safety and dignity. From thisrostrum  we appeal to the international community and therelevant organizations to continue to provide support for theStates affected by these problems so as to ensure theprompt and effective implementation of the KhartoumDeclaration and its recommendations with regard torefugees and internally displaced persons.We call for the renunciation of selectivity in dealingwith the question of humanitarian assistance  human rightsand democracy at the international level. We also appeal toStates to avoid politicizing these questions and using themas a pretext for interference in the internal affairs of others.We are eager to see those lofty principles appliedeffectively while preserving the principle of the sovereignty security and territorial integrity of States. In this context we should like to draw attention to the cooperation of theGovernment of the Sudan with the United Nations in thedelivery of relief assistance to the affected population in thesouth  as well as to the recent visit of the United Nationsmission to the Nuba Mountain region to assess thehumanitarian needs there.In his report on the work of the Organization and hisopening statement before this session  theSecretary-General reflected the international concernabout the expansion and intensification of civil wars andother conflicts in various regions and the human tragediesand physical and economic destruction that result fromsuch wars. We share the Secretary-General's concern onthis matter. We reaffirm the importance of maximizingcollective efforts to eliminate the causes of conflictsbefore they erupt and of using all available means to putan end to them.We believe  however  that any actions taken ormeans used must have the consent and agreement of theState concerned and must be within the framework ofinternational laws and standards  particularly those of theUnited Nations Charter. In the absence of a transparent democratic and just international order  moving outsidethat framework and calling for interference in the internalaffairs of States will only lead to chaos and the hegemonyof the powerful over the weak.President Abdelaziz Bouteflika  the current Chairmanof the OAU  summed up the fears and concerns of thesmall and weak States in this regard by saying that weremain very sensitive to any encroachment on oursovereignty  not only because it constitutes our last lineof defence against the laws of an unjust world butbecause we do not participate effectively in thedecision-making process in the Security Council or in themonitoring of the implementation of these decisions.Modern history is full of examples of such unjustinterpretation and application of laws and resolutions. Iwould like to highlight just one example: the unjust andunjustified attack by the United States on the al-Shifapharmaceutical factory and the inability of the SecurityCouncil to take a decision on Sudan's request to send amission to investigate the American allegationsconcerning the factory.The ideas put forward by the Secretary-General inhis report require further consultations and considerationby the General Assembly and other United Nationsbodies  with the participation of all Member States andwithin the framework of the Charter and internationallaws and norms.29Undoubtedly  the continued imbalance in internationalrelations has strengthened the trend towards unilateralsupremacy and double standards. This imbalance has hadnegative effects on international peace  security andstability. It has also created an unhealthy atmosphere whichpromotes the interests of certain States while ignoring indeed belittling  the interests and rights of the weakermembers of the international community. Hence  the Sudanhas always supported the call for the establishment of abalanced and diverse international order  an order thatrespects the specific religious  historical and culturalcharacteristics of peoples and that protects their naturalright to choose their own social  economic and politicalsystems in harmony with their cultural attributes.The fact that the Sudan is being targeted by the UnitedStates Administration is not open to question. Indeed  theUnited States Administration itself does not deny this. Ithas taken many measures aimed at destabilizing Sudan andits security  and has pursued a declared policy of isolatingthe Sudan through the provision of military assistance tosome of its neighbours. It has consistently voted against theSudan in the international financial institutions and hassponsored resolutions condemning and denouncing theSudan at the United Nations and its specialized agencies. Ithas also attempted to smear the Sudan’s image in theinternational arena. It has made baseless accusations againstthe Sudan  charging it with involvement in internationalterrorism and placing its name on its list of what it callsStates sponsoring terrorism. Furthermore  the United StatesAdministration imposed unilateral economic sanctions onthe Sudan despite the international community’s clear anddeclared position on such coercive economic measures. Allthese actions have been taken by the United States on thebasis of totally false and unfounded allegations andaccusations. The United States Administration has neverbeen able to produce a single piece of evidence to prove itsallegations.The unjust United States actions and accusationsagainst the Sudan culminated last year in the bombing anddestruction of the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory inKhartoum. A whole year has elapsed since I addressed theGeneral Assembly from this rostrum about the flagrantaggression by the United States of America against thatfactory  which was privately owned and financed by thebank of the Common Market for Eastern and SouthernAfrica (COMESA). Has any action been taken since theSudan explained to the international community theenormity of the mistake perpetrated by the United Statesagainst the Sudanese people  depriving them of a mainsource of medication for their innocent children and for themany refugees and displaced persons that are givenshelter by the Sudan? The Sudan continues to demandand to expect justice and redress from the SecurityCouncil as the organ with the primary responsibility forthe maintenance of international peace and security.Immediately after the bombing of the factory last August Sudan requested the Security Council to send a missionto ascertain the facts regarding the factory’s ownershipand output  and to verify the allegations invoked by theUnited States to attempt to justify its aggression. Thenon-aligned countries  the Arab Group  the African Groupand the members of the Organization of the IslamicConference all wrote letters to the Security Councilsupporting the Sudan’s request. Most regrettably  theCouncil remained unable to act. The United Statesprevented the Council from discharging its most basicduty in this regard  namely to investigate the allegationsthat the United States used to try to justify its armedaggression.Since I addressed the Assembly last year  dozens ofarticles and reports have been published in major UnitedStates newspapers. Numerous statements have been madeby United States congressional officials and formerCentral Intelligence Agency experts  along with a numberof academic studies by specialized institutes in the UnitedStates and other countries  all of which affirm that the Al-Shifa factory was a pharmaceutical factory producinghuman and veterinary medicines. They also affirm thatthe United States made a terrible mistake by destroyingthat factory  which had links to the United Nations: theSecurity Council had authorized the factory to exportmedicines to Iraq within the framework of the oil-for-foodprogramme. The Sudan referred all these studies  articlesand declarations to the Security Council. This year  theowner of the factory hired some of the best known UnitedStates experts in the field of chemical weapons toexamine the factory and ascertain the truth about itsoutput. The experts took samples  which were examinedin the most sophisticated and advanced laboratories inEurope and the United States. The conclusion was that thefactory produced nothing other than medications forhuman and veterinary use. The Sudan also formed its ownspecialized scientific committee composed of universityprofessors in the Sudan to examine the factory. Thecommittee issued a report affirming once again that theUnited States allegations about the factory had no logicalor scientific basis.A most important development then followed: adecision by the United States Departments of Justice andof the Treasury to unfreeze the assets of the owner of the30factory in the United States. That reaffirms that thejustifications put forward by the United States for thebombing of the Al-Shifa factory were baseless. There is nophysical evidence to prove them. Rather  they were basedon misleading intelligence information. The United Statesallegations that the factory is owned by terrorist groups arealso baseless and lack any supporting evidence or proof.The United States decision to unfreeze the assets of thefactory’s owner came after the United States Administrationascertained that he had no connection with terrorism. Thisin itself is clear and irrefutable proof of what Sudan hasbeen saying before the international community all along.When the matter was put before the Security Councillast year and when the Sudan requested the dispatch of afact-finding mission  the United States objected on thepretext that it would settle the question bilaterally with theSudan. A whole year has elapsed and all we have receivedis more procrastination. This led me last August to sendanother letter to the President of the Security Councilasking him again to dispatch a fact-finding mission. Weappeal to the United Nations  as it represents all countries big and small  to prove its impartiality and objectivity; weappeal to the Security Council to send a mission to uncoverthe facts about the destruction of the Al-Shifapharmaceutical factory. The United Nations should requestthe United States not to object to the dispatch of suchmission if it is confident of the information and the causesthat led it to bomb the factory.The bombing of the pharmaceutical factory took thelives of a number of Sudanese. It deprived hundreds ofworkers of their livelihood. It also deprived the Sudanesepeople and the refugees from neighbouring countries oftheir main source of medication and vaccines. All thismakes the international community wonder about thesincerity of the United States commitment to human rights.In their 1998 and 1999 ministerial declarations  the Groupof 77 and China called for applying justice in this case inaccordance with the United Nations Charter andinternational law. This act of aggression was a unilateral actunacceptable to the international community. TheMovement of Non-Aligned Countries condemned this act atits Durban Summit and at subsequent ministerial meetings.Persisting in targeting the Sudan  the United StatesAdministration recently appointed a special envoy for theSudan with specific objectives and terms of reference.Sudan was not party to the choice of that envoy or to thedefinition of the objectives and terms of reference of hismission.Clearly  the way in which the United StatesAdministration chose this envoy reflects a condescendingattitude and is an act of cultural arrogance inconsistentwith the spirit of the United Nations Charter  whichgoverns relations between States. At the time when theUnited States claims to be concerned with the problemsof the Sudan  we find that it has blocked  to a largedegree  all channels of bilateral contact. When announcingthe appointment of the special envoy  the United Statesspokesman affirmed that his mandate would not includethe bilateral aspect of relations between the two countries.Here we would like to pose a question: how could a Stateappoint an envoy to another State without having his taskinclude their bilateral relations? This is indeed bizarre since the basic disagreements between us and the UnitedStates are of a bilateral nature. Such disagreements ledthe United States to use force to destroy a pharmaceuticalfactory  and then it refused international arbitration in thematter. It is also bizarre that the United StatesAdministration has given its envoy to the Sudan the taskof dealing with the questions of relief  human rights andpeace in the southern Sudan. I say this is bizarre becausethese questions are dealt with either in the United Nationsor at the regional level. The first question  relief  and thesecond  human rights  are dealt with in the relevantorgans of the United Nations  respectively  the Office forthe Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and theCommission on Human Rights. The issue of peace in thesouthern Sudan is being dealt with at the regional level bythe Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) with the support of the Organization of African Unity  theUnited Nations and the group of IGAD partners  of whichthe United States is a member. The Sudan will continueto follow closely the steps taken by the United StatesAdministration and will take the necessary measures toprotect its national interests. Here I would like to reaffirmthat the Government of the Sudan is willing to settle itsdifferences with the United States of America throughdialogue and the initiatives already taken in this regard with a view to breaking the stalemate. This interestcontinues even after the cruel American aggressionagainst the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory. Yet thisinterest of ours must be met with an objective responseby the other party. Hence  we call upon the UnitedNations and peace-loving countries to urge the UnitedStates Administration to take positive steps towards thenormalization of relations with the Sudan and to desistfrom interference in its internal affairs  which only resultsin prolonging the civil war and death and suffering for theSudanese people.31The Sudan believes that the United States  as a greatPower concerned with world and regional peace  could playan important role in the settlement of the Sudan’s problems.But for the United States to play that role  we demand thatit show neutrality and desist from injustice and aggression.The delegation of the Sudan is of the view that theMillennium Assembly  in which all world leaders willparticipate  is an important occasion for the United Nationsto enhance its role and its neutrality. In this regard  wepropose that the Millennium Summit declaration contain thefollowing: a reaffirmation of the importance of peacefulcoexistence; respect for plurality and diversity and thepromotion of dialogue between various cultures andreligions; a reaffirmation of the need to achieve securityand stability by resorting to the United Nations for thesettlement of conflicts between States; a reaffirmation ofthe need to coordinate international efforts for theachievement of development and the eradication of poverty;and a reaffirmation of the resolve of the internationalcommunity to combat terrorism in all its forms andmanifestations. In this regard  we would like to state ourunderstanding that the adoption of a declaration by theMillennium Summit will not detract from the UnitedNations Charter  which embodies lofty and noble principlesvalid for all time.In conclusion  most of the people of the Sudan areadherents of Islam and Christianity. Thus  the Sudan has arich legacy of tolerance and coexistence between religionsand cultures. Christianity  the religion of Jesus Christ —peace be upon him — teaches fraternity  tolerance andsuccour for the weak. Islam  the last of the revealedreligions  has brought an integrated way of life that upholdsthe value of freedom and thought. It also consecrates theprinciple of coexistence between religions and cultures. TheHoly Koran states “Invite (all) to the WayOf thy Lord with wisdomAnd beautiful preaching;And argue with themIn ways that are bestAnd most gracious.”(The Holy Koran  XVI:125)."
"147",6137,"SEN",54,1999,"In electingyou unanimously to preside over its at the fifty-fourthsession  Sir  the General Assembly paid a well-deservedtribute to your country  the sister Republic of Namibia which in November 1989  under the auspices of theUnited Nations Transition Assistance Group  organizedthat land's first free and fair elections  which marked thesuccessful culmination of the legitimate  heroic struggleof the Namibian people for independence  under theleadership of the South-West Africa People's Organization6(SWAPO) and its President  His Excellency Mr. SamNujoma. Now  following this happy sequence of events  weare now pleased to see Namibia at the helm of this historicsession of the General Assembly  represented by youyourself. On behalf of the delegation of Senegal  Sir  Iconvey to you our warmest  fraternal congratulations; wewish you every success in your high post.I wish also to convey my sincere and warmcongratulations to your predecessor  Minister Didier Opertti on the competent  committed and authoritative way inwhich he guided the work of the fifty-third session of theGeneral Assembly.Finally  I wish once again to offer Secretary-GeneralKofi Annan my encouragement as he continues  withenergy  intelligence and vision  to carry out his delicatetasks authoritatively and successfully in a particularlydifficult global context. I feel bound to say that his electionto head the Secretariat of the United Nations was a sourceof pride for Africa and a source of satisfaction for allpeace- and justice-loving countries. During the Secretary-General's visit to Senegal  Mr. Abdou Diouf  President ofthe Republic of Senegal  made it clear that the SenegaleseGovernment was committed to and actively supported theSecretary-General.I take genuine pleasure and great joy in welcomingamong us the delegations representing the Republic ofKiribati  the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga which have just been admitted as full-fledged Members ofthe great United Nations family. These admissions attest toand bolster the universal character of our Organization  thushelping strengthen its aims and principles.Allow me to use the idea of universality to explainand justify  if that is necessary  my country's unreservedsupport for the admission of the Republic of China  with its22 million inhabitants  as a full Member of the UnitedNations and its specialized agencies. The Republic ofChina — a democratic country concerned with safeguardingand promoting human rights  a world economic Powerrecognized by nations  and  last but not least  a nation thatmaintains trade relations through commercial delegations —shares with deep conviction our common faith in the nobleideals of peace  solidarity and cooperation enshrined in theCharter. That country  for the sake of the principle of theuniversality of our Organization  should take its place oncemore. Simple justice requires this  and the ideals embodiedin our Charter dictate it  because it is in the name of theseprinciples that other States are admitted as Members of thisOrganization  which I welcome.Our fifty-fourth regular session  we must all agree is an event of great historical and political significance.Historical  because it is the penultimate session — or thelast  depending on how you look at it — of the twentiethcentury  the century in which it was born  after two worldwars and other great calamities for humankind  theconsequences of which are still being felt.This century has also been one of light  withtremendous advances achieved by the human race invarious fields  particularly in science and technology. Thissession takes on special political importance because it isan irreplaceable tool in the service of peace  internationalsecurity  cooperation and the promotion of human rightsand is a timely opportunity for dialogue  reflection andpreparation for the great encounters of the comingmillennium.At the threshold of the third millennium  we shouldwonder and think together  in the framework of thisOrganization  about what kind of peace  development andsolidarity we should build in the coming century. It is arecognized fact that current changes  the range of whoseeffects in the political  economic and social spherescannot be foreseen  call inevitably for a deep-goingreform of the United Nations and impose a need to adaptthe Organization to the demands of the times. Thus  weneed to be clear-sighted  creative and realistic and makeinnovative  broad-ranging and constructive proposals thatcan be translated into concrete actions taken solely in theinterests of all our peoples and all our nations  whichmake up the family that we call humankind.In this respect  reform of the Security Council is amajor test of our resolve to modernize this importantbody  which we need to endow with greater transparency greater democracy  greater authority and greaterlegitimacy — in short  greater credibility.Many proposals have already been made  but inrestructuring this key organ of the system  we need to gobeyond them  demonstrating creativity and a willingnessto compromise  considering only the interests of thisOrganization at the service of humanity. From thisstandpoint  in the Algiers Declaration  the States of Africaunanimously recalled the legitimate demands embodied inthe Harare Declaration adopted by the Conference ofHeads of State and Government of the Organization ofAfrican Unity (OAU).The pressing need to adapt the United Nationssystem to the realities of the coming century should 7nonetheless  not obscure current acute needs associated withthe maintenance and promotion of peace in the world. Inthis spirit  as the international community celebrates the100th anniversary of the Hague Peace Conference  I wishto say how much we welcome certain significant advancestowards peace in Africa.We commend the Peace Agreement signed in Loméon 7 July 1999  thanks to the tireless efforts of theEconomic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)and President Eyadema  in the context of the Sierra Leoneconflict. We also commend the Abuja Peace Agreement andthe additional protocols in the context of the Guinea-Bissauconflict  thanks to the mediation of ECOWAS  under thechairmanship of Nigeria and Togo. Senegal stronglysupports the Governments of Sierra Leone andGuinea-Bissau in their efforts to build peace  to moveresolutely towards national reconciliation and to implementa policy of economic and social recovery in their countries.In the same spirit  the signing last 10 July  in Lusaka  ofthe Ceasefire Agreement among the principal parties to theconflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is anothercause for satisfaction and hope.I would also like to touch on the Lockerbie affair inthe hopes that the attitudes of the countries offer thepossibility of a successful outcome.Last  but not least  my country expresses the warmesthope that the referendum process under way in WesternSahara will be completed as early as possible in accordancewith the letter and spirit of the United Nations settlementplan adopted in 1991  as well as that of the Houstonagreements  with full respect for the inalienable rights of allinhabitants of Western Sahara to participate in thereferendum. Allow me — and I think this is the right placeto do so — to pay humble tribute to the memory ofKing Hassan II.Finally  we hope that with the assistance of the greatPowers and the cooperation of Indonesia  the situation inEast Timor will be brought under control by the UnitedNations in order to ensure that the legitimate rights of theTimorese people prevail.These significant breakthroughs should not make usoverlook the situations in Angola and Somalia  or theconflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea  where  in spite of thepraiseworthy efforts of the OAU  there has been no serioussign of a final settlement. We must therefore continue ourefforts because our only salvation lies in peace and inreconciliation.In this sense  the evolution we have witnessed in theMiddle East gives us grounds for hope  the hope offinally seeing a climate of complete trust and confidenceand a sincere resumption of negotiations between Israelisand Palestinians and between Israel and the Arabcountries  with the rights of the peoples of the regionrespected. My country  having presided over theCommittee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights ofthe Palestinian People ever since its creation  reaffirms itssupport for and solidarity with the fraternal people ofPalestine  the Palestinian Authority and its head  PresidentYasser Arafat  which have been struggling now for morethan half a century for the creation of an independent andsovereign Palestinian State.We solemnly reaffirm our support for the Bethlehem2000 project which has the objective of celebrating inBethlehem  on Palestinian soil  the second millenniumsince the birth of Christ.Furthermore  the Israeli Government seems now towant to work resolutely for peace. We urge it to continueon this path. It is the only approach that responds to thesituation of the peoples of the subregion and to thehardships connected to the constraints imposed byglobalization.Before concluding the subject of peace and security I would like to state that my country supports any moveto protect  safeguard and promote the rights of womenand children. Its legal code has been modified to translatethat choice and those convictions into its own domesticlaw.I should like now to deal with the other dimensionof peace: development cooperation. The United Nations responding once again to its mission to serve the peoplesof the world  has  during the major conferences of thedecade  provided a framework for the definition of acoherent set of programmes based on consensus. Theseprogrammes continue to inspire our common effortstowards sustainable development.But a careful review of the realities of this centurynow coming to a close lead us to note that ourachievements have been seriously undermined by thecontradictory tendencies that are a hallmark of humanityas it enters the third millennium. The lack of sufficientsustained growth in the world as a whole means that theglobal economy is facing great risks in the years to come.Indeed  because of a lack of sufficient growth  tradetensions are threatening to increase between8underdeveloped countries and around them  and thus the lagin development can only increase  increasing the mob ofuncontrolled emigration.In addition  the gap that has been emerging over manyyears is becoming increasingly clear. On the one hand wesee a small number of regions enjoying a high standard ofliving or rapid development. In these countries the volumeof trade  of interdependence and competition is increasing.On the other hand  there is a group of countries — morenumerous and more populous — in which the standards ofliving are poor and stagnating. They are for the most partnot involved in this ever-tighter network of commercial financial and industrial exchanges. It is difficult for them tofind markets for their products  they suffer from capitalflight  and businesses avoid setting up in these countries.However  over the last four years  the gross nationalproduct of Africa has grown at an annual average rate of4.5 per cent  resulting in a year-on-year increase in percapita incomes. This is particularly remarkable because theprogress is attributable  above all  to internal adjustmentefforts rather than to external phenomena. Nevertheless despite this macroeconomic performance  most Africancountries do not possess the basic means for ensuringsustainable growth in a future of a kind that would enablethem to achieve their poverty-reduction objectives inkeeping with the medium-term goals set at the WorldSummit on Social Development in Copenhagen  because therequired rate of growth is in the order of 8 per cent peryear.While it is true that the slow pace of integration ofAfrican economies into the global economy has protectedmost of these economies from the most violent shocks ofrecent financial crises  the other side of the coin is thatAfrica is not in a position to take full advantage ofglobalization  which could increase the resources availablefor productive investment. However  the developingcountries will not and cannot escape the effects ofglobalization. We would therefore like to stress here — inparticular to our African partners in various initiatives suchas the second Tokyo International Conference on AfricanDevelopment (TICAD II)  the United States/Africa forumand the negotiations between the European Union andAfrica  the Caribbean and the Pacific — the need toencourage the efforts that have been undertaken particularly in the elimination of the rigidities andimbalances that persist in the global economy.In this regard  it might be worthwhile to reaffirm thecommitment that joins the developing and the developedcountries within the World Trade Organization andinvolves recognition of the need to make significantefforts so that the developing countries — the least-developed in particular — are assured of a share in thegrowth in world trade in keeping with their developmentneeds.But also  an examination of the way the principlesof the multilateral trade system created at the UruguayRound have been implemented reveals that commitmentshave not been honoured: many obstacles impede accessby products from the South in general  and from Africancountries in particular  to Northern markets. Tariffbarriers  sliding-scale increases in duty rates  anti-dumping measures and animal and plant hygienemeasures all represent acts and attitudes that impede tradeand that affect our exports — and  thus  our tradesurpluses. That is why we venture to hope that the SeattleRound in November this year will take into greateraccount not only the concerns of the developing countriespositions by removing obstacles to their completeparticipation in world trade on the basis of the principlesof justice and equity — particularly by working to reduceand eliminate the restrictive and distorting effects that theaforementioned barriers  laws and measures have ontrade — but will also take into consideration social rightsand sustainable development as inalienable elements in allworld trade.Given the significant efforts by the African countriesto achieve their recent economic performance levels  itwill be a Herculean task in terms of resources for them toachieve and maintain 8 per cent annual growth in theirgross domestic product  in order to reduce poverty. Weshould like to take this opportunity to welcome the newinternational climate for finding a solution to the Africandebt crisis  particularly given that the total of this debt —estimated at $350 billion in 1998 — represents 300 percent of Africa's export earnings.To this end  the proposals by a some G-8 countries the United Nations Conference on Trade andDevelopment and other organs of the United Nations  aswell as the recent studies by the Bretton Woodsinstitutions  are signs of a new realism  i.e.  that most ofthe debt cannot be repaid  that the debt is a majorobstacle to balanced growth in African countries  and thatthe current machinery for debt settlement  in particular theHeavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt (HIPC) Initiative is too slow  too selective and imposes too manyconditions. The principal members of the World Bank andthe International Monetary Fund (IMF) must accept the9idea  among others  of increasing the resources for theHIPC significantly by selling gold reserves.Furthermore  despite the pressures within the donorcommunity to reduce aid volumes  the economicperformance of Africa and the continent's commitment tostructural reform can be maintained only on the basis ofexpansion  not contraction: increased developmentassistance is essential if we are to achieve the fundamentalobjectives of development.Finally  despite the praiseworthy efforts of our variouscountries to implement economic and financial reforms inflows of direct foreign investment remain marginal.In highlighting these major factors in the currentglobal economic situation  I am far from wishing to shirkan enduring truth: sustainable development is the individualresponsibility of each State. The need for the internationalcommunity to find a more global and more judicioussolution to the debt problem in no way detracts from theneed for African countries to manage their economiesbetter.This attitude towards debt will be put into practice bythe definition and implementation of a high-qualitymacroeconomic framework; by a significant intensificationof efforts towards national thrift to accompany internationalfinancing; and by respect for the state of law  transparency control and responsibility in the management of publicaffairs. Thanks to the guidance and choices of Mr. AbdouDiouf  President of the Republic  my country subscribes tothese fundamental principles  on which the policy of theGovernment of Senegal is based.I have particularly stressed questions of peace anddevelopment because we live on a continent where peace isthreatened every day by underdevelopment and wheredevelopment efforts are made precarious by the absence ofpeace. It is therefore important that efforts to consolidatepeace in Africa be accompanied by extraordinary efforts toincrease the quality and quantity of development assistancein order significantly to reduce our debt and increase theflow of productive investment to our continent and toestablish  if not a Marshall Plan for Africa  at least a planfor financing its development.My delegation fervently hopes that  at the dawn of thetwenty-first century  the opportunity will be found to reviveinternational cooperation for development in order to builda more humane world. I am convinced that we have themeans and the intelligence; we must also summon thepolitical determination to do so. Thus  in order to improveinteraction  Africa for its part has agreed to promoteeconomic integration and to go one step further bycreating a union of African States. This was the sense ofthe Syrte Declaration adopted on 9 September 1999 at theFourth Extraordinary Summit of heads of State of theOrganization of African Unity  convened on the happyinitiative of Mr. Al-Qadhafi.I am convinced that the wealthy nations are clearlyaware of their various and diverse responsibilities and thatthey will not shirk their obligations. Indeed  should theydo so  God forbid  the eternal night of hideous povertywill blanket almost the entire world. I express the genuinehope  willingly undertaken and profoundly shared by allnations  that we cannot remain indifferent to anything thatis human. I am therefore convinced that  together  we cansave humanity."
"148",6184,"SGP",54,1999,"First let convey mywarmest congratulations to you  Mr. President  on yourelection. As we enter the new millennium  the UnitedNations is crossing a significant threshold  and we needa seasoned hand to lead us. Your long experience with the23United Nations  first as a freedom fighter  now as ForeignMinister of Namibia  will stand us in good stead.Let me also thank your distinguished predecessor Mr. Didier Opertti of Uruguay  for the good work he didlast year.As a fellow small State  Singapore would also like towarmly welcome the three new Members to the UnitedNations: Kiribati  Nauru and Tonga. We hope that they willalso join the forum of small States.I wish to pose this question: Will the United Nationssurvive in the twenty-first century? I have framed thisquestion provocatively because I believe that the UnitedNations has not yet adequately come to grips with thecentral challenges of its next phase of development. Unlessit does so  my question may not be just rhetorical.To be sure  the United Nations has been seized ofefforts at reform for several years. But what is requiredmust go beyond the modification of existing institutions ororganizational structures. The issue is not just how to makethe General Assembly  the Security Council  the Secretariator other organs work more effectively  although that isimportant. But we cannot succeed if we neglect the broadercontext of such endeavours. The key question is whetherthe current United Nations is conceptually andconstitutionally sound.The simple but hard-won lesson of this century'sexperiments with international organizations  from theLeague to the United Nations  is that the United Nationsmust work within the framework of the state system. If theUnited Nations has worked better or has lasted longer thanthe League  it is because the United Nations hasaccommodated the state system rather than posed a directthreat to it. Its Member States see the United Nations as anadditional protective umbrella  not as a body thatdiminishes them.The League's Covenant was based on differentpremises. It emphasized disarmament. It promotedcollective security. It required States to submit disputes toarbitration and judicial settlement. By doing so  the Leagueposed an explicit challenge to the rights of States. On theother hand  the United Nations can do nothing that itsMembers do not expressly allow it to do. Our Charter isclear and explicit that the United Nations is based on theprinciple of the sovereign equality of its Members. It alsostresses the concomitant principle of non-interference ininternal affairs.But these premises are now under pressure. As thetwentieth century draws to a close  the state system is onthe verge of major transformation. This will profoundlyaffect all Members and the United Nations itself.I do not predict the end of the nation State. Theconcept of sovereignty is undergoing profoundmodification  but it does not seem likely that the nationState will simply disappear. No viable alternative toorganizing international political life has yet emerged  nomatter how inadequate or ineffective the current formmay have become. Radical proposals for restructuring theframework of the state system will inevitably invitedisappointment. The United Nations must therefore workwithin the existing framework  even as that framework isbeing transformed. Herein lie the subtlety and thedifficulty of the new challenge.Two forces are impelling change: the pressures of atruly integrated world economy and the end of the coldwar. Neither is adequately understood; even lessunderstood is their interplay. This dialectic simultaneouslyimpels an unprecedented degree of internationalcooperation and makes international cooperation moredifficult to achieve.There have always been issues which required Statesto work together. Interdependence is not new. In a sense it is as old as the state system. To be sure  the numberand scope of transnational issues that require internationalcooperative action have now expanded  but this is achange of degree  not of kind. Globalization is not justmore interdependence.While globalization's effects are most evident infinance and economics  there are far-reaching implicationsacross a range of issues. It affects the very notion ofstatehood and government as they have hitherto beenunderstood.The essential function of any Government is togovern — to provide public goods and services to itscitizens within its borders. But in a globalized economy national borders no longer include sufficient territory tofunction as self-contained economic units. Financialgeography and economic geography no longer coincidewith political geography. This mismatch means thatGovernments no longer have a monopoly of legitimate24power within their own state boundaries. This does notchallenge the de jure sovereignty of States  but profoundlyalters every Government's de facto capacity to govern.The challenge is not  as it was throughout history merely of one State circumscribing the sovereignty ofanother — of the powerful forcing their will on the weak.The real challenge is now within each State  no matter howpowerful.Dealing with this phenomenon poses a different kindof challenge than just insisting on the legal concept ofsovereignty or persuading Governments to work together onspecific issues. It forces a reconceptualization of the veryidea of government and statehood. It requires a completechange of mindset by the powerful as well as by the weak.This will be difficult and painful to achieve.What is required is an unprecedented and qualitativelynew kind of international cooperation  not just cooperationbased on the alignment of national interests  as has occurredthroughout history. It requires the redefinition of whatconstitutes both “nation” and “interests”. States can nolonger just collide or cooperate at the boundaries of theirsovereignties. It demands nothing less than sharedresponsibility for governance and a pooling ofsovereignties.For this new kind of international cooperation to beconstructed and take root  the imperative of cooperationmust be supported by practical experience that demonstratesthat it is superior to any other political alternative. It is herethat the intersection and interplay of globalization and thepost-cold-war international order complicate matters.The end of the cold war at first seemed to promise anew dawn for the United Nations  opening up vastpotentialities for international cooperation unfettered byideological conflict. But these hopes have now been dashed.In reality  the end of the cold war may have madeinternational cooperation less likely.Paradoxically  the ever-greater integration of the worldeconomy has been accompanied by increasing politicalfragmentation. The cold war was not just an ideologicalgeopolitical struggle; the cold war imposed identities thattranscended nationalism. Even those who sought to escapethe cold war in fact defined themselves in relation to it.Irrespective of which side we stood for  the cold war wasthe organizing principle for international action and theconcept by which we understood global events.To those disoriented by the pressures ofglobalization  the end of the cold war provided anopportunity to seek reassurance and a new identity in realor imagined ethnic nationalisms. The resultingproliferation of States and the lack of a clear organizingprinciple for international action have made cooperationproblematic.The end of ideological conflict and the increasinginfluence of market principles in all areas of life aremaking economic efficiency an essential condition forevaluating political actions. But globalization hassimultaneously eroded the ability of States to muster thepolitical consensus of their own citizens for such action.It is therefore not very surprising that the right kind ofnew response has not yet been forthcoming.Of course  lip service is being paid to the need fornew international institutions to deal with newtransnational problems or to the reform of existinginternational institutions  the United Nations among them.But the more usual reaction to the mismatch betweeneconomic geography and the political geography of stateboundaries has been defensive or a sterile triumphalism:a new protectionism  xenophobic or nostalgic nationalismsor  where a country feels strong and confident enough  anew kind of extraterritoriality  reminiscent of thenineteenth century. Strong States try to project theirnational laws beyond their boundaries or insist on theirstandards as conditionalities for trade and other kinds ofcooperative interactions.The recognition that problems are global  and thealmost universal acceptance of the market  commands atbest only superficial international consensus. The realresponses  the most concrete and practical responses  havebeen regional rather than universal.This process is most advanced in Europe and NorthAmerica  through the European Union and the NorthAmerican Free Trade Agreement  and less so in LatinAmerica and Asia  through the Southern Cone CommonMarket  the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Counciland the Association of South-East Asian Nations FreeTrade Area. Tentative linkages are being exploredbetween regions. Africa has been only peripherallyengaged. But relying on regionalism as more than astopgap in a globalized world creates a latent instability.If projected unchecked into the twenty-first century  thismust ultimately affect basic issues of war and peace. It isobviously unacceptable for an entire continent to bemarginalized.25So a truly universal approach to shared responsibilityfor global governance and pooling of sovereignties to dealwith global problems requires an international consensus onwhat is legitimately in the general interest of still sovereignStates. No matter how compelling the issue or problem  thisis not self-evident.The definition of what is in the legitimate publicinterest within a specific State or nation is the product of along historical process  cultural attributes and a level ofeconomic development. It is the basic stuff of most politicalcontests in most States. Consensus is not easy to reachdomestically. It certainly will be even more difficult in aninternational system that is concurrently united and dividedby globalization and the end of the cold war.The international problem is compounded because theexpectation that the post-cold-war international systemwould be multipolar has proved premature. A multipolarworld is still more a matter of potential rather than acurrent reality. This has engendered discomfort.The war in Kosovo focused such feelings. It threwinto brutal relief a trend that has been under way for sometime: that the absolute sovereignty of States has to bequalified to require compliance with generally acceptedstandards of conduct and respect for human rights.This is not all that novel a notion. The traditionalapproach of non-interference in domestic affairs was neveras absolute in practice as in theory. The doctrine ofhumanitarian intervention dates from the nineteenth century when the powerful claimed the right to intervene in theaffairs of the weak. The war in Kosovo resonated with suchhistorical memories  thus adding to the discomfort.It is a fact that sovereignty now coexists uneasily witha different current of international law concerned with therights of individuals. These trends have not yet beenreconciled. But both trends are facts that cannot be wishedaway. In any case  their logical compatibility is not the realissue.Notwithstanding Kosovo  it does not appear that themajority of States have much to fear if they treat theircitizens well. There are many countries that treat theircitizens badly without any suggestion of any sanctionharsher than moral disapproval. Concern for human rightshas always been selective.The more critical issue is related but different. Theloss of territorial reference points engendered byglobalization's mismatch between economic and politicalgeographies and the loss of strategic meaning after theend of the cold war have made most internationalreactions ad hoc.We lurch from crisis to crisis  with no clear sense ofdirection or consistency. Why Kosovo or East Timor andnot Africa? Are the rights of humans everywhere notuniversal? How to choose when to intervene among theall-too-many conflicts? In his statement to the GeneralAssembly this year  the Secretary-General has posedseveral thoughtful challenges for us: “Nothing in theCharter precludes a recognition that there are rightsbeyond borders.” What the Charter does say is that armedforce shall not be used  save in the common interest. TheSecretary-General then asked  what is the commoninterest? Who shall define it? Who will defend it? Underwhose authority? With what means of intervention?I agree with the Secretary-General that thesequestions will need to be answered and criteriaestablished. Rules and objective criteria for suchinterventions are urgently needed. Failure to do so willbreed uncertainty and instability. If a new balance has tobe struck between sovereignty and other values  it shouldbe struck knowingly and with our eyes open. Thealternative is to be led  one step at a time  with the bestof intentions  by ad hoc solutions.This will be a major challenge for the internationalcommunity if the United Nations is to remain relevant inthe coming century. This is because we can expect to facemany more situations which will pose the dilemma ofreconciling State sovereignty with internationalintervention to redress violations of human rights.We are all familiar with the pressures of theinternational media and non-governmental actors. Theseare realities but provide no satisfactory answers. It is notpolitically acceptable that questions of international peaceand stability should be decided on an ad hoc basis. It iseven less acceptable that consensus on the need for morepeaceful modes of international cooperation should reflectthe preoccupations of a few.What we need is to replicate on a global scale thoseconditions that have made the pluralistic societies inadvanced economies still capable of collective action. NoGovernment anywhere can rule by coercion alone or leadlegitimately merely because it wields supreme power.Resort to coercion or naked power is more often than nottaken to be a symptom of failure of government and notits defining feature.26What is required  therefore  on the international stageis what has already been accepted domestically — indeed insisted upon in the name of democracy: a modestacceptance of the reality of diversity and a nuancedappreciation of the difference between friends  friendlycritics and honest disagreements. Persuading those alreadydisoriented by globalization and rapid technological changesrequires patient and skilful diplomacy in the artful balanceof competing interests.Despite the handicaps under which it laboured  and forall its imperfections  the United Nations has played acritical role in some of the great world issues of the firstfour decades of its existence. It eased the pangs ofdecolonization. It provided a cathartic theatre to vent themost dangerous passions of the cold war. It provided themeans for the super-Powers to back down from unwantedconfrontations without grievous political costs to either.From time to time  it scored notable successes inpeacekeeping operations around the world. At the sametime  the United Nations  through its specialized agencies continues to play a vital developmental role for the majorityof its Members.But the United Nations experiences of the last decadehave been less happy. The United Nations has played atbest only a very marginal role in the great developments ofthe closing years of the twentieth century that I have triedto describe. It risks becoming increasingly divorced fromthe very international realities in which it is inescapablyembedded.Like all organizations of sovereign States  the UnitedNations can only provide a mechanism for its Members touse for whatever purpose their agreements or disagreementsdictate. But the United Nations cannot be just a tool of thefew  a repository for issues that no country is willing orknows how to confront  or a convenient scapegoat. Thehard fact is that these are the roles that the United Nationshas been forced to play in recent years. It cannot continueon this path without permanent damage.In our century  the trend towards internationalorganization  towards the development of a morepredictable pattern of relationships between States andinternational regimes that transcend individual sovereigntiesis  I believe  established. There is no going back. Whetherwe like it or not  the world has become too complex to bedealt with except multilaterally.But this does not mean that any particular internationalinstitution will necessarily play an effective role in theorganization of international life in the next century. TheUnited Nations cannot assume that it will survive intact just by clinging on to structures and processes conceivedin 1945. The world has changed dramatically since then.It will continue to do so. The United Nations has nochoice but to change in tandem.This imperative is clear. What is unclear is how theUnited Nations should change. That is why I have posedmore questions than I have provided answers. The processof discussion must start now. The mechanism is at ourdisposal. The responsibility to use it is ours. Whether wewill engage ourselves in this responsibility quicklyenough to make a difference to the United Nations is forus to choose. I do not know how much time we have. Ionly know that the time left is finite."
"149",6217,"SLB",54,1999,"Let me express mysincere congratulations  Sir  on your election as President ofthe General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session. Under yourleadership  I am confident the Assembly will effectivelyaddress the issues before it.My Government salutes the Secretary-General  theSecretariat and the United Nations agencies for theirdedication and commitment to building peace andconfidence around the world. The Solomon Islands alsoapplauds the Secretary-General’s programme ofmodernization and revitalization of the Organization aimed at creating a more effective United Nations tobetter serve the development needs of its Members  thusensuring peace and security in the twenty-first century.My country will be a committed partner in achieving thisgoal in the new millennium.The Government and people of the Solomon Islandswarmly welcome the admission of our sister nations —the Republic of Nauru  the Republic of Kiribati and theKingdom of Tonga — as new Members of the UnitedNations. This makes the principle of universality  asstipulated by the United Nations Charter  a near reality. Itis also further testimony that the United Nations isindispensable. Its body of international laws is central tothe protection and security of our small island States.While there have been important successes for theinternational community  peace and development in manyparts of the world remain precarious. The past decade haswitnessed the increase in the world’s illicit drug problemand its related crimes  terrorism  large-scale movementand trade in small arms and the proliferation of nuclearweapons and weapons of mass destruction. Equallyalarming is the rise in local and regional conflicts invarious parts of the world and the threat they pose tonational and international peace  stability andadvancement. Poverty  meanwhile  remains a majorobstacle to the economic progress of many developingcountries  especially the least developed. In addition  theeconomic threats associated with globalization and tradeliberalization have increased in recent years.For small island developing States like the SolomonIslands  post-cold-war security now embraces human environmental and economic dimensions. The mostimportant asset of any country is its people. In a smallisland developing State like mine  investment in human-resource development is not only vital  but a criticalprerequisite to embracing national peace  stability andeconomic prosperity.In this connection  the Barbados Programme ofAction for the Sustainable Development of Small IslandDeveloping States  as reiterated by many representativesat the special session earlier this week  remains a validblueprint for the sustainable development of small island6developing States  including my country. The environmentaland economic vulnerabilities of small island developingStates present major difficulties to our efforts to achievesustainable development. Climate change and sea-level riseare matters of survival for the small island developingStates. Annex I parties must fulfil their commitment underthe United Nations Framework Convention on ClimateChange.The increasing incidence and magnitude of naturaldisasters are particularly alarming. On the other hand  theoverall decline in official development assistance flows  theerosion of trade preferences  falling primary commodityprices and limited market access could severely harm oursmall and fragile economies. Hence  greater internationalsupport is required for the successful implementation of theBarbados Programme of Action in the future.My Government recognizes the importance of goodgovernance to advance human development and to promotesustained economic growth. We are taking measurestowards this end. The call for good governance  however must be accompanied by the necessary resources and thecreation of an enabling regional and internationalenvironment.Allow me to outline the views and some of the stepstaken by my Government to address some of theaforementioned issues  including our efforts to create andstrengthen accountable administrative and financialinstitutions  as well as the appropriate policies andlegislation.When my Government assumed office in September1997  we were confronted with a major financial crisis inthe public sector. The domestic financial system wasoverburdened with public debt  which the Government wasunable to service. Additionally  the Asian financial crisis inlate 1997 further deepened the crisis in the domesticeconomy. The public service was unable to deliver goodsand services effectively and efficiently. The private sectorbecame stagnant. This state of affairs demanded an urgentoverhaul of the public sector and the need to create avibrant private sector. Short-term  medium-term and long-term measures had to be taken.Thus  my Government responded with a series ofpolicy statements committing itself to a broad-basedprogramme of policy and structural reforms. The overallgoals of the policy and structural-reform programme are tofoster financial and macroeconomic stability  to establish amore effective and efficient public service and to create anenvironment for the private sector that is conducive toviable growth and sustainability.It is obvious that  although we have the primaryresponsibility to implement our reform initiatives  wecannot do it alone. The experiences of small economiesthat have undertaken similar reforms indicate that suchreforms can be accelerated by access to capital — oftengrant in aid — technical assistance  technology transfers assured markets for primary commodities and links tonew market locations. Therefore  the political will that myGovernment has demonstrated has to be supplemented bysignificant international support if we are to fulfil theaspirations of our people.I am grateful to our bilateral and multilateraldevelopment partners for the positive response they haveshown so far towards our reform initiatives. Additionalassistance will be required to implement  in particular  ourmedium-term development strategy and our public sectorinvestment programme.Peace and development are mutually interdependent.In this connection  the current insurgency on the island ofGuadalcanal is a big set-back to our development efforts.It has already affected various sectors of the economy andcaused the displacement of more than 30 000 people.While the crisis may not be comparable to major conflictsin other parts of the world  its net result in human lossand suffering is relative. This crisis has to be understoodin the context of our smallness  our limited resources  ourethnic and cultural diversity and our history. The SolomonIslands  with a population of 400 000  has more than 80different languages. Thus  if the insurgency is left toescalate  it could seriously threaten national peace andsecurity.My Government is  therefore  firmly committed toan early resolution of the conflict. The engagement of theCommonwealth special envoy is a preventive measure tobring about reconciliation between the parties concerned.I wish to acknowledge the assistance of theCommonwealth Secretariat in this regard. Threeagreements to settle the crisis have been reached. We areworking very hard to ensure their implementation.I am also grateful for the prompt response of theUnited Nations Secretary-General to my request for aUnited Nations mission to assess the humanitarian aspectsof the crisis. My Government is committed to workingclosely with the appropriate United Nations agencies toimplement the recommendations of that mission. We also7appreciate the humanitarian assistance of our developmentpartners  including the Red Cross  to the displacedpopulation. My Government is fully aware of the need topursue the necessary policies and programmes for nation-building through the creation of long-term developmentstrategies that promote social cohesion and national unity.My Government attaches great importance to regionalcooperation  security and development. The political economic and environmental regional organizations in ourregion  including the South Pacific Forum  the SouthPacific Environmental Programme  the Pacific Community the South Pacific Forum Fisheries Agency and the SouthPacific Geoscience Commission  provide vital mechanismsfor policy advice and action on issues of regional concernand interest  especially in the areas of the environment population  fisheries resources management andvulnerability index. The Solomon Islands has benefitedfrom their contributions and thus will continue to supportand actively participate in their activities. The thirtiethSouth Pacific Forum meeting  to be held in Palau nextweek  provides an opportunity for us to discuss how best tostrengthen regional cooperation in order to effectively copewith the challenges of the new millennium and to harnessthe opportunities it will bring.Furthermore  my Government will continue to supportthe efforts of the Government of Papua New Guinea torebuild peace and confidence on Bougainville. We also notethe contributions of other South Pacific neighbours and ofthe United Nations in this process.The Solomon Islands further welcomes the progressmade in the last decade in the decolonization process inNew Caledonia. We reiterate our support for the aspirationsof the Kanaks of New Caledonia to attain self-governmentand political independence. The process towards self-determination for other remaining non-self-governingterritories  including Guam and French Polynesia  must alsobe facilitated. The United Nations is well placed to continueto facilitate this process.My Government is concerned about the deteriorationof law and order in East Timor following the referendumon self-determination. The parties concerned must nowhonour the outcome of the referendum. Violence must notbe used to deny the choice that was made by theoverwhelming majority: the chance to move forward. TheSolomon Islands appreciates the leading role of Australiaand New Zealand in the international peacekeeping missionin East Timor.At this juncture  let me renew the support of theSolomon Islands for the appeal of the 22 million peopleof the Republic of China on Taiwan to be represented inthe United Nations and its related organizations. Taiwanis capable of and willing to fulfil the obligationscontained in the Charter of the United Nations. Itsoutstanding economic success has enabled it to play apositive role in promoting world trade and in eradicatingpoverty. It has rendered development assistance  includingtechnical training and technology transfer  to developingcountries  including my own. It has responded to UnitedNations appeals for emergency relief and rehabilitationassistance to countries that have suffered from naturaldisasters and wars.Regarding the accomplishments of the Republic ofChina on Taiwan  are these not sufficient to meritdiplomatic recognition from the international community?Taiwan's membership in the United Nations system wouldcontribute substantially to the security and stability of theAsia-Pacific region and of the world in general. It wouldalso provide an effective basis for peaceful dialogue. Theprocess of self-realization  supported by the UnitedNations  has resulted in the membership of North andSouth Korea in the United Nations. The United Nationsought to give similar consideration to the question ofTaiwan. Ideally  the membership of the Republic of Chinaon Taiwan  together with the People's Republic of China will make a stronger United Nations. The SolomonIslands would welcome the opportunity to work throughthe United Nations system to achieve a peaceful and justresolution.My Government joins those who spoke before me insupporting the call by the Secretary-General to accordhigh priority to preventive action to address the rise inlocal  national and regional conflicts. Are the currentmechanisms available to the United Nations adequate toeffectively resolve small-scale armed conflicts? Is there arole for regional organizations to make a contribution tothis preventive approach? The reform of the SecurityCouncil should include consideration of a workable andeffective preventive strategy. In addition  areconfiguration of the United Nations regional groupingsis necessary to reflect present-day realities and toaccommodate the interests and concerns of MemberStates.Perhaps the most profound challenge for the nextcentury is how to deal with the imperatives ofglobalization  that is  capitalizing on its positives andmitigating its negatives. In other words  the challenge of8globalization in the new era is not to halt the expansion ofglobal markets  but to find the rules and institutions forstronger governance to preserve the advantages of globalmarkets and competition within a framework of cooperationto enhance human progress.Only the United Nations and other internationalinstitutions have the scope and the legitimacy to generatethe principles  norms and rules that are essential ifglobalization is to benefit everyone. Developing countries in particular the least developed  need international supportto build the capacities to enable us to become moreeffectively and beneficially integrated into the globaleconomy. Debt relief  new and additional resources fordevelopment and better diverse trade opportunities arerequired to facilitate this process.The Millennium Assembly  to be held in September2000  affords a unique opportunity for all States to discussand exchange views on how best to address the manychallenges facing us. My Government looks forward toparticipating actively in this important gathering. Equallyimportant are the special session of the General Assemblyto review the implementation of the outcome of the WorldSummit for Social Development and Further Initiatives: thereview of the Beijing Fourth World Conference on Women;and the Third United Nations Conference on the LeastDeveloped Countries  to be held in the year 2001.Finally  the United Nations needs adequate financialresources to achieve its objectives. The current financialdifficulties do not bode well for the Organization. MemberStates must honour their Charter obligations and pay theirdues in full  on time  and without conditions. Despite ourown economic and financial constraints  my Governmenthas settled most of its arrears to the United Nations including contributions to the regular budget for 1999 andpeacekeeping operations.This century has witnessed vast advances in transportand communications technology  the increase of globaltrade and wealth and improvements in the area ofinternational peace and security. New information andcommunications technologies have driven globalization.Unfortunately  these achievements  including the benefitsand opportunities of globalization  have not been widelyenjoyed and distributed.

"150",6263,"SLE",54,1999,"On behalf of PresidentAhmad Tejan Kabbah  the Government and people ofSierra Leone  and on my own personal behalf  I wouldlike to congratulate Mr. Gurirab most heartily on hiselection as President of the General Assembly at itsfifty-fourth session. This is the last session before the endof this century and today we have only 92 days until thebeginning of a new millennium.We welcome Mr. Gurirab’s unanimous election topreside over this body. With his long experience  both inthe public service of his country and in the internationalarena  I have no doubt that he will be able to steer thedeliberations of the fifty-fourth session to a successfulconclusion. I want to assure him of my delegation’s fullsupport and cooperation during his tenure of office.The affairs that confront us as a country continue tocause problems all over the globe. We are faced withsituations that we cannot completely handle. Permit me toconvey the thanks and appreciation of my Government tothe Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  and to his stafffor their dedicated service to the United Nations in thenever-ending quest to attain international peace andsecurity. Mr. Annan has spared no efforts in drawing theattention of the international community  as well as thatof the Security Council  to the tragic situation in SierraLeone  stressing the urgent need for resources to sustainthe Lomé Peace Agreement  recently signed between theGovernment of Sierra Leone and the RevolutionaryUnited Front (RUF)  and the need to send an appreciablecontingent of peacekeepers and United Nations militaryobservers to my country.The rebel war has gone on for a long time. Itsintensification culminated in the invasion of the capital Freetown  by the RUF/Armed Forces RevolutionaryCouncil junta on 6 January 1999. I have no doubt thatmany members must have watched  heard or read of theensuing mayhem  even though those ghastly events wereoverlooked because of the focus of the internationalmedia and  indeed  of the international community on37Kosovo. There was a time when we felt that theinternational community had abandoned us to our fate.Our people have gone through a very difficult anddevastating period  covering more than eight years. We arenow ready to put that nightmare behind us  to moveforward and to do so quickly. The most important elementin this is the disarmament  demobilization and reintegrationprogramme  under the supervision of United Nationspeacekeepers and observers and the Economic Communityof West African States (ECOWAS) Monitoring Group(ECOMOG).My Government therefore welcomes the eighth reportof the Secretary-General on Sierra Leone to the SecurityCouncil. Among other things  the report recommends thedeployment of sufficient numbers of peacekeepers andobservers  as well as support staff. The Secretary-Generalstresses the urgent need for the mobilization of adequateresources into a special trust fund for this purpose. Mydelegation welcomes with gratitude the contributions of theGovernments of the United Kingdom and Canada and theWorld Bank to the trust fund  and the recentrecommendation of the Secretary- General to the SecurityCouncil to deploy up to 6 000 peacekeepers and observers.The need for an early decision on this cannot beoveremphasized.A special conference is to take place shortly inWashington  D.C.  for pledges to the fund and for otherpost-conflict programmes  including humanitarianassistance  the welfare of refugees and the welfare ofchildren associated with the war. I would like to thank allour friends in the donor community who will beparticipating in that meeting and to plead with them todonate generously.Since the signing of the Lomé Agreement  the peacehas been generally holding. There have been a few severehiccups  but because of the determination of all to moveforward  we have been able to contain the situation. Thewar went on for a long time; the rebels were used toobtaining everything they needed by the use of force. Sincethe Agreement  they have simply been waiting for thedisarmament  demobilization and reintegration programmeto commence. The delay in implementing this could be afactor in the restlessness observed in some elements fromtime to time. It is a dangerous void.The programme itself is under the chairmanship of ourPresident  and because of the importance that our peopleattach to it  the civilian population has established a fundthat is receiving modest donations from an alreadytraumatized and war-weary people. Unfortunately  theanxiety and enthusiasm of our people have yet to bematched by those of the international community.The speed and the extent of interventions in Bosniaand in Kosovo  and more recently in East Timor  clearlydemonstrate the capacity of the international communityto stop human suffering when it is willing to do so. Ourpeople have been baffled at the delay in implementing theSierra Leone programme.Although the heinous atrocities committed in SierraLeone by the RUF and its collaborators barely receivedattention from the international community  varioushuman rights groups denounced the United Nations forsigning the Lomé Peace Agreement with a reservation onamnesty provision. May I at this stage appeal to theinternational community not to do anything that wouldadversely affect the implementation of the PeaceAgreement.For the average Sierra Leonean  the PeaceAgreement was a bitter pill to swallow  but an essentialpill to end the atrocities in the country. However  in orderto ensure accountability  a truth and reconciliationcommission was provided for in the agreement. It mayneed to be backed by an international inquiry body  suchas has been proposed by the United Nations HighCommissioner for Human Rights.Once again I would like to put on record mycountry’s indebtedness and gratitude to the member Statesof the Economic Community of West African States(ECOWAS)  and four countries in particular — Nigeria Guinea  Ghana and Mali — which contributed troops tothe ECOWAS Monitoring Group (ECOMOG).As a new millennium dawns  the problems facingmy country — and indeed many developing countries —are multiple; not least is the problem of finding aconsistent set of policies and institutions that will enableus to have sustainable economic growth. Coupled withthis is the fact that newly elected democraticGovernments like ours are facing the paradox of how tosustain democracy in an environment where hardeconomic decisions are needed. In an increasinglyshrinking world  the problems of developing countries including those of Sierra Leone  ought to be seen asglobal problems.38The impact of these problems is felt by all in the formof environmental devastation  global warming  economicmigrations and conflict  both local and regional. Theseproblems affect the developed world in the form ofincreased immigration  greater welfare bills  slowereconomic growth and increased defence budgets  due togreater instability in the third world and the increased needfor conflict resolution and prevention.In these circumstances  the continuing decline in thelevels of development assistance has not helped the Africansituation. Globalization cannot be effected as a “one-waystreet” where all the vehicles travel North  leaving onlyexhaust fumes in the South. A level playing field isrequired  and this cannot be achieved with Africa’s heavydebt burden. Sierra Leone welcomes the 1999 CologneDebt Initiative  which enhances the Heavily Indebted PoorCountries Debt Initiative framework for debt relief. Weagree that further efforts are needed for greater focus on thepriority objective of poverty reduction. At the same time my delegation hopes that agreement will soon be reachedto shorten the period during which countries can qualify tobe part of the HIPC Debt Initiative framework.With the cold war over  mankind had looked forwardto a period of peace and universal development. But  as theBritish Foreign Secretary Robin Cook observed at therecent Security Council meeting on trafficking in smallarms  small arms have caused more death and destructionin recent times than weapons of mass destruction. Indeed my delegation agrees with the general view that the illegalarms trade is as dangerous as drugs  both serving asinstruments of destruction of civilian lives and of socio-economic structures.The proliferation of trade in light weapons  financedby cash from the sale of precious minerals  such asdiamonds and gold  is at the core of Africa’s conflicts andtheir prolongation. My delegation therefore welcomes therecent decision of the Security Council on this nefarioustrade. We call on the international community to supportthe Security Council decision so as to effectively preventthe availability and flow of arms to conflict areas. Thedecision should not be left to the merchants of death  whoseonly interest is money  by whatever means.The United Nations  despite its occasionalimperfectability  remains an essential institution for movinginternational relations towards cooperative security. Itsoperational and procedural capabilities need to bestrengthened for the next century. My Government fullysupports the Declaration of Algiers  adopted by theAssembly of Heads of State and Government of theOrganization of African Unity  meeting in Algeria from12-14 July 1999. The Declaration called  inter alia  forthe democratization of international relations  thedemocratization of the United Nations and the SecurityCouncil and the recognition of Africa’s legitimate positionin this Organization.My Government also reinforces its belief in theHarare Declaration  calling for the unconditionalallocation of two permanent Security Council seats toAfrica."
"151",6310,"SLV",54,1999,"I shouldlike to take this opportunity to thank Mr. Didier Opertti forhis tireless work during the session just closed. I shouldalso like  on behalf of my Government and my compatriots to thank the Secretary-General for his tireless work to carryforward the principles that unite all the nations representedin this Hall.I should like to tell the Assembly about thefundamental challenges facing my country  which have todo  in those more specific circumstances  with those moreuniversal issues that are the concern of this Organization ofall nations.In only my fourth month as President of El Salvador I believe I must say that I recognize what a great honour itis for me to address the Assembly. During the months whenI was a presidential candidate  my country was full ofconfused and contradictory ideas as to its direction anddestiny. I therefore felt the need to counter the manyopposing viewpoints with the one inescapable argument —the reality of my country — in order to find what directionthat should be. That is why I dropped the political debateto delve deeply into the only matter that is of interest toany candidate in El Salvador: reading the relationshipbetween the citizens of El Salvador and their country inorder to move forward.That enabled me to identify with rural people  potters industrialists and tradespeople in their efforts to build adecent future for themselves and their families. At no timeduring the conversations that I had in various parts of mycountry was I asked for privileges or perquisites  andneither did people demand assistance programmes: they allwanted to see their own families' destinies built on afoundation of decent work and their own efforts. Thatrequirement  those aspirations addressed to myGovernment — and to which my Administration is dutybound — are what bring me to this rostrum to address theAssembly.It seems to me that in recent decades significantprogress has been made by our region and by the world asa whole in developing all the political freedoms. Mycountry in particular has moved rapidly during the pastseven years through universal suffrage to democraticinstitutions and the will of the people expressed in allorgans of the State. Just seven years ago  El Salvador wascompletely divided by a fratricidal war; today it has a fullyfledged democracy. And in this effort to move forward we have been encouraged and stimulated by many of thenations whose representatives are listening to these wordshere today.However  I must say that the commitment of nationsto political freedom finds no corresponding stimulus to ordevelopment of economic freedoms: developed countriesrespond to our efforts to bring our products to the worldmarket with protectionism  trade barriers and quotas. Bycontrast  our nations are completely open; we havecomplete economic freedom; we welcome free trade withall nations.What is the cause of this discontinuity betweenpolitical freedoms and economic freedoms? How can wepromote political freedom and democracy when the worldis being closed to economic freedom? Neither I nor mycompatriots are asking the world for assistance because ofpoverty: we are trying to build honourable nations forgedby our own work. That is the aspiration of mycompatriots  of El Salvador  and of all nations that canhold up their heads in dignity. It is absurd for us to becalled upon to demonstrate openness when the developedcountries respond with protectionism.That is why it is important that I highlight theseessential challenges. We must choose the path of freedom but not freedom limited to certain areas. It must befreedom in all its fullness. If political freedom is notmatched by economic freedom  how can we justify theefforts of those of us who are trying to change ourcountries institutionally in order to make them freer?Some in our region are waxing nostalgic about Stateinterventionism and other forms of authoritarianism  as away of solving our problems.Future generations will not judge us only by ourdeeds; they will judge us too by what we fail to do. If welack the courage to speak or to act  they will demand toknow why  on the threshold of the new millennium  wedid not want genuinely to open the world to freedom.Let me acknowledge United Nations assistance andintervention in my country. The efforts of Salvadorans tomeet our aspirations to lasting peace would not have metwith success without the proper forum through which tobring conciliation among Salvadorans: the United Nations.We must therefore express our gratitude to theOrganization  a house of concord among nations  and toits Member States  for their involvement in theachievement of our Peace Agreement. El Salvador has4only one way of expressing that gratitude: whileunderstanding that historical experiences vary  we offer theworld our humble experience so that it may be studied byany country that chooses to resolve its conflicts by takingthe path of concord.Following the armed conflict  hundreds of thousandsof Salvadorans were forced to leave their homes andcommunities in order to feed their families. Many of mycompatriots have been received in nations represented inthis Hall. Let me address the nations in which Salvadoransare living  sometimes in difficult circumstances: I ask forunderstanding for my compatriots; they are in yourcountries solely because they have to earn a living for theirfamilies. They must not be blamed for social tensions thatpredate their arrival. I call for respect for thoseSalvadorans. Citizens of the world do not lose their dignityor their rights when they become emigrants. And I wish tosend this message to my compatriots scattered across theglobe because of the armed struggle: in El Salvador therewill always be room for them to thrive. Our commondestiny is linked to our hopes and to a hopeful future: thatwe should be together. I am here not only to represent youbut to defend your rights.In the name of the freedom I have so often evoked  letme speak of a matter that has been a concern of theGeneral Assembly: that of the Republic of China onTaiwan. We believe that when a people  expressing itssovereign will through democratic elections  elects officials chooses a common destiny and builds a vision of itsrelations with the rest of the world  it is has the absoluteright to participate on an equal footing with the rest of usin this forum. For nearly 50 years  we Salvadorans havemaintained relations of all kinds with the Republic of Chinaon Taiwan. It is our firm hope that that friendly people willbe able to have a voice in this forum.We also express our concern that so many years havegone by  and that the matter of setting up operationalmachinery to promote peace among nations has so oftencome before the Security Council without any resolution. Itis a paradox that  as we speak of concord for the nextmillennium  we have been unable to reach agreement onthis matter. This weakens all; it weakens the UnitedNations. It is a betrayal of the beliefs of all the nations thatwant the Organization to participate actively in promotingpeace.I stand in solidarity with nations that have been thevictims of natural disasters. We in Central America owe adebt of gratitude to all who helped us when the recenthurricane devastated our Republics — non-governmentalorganizations  Governments  the United Nations andfriendly nations. That debt of gratitude can be convertedto solidarity only if we say that we in turn want to do ourutmost to help other nations that have been the victims ofnatural disasters  such as Turkey and the Republic ofChina on Taiwan  not to mention other  no less painfuldifficulties such as the conflict that is of such graveconcern to our Colombian brethren.In solidarity between the peoples of Latin Americaand in solidarity between our two countries — for we toohave experienced such a conflict — we offer our brothersin Colombia any kind of assistance or experience they askfor to deal successfully with this problem so like the onethat tore apart the lives of the people of El Salvador.In this Hall that is the forum for the comity ofnations  it is incumbent upon us to give substance to therhetoric of our words. For this reason  since you havedone me the honour of patiently listening to me  I wouldlike to say to you that we  just as you  in our efforts forour common future  foresee that the entire world will livein peace  justice and liberty in the years to come."
"152",6335,"SMR",54,1999,"Mr. President  on behalfof the Government of the Republic of San Marino  I wishto congratulate you on your election to the presidency of21the fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly. Yourepresent a geographical region  the African continent which can significantly contribute to identifying the majorcauses of world problems and help to evaluate their effects.You can lead this Organization towards desirable andconcrete results.A particular acknowledgment goes to President DidierOpertti. San Marino had the opportunity and privilege towork in close cooperation with him and to ascertain hisundeniable and extraordinary skills and the remarkableaccomplishments reached during his mandate.Finally  I would like to congratulate the three newStates which have recently joined the big family of theUnited Nations. I am deeply convinced that countries neverinvolved in wars possess an inestimable richness and cantransmit to the whole world their history of peace andtolerance  helping us reach the goals set forth in thepreambular paragraphs of the Charter.The Republic of San Marino believes that the UnitedNations is  and must remain  the forum for internationalnegotiations best suited to the nations’ expectations. Wereiterate its central role in the prevention and managementof international crises  particularly in the field of peace andsecurity  through the necessary updating process of its mainoperative organs  and primarily the Security Council  whichshould never be delegitimized.The Council’s reform  in the context of a larger reformof the United Nations system  is a fundamental step in theconstruction of the new international structure. The reformoriginated from the need to update the composition and themodus operandi of the most important United Nationsorgan to operate in a deeply changed internationalenvironment.We are particularly thankful to the Secretary-Generalfor courageously proposing  and partly alreadyaccomplishing  a complete  wide-ranging programme ofreforms to strengthen the United Nations. This programmewill progress because only an Organization in constantevolution will be able to prevent  in some cases  and totackle  in others  the challenges of the next millennium.San Marino feels internationally responsible and itfeels the need to mobilize all its strength to find solutionsof solidarity to the serious problem of the external debt ofdeveloping countries.Faced with 3 billion people who still live with lessthan $2 a day  faced with 130 million children withoutaccess to education and 1.5 billion people withoutdrinking water  we must support action aimed at creatingsustainable development and healthy economic policies.The imbalance between rich and poor countries must notbecome irreversible  with tragic consequences for allhumankind.San Marino shares and supports the series ofprogrammes and plans announced and applied by creditorcountries and by the major world financial institutions totackle this serious emergency. Programmes and planshave so far shown themselves to be insufficient to tacklethe problem of debt in a decisive way.We hope that the United Nations will intensify thedebate aimed at an equitable and durable solution to theproblem. In particular  we hope that the GeneralAssembly and the Economic and Social Council willrepresent the best laboratory of ideas for its definition.San Marino shares the ethical approach to the situationthrough solidarity and development. We believe this willgive more hope to the people affected by this heavyburden.In the past year the Republic of San Marino was oneof the first countries to ratify the Statute of theInternational Criminal Court  convinced that such aninstitution is indispensable for the future world order. Ininternational society  it represents not only a politicaladvance  but moral progress  too.The Republic of San Marino has recently establisheda permanent court of arbitration  trusting it will becomea trustworthy and impartial international instrument forthe resolution of national and international disputes. Weare convinced that such an instrument will be dulyevaluated by all Member States of the United Nations andthat they will shortly be able to subscribe to a properconvention. We further believe that this initiative couldrepresent a significant contribution by our country to theinternational community.At the outset of the third millennium  we still finddisconcerting the coexistence of a large  consolidatedcorpus of humanitarian laws and human rights and thespread of atrocities beyond all limits  affecting almostexclusively civil populations  mainly women and children.The international community can rightly state that ithas reached goals in the field of humanitarian law and22human rights that were unimaginable 50 years ago.However  these considerable goals have been reached onlywith the simultaneous application of established rules. Inthis regard  we appreciate the tireless work of the SpecialRepresentative of the Secretary-General for Children andArmed Conflict  aimed at filling the deep gap betweenlegality and accepted practice  and at underlining theabsolute need in the community of States for the fullapplication of and respect for  international law. SanMarino has great expectations of the future World Summitfor Children.In every country and in every culture there aremessages of peace which are often forgotten  neglected orignored. It is the responsibility of the United Nations  itsspecialized agencies  and all of us to rehabilitate thosemessages through the awakening of our conscience and theapplication of a universal culture of peace. This will happenif we are able to courageously identify and defeat the seedsof violence.Therefore  we have to decide now what culture wewant to defend: a culture where violence is considered aninevitable evil from which we can only protect ourselves or a culture where violence can and must be eradicated.The preamble to the Constitution of the UnitedNations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization(UNESCO)  which includes the words “since wars begin in the minds of men  it is inthe minds of men that the defences of peacemust be constructed” remains today  in our opinion  the right perspective  becausepeace-building through dialogue  education and acceptanceof differences is the best guarantee for the survival ofhumanity.We all know that there are 45 armed conflicts goingon at this very moment all over the world. Sadly  thespilling of stains of hate and violence constantly destroysthe hope that humanity will soon prepare to use the so-called “peace dividend”  resulting from the end of thebalance of terror between the super-Powers  for positivegoals.The Republic of San Marino deeply appreciates therecent Security Council resolution expeditiouslyestablishing a multinational peace force to change thesituation in the East Timor crisis. What the UnitedNations is starting is a risky mission  but it will contributeto increasing the role and dignity of the United Nations underlining its force as an impartial and neutral institutiondeploying itself as a bulwark against prevarication todefend the life and the dignity of humankind.It is with great satisfaction that the Government ofSan Marino acknowledges the renewed impetus andmomentum of the Arab-Israeli peace process negotiations.San Marino regards with equal satisfaction the presentsearch for political solutions at the end of the Balkansconflict  activating a channel of concrete solidarity for thepopulation of Kosovo.The people of San Marino sadly regret to see thatthe important and topical question of the death penaltyhas not been included in the General Assembly’s agenda.San Marino intends to continue to voice its protest againstcapital punishment  firmly convinced that the abhorrentinstrument of death consciously and legally inflicted byone human being on another can be considered neither avalid and effective answer to defend society nor adeterrent against the spreading of criminality.On behalf of the Government of San Marino  I wishto acknowledge once more the focal role of the UnitedNations with respect to the major challenges at the end ofthis millennium and the momentum that the greatestinternational Organization can provide for a new century in which the supremacy of a culture of peace over aculture of war  of a culture of life over a culture of death of the full realization of human dignity over its systematicviolation  will prevail.It is in this spirit that I wish good work to you  Sir and to all the members of the Assembly."
"153",6451,"SUR",54,1999,"First of all  I would like toextend to you  Sir  my warm congratulations on yourelection to the helm of our General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session. We are confident that  in view of yourlong experience in the affairs of our Organization  wemay look forward to a fruitful and constructive year forthe work of the General Assembly and its MainCommittees.Allow me also to thank Mr. Didier Opertti  who ledthe General Assembly at its fifty-third session withremarkable distinction and efficiency.To the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  we wishto express our sincere gratitude for his dynamic leadershipand his continued efforts to promote durable peace andsecurity.Furthermore  I would like to join previous speakers inwelcoming the Republic of Kiribati  the Republic of Nauruand the Kingdom of Tonga as new Members of the UnitedNations family.The ongoing globalization process has increased theinfluence of markets  benefiting a small group of countries their corporations and people. At the same time  it hasmarginalized the majority of developing nations  inparticular the small and vulnerable ones  underminingdecades-long efforts by these countries to create economicwell-being  social justice and sustainable humandevelopment.It has  furthermore  eroded trade preferences andchallenged and undermined the basic principles ofinternational cooperation. It has also eroded internationalcommitments to financing for development through the non-fulfilment of agreed targets of official developmentassistance and through the reduction in contributions to thecore resources of the different programmes and funds of theUnited Nations system.The drop in prices of primary commodities to theirlowest level in a century and a half and the reduction ofofficial development assistance have brought manyGovernments in developing countries face to face with thedangers of not being in a position to address in asatisfactory manner the just socio-economic demands oftheir respective peoples. In many cases  this has triggeredsocial unrest and political instability and hampered effortsto achieve sustainable development.Access to financing for development has beenrendered more difficult  since the flow of private capitalresources has been limited to certain regions and to a fewdeveloping countries  resulting in a further widening of thegap between developed and the majority of developingcountries. As a consequence of this widening gap  povertycontinues to rise  leading to increased migration environmental deterioration  political conflicts andinstability  which eventually will have long-term negativeconsequences not only for developing  but for developedcountries as well.The international community therefore has a moralobligation to ensure that these negative influences ofglobalization are contained so that the benefits ofglobalization are shared among all nations. It must alsoguarantee special and differential treatment to small vulnerable developing countries in the internationalsystem. Such treatment must  specifically  extend to thefinancial  monetary and trading system  in order tosupport these countries in successfully adjusting to thedemands of globalization.The traffic in illegal drugs has become a seriousthreat to the national security of many nations  inparticular the small and vulnerable ones such asSuriname  because it promotes violence  corruption money-laundering and illegal arms trafficking. In thisway  countries can be manoeuvred into dangerous watersand be accused of interference in the internal affairs ofothers. It has become practically impossible for Suriname with its limited resources  to combat this scourge on itsown. We are therefore actively pursuing bilateralagreements with friendly nations to assist us in thisdifficult task. In this context  I would mention theagreement on cooperation in maritime law enforcementwhich we recently signed with the Government of theUnited States of America. We will continue to workclosely with our neighbours  with friendly nations andwith the relevant regional and international institutions tocontribute to the ongoing fight to eradicate this evil fromour region.The information superhighway  the Internet  isnowadays the means of choice for the exchange ofinformation  with a great impact on the social andeconomic life of the international community. This newform of technology offers great possibilities foraccelerated development in many fields. At the sametime  however  we should note that the development ofthis technology involves the risk of further marginalizingvulnerable economies.In addition to the positive effects of the Internet  wesee that the adverse effects on trade  the ever wideninggap in the field of education  the threat to social andcultural values and the abuse of this technology by peoplewith malicious intentions often cause great concern inthird world societies. I am convinced that in applyinginnovative technology  equal attention should be given tothe negative effects for societies with limited or no accessto it.I therefore urge the United Nations to ensure thatthis disparity  with its far-reaching consequences in thesocio-economic  educational and cultural fields  is12eliminated by augmenting the availability of and access tothis technology. Furthermore  it is of great importance toset up a legal framework to prevent the abuse and crimewhich can emanate from use of the Internet.The Surinamese Government is of the opinion that itsforeign policy must be fully at the service of its social andeconomic development. In our view  the State should nolonger fulfil the role it has traditionally performed ofbearing full responsibility for development strategies andacting as a dirigiste and sometimes even as a welfare State:development requires a State which is effective  fulfils therole of catalyst and facilitator  and encourages andcomplements the activities of the private sector.Good governance is not a luxury  but an absolutenecessity. In addition  I should say that without aneffectively operating State it would be impossible  fromboth the economic and the social points of view  toimplement a policy for sustainable development. Fordevelopment does not presuppose that there will be only theappropriate economic  social and technical inputs: in today'sworld  sustainable development and welfare can be attainedonly if regulations in a country are supportive so that theState can contribute to the effectiveness of the intendeddevelopment.It is my Government's objective to develop our naturalresources in cooperation with identified partners in theinternational community in such a manner that theenvironment and the ecosystem will be preserved for futuregenerations. In this light  may the unique decision bySuriname to offer almost 10 per cent of its territory as agift to humankind by creating a nature reserve of nearly1.16 million hectares  serve as an example. Theenvironment and its biodiversity shall  especially in thisnature reserve  always be fully protected.The Government of Suriname is convinced thateffective democratic structures are fundamental to asatisfactory enjoyment of democracy  so conditions havebeen created for the fullest development of Suriname'scitizens. Since the beginning of its period of administration the Government has devoted itself to strengtheningdemocratic institutions and anchoring the rule of law. Lawand justice  and effective institutions to implement them are the basis for the comprehensive and balanceddevelopment of the nation.My Government's policy is aimed also at promotingand safeguarding fundamental human rights and freedoms.Thus  we are creating ideal conditions for the optimalemployment of human and natural resources in theinterests of the development of our nation. We realize thatdemocracy  development  peace and social progress donot enjoy special attention only within the borders ofSuriname  but that the international community  moreparticularly the United Nations  thoroughly examines promotes and safeguards them.On 25 May 2000  the Surinamese people will decide through general and free elections by secret ballot  on theappointment of a national Government at the highest levelof State. My Government and the independent institutionsdesignated by law are engaged in preparations for theapproaching elections. In this respect  we know we havethe support of the Organization of American States andthe United Nations  as well as other internationalorganizations. Talks on possible financial assistance bythe European Union are in a phase of conclusion. Theprimary goal of the Government is to hold general andfree elections  with the greatest possible care  by secretballot  and once again to confirm to the world Suriname'sexcellent reputation in this field.Our world is closing this millennium  in whichhumankind has made enormous progress in science andtechnology  enhancing its capacity for its own securityand survival. The millennium has been an era of untoldhuman suffering caused by wars waged between andwithin States  with the means capable of destroying allthat which the human race has so far achieved. It has alsobeen an era in which many developing countries gainedconstitutional independence. Unfortunately  however  ithas not brought them economic independence and henceactual decolonization. Consequently  their fullparticipation in developments relating to the formation ofeconomic blocs was seriously impeded.This millennium has also seen the birth of a uniqueworld Organization  the United Nations  to assist us inovercoming the threat of complete destruction. Let usallow this unique instrument to assist humanity inachieving its noble desire for a peaceful world — a worldwith equitable economic  trade and development systems;a world with a protected and safe environment andecosystem; a world in which human rights andfundamental freedoms are protected  promoted andguaranteed to all its citizens; a world with adequatedevelopment opportunities for everyone; a world in whichhuman potential can be fully developed  irrespective ofrace  sex  creed or religion; and a world from which alltendencies and signals regarding recolonization originatingfrom former colonizers are banished.13Let us all  upon entering the new millennium contribute wholeheartedly to these noble goals."
"154",6475,"SVK",54,1999,"I would like to expressmy sincere congratulations  Sir  on your election asPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourthsession and to extend my best wishes for a successfulconduct of the deliberations and work of this body.I wish also to thank your predecessor  Mr. DidierOpertti  for his leadership and his personal contribution tothe achievements of the fifty-third session.The United Nations was created over 50 years agoin specific political circumstances marked by enthusiasmbrought about by the end of the Second World War. Itsestablishment was a very important step towards a newglobal order  although the political situation dominated bysuper-Power rivalry over next several decades preventedit from using its potential to the full. The currentinternational political situation is much more propitiousfor pursuing the original purposes and principles of theUnited Nations Charter. Following the end of the bipolardivision of the world  we have witnessed new politicalprocesses that have profoundly changed the politicallandscape. An ever- growing number of countries areembracing democratic principles and implementing themin practice. This should be emphasized  especially in aforum such as the General Assembly  because the spreadof democracy gives momentum to the work of the UnitedNations and stimulates the expansion of its activitiesthroughout the world.A growing number of countries are acknowledgingtheir share of the global responsibility for a better life onour planet and for the wise exploitation of its resources.In this era of globalization and interdependence  the6United Nations plays a unique and irreplaceable role. Itsfundamental and key tasks — safeguarding peace andsecurity; promoting economic cooperation and socialdevelopment  including poverty eradication; strengtheningthe role of international law; and protecting humanrights — are even more relevant today than they were 54years ago. The Slovak Republic is very much aware of thisfact.One of the crucial issues in reforming the Organizationand preparing it for the challenges that lie ahead is thereform of the Security Council. The Security Council is thesymbol and pillar of the concept of collective security designed in the aftermath of the most tragic conflict of thiscentury in order to prevent its repetition.The fundamental political changes that have takenplace in the world in the last 50 years represent a challengeto the future role of the Security Council and its legitimacy.We must draw lessons from past setbacks. Caused mostlyby the divergent interests of major actors or by a lack ofpolitical will  they paralysed the Security Council  whichremained inactive instead of taking effective action onbehalf of the Member States. Otherwise  we risk the erosionof the authority of the Security Council and consequentlyof its central role in the maintenance of international peaceand security. The United Nations cannot afford to let thathappen  because there is no alternative to the concept ofcollective security as embodied in the United NationsCharter. The modern world needs a supreme securityauthority with unquestioned credibility.The key tasks of Security Council reform are tostrengthen its representative character  improve theeffectiveness and transparency of its decision-makingprocess and working methods and  ultimately  enhance itslegitimacy. To achieve this goal  it is necessary to reach thewidest possible agreement on enlarging its membership andon the veto right  which plays a pivotal role in the overallreform of the Council. Unless the scope of application ofthe veto and its relationship to potential new members ofthe Security Council are clarified  it will be very difficultto proceed to the enlargement of the category of permanentmembers.Slovakia recognizes as legitimate the efforts of somecountries  which  being capable of assuming a share of thegobal responsibility for the maintenance of internationalpeace and security  desire a position in an enlarged SecurityCouncil. At the same time  however  it is necessary toensure the appropriate representation of the developingcountries of Africa  Asia  Latin America and the Caribbeanregion  since those countries represent a significantmajority of the United Nations membership.Regrettably  as the past six years of discussions inthe Open-ended Working Group on the Question ofEquitable Representation on and Increase in theMembership of the Security Council have shown  afundamental divergence of views continues to exist withregard to enlarging the category of permanent members thus making it very unlikely that concrete results will beachieved in the near future.We believe that in order to move ahead  we shouldproceed gradually rather than running in place in order toprevent the United Nations from “missing the boat” in ourrapidly changing world. If there is no agreement on othercategories of membership  Slovakia is ready  at this stage to support expanding only the non-permanent category.The overall number of seats in the enlarged SecurityCouncil would then depend on the scenario eventuallyagreed on by Member States. Nevertheless  it should notexceed the range of 23 to 25 in order to preserve itscapability to act promptly. I would like to point out thatSlovakia is flexible in this regard. The expansion of theSecurity Council should also take into account anappropriate increase in the representation of the EasternEuropean regional Group  whose membership has morethan doubled in recent years.Peacekeeping operations continue to be one of thekey instruments available to the United Nations in thedischarge of its primary responsibility for the maintenanceof international peace and security. Nevertheless  in thelight of the tragic experience of recent and still-ragingconflicts  it is necessary to reinforce those mechanisms which would allow the United Nations to more activelyconcentrate on preventing conflicts and addressing theircauses rather than their consequences. An early- warningsystem should be further enhanced  and preventivediplomacy should play a more active role in potentialconflict situations.Today’s conflicts have many dimensions  whichmust be addressed comprehensively. An integrated multidimensional approach to peacekeeping and post-conflict peace-building must be taken if a conflict is to beresolved in a durable manner. It is important to ensure aneffective coordination among the military  civilian andhumanitarian components of multidisciplinary operations which should be given adequate mandates and resources.7As time is a crucial factor in most cases ofdeployment of peacekeeping forces  Slovakia supports theefforts to enhance United Nations rapid-deploymentcapabilities through the United Nations standbyarrangements system. Regional initiatives play an importantrole in this respect  and Slovakia has therefore joined theCentral European Nations Cooperation in Peace Support aimed at closer cooperation among several CentralEuropean States in the field of the preparation  training andparticipation of their armed forces in peacekeepingoperations.Since its admission to the United Nations Slovakia hasbeen contributing to a number of United Nationspeacekeeping operations in Africa  Asia and Europe including those in Angola  Rwanda  the border region ofUganda and Rwanda  Liberia  Sierra Leone  the SyrianGolan Heights  Jerusalem  Bosnia and Herzegovina  Croatiaand Eastern Slavonia. The Slovak Government has alsorecently decided to contribute an engineering unit to theUnited Nations Mission for the Referendum in WesternSahara (MINURSO). Slovakia thus ranks among the leadingtroop contributors in terms of the number of troops percapita. I would like to take this opportunity to assure theAssembly that Slovakia is determined to continue to supportUnited Nations peacekeeping activities in all the mainareas: troops  logistics and training.The active participation of the Slovak Republic inUnited Nations peacekeeping activities has proved that ithas a responsible approach to the maintenance ofinternational peace and security  and has logically led to thesubmission of its candidature for the non-permanent seat inthe Security Council for the term 2000-2001. Throughmembership in the Security Council  Slovakia would like toprove that small countries  too  can make an importantcontribution to the resolution of conflicts and crises in theworld.Kosovo is the most recent example of the tragic realityof the present-day Balkans  driven by violence and ethnichatred  which is not only a product of the region’scomplicated historical circumstances  but  above all  theresult of human rights violations and of the misuse ofethnic differences to reach short-sighted political goals.Slovakia attaches great importance to the political resolutionof the Kosovo conflict  and appreciates the efforts of theUnited Nations  the Secretary-General  the Contact Groupdealing with the former Yugoslavia and regionalorganizations to this end. We welcomed with great hope theadoption of Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)  aimedat creating conditions for building a democratic Kosovobased on respect for the human rights of all citizens regardless of their ethnic origin and religion  and for allthe principles enshrined in Article 2 of the United NationsCharter.Post-conflict peace-building in Bosnia andHerzegovina has proved that reconstruction of aconflict-torn society on a multi-ethnic basis is in no wayan easy task. However  if new tragedies are to beprevented  the international community must give a handto the people in that part of Europe in their quest forreconciliation and for building mutual trust. An importantrole in these efforts is to be played by the economicreconstruction and development of the entire Balkanregion.In this connection  Slovakia welcomes and fullysupports the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe. Ibelieve it will open a new stage in the history of theregion. The proof of the importance which the SlovakRepublic attaches to securing stability in this part ofEurope is the appointment of the Minister for ForeignAffairs of Slovakia  Mr. Eduard Kukan  as the SpecialEnvoy of the Secretary-General for the Balkans. Aconference was held under his auspices in Bratislava  thecapital of Slovakia  on the post-war reconstruction of theFederal Republic of Yugoslavia. The conference clearlyshowed the direction which the international communityand Yugoslav society should take if the country is tobecome a firm part of the community of nations in theBalkans  built on new foundations.The Slovak Republic considers a just peace in theMiddle East to be an important component of globalstability. For this reason  we welcomed the signing  on 4September 1999  of a new agreement between Israel andthe Palestinian Authority on the implementation ofindividual steps of the Wye Memorandum. At the sametime  we hope that Israel  Syria and Lebanon will alsorenew their dialogues. Although certain issues remain tobe resolved among the parties  we believe that a finalagreement will eventually be reached and a permanentpeace will be secured for the Middle East region.The continent of Africa is suffering from far toomany conflicts  often fed by poverty andunderdevelopment. Clearly  cooperation between theinternational community and African States is greatlyneeded in order to prevent and to address conflicts and tohelp Africa to create conditions for sustainabledevelopment. Slovakia shares the Secretary-General’sview  expressed in his report on Africa last year  that8Africans themselves must demonstrate the political will torespond to problems by peaceful means and to adhere tothe rules of good governance through ensuring respect forhuman rights and the rule of law  strengtheningdemocratization and promoting transparency in publicadministration. In the meantime  the assistance of theinternational community is important not only for theeconomic development of African States  but also to enablethem to build their own capacity for conflict prevention andresolution.The African regional and subregional organizations such as the Organization of African Unity  the EconomicCommunity of West African States and the SouthernAfrican Development Community  should be given creditfor the role they have played in the implementation ofpeace operations in several African countries  and should beprovided with the necessary financial and materialassistance. Slovakia is ready to contribute its share — forinstance  by offering its Training Centre for PeacekeepingOperations  which has specific facilities for trainingengineering units.Another pressing problem is the prevention of theillicit flow of arms and military material into zones ofconflict  and the enforcement of an effectiveimplementation of the Security Council arms embargoes.The most disturbing fact is that the Security Council’ssanctions are violated mostly by non-African countrieswhich have turned Africa into a store for all kinds ofweapons. Slovakia firmly adheres to all Security Councildecisions  including sanctions. We believe that SecurityCouncil sanctions committees should be actively engagedin ensuring the concerted efforts of all the actors concerned— Governments  international governmental andnon-governmental organizations  private companies andleaders of opinion — in order to identify the sources ofarms flows into zones of conflict and cut off military forcesand rebel groups from their resources  thus eliminating theirability to wage war.I realize that the United Nations is not only apeacekeeper; it also has a role to play in the everyday livesof many people suffering from hunger  poverty  disease illiteracy and backwardness. All of us are obligated topromote sustainable development and to protect the globalenvironment and human rights. The best way to prevent andeliminate conflicts is to create conditions for a worthy lifefor every individual on this planet as well as friendlyrelations among nations based on the principles of equalrights  democracy  the rule of law and respect for humanrights.Being a small country  the Slovak Republic does notalways have means to resolve global issues comparable tothose that some big countries have. But it compensatesfor this disadvantage with its determined and activeapproach to all the major problems that mankind isfacing. As experience has shown  small and medium-sizedcountries can contribute significantly to the resolution ofcrises and conflicts. This may be due to the fact that thesecountries are not burdened with power interests and arecapable of presenting and advocating solutions acceptableto all. Slovakia has already demonstrated its ability to bean active player in international relations. The UnitedNations and its Security Council are the forums in whichwe can put this valuable experience to the best use."
"155",6500,"SVN",54,1999,"Let me take thisopportunity to congratulate you  Sir  and your country Namibia  on your election as President of the fifty-fourthsession of the General Assembly. I am convinced that yourexperience and diplomatic skills will help this GeneralAssembly to fulfil its important tasks. I would also like tothank the outgoing President  Mr. Didier Opertti ofUruguay  for the guidance he provided to the fifty-thirdsession of the General Assembly.Let me also take this opportunity to warmly welcomethe Republic of Nauru  the Republic of Kiribati and theKingdom of Tonga  which have just joined the UnitedNations family.We are gathered here at the threshold not just of anew century but of a new millennium. It is appropriate therefore  that we take advantage of this important occasionto reflect upon our situation in the world today. I speakhere not of our situation as individuals or even as nations but as a race.There are many signs of progress  and there arereasons for hope. However  the ultimate goal of worldpeace still seems elusive. The number of conflicts issignificantly increasing. All over the world  millions ofcivilians are the victims of well-planned and systematicpolicies of killing  displacement  property destruction andintimidation. At the end of last year  the number of peopleworldwide who had been evicted from their homes stoodat more than 21 million.East Timor and Kosovo are just two tragic examplesof typical cases of contemporary armed conflicts. Theseare conflicts frequently take place within what the outsideworld recognizes as State borders  rather than betweenpreviously established States. Today  these types of warsamount to more than 90 per cent of those raging in theworld.To make matters even worse  the number of civilianskilled in these nominally “internal” wars is sharplyincreasing. A new kind of warfare is developing in whichcivilians are a primary strategic target. “Ethnic cleansing” massacres and a horrifying variety of war crimes havebecome weapons for achieving political  economic andmilitary goals. Ethnic  religious  national and socialinequalities are frequently used as a smokescreen to hidethe reality of massacre and conquest from the rest of theworld. Furthermore  these inequalities are exploited byruthless leaders  who use them as a tool to achieve veryconcrete aims. We have seen this phenomenon in almostall of the armed conflicts of recent times — in Bosniaand Herzegovina  Kosovo  Rwanda  Sierra Leone  theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  Angola  Afghanistanand  most recently  in East Timor.How should the international community react togross violations of human rights — violations that amountto threats to international peace and security? When andhow can the international community seek to establishthat a sovereign Government cannot  or does not want to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe? When and by whatcriteria does it decide to use its instruments ofenforcement?All United Nations Member States must think hardabout these questions. We are grateful to the Secretary-General  who made  at the beginning of this debate  asignificant contribution to such thinking.This turn-of-the-century crime wave cries out fornew approaches and new ways of protecting vulnerablecivilian populations. Armed conflicts have in fact becomea problem for humankind  not just for the nation ornations directly concerned.The international community must innovate as itseeks to solve these pressing humanitarian problems. Ourbasic aim has to be human security  and here I meanphysical and not just legal security. Slovenia welcomes15and participates in the initiatives of like-minded countrieswhich are determined to give full meaning and specificpractical expression to the concept of human security. Inaddition  as one answer to these challenges  new and moresophisticated concepts of peacekeeping operations are beingdeveloped. New methods of conflict prevention should alsobe explored. Preventive diplomacy  preventive deployment preventive disarmament and post-conflict peace-building arethe orders of the day.We have to ensure respect for human rights. We arefirm in our belief that a determined commitment to promoteand protect human rights has to be an underlying principlefor the activities of the United Nations at the threshold ofthe new millennium. We have to create conditions for goodgovernance  the rule of law  sustainable development andsocial justice. All of these tasks and many others requirecreative thinking and bold action. Solving these thornyproblems is a prerequisite for peace and prosperity. This isalso the way to prevent conditions which directly feed theflames of the conflicts that I have described.As an elected member of the Security Council  we arecontributing to the maintenance of world peace andsecurity. We are cooperating actively in the resolution ofcrises in South-Eastern Europe  Africa  Asia  Latin Americaand the Middle East. We believe that special importanceshould be attached to preventive action in situations posinga potential threat to international peace but which have notyet developed into armed conflict. Where situations havealready escalated into armed conflict  no effort should bespared in finding a peaceful and timely resolution. Werecognize the recent Security Council mission to Jakartaand Dili  in which Slovenia took part  as an innovativeapproach by the United Nations in dealing with crisissituations. Clearly  we welcome this.Finally  in post-conflict situations  such as Kosovo continued coordinated action by the internationalcommunity is necessary. It is only by working in concertthat the United Nations  regional organizations and otherinternational players can be effective. Only in this way canthe difficult goals that have been set be achieved. Thesegoals include bringing political and economic stabilization democratization  the protection of human rights to theterritory in question and establishing a functional legalsystem there.The changing nature of armed conflicts is alsochanging the role of the Security Council as it dischargesits primary responsibility for the maintenance ofinternational peace and security. We note the increasedreadiness and determination of regional organizations totake on their share of responsibility for the maintenanceof regional peace and security. As many examples offruitful collaboration attest  relations between the SecurityCouncil and these regional organizations are relations notof competition but rather of cooperation. We thereforecommend the increased role of regional organizationsunder Chapter VIII of the Charter.Let me continue by presenting some elements thatwe must consider in any international response to thechanging nature of armed conflicts. There is anunacceptably wide — even a growing — gap between theexisting norms of international humanitarian and humanrights law and common situations on the ground: humanrights are frequently and openly violated. Determined andunited action by the international community is needed toensure that the existing norms of human rights are fullyobserved.Those who commit war crimes and crimes againsthumanity must be brought to justice. This is primarily theresponsibility of States  which must act both individuallythrough their national systems of justice  and collectivelythrough an effective international justice system. Failureto act is no more and no less than an invitation to thosecapable of creating new  even more serious cycles ofhuman tragedy to do just that.Whether there is to be human progress anddevelopment depends on the result of this confrontationbetween the rule of international law and those who standto benefit directly from lawlessness. Internationalindifference can only reward such people. In this regard Slovenia attaches particular importance to the need toensure more effective  comprehensive and efficientdelivery of international justice. We are supportive of thetwo existing United Nations International CriminalTribunals and of the ongoing process designed to givebirth to a permanent International Criminal Court. To thisend we have begun the legislative procedures necessaryto ratify the Rome Statute. We are also contributing toefforts to complete the mandate of the PreparatoryCommission for the International Criminal Court.Peacekeeping operations have in recent yearsbecome increasingly multidimensional: they encompassnot only demanding military tasks but also a variety ofother functions  such as civilian police activities  supportfor humanitarian assistance  practical disarmamentmeasures  demobilization and integration of formercombatants  and enhancing and monitoring human rights.16I should like to avail myself of this important occasionto affirm that Slovenia considers peacekeeping to be one ofthe key instruments available to the United Nations indischarging its responsibility for the maintenance ofinternational peace and security. We have increased ourparticipation in United Nations peacekeeping operations —and are committed to further increasing our participation inthe near future — not only in terms of military personnelbut also of civilian police and humanitarian aid workers.Disarmament efforts are a vital ingredient in themaintenance of international peace and security. Theachievements of past years have been considerable especially in such areas as chemical weapons and thecomprehensive ban on nuclear weapon testing. However there is a need to strengthen disarmament work  in the areanot only of weapons of mass destruction but also inreducing flows of conventional arms. We hope that theConference on Disarmament will be strengthened as aneffective disarmament negotiation body. We also hope thatthe forthcoming Review Conference of the Parties to theTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)will represent a decisive step in the strengthening of thenon-proliferation regime  and that progress will be madetowards the objective of nuclear disarmament.I strongly believe that States Members of the UnitedNations and the international community as a whole mustcontinue efforts to strengthen the prohibition of land mines which is one specific front in protecting the physicalsecurity to which I referred. Last year our Governmentestablished an International Trust Fund for Demining andMine Victim Assistance in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Ouraim is to help Bosnia and Herzegovina and other mine-affected countries in the region get rid of those lethal hidden weapons  and to help those who have been woundedby them. In only the first year of its existence  theInternational Trust Fund has achieved many positive resultsin Bosnia; it is now extending its activities to Kosovo.There are many ways in which United NationsMember States can contribute to the maintenance ofinternational peace and security. I would like to point outthat Slovenia has joined a number of other nations incommitting itself to tackling the security challenges ofSouth-Eastern Europe. In establishing the Stability Pact  theinternational community has formed a framework intendedto enable the concerted and sustained action necessary tostabilize the region. If it lives up to its early promise —and we intend to work hard to make sure that it does — theStability Pact could be the key factor in bringing lastingpeace  economic recovery and development to a verytroubled neighbourhood. That such a wide range of Statesand international organizations — not least the UnitedNations — have committed themselves to helping in thisvery ambitious task gives us grounds for hope.In conclusion  I would like to return to the questionwith which I started: at the end of the millennium  howdoes the human race stand? Are there grounds for hope?Do we have the institutions and strategies needed to dealwith our problems? If not  can we modify and redesignthem? Even in the face of tragic conflicts  I believe thatthe answer to these questions must be “yes”."
"156",6545,"SWE",54,1999,"The past year has been adifficult one for the United Nations. Its principles havebeen challenged. Its relevance has been questioned. Still  atthe end of the millennium  we have proved ourselvesunable to prevent war between Ethiopia and Eritrea andunable to prevent genocide in Rwanda or ethnic cleansingin Kosovo. Still  we see flagrant disrespect for internationallaw  humanitarian law and human rights. Children are usedas soldiers in Sierra Leone  women are denied all rights inAfghanistan  fundamentalist forces have demonstratingstudents arrested and possibly sentenced to death in Iran.Other tragic examples can be found in almost all parts ofthe world.We can change all that  if only there is political will.It is up to us  the Member States  to ensure that the UnitedNations and the Security Council are able to upholdinternational law and their responsibility for internationalpeace and security.I would like to highlight four key areas that we  theUnited Nations and its Member States  need to address tomake the United Nations truly relevant: the questions ofintervention; early action and prevention; nucleardisarmament; and human rights. To succeed  the UnitedNations system also needs to be reformed  and I will comeback to that.When it comes to intervention to secure peace regional organizations and arrangements  as well as so-called coalitions of the willing  can have important roles together with the United Nations  as we have just seen inEast Timor. But it is for the Security Council to provide thelegal foundation — the mandate — for such action  inparticular when force has to be used. Without such a legalfoundation  we run the risk of anarchy in internationalrelations  and in fact we undermine the prospects for peaceand security; and that long-term perspective must never belost.Our responsibility for international peace andsecurity implies that necessary action by the SecurityCouncil should not be hindered by a veto. If the SecurityCouncil in an urgent situation is paralysed by a veto or athreat of veto  this may undermine the authority and therelevance of the United Nations itself. It also presents theinternational community with a difficult dilemma.When human life is threatened on a massive scale it is not possible to remain passive. Humanitarianintervention has to be assessed on a case-by-case basis  inview of the values at stake and whether all other meanshave been exhausted. The effects on international law andinternational security at large have to be considered aswell.As the Secretary-General said yesterday  we mustensure that the Security Council is able to rise to thechallenge. It must negotiate in earnest  with creativity andwithout the threat of veto  to define threats to peace andsecurity at an early stage  and to deal with a crisis beforean emergency situation arises. Council action does notnecessarily mean the use of force. The use of forcealmost inevitably causes suffering for the innocent. Itshould  therefore  only be the last resort. There are manyother tools available. The United Nations Charter offersseveral options.The most obvious alternative to the use of force isconflict prevention and early action. Member States  inparticular the permanent members of the SecurityCouncil  must share information on conflict situations andearly warning signals with the Secretariat. The Secretary-General should be invited to react to such reports and topropose appropriate and timely action to the SecurityCouncil. The United Nations offices in the field and earlyfact-finding missions dispatched to areas of potentialconflict could help the Secretary-General formulate suchproposals. Academic institutions and non-governmentalorganizations could also be helpful in this regard.The Swedish Government has adopted a programmeof action to facilitate and contribute to the prevention ofarmed conflict. It is our hope that this action plan willstimulate a debate on how to change the focus from crisismanagement to early preventive action in order topromote a culture of prevention.When considering peacekeeping operations  theSecurity Council should not be hampered by short-termbudgetary considerations. This sends a very negativemessage and runs counter to the need for early and32preventive action. All countries must pay their assessedcontributions in full  on time and without conditions.Naturally  that also goes for the host country. The UnitedNations must be given the necessary resources to be able toact swiftly upon decisions by the Security Council.The danger of nuclear devastation has not faded. Onthe contrary  we are faced with new threats. Last year thepositive trend set by Argentina  Brazil and South Africahaving joined the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons (NPT) was reversed by India andPakistan  which both tested nuclear weapons. Their actionshave endangered international peace and security  as wellas stability in the region  and are a serious setback to ourhopes for a world without nuclear weapons.Sweden will follow up its call of last year for a newagenda for complete nuclear disarmament. India andPakistan have taken us further away from that goal. We callupon them  and all other States which have not yet done so to give up their nuclear ambitions. All countries shouldbecome parties to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-BanTreaty (CTBT) and the NPT.The five nuclear-weapon States also have aresponsibility to complete nuclear disarmament.Deployment of national missile defence systems in thefuture would create uncertainties and have a negativeimpact on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. Weencourage the United States and Russia to re-establish anew momentum in the stalled START negotiations  andespecially we call upon Russia to ratify the Start IIagreement without further delay. Reductions should beextended to non-strategic nuclear weapons. Furthermore  weurge the three nuclear-weapon States which have not yetdone so to ratify the CTBT. All this should be done in aneffort aimed at the elimination of all kinds of weapons ofmass destruction  which still pose a threat to human beingsall over the world.Any regime violating human rights paves the way forcrisis and armed conflict. The defence of human rights is alegitimate concern for the Security Council and theinternational community. It is our duty to react when therights of individuals are violated  wherever it happens.Still  disrespect for democracy and human rights isobvious in many parts of the world. The events in EastTimor show how the will of the people can be totallyignored by armed thugs. In Kosovo  innocent civilians areattacked for belonging to a certain ethnic group.Still  poverty and social injustice deprive people ofhealth and education.Still  women and girls are facing discrimination. Thebrutalizing and killing of women is carried out withimpunity in many countries. In wars  rape is used as ameans of terror. Often women are deprived of their rightto earn their own living or participate in the economicand political life of their countries. I urge all countries toadhere to the Convention on the Elimination of All Formsof Discrimination against Women  without reservation.Still  10 years after the adoption of the Conventionon the Rights of the Child  the hopes of children for thefuture are overshadowed by daily hardship and fear. Toooften their talents and skills are buried in poverty ordiseases which are curable but not attended to. Too oftenthey are denied proper education  or suffer fromdiscriminatory school systems. The recruitment of childsoldiers is a shameful practice that causes individualsuffering and will harm the security and development ofsocieties for many years to come. I appeal to allGovernments to assist in the conclusion of the twooptional protocols to the Convention on the Rights of theChild in order to prohibit sexual abuse of children and theuse of children below the age of 18 in armed conflict.The use of the death penalty has no place in acivilized society. Sweden welcomes moves taken in anumber of countries to put an end to this repugnantpractice. The abolition of the death penalty wouldenhance human dignity worldwide.Still  the ugly face of racism appears in all parts ofthe world. Manifestations of racism are an affront to thefundamental principle of non-discrimination and a threatto the fragile fabric of peaceful relations between peoplein an increasingly global community. The preparations forthe World Conference against Racism  RacialDiscrimination  Xenophobia and Related Intoleranceprovide an important opportunity to identify concrete andaction-oriented ways to combat racism. Another importantmanifestation will be the Stockholm International Forumon the Holocaust  to be held in January 2000.The early entry into force of the Statute of theInternational Criminal Court would send a clear signalthat the international community is determined to end theculture of impunity for the most heinous crimes underinternational law. Sweden is committed to earlyratification  and we urge all countries to be similarlycommitted.33As I said at the outset  in order to have an efficientand relevant United Nations  not paralysed by the veto andable to cope with the challenges of conflict prevention nuclear disarmament and the protection of human rights  wealso need reforms. In particular  we need to strengthen theUnited Nations capacity for conflict prevention and toaddress root causes of conflict. This is a moral imperativeas well as a humanitarian  political and economic necessity.The Security Council should be enlarged to betterreflect the realities of today’s international relations. Ageographical balance is important in this regard so that theCouncil can become truly representative of the internationalcommunity.The use of the veto  or even the threat of its use hampers the work of the Council. We support the proposalthat as a first step the right of veto should be limited todecisions on enforcement action under Chapter VII of theCharter. We would also like to see the five permanentmembers agreeing on a moratorium on the use of the veto.The Security Council should be more transparent andopen. This would contribute to the acceptance andlegitimacy of its decisions. The Council should be able tohear the views of all relevant parties to a conflict withoutthe implication of political recognition.The involvement of humanitarian organizations in theCouncil’s deliberations would enhance the quality of itsdecisions. The humanitarian consequences of SecurityCouncil action should always be taken into consideration.This is particularly important when sanctions are imposed.Sweden welcomes the Secretary-General’s efforts toreform the Secretariat and modernize its managementculture  and we appreciate the improved efficiency that hasfollowed. Reform is not only about cost-cutting. The aimmust be to revitalize the Organization and the multilateralsystem to cope with the many challenges before us.Long-term security is closely linked to sustainabledevelopment and the eradication of poverty. We need tostrengthen not only the United Nations capacity to providehumanitarian assistance but also its long-term social andeconomic development efforts.A basic problem is the lack of funds. The donorcommunity needs to ensure sufficient and predictablefinancial resources to allow the reforms to produce long-term results. Sweden is one of only four countries that meetthe United Nations aid target of 0.7 per cent of grossnational product. Development requires a true partnershipbetween countries  ensuring sufficient external resources sound use of internal resources and good governance.The reform process has to continue  and we lookforward to the Millennium Assembly and the summit nextyear as an opportunity to accelerate the work.We all have a tendency to blame the United Nationsfor our own failures and shortcomings. In fact  when theUnited Nations fails  it is because we fail. If the UnitedNations loses its relevance  we lose. There is no realalternative to global cooperation to cope with increasinglyglobal problems  and for this  we need the UnitedNations — but a strengthened and reformed UnitedNations."
"157",6583,"SWZ",54,1999,"I am honoured to address theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-fourth session as arepresentative of His Majesty the King of Swaziland. Ibring with me from the Kingdom of Swaziland warmestgreetings and best wishes to all our fellow members fromHis Majesty King Mswati III  Her Majesty the Indlovukazi the Government and the whole Swazi nation.The Kingdom of Swaziland congratulates you  Sir  onyour election to the presidency of the General Assembly atthis session. We are especially proud that a fellow southernAfrican has been elected to this demanding position  andwe are confident that your diplomatic skills and experiencewill help you guide and lead this Assembly towards thesuccessful conclusion of its deliberations.We should also like to commend the skilful leadershipof the fifty-third session by your predecessor Mr. DidierOpertti.We are meeting at a time of great challenges for theUnited Nations. The membership is faced with a number ofissues concerning the very shape of our Organization andthe scope of operations that we choose to undertake. TheKingdom of Swaziland believes that we are fortunateindeed to have at this time a Secretary-General whocommands such universal respect and who possesses thequalities of determination  enthusiasm and leadership thatare so necessary as we chart our course for the future. Wecall on him and on the staff of the United Nations to keepup their good work in the service of all Member States.The Kingdom of Swaziland believes that theSecretary-General and his staff can best be supported byour continuing commitment to meeting our financialobligations in full and on time. We call on all our fellowMembers to comply by honouring their obligations so thatour Organization can have sufficient resources with whichto cope with the widening scope of its operations and tomeet the expectations of us all.The Kingdom of Swaziland is delighted to extend awarm welcome to our Organization’s three new Members:the nation States of Tonga  Nauru and Kiribati. Theiradmission is further confirmation of our respect for theprinciples of universality and representation  as containedin the founding Charter of the United Nations.But even as we welcome these new Members  theKingdom of Swaziland is conscious that the principle ofuniversality is not applied equally to others who feelexcluded from the activities of our Organization. I referto the 22 million people of the Republic of China onTaiwan  who believe that they are being denied their rightto representation in the United Nations. The Governmentand the people of the Republic of China on Taiwan haveshown their willingness and capacity to contribute activelyto global development and peace  through disaster relief anddevelopment support to many countries and regions. TheRepublic of China on Taiwan is clearly a peace-lovingnation  and is highly developed in all economic  social andpolitical spheres.It is the view of the Kingdom of Swaziland thatinternational peace and security and equitable developmentfor all mankind  can be achieved only through the inclusionof all the people of the world in the one truly globaldevelopment Organization. We therefore support the callfrom an increasing number of Member States for theestablishment of a working group by the General Assemblyto examine the exceptional international situation relating tothe Republic of China on Taiwan and to ensure that thefundamental right of its 22 million people to participate inthe work and activities of the United Nations is fullyrespected. We recognize that  as has been the case in someother nations  the matter of reunification is for the Chinesepeople themselves.The history of the twentieth century will have furtherevidence to support the belief that man apparently andsurprisingly cannot live peacefully side by side with hisneighbour  nor in harmony with nature and his environment.Despite the many remarkable achievements of the last 99years  notably in the collapse of ideological and politicalcolonialism and in the fields of technology  science andmedicine  it will be  in the end  by world wars environmental degradation and the emergence of globalepidemics that this century will be remembered.The Kingdom of Swaziland believes that thepromotion of sustainable international peace and securitymust be the main priority for the United Nations  becauseit is clear that our collective aim of raising the livingstandards of our peoples is possible only in conditions ofglobal stability and with nations living in harmonyalongside one another.It has long been recognized that the greatest threat toglobal peace lies in the continuing spread of weapons ofmass destruction. Our failure so far as an Organization tohave true commitment from all Members to arms controland nuclear disarmament has meant that we enter the nextmillennium with this threat still overshadowing all mattersof international relations.The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-BanTreaty are designed as essential first steps towards aworld free from the danger that such weapons pose. Weclearly need to find a way to strengthen thenon-proliferation regime  and also to prevent the flow ofconventional weapons and anti-personnel landmines intozones of conflict.The Kingdom of Swaziland therefore calls upon theConference on Disarmament to implement the proposal ofthe Non-Aligned Movement by establishing as its highestpriority an ad hoc committee to begin negotiations on aprogramme for the complete elimination of nuclearweapons  within a time-bound framework. We also urgethose States with nuclear weapons to implement faithfullyboth the letter and spirit of all agreements relating to thenon-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nucleardisarmament.Whilst the possibilities of global conflict havediminished since the end of the cold-war era  it is a factthat there has been a corresponding increase in theincidence of internal conflicts and cross-borderdisturbances arising from a variety of causes  includingethnic and religious confrontation. The Kingdom ofSwaziland believes that the emphasis of the UnitedNations in dealing with this increase of internal andcross-border crises should be on the introduction of aneffective mechanism of preventive diplomacy to stopincidents from escalating out of control. This has been thefocus of regional organizations of which the Kingdom ofSwaziland is a member  such as the Common Market forEastern and Southern Africa (COMESA)  the SouthernAfrican Development Community (SADC) and theOrganization of African Unity (OAU). We believe that while recognizing the overall responsibility of the UnitedNations towards global peace  the regional organizationsmust take the lead as the building blocks towards stabilityand closer cooperation.The past year in international affairs has been a mixof progress in some areas of past conflict and thecontinuation or emergence of crises in many others. TheUnited Nations has quite correctly become involved intrying to help resolve each of these situations  to a greateror lesser degree  and the Kingdom of Swazilandcommends its efforts and those of all who have played asimilar role.The Kingdom of Swaziland recognizes the recentprogress made by Israelis and Palestinians towards the2implementation of the Wye River peace accord. This hasbeen a most encouraging step towards lasting peace in theMiddle East region and we applaud the courage andcommitment of the leadership of both sides towardsachieving this aim.The crisis in the former Yugoslavia earlier this yeargave us cause for great concern  especially in the light ofthe threat of the conflict’s spreading to other Balkan States.We pray that the recent return to relative stability will leadto lasting peace in that troubled region and that the wishesof the people for their future will be the guiding principlein any long-term dispensation.We have viewed with concern the events in EastTimor following the referendum on independence and wefully support the decision of the United Nations to accedeto the request of the Indonesian Government for the urgentdeployment of a peacekeeping force. We appeal to allinvolved to restore calm to the situation and to respect thewishes of the people of East Timor for their future.We have watched with equal concern the apparentsetback in the peace process in Northern Ireland. Wesupport the efforts of the British and Irish Governments tocreate the right conditions of trust and confidence  in whichthe people of Northern Ireland can decide their future forthemselves. We urge all parties involved to exerciserestraint and to rediscover the spirit of compromise andreconciliation that characterized the original Good FridayAgreement.Closer to home  on our own continent of Africa  thepast year has given cause for some optimism in a numberof areas; but in others  the tale is all too depressinglyfamiliar.We welcome with great relief the signing of the PeaceAgreement between the warring factions in Sierra Leoneand we appeal to both sides to abide by the terms of thesettlement so that their people may benefit from thedividend of peace after so many years of suffering and lackof development.The continuing border dispute between Ethiopia andEritrea has unsettled all in the Horn of Africa and weapplaud the decision of both countries to agree to mediationefforts between them by the United Nations and the OAU.We pray that this sensible move may lead to a peacefulsettlement of the crisis.The recent signing of an Agreement by all parties tothe conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo hasencouraged all of us in the region. We hope that therewill be commitment by all signatories to the terms of theceasefire and that a lasting solution may be found thatwill allow the Congolese people to develop their greatpotential in peace. This last success is all the moreencouraging for those of us in the SADC region  since itcame about through the combined efforts of a number ofSADC member States. In a similar vein  heightenedtension between two of our members  Angola andZambia  was able to be defused before the situation couldescalate into a crisis.Both of these situations point to the acceptance ofresponsibility by our member States for resolving regionaldifficulties ourselves. Of course  this does not precludeour welcome to the willingness of others  such as theOAU  the United Nations and individual countries thatwish to be involved  especially in the provision of trainingand material and financial support. But we firmly believein the principle that African problems require africansolutions and we are determined to come up with themeans and mechanisms to abide by it.On the negative side  the continent has seen thecontinuation of two crises that are having an especiallydamaging effect on the lives of the people involved andthat we believe require the urgent attention of the UnitedNations.The first concerns the deteriorating situation inAngola  where peace remains as elusive as ever. We callon the leadership of UNITA to respect the terms of theLusaka Protocol and to recognize the need to use it as thestarting point in the search for lasting peace and nationalhealing. We appeal to the international community tocontinue to support the efforts of SADC and all of uswho are involved in the quest for an end to the sufferingof the Angolan people.The situation is Somalia  while possessing differentcharacteristics  has the same distressing effect on thepeople of that unfortunate country. The fact is that thedivision and lack of any legitimate central authority intheir country has deprived Somalis not only of peace andthe chance for development  but also of a voice of appealin regional and international forums.The time has surely come for the United Nations toshow real commitment to finding a solution to theSomalia crisis  in the same way that we are expending a3great deal of effort and resources in crisis situations inother parts of the world. The Somali people deserve thesame concern and respect for their future from the rest ofthe world as those in countries with perhaps greater globalrecognition and resources.The complex challenges facing the world today lendgreater significance and urgency to the initiatives for reformof our Organization. The Kingdom of Swaziland believesthat these reforms are essential if the United Nations is toretain the global credibility and authority that are sonecessary in its operations.Recent history has shown clearly that the traditionalmechanisms for harmonizing global relations and conflictresolution  in particular  are no longer effective  and theUnited Nations is in real danger of losing the confidence ofits Members in these areas.Our aim must be to transform our Organization into astructure that is truly representative of all our Members andthat is transparent and efficient in its operations  whileremaining consistent to the purposes and principles of ourfounding Charter.We believe that the priority should be to achievebalanced representation in the principal organs of theUnited Nations. The Security Council  as a particularexample  requires reform in order to strengthen itslegitimacy. Its composition must reflect the plurality anddiversity of the membership of the United Nations  withdue regard for the profound geopolitical changes in recenthistory.The Kingdom of Swaziland reaffirms its full supportfor the African position on reform of the Security Council namely  two permanent seats for Africa to be shared on arotational basis  as well as three non-permanent seats  anda re-examination of the exercise of veto power.It is a fact that the majority of Member States concurwith this need for reform of the Security Council and thatall agree on the urgency attached to the matter. Yet therehas been very little progress made so far by theOpen-ended Working Group established to address this vitalissue. We are concerned at this lack of progress and wouldurge the Working Group to overcome whatever obstaclesremain to a resolution that meets Members’ demands forfairness and urgency.Turning now to the question of the MillenniumAssembly  to be convened next year  the Kingdom ofSwaziland is encouraged by the emerging consensusamong Member States on the need to articulate a visionfor the international community in the year 2000.We support the Secretary-General’s theme of theUnited Nations in the twenty-first century and theproposed sub-topics for the Millennium Assembly. Ofthese  we believe the closely related sub-topics of peaceand security  on the one hand  and development andpoverty eradication  on the other  to be of the highestpriority in the context of the overall theme.Future global stability depends on the ability ofnational Governments to increase the momentum foreconomic development and their capacity to improve thedelivery of job creation and essential social services  suchas health and education.We believe that poverty eradication can be achievedonly through the promotion of an accelerated pace ofgrowth and development in the developing countries.There can be no doubt that  to achieve this aim  we needthe support of the rest of the international community and this support can best be coordinated by the UnitedNations.One key factor in the achievement of our aim ofpoverty eradication is the concept of the globalization andliberalization of the global economy. The conclusion ofthe Uruguay Round  on the one hand  promised to openup enormous trade opportunities in the sale andmovement of goods and services  but on the other itthreatened the fragile economies of those countries thathad not achieved the state of preparation to take fulladvantage.The continent of Africa  in particular  continues toface a multitude of problems as we struggle to settle intothe new world order. Many of us are undertaking painfulreforms of existing structures in order to respond to thedemands of globalization and liberalization. Theimplementation of structural adjustment programmes often on the instructions of the Bretton Woodsinstitutions  is having a severely adverse impact on thesocial welfare of many African countries  with devastatingeffects on the quality of life of our people. We can seethe result of these effects in many countries  where adecrease in expenditure on social programmes has led toheightened internal tension and instability.Clearly  globalization and liberalization as conceptshave much to recommend them. Undoubtedly  they hold4the key to an economic future of equal opportunity for allcountries. But we are saying that they need to take intoaccount the unequal starting points of each country: thatsome are better prepared than others to take full advantageof the opportunities they offer and that many of us maywell lose any hope of catching up. We are seeing the verysovereignty of countries being eroded by the power ofmultinational companies. True economic power is beingheld in fewer and fewer hands  and the developingcountries are becoming further marginalized. Socialproblems increase as people lose jobs and capital andcurrency values are controlled elsewhere.The developing countries cannot wish awayglobalization  but we would wish it to adopt a more humanface  one that recognizes and makes allowances for thefundamental inequalities between the richer and the poorernations of the world and makes concessions to allow us theopportunity to take full advantage of its opportunities in duecourse.For our part in the Kingdom of Swaziland  we areaggressively pursuing political  economic  social andinstitutional reforms that will have a major impact on allaspects of national life  in accordance with the wishes andexpectations of the Swazi people themselves.This year  we launched the national developmentstrategy  a people-driven vision for the long term  providinga planning framework for government action priorities forthe next 25 years. The core aim of the strategy is to achievea sustainable increase in the standard of living of allSwazis  with particular emphasis on eliminating povertyfrom our society. Our priority is to create the conditions fora vibrant economy and to increase our capacity to provideour people with a high level of human development.This long-term blueprint has been used as the basis fortwo short- and medium-term programmes of action by theGovernment that are linked to timetables and are fullyaccountable for results.The economic and social reform agenda is aperformance management tool that identifies priority actionsand keeps government performance under close  publicscrutiny and the public sector management programmedesigned to improve service delivery and cost-effectivenessin the public sector. We believe that these initiatives  withthe wishes of the people at their heart  will provide us withthe right conditions in which to prosper and to achieve ourhuman development objectives.We have very much appreciated the support of theUnited Nations in formulating the strategy. The nationaldevelopment strategy should  from now on  form thepriority target for all development support from UnitedNations agencies. We would wish the same from theinternational development finance institutions. We sharethe concern of many fellow Member States in thedeveloping world that too often these institutions’ targetfor support is not in tune with the wishes of the countryinvolved and that the process of project design andapproval is painfully slow. We look forward to workingwith the United Nations Development Programme and theinternational finance institutions to design projects thatcoincide with the wishes of our own people  and withina time-frame that meets our expectations of speedyimplementation.In 1996  the Kingdom of Swaziland embarked on areview of its Constitution with the establishment of acommission that was tasked with collecting the views ofall Swazis on all aspects of the present Constitution. Wehave kept the General Assembly fully informed on theprogress of this commission each year  and I am delightedto report that the people’s recommendations on theConstitution will be presented to the nation at the end ofthis year. The process will then move forward to thedrafting of these recommendations into a formaldocument that will be confirmed by the peoplethemselves  before final ratification.Throughout the process of constitutional review  wehave been guided by the principle of involving all Swazisin the drafting of what will be the Kingdom’s definingdocument. Consultation with our people on all importantmatters is a principle that we have followed throughoutour history  and is one that has helped us to maintain thepeace and stability with which we have always beenblessed.I have spoken at length about the efforts we in theKingdom of Swaziland are making to improve the livesof our people. And yet  all our plans and all our goodintentions are meaningless in the face of the danger thatthreatens to overwhelm our nation. I am referring  ofcourse  to the HIV/AIDS crisis  which is already havinga severe impact on the lives of many Swazi families andwhich undermines all our hopes for a future of prosperityand security for all our people. We are facing up to thefact that the Kingdom of Swaziland has one of the highestrates of HIV infection in the world  and our hospitals andclinics are stretched to the limit of capacity as a result.We are making every effort to halt the spread of the5deadly disease. But it is an uphill struggle and involves usin bringing about a wholesale change in attitude and moralbehaviour.Our chief concern is to promote awareness of thedanger and of the preventive measures available. Ourresources are limited  and we need the continuing supportof the international community in our efforts to reverse thedownward trend. This appeal was repeatedly made at therecent Eleventh International Conference on AIDS andSTDs in Africa held in Lusaka. We therefore join otherMember States in a similar predicament in appealing to theUnited Nations to coordinate an international response tothe crisis. The very future of our nation  and that of manyothers  depends on those with the technical and financialresources joining forces with us to stem the deadly tide.In conclusion  I should like to take this opportunity toexpress the deep gratitude of Their Majesties  theGovernment and the whole Swazi nation  to the UnitedNations Development Programme and all its sister agencies for the many programmes of assistance undertaken in theKingdom of Swaziland since our independence.We believe that the United Nations  as the one trulyglobal development Organization  remains the only hope forovercoming the many complex challenges facing the worldtoday. Despite the setbacks and obstacles to achieving ourcollective aims  there can be no doubt that the world wouldbe a more troubled place without the combined efforts ofall of us here.The Kingdom of Swaziland therefore takes great pridein reaffirming its commitment to the principles and idealscontained in the United Nations Charter  and we askAlmighty God to watch over and guide us in thechallenging times ahead for our Organization."
"158",6658,"SYR",54,1999,"It gives me great pleasure to congratulate Mr.Gurirab on his election to the presidency of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-fourth session. I am confident thatthe struggle for freedom of his friendly country  Namibia and his wide-ranging knowledge of international issueswill facilitate his lofty task and will lead the deliberationsof the Assembly at this important session to a successfulconclusion.I should like to express my thanks to the ForeignMinister of Uruguay for his efforts and wise leadership ofour deliberations in the General Assembly during theprevious session. I should also like to express ourgratitude to the Secretary-General of our Organization Mr. Kofi Annan  for his attempts to uphold the principlesand purposes of the Charter of the United Nations.The Syrian Arab Republic welcomes the Republic ofKiribati  the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom ofTonga to the United Nations. We are confident that thepresence of these States in the international communitywill buttress the role of the United Nations and uphold itsprinciples.15Leaving the last century of the second millennium andentering the first century of the third millennium does notin itself mean the end of an era and the beginning of a newone in the life of humankind. States and peoples will takewith them into the next century their concerns  aspirations successes  failures  challenges and hopes. They willcontinue as usual to follow their economic  educational political and social development plans and programmes knowing that the end of the twentieth century will notautomatically mean an end to current regional conflicts.Neither will it automatically raise levels of development orrid developing countries of the debt burdens under whichthey are languishing.If the advocates of market theories and globalization and their political leaders  were to recognize that at presentthe poor are becoming poorer while the rich become richerand that the gap between developing and developedcountries is becoming wider in every area — whether in theeconomic  commercial  technical  health or environmentalspheres — an element of pessimism would  unfortunately mar the feeling of optimism with which we hope towelcome the dawn of the twenty-first century.Optimism about the future is desirable because itprevents humanity  both at individual and society levels from falling into the trap of despair and frustration.Optimism is also justified because progress in research science and knowledge shrinks distances  eliminatesobstacles and opens doors and minds in the South as wellas in the North. Given that fact  it is natural that people'sunderstanding of each other's problems and concerns shouldincrease and that ultimately a common awareness willdevelop to enable everyone to face the threats andchallenges that await humankind everywhere on this planet.Like poisonous waste from industrial development  theepidemics resulting from underdevelopment and povertyknow no borders or obstacles. Drugs would not have spreadin some States in the South had it not been for the manytraffickers and users in the countries of the North. Neithershould we forget that the pollution of the environment inthe countries of the North is primarily the result ofindustrial production of all kinds  both sophisticated andbasic  at a time when environmental pollution in thecountries of the South is primarily the result of the lack ofa minimum of small  basic industries capable of makingproducts to deal with environmental pollution or ofemploying the means to do so.In this context  we should like to reaffirm our beliefthat weakening the economies of the developing countriesdoes not necessarily serve the interests of the economiesof developed countries  because it weakens the purchasingpower of the former  which  in turn  negatively affects therates of economic development of the latter. The financialcrisis that affected the economies of the countries ofSouth-East Asia two years ago reflected that mutual effectwhen its repercussions reached Brazil and even someother countries in South America. There must  therefore be a constructive dialogue between developing anddeveloped countries  a dialogue based on commoninterests  genuine interrelations and mutual responsibilitiesaimed at ensuring sustainable development and socialjustice.We hope that there will be an end to the contrarietyby which the industrial countries demand that developingcountries open their markets and borders to their productswhile the developing countries are finding it difficult toexport their goods because of protectionist measures andobstacles  including the prevention of the transfer oftechnology and the refusal to allow developing countriesto integrate such technology into their industrialprocesses.If we were to look back at the ethnic and religiouswars and conflicts that spread with the end of the coldwar and that reached the heart of Africa  Asia and evenEurope  we would find it difficult to imagine theirrepercussions being confined within closed borders.Through succeeding waves of migration  various religionsand ethnic groups have become part of the social fabricof most societies in the world  especially in Westerncountries. The tragedy of such wars and conflicts istherefore a source of concern for most countries of theworld  particularly the United States of America  whichhas the largest number of ethnic and religious groups ofany country in recent history. That fact explains theinterest the United States takes in regional conflicts particularly those in the Middle East  which haverepercussions at the domestic level in the United States.Such American interest is commensurate with the variedimpact of these conflicts  although one should notdisregard the other economic and strategic interests.The impact of impressive scientific and technologicaladvances in communications and in the flow ofinformation on such events will not be limited to amomentary pinprick of conscience when we see them onour television screens. It could well go beyond this in thefuture  resulting in concrete action by large groups and16could in turn threaten the stability and sovereignty ofStates  especially those whose populations encompass manyethnic groups and religions.It is regrettable that these grave challenges andphenomena will be carried over into the next century perhaps for years or even decades  without a remedy. Weare convinced that the best framework for facing up tothese challenges and phenomena in a serious and effectivemanner is a United Nations truly respected by all itsMember States  one based on collective action by the Statesof the North and of the South  all according to their ownpotential and capacities.Marginalizing the role of the United Nations  using itonly on selected occasions and as a cover for initiatives anddecisions adopted outside the Security Council  will servethe interests of no one. The problems and challenges facingmankind are truly grave and dangerous both quantitativelyand qualitatively. We believe that no one State  howeverpowerful and wise it is  can meet these universal problemsand challenges alone  much less find lasting  solid solutionsto them.Clearly  many are dissatisfied with the use ofhumanitarian pretexts to launch military intervention outsidethe framework of the Security Council. It began with theintervention in Somalia in 1992  whose repercussionsincluded the collapse of all State institutions and thecarving up of the capital  Mogadishu  among fightingwarlords. This trend continued with the intervention inKosovo  where the fate of the people remains in thebalance  although the intervention succeeded in supplyingthe people with medicine and food.But here it must be said that illegitimate interventionoutside the framework of the Security Council is not as badas completely ignoring dangerous and bloody crises such asthose beyond what might be called the line of death andhunger: a line stretching from the Horn of Africa  in theeast  to Angola  in the west  and then to Rwanda  Burundiand the Congo. Many suffering Africans who live alongthis bleeding line and who lack the most basic necessitiesmay well envy the inhabitants of Kosovo  who at least hadfood and medicine during their ordeal.Since the end of the cold war hopes have been pinnedon the reform of the United Nations and on an increase inthe membership of the Security Council with a view toachieving a more democratic and fairer representation inthis international organization. The Non-Aligned Movementhas been enthusiastic about this issue and has given itserious consideration at all its conferences. Its memberStates know full well that they lack influence in theSecurity Council commensurate with their numbers andreflecting their legitimate concerns. At the same time Germany and Japan  following major internationaltransformations  have become aware of how important itis for them to become permanent members of the SecurityCouncil. Here Italy has played an important role inseeking a third way between the North and the South. Nosolution has yet emerged that could attract consensus onthe subject among members of the United Nations.The unavoidable question for us all is what has sofar been achieved in the process of reforming the SecurityCouncil and promoting its role and status. The answer isnothing  except for the marginalization of the role andstatus of the Security Council and the extension of itsactivities beyond the primary responsibility formaintaining international peace and security  both whenevents have required it and  at times  when they have not.It seems that the premeditated marginalization of the roleof the Security Council and the fact that the reformprocess has been almost dormant are being used by someas a pretext for ignoring the Charter and violating thesovereignty of States through the use of regional militaryorganizations as a substitute for the Security Council.The world today cannot endure a nuclear arms racethat threatens the security and the very survival ofmankind  particularly in the absence of a just and stableinternational order. There will be no successful non-proliferation regime without achieving universality for theTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons(NPT). Syria  the other Arab States and most countries ofthe world have appealed to the five nuclear States  in thelight of the 1995 extension of the NPT  not to excludeany State from acceding to the Treaty  so that the worldmay be spared another nuclear arms race. A new nucleararms race has actually taken place in South Asia since theextension of the Treaty. In the Middle East  Israel remainsthe only State in the region that refuses to accede to theTreaty and to submit all its nuclear installations to thesafeguards system of the International Atomic EnergyAgency (IAEA). As the time for the next review of theNPT approaches  Syria renews its call for transformingthe Middle East into a nuclear-weapon-free zone underUnited Nations auspices  as a serious contribution to thecreation of a propitious climate for the regional peace security and stability to which we all aspire.The international community looked to the peaceprocess that began at Madrid in 1991 as the most17important  most serious initiative for ending a conflict thathas been raging for decades  one that has bled the hugeeconomic and human energies of the peoples of the region.The Madrid framework  the guarantees offered by theUnited States  the results reached based on relevant SecurityCouncil resolutions  the principle of land for peace  allconstituted obligations and commitments accepted by allparties concerned. None of these can now be called intoquestion or circumvented. They all have been dulydeposited with the United States Administration  with theagreement of the parties concerned. Hence Syria's call toreaffirm that trust  including complete Israeli withdrawal tothe lines of 4 June 1967  and resumption of peace talkswith Israel from the point at which they were suspended inorder to address pending matters until both sides agree onfull peace.What Syria is calling for cannot be considered a“precondition”  as the Israeli government claims: if we wereto accept that it was  as the Netanyahu Government alsoclaimed  we would have to conclude that any agreementbetween negotiators on any single component of any apeace accord would always be considered a “precondition”if any move were made to conclude any other componentof a peace accord. And that would invariably takenegotiations  back to square one after each step forward endlessly back and forth.Also  we draw the Assembly's attention to the falsityof the Israeli claim that Syria wants to get a particularresult in the negotiations before they have even started.Needless to say  trust in the United States of America doesnot  by itself  constitute a peace agreement; rather  it is afundamental part of an agreement whose remainingelements — normal  peaceful relations and securityarrangements based on the purposes and principles laiddown under United States auspices and with itsparticipation — still need to be fleshed out.So we were not surprised  yesterday  by the address ofthe Foreign Minister of Israel before this Assembly  when— under the flag of peace education — he requestedleaders and teachers to stress to their peoples and studentsthe importance of peace  totally ignoring the fact that theIsraeli occupation is a major reason for the absence ofpeace in the region.Peace education requires first and foremost an end toIsrael's occupation of Arab territories. Specifically  it mustwithdraw from the Golan Heights to the 4 June 1967 line;from south Lebanon; from the western Bekaa  and alsofrom Jerusalem  the city of peace. Settlement activities inthe occupied territories and the destruction of Arab housesmust stop. Last but not least  Israeli words about peacemust be translated into deeds  so that students in Israel donot think that peace education means continuedoccupation by force of other peoples' lands.During the past few weeks  major efforts have beenmade by the United States of America  and by theEuropean Union  the Russian Federation and othercountries. We hope that these efforts will continue untilIsrael realizes how fair Syria's position is and how readySyria is to resume negotiations at the point where theyleft off. Let us not waste long and arduous years ofnegotiations: Syria is eager not to miss this opportunity toachieve peace; if it is missed  then Israel alone shouldtake the blame.Syria reaffirms once more its great concern for theunity and territorial integrity of Iraq and calls for an endto the suffering of the fraternal Iraqi people. It calls foreconomic sanctions to be lifted  in accordance with therelevant Security Council resolutions. It also calls for noaction or measure to be taken outside the United Nationscontext. At the same time  we ask Iraq to implement theremaining Security Council resolutions in a manner thatguarantees a just solution to the problem of Kuwaitiprisoners of war and other detainees.Syria also calls on the Security Council to put animmediate and final end to the sanctions against Libya  asLibya has honoured all its obligations under SecurityCouncil resolutions. We would emphasize that we fullysupport the Libyan requests for the sanctions to be ended.In the light of the fraternal relations which Syriamaintains with the United Arab Emirates and the IslamicRepublic of Iran  we call on these two neighbouringcountries to hold talks to find a peaceful solution to thedispute over three islands in the Gulf.The continuing tragic situation in Afghanistan is asource of great concern to us. We are convinced that theAfghan problem can be solved only if the fighting ceasesand negotiations are begun on achieving nationalreconciliation and finding an acceptable and lastingpolitical settlement that results in security and stability forour friends the Afghan people.Syria expresses its full support for all measures toensure peace  security and stability on the Koreanpeninsula. It expresses its support also for the aspirationsof the Korean people for national unity achieved bypeaceful means and free of foreign intervention.18Syria once again highlights the need to take allnecessary steps  at the earliest possible moment  to end theeconomic  trade and financial embargo on Cuba imposed bythe United States of America for almost four decades. Wesupport Cuba's call for differences between the twocountries to be resolved through dialogue and on a basis ofequality  mutual respect and good- neighbourly relations.As we bid farewell to the twentieth century  thehuman race is still yearning for a world free of war injustice  ignorance and poverty  a world governed byinternational relations based on cooperation  mutual respect greater justice and true equity. Those are the yearningswhich the peoples of the world hope to see realized nextcentury  so that coming generations are guaranteed a betterlife and a more prosperous and humane future."
"159",6703,"TCD",54,1999,"On behalf ofthe Chad delegation  and on my own behalf  I would liketo extend warm congratulations to you  Mr. President  onyour election to the presidency of the General Assemblyat its fifty-fourth session. This is both a tribute to yourcountry  Namibia  for its contribution in defending theideals of our Organization and a recognition of yourconsiderable ability. The delegation of Chad is firmlyconvinced that your experience  talents and wisdom willcontribute to the success of our deliberations. We assureyou of our full support and cooperation in theaccomplishment of your noble mission.I would also like to express our gratitude to yourpredecessor  Mr. Didier Opertti of Uruguay  who tactfullyand adroitly led the work of the fifty-third session.Allow me also to praise the merits of our Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for the foresight  wisdom and above all  patience with which he is guiding theOrganization  as well as for his sustained efforts inseeking international peace and security  despite all kindsof difficulties and the immensity of his tasks.In a few months we will enter the third millennium a millennium filled with uncertainties  fears andunknowns  but also one of hope. That millennium will becharacterized by globalization and  above all  thedomination of human intelligence over nature. It will bean era of communications in which our planet will shrinkto a tiny area. It will also mean the disappearance ofbarriers to the circulation of ideas  knowledge  culture andscience. But it will also be an era of competition andcomplementarity.During this century  the aspirations of most peopleswas to be fed  clothed  cared for  educated  trained housed and gainfully employed. It is legitimate to hopethat with the arrival of the coming century these essential basic human needs will be met  so that we can avoid afurther widening of the gap between wealthy and poorcountries.On the eve of the third millennium  we mustacknowledge that the lofty objectives of the UnitedNations  primarily the maintenance of international peaceand security and the reduction of poverty among MemberStates  are far from being attained  although we have beenfocusing on them for half a century.How can we not ask ourselves these kinds ofquestions at this great annual gathering  where the scopeand urgency of political and economic problems are madeso clear? It is time to contemplate solutions that include21new kinds of relationships  based on solidarity andpartnership  that go beyond the traditional relations ofcooperation  which have proved their limitations.Turning more specifically to Chad  our major concernis to create conditions of peace and security through a fullyparticipatory political process that involves the variouspolitical parties in the management of public affairs and inthe national reconciliation policy for all the people of Chad.The involvement in this approach of all segments of societyhas enabled our country to restore political stability andcivil peace and to establish constitutional and democraticinstitutions.We are firmly convinced that a democracy can beeffective only when it is based on certain republicanconcepts  primarily justice  the primacy of human rights andthe participation of local communities in the managementof their own affairs. The recent establishment of theSupreme Court and the Constitutional Council speak to thismajor concern  as does that of the National Commission onHuman Rights  in operation since 1994. These efforts wereacknowledged and led the United Nations Commission onHuman Rights last April to end its consideration of thehuman rights situation in Chad and consequently removeour country from the confidential procedural situation it hadbeen in since March 1991.Finally  our Government has undertaken adecentralization policy aimed at implementing the choicemade by the people of Chad  as reflected in theConstitution of 11 April 1996  through the establishment ofdecentralized territorial communities and the gradualtransfer of authority.In an effort to consolidate peace and reinforce socialcohesion  the Government of Chad has focused on twoquestions: the army and anti-personnel mines. With respectto the thorny problems relating to the army and security our Government has undertaken to ensure professionaltraining for demobilized former combatants in order toredeploy them to new jobs  to provide them support indeveloping income-generating skills and to see to it thattheir basic needs are met.With respect to security issues  we have set up ademining programme that should contribute to increasingthe safety of the national territory  where approximately amillion mines and an indeterminate amount of ammunitionof all calibres remain buried  thereby helping to open upChad  especially the northern part of the country. Thepresence of these dangerous devices seriously impedes themovement of goods and people and hence thedevelopment of the regions concerned.In this regard  my country has signed and ratified theOttawa Convention and has set up national structuressupervised by the National High Commissioner forDemining in order effectively to combat these lethaldevices. The objectives of that programme focus  interalia  on reducing the number of victims  making the mainroads safer  promoting economic and social developmentand facilitating the return of displaced persons.The implementation of this ambitious deminingprogramme  whose dimensions extend beyond the bordersof our country  cannot be done without the assistance ofour partners and friends. That is why we wish to appealonce again from this lofty rostrum to the solidarity ofMember States of our Organization and to ask them toprovide us with assistance and cooperation.On the eve of the twenty-first century  the welfare ofthe country's citizens remains the motivating force forgovernmental action in Chad. That action is based on theambitious reforms undertaken since 1995 and focusesprimarily on a modern and dynamic economy. In point offact  following devaluation in 1994  Chad rejoined theBretton Woods institutions and on 23 April 1995 adopteda structural adjustment programme for the medium term with resources provided by the International MonetaryFund in the framework of its Enhanced StructuralAdjustment Facility and by the World Bank in terms ofstructural-adjustment credit  and with financial assistancefrom our usual partners — France  the European Unionand the African Development Bank. Bold reforms havebeen undertaken that focus primarily on stabilizing publicfinance  correcting external imbalances and ensuringsustainable growth. To this end we instituted an effectivepolicy to combat poverty.Our Government has drafted and adopted a newsustainable development programme focusing on threemajor challenges: economic and financial  social  andpolitical and institutional. The goal is to create a climateof social stability through sustained structural reform andthrough fiscal  monetary and budgetary policies that willcontribute to a macro-economic consolidation and tocontrolling inflation.This fight against poverty focuses on four strategicpriority elements in the areas of health  education infrastructure and rural development. In this undertakingwe have received support from the international22community at the fourth round table on Chad  held inGeneva on 21 and 22 October 1998  where some $1.12billion was pledged.In this regard  I wish to express our deepest gratitudeto friendly countries and international financialorganizations and institutions for their strong response toour appeal for international solidarity. The people of Chadwill never forget those commendable efforts. Following thatround table  we organized two sectoral meetings  on healthand on rural development. Meetings on infrastructure andeducation will take place in the near future. We reiterateour appeal to all interested parties to participate actively inthese meetings  which will be held in N'Djamena inNovember and December 1999  respectively.One cannot speak of Chad's economy today withoutreferring to the question of the exploitation of its oilresources. This is a key political  diplomatic and socio-economic issue that has fueled heated discussions bothinside and outside the country. In addition to its undeniableeconomic importance  this project will contributesignificantly to subregional integration because it establishesa partnership between two brotherly countries  namelyCameroon and Chad.In this respect  we have taken into account thedevelopment difficulties that Chad is facing  and we areconsidering our future in terms of petroleum-related issueswith a great deal of caution. The Government and theParliament of Chad have already set up management anddistribution mechanisms for the anticipated oil income. Forthe first time ever in the history of the exploitation of oildeposits  legislation has been enacted to guaranteetransparency in the management of oil revenue and also toset aside some of that income for territorial communities inthe oil-producing regions and for future generations. The oilactivity is an exceptional opportunity  which shouldcontribute to the gradual rebalancing of our budget and giveus room for manoeuvre to establish a true policy fordevelopment. This project has rightly raised hopesthroughout the country.We are all firmly convinced that new efforts and manysacrifices are required to ensure the gradual implementationof the purposes and principles enshrined in the UnitedNations Charter as they relate to disputes between aconsiderable number of Member States as well as to otherequally challenging evils that continue to trouble the humanconscience. How can we remain indifferent whenconfronted with the scourges of poverty  illiteracy  foreignaggression  conflict  various pandemics and transnationalproblems associated with the degradation of theenvironment and drug trafficking? Unfortunately  thesechallenges will further increase with globalization  whichis now inevitable. Africa is the continent that has beenmost exposed to those evils  and the growing number ofcrises is causing our efforts to be spread too thinly andreducing the meagre resources available and dividing ourcountries.The interdependence of peace and socio-economicdevelopment needs no further proof  especially in Chad which has experienced the torments of war  its disastrouseffects on the population and its repercussions on socialand economic life. Out of a sense of duty andinternational obligation  my country has made and willcontinue to make enormous sacrifices for other Africancountries that have fallen victim to the problems inherentin coexistence. That is why we have participated invarious peacekeeping operations in the subregion ofCentral Africa. In this context  I am pleased to recallOperation Turquoise  in which Chad participated to savelives in Rwanda. Chad also contributed to the Inter-African Mission to Monitor the Implementation of theBangui Agreements and the United Nations Mission inthe Central African Republic  which sought a negotiatedsolution between the Government of the Central AfricanRepublic and a part of the rebel army  and which resultedin bringing together different viewpoints opinions andestablishing conditions required for the organization ofmulti-party elections.In that same spirit  my country intervened in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo. Our involvement together with that of other countries  enabled the situationto be stabilized and promoted dialogue between thewarring parties. With the signing of the Syrte accords on18 April 1999  Chad withdrew its troops from theDemocratic Republic of the Congo. The signing of theLusaka ceasefire agreement by all the parties in conflicthas opened up new prospects for that brotherly people.Chad hopes that that agreement  which the SecurityCouncil has endorsed  will lead to a definitive peace inthat country and the entire Great Lakes region. Chad willsupport that process.The tragedy in the Democratic Republic of theCongo has not made us lose sight of the situation in theRepublic of the Congo  which was recently on the vergeof breaking up. Now passion seems to be giving way toreason. We welcome the will shown by both theGovernment of Congo and the opposition parties  whohave taken the wise decision to negotiate to restore peace23to their country. Chad welcomes and encourages thispositive development.To this rather sombre picture we must add the fragilesituation in Angola  where the civil war has resumedthroughout the national territory. This is of great concernfor all of Africa  particularly since the resumption ofhostilities will undoubtedly mean the failure of theconsiderable efforts made on all sides to bring peace to thatcountry  which has been ravaged by a long war  thusprolonging the suffering of the Angolan people. We appealto the Security Council to assist in restoring peace to thatwounded country.We welcome the tireless efforts of the EconomicCommunity of West African States to bring peace andsecurity to West Africa. Those efforts have led to thesigning of the ceasefire agreements in Sierra Leone andGuinea-Bissau. All the parties involved in those crisesshould show restraint and work towards reconciliation inthe higher interests of their peoples.With regard to the Horn of Africa  we note that therehas been no obvious progress in the willingness of theparties involved in the conflict in Somalia to find a politicalsolution leading to national unity. While we welcome theefforts of Mr. Hosni Mubarak aimed at a negotiatedresolution of the crisis  we also appeal to the Somali leadersto assist in restoring peace to their country. We regret theresumption of hostilities between the Ethiopians andEritreans  which has led to a considerable loss of life andmaterial damage. We urge all those who have mediatedbetween the warring parties to persevere so as to put an endto those hostilities  which have further exacerbated analready disturbing situation.Closer to home  Chad welcomes the decision of theSecurity Council to suspend the embargo against the GreatSocialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. We urge that thesanctions be lifted once and for all; they have seriouslydamaged the interests of the brotherly people of thatneighbouring country.Of all the continents  Africa seems to have sufferedthe most from the economic crisis and from wars and otherconflict situations. But we have not forgotten the majorproblems that other peoples are facing.With regard to the situation in the Middle East  it hasalready been established that the question of Palestine is atthe heart of the conflict. Its resolution lies in theimplementation of the Oslo accords and  in particular  infull respect by all the parties for United Nationsresolutions. The credibility of the Security Council is atstake. With the arrival of a new Israeli Government  thereis new hope for the future. Chad encourages all theparties to work together in the same direction.Elsewhere  the effects of the conflicts between Iraqand Kuwait and between Iraq and Iran persist  hamperingthe final return to peace. We appeal to the sense ofresponsibility of the former warring parties to worktirelessly to restore full peace.In the Balkans  Chad encourages the efforts of theinternational community to restore peace to the region and in particular to Kosovo. As for East Timor  we urgeall the parties involved to complete the process begununder the auspices of the United Nations so as to end thesuffering of the people there.In Asia  Chad is concerned about the fate of theRepublic of China on Taiwan and its 22 millioninhabitants. The Republic of China on Taiwan  whichplays a major role in world trade  is a peace-lovingcountry that fulfils the obligations in the United NationsCharter  as it has shown on many occasions. Chadsupports the admission of the Republic of China onTaiwan to the United Nations as a means of correcting aninjustice.It is well known that a number of conflicts stemfrom the unbridled arms race. In this regard  thecirculation  proliferation of and illicit trafficking in smallarms in Africa is of concern to us  particularly since thisphenomenon  the result of the end of the cold war andnumerous conflicts in the continent  has taken a disturbingturn. If appropriate solutions are not found soon  peace security and stability in our countries will be constantlythreatened.To address this situation  a conference on small armsand drug trafficking will take place in Chad under theauspices of the United Nations Standing AdvisoryCommittee on Security Questions in Central Africa; itwill be followed immediately by the twelfth ministerialmeeting of that Committee. Those two important meetingswill be held at Ndjamena from 25 to 30 October 1999.Chad is honoured to act as host to the Committee andwill do everything in its power to ensure the success ofits work.The United Nations was founded in a historicalcontext with which we are all familiar. It has been and24remains a place for bringing people and ideas closertogether  and its very existence has helped avert more thanone catastrophe. But the international political andeconomic environment has changed  and the great rivalry ofthe cold war has disappeared  giving way to an internationalsystem that is still finding itself. We now see an increaseddesire by Member States to participate in the managementof international affairs in addition to the management oftheir own. United Nations structures must therefore beadapted to the new scope of today’s problems  whichrequires an equal sharing of international responsibilities;these must no longer be the monopoly of a few States however powerful they may be.To respond to these concerns  the Security Councilmust be reformed. Here  Chad wholeheartedly supports theposition of the Organization of African Unity that  interalia  there must be equitable and legitimate representationon the Security Council for the African continent.With respect to the global economy and world trade appropriate steps must be taken to ensure that the all Stateswill share equally in the benefits of globalization.Globalization of the economy certainly can have theadvantage of eliminating all discriminatory and unfairpractices in world trade  but it must be recognized that thelack of competitive power of the economies of the countriesof the South does not enable them to benefit fully fromthis. Moreover  the unbridled liberalization of markets andthe lack of measures to consolidate certain gains areweakening their economies and marginalizing them in theworld arena.Similarly  the indebtedness of those countries placesa heavy burden on their meagre budgetary resources  andwipes out all their development efforts. I welcome therecent decision taken by the Group of Seven at its summitheld at Cologne  Germany  to ease the debt of heavilyindebted poor countries. Such initiatives are praiseworthy but they remain insufficient. Chad urges the wealthycountries to make a greater effort to enable poor countriesfinally to address the external-debt burden  which is a trueobstacle to economic and social development."
"160",6749,"TGO",54,1999,"I am pleasedto join those who spoke before me in expressing mywarmest congratulations to the President on his election tolead this fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly. Thischoice reflects the great esteem in which the internationalcommunity holds his country  Namibia  as well as being atribute to his past as a freedom fighter and to his qualitiesas a statesman. I assure him of the wholehearted support ofmy delegation as he carries out his duties.I would also like to extend my most sincerecongratulations to President Gurirab’s predecessor His Excellency Mr. Didier Opertti  Minister for ForeignAffairs of Uruguay  for the skill with which he conductedthe work of the fifty-third session of the Assembly.To Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan I would like to express the utmost appreciation of theGovernment of Togo for the perspicacity and tenacity hehas shown in seeking solutions to the many problems facingthe Organization.Finally  I would like to take advantage of thisopportunity to warmly congratulate the Republic of Kiribati the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga on theiradmission into this great family  the United Nations.We have met once again this year to take stock ofactions carried out in pursuit of our common objectivesand to coordinate our views on what actions to take inorder to address today’s challenges. Given the currentstate of the world  we must acknowledge that  despite thesignificant progress that has been made  the world is stillmarked  unfortunately  by instability  raging wars andtensions that are most often due to widespread povertyand to the uneven distribution of resources  as well as tothe legitimate aspiration of peoples for greater freedom justice and well-being.Indeed  at a time when mankind is getting ready toembark on the third millennium  our world offers one ofthe bleakest pictures in its history from an economic andsocial point of view. All kinds of problems linked tounderdevelopment  poverty and inequalities betweendeveloped and disadvantaged countries — problems longdenounced in this and other forums — have worsened inrecent years as a result of the globalization of theeconomy. Although developed countries have benefitedfrom this phenomenon  especially in the areas of tradeand investment  developing countries are suffering thenegative impact of globalization on their economies which have already been rendered fragile by theirunbearable debt burden  the plummeting of prices for rawmaterials and the steady decline in official developmentassistance.As regards the external-debt problem in particular we can never stress enough how the accumulation of thisdebt hampers development efforts. The awareness of theextent of this problem and of its impact on developmentis such that the most industrialized countries and theBretton Woods institutions and those of the UnitedNations system now acknowledge that most of thedeveloping countries’ debt can never be repaid. They alsoacknowledge quite openly that the debt burden is themajor obstacle to the development of poor countries andthat the mechanisms that have been established to resolvethe debt crisis have not been very effective.Within this context we can only welcome thecommitment of the G-8 summit  held last June inCologne  to cancel a portion of the debt of world’spoorest countries. My delegation encourages theinternational community to continue to take bold stepsaimed at resolving the debt problem in an effective andlasting manner. These steps might include the cancellationof all of the bilateral debt of the poorest countries  asignificant reduction of the debt burden of middle-incomeand low-income countries  and increasing the flexibility20of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative soas to make its benefits more generally available. However we should point out that the implementation of suchmeasures should not be carried out to the detriment ofofficial development assistance  which  unfortunately continues to decline.As regards trade  it is generally acknowledged that theexpansion of international trade is a true engine for growthand development. We would like to see the internationalcommunity take appropriate measures to integratedeveloping countries into the international-trade regime through increasing access for their exports to the marketsof developed countries  by supporting the diversificationand strengthening of developing countries’ productioncapacities  and by improving terms of trade.We sincerely hope that the forthcoming negotiationsat the World Trade Organization  the tenth United NationsConference on Trade and Development and between theEuropean Union and the African  Caribbean and Pacificcountries will take into account the interests of the weakestpartners.In recent years  many initiatives have been taken onthe bilateral and multilateral levels to try to address thechallenges faced by the African continent. In this respect I would cite the United States initiative for a Partnershipfor Economic Growth and Opportunity in Africa and theTokyo International Conferences on African Development.While this may be satisfying  there is still reason  in thename of efficiency  to call for some degree of coordinationbetween these initiatives and those of the United Nationssystem.Efforts to promote development and eradicate povertyin Africa cannot be dissociated from our daily struggle tosafeguard peace and security. For our countries again thisyear  preserving and consolidating a climate of peace andstability have been the major imperative  given the manyreal dangers.Thus  the Government of Togo  traditionally inclinedto search for peace and stability  has spared no effort to tryto reconcile points of view whenever discord arises convinced that dialogue and cooperation should beemphasized in the settlement of disputes and that anyconflict that may arise in any country of a subregionrepresents a tragedy for the entire subregion  and perhapsAfrica as a whole.Inspired by the spirit of subregional solidarity that under the President of our Republic  Mr. GnassingbéEyadéma  current Chairman of the Authority of Heads ofState and Government of the Economic Community ofWest African States (ECOWAS)  we have carried outactions and taken appropriate initiatives to find negotiatedsolutions to the crisis in Guinea-Bissau  the conflict inSierra Leone and the border dispute between Guinea andLiberia.Following the crisis that erupted in Guinea-Bissau inJune 1998  the efforts of the ECOWAS and theCommunity of Portuguese-Speaking Countries led to thesigning of a ceasefire and a peace Agreement inNovember 1998. The subsequent deployment of anECOWAS Monitoring Group contingent with woefullyinadequate means did not allow us effectively toimplement the provisions of the Abuja Agreement and theLomé Protocol  nor did it entirely allay tensions. Despitethe brutal upheaval of the peace process on 7 May 1999 the Security Council ratified the Secretary-General’sproposal to maintain the United Nations office in Guinea-Bissau with a new mandate. We hope that theOrganization and the international community willcontinue to provide the necessary assistance to the peopleof Guinea-Bissau  who so desperately need it. Wewelcome the commitments undertaken that will ensurerespect for the elections of November 1997. We expectthat tranquility and security will return to Guinea-Bissau.In Sierra Leone  thanks to the initiative anddetermination of the ECOWAS heads of State and to thesupport of the international community  the Governmentof Sierra Leone and the Revolutionary United Frontsigned  in our capital city of Lomé on 7 July 1999  aPeace Agreement whose implementation will  we hope allow the people of Sierra Leone to embark decisively onthe path of national reconciliation  stability andreconstruction. Thus  as I pointed out yesterdaybefore the Security Council in the context of the opendebate on the situation in Africa  the restoration is closelylinked to the implementation of the Lomé PeaceAgreement.That is why I am pleased by the Secretary-General’sproposal in his latest report on Sierra Leone to create aUnited Nations force of 6 000 in that country  in keepingwith this Agreement. I am convinced that the SecurityCouncil  which has already begun to consider the matter will authorize as soon as possible the deployment of thatforce  which  in compliance with its mandate  will help21the Government of Sierra Leone to implement the stalleddisarmament  demobilization and reintegration programme.We also wish particularly to thank the Government ofthe United Kingdom  which chairs the international contactgroup on Sierra Leone; the international organizations andhumanitarian agencies; and all those who have variouslycontributed to restoring peace in that country. I recall thefine spirit of solidarity that was manifest during thenegotiations on the Lomé Peace Agreement  which allowedthe representatives of the United States of America  theUnited Kingdom  the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and theSecretary-General of the Organization of African Unity  aswell as the permanent representatives of the United Nationsand the Secretary-General’s Special Representative in SierraLeone to pool their efforts around the seven-memberECOWAS contact group  which worked tirelessly day andnight for success in Sierra Leone. That is why we feel thatthe decision to embark as soon as possible on thedisarmament  demobilization and reintegration programmewith the dispatch of 6 000 United Nations blue helmetswould put an end to this war.As for Liberia  the Ad Hoc Committee of theMinisters for Foreign Affairs of ECOWAS met on 26August 1999 in Lomé to study the destabilization of thatbrotherly country. My delegation makes an urgent appeal tothe parties involved to respect the relevant provisions of theECOWAS Treaty and the non-aggression protocol signed inLagos on 22 April 1998 in order to allow the immediaterestoration of a climate of peace  security and confidence inthe subregion. In this respect  we were pleased by therecent signing in Abuja  on 16 September  of theunderstanding between the heads of State of Guinea andLiberia during the ECOWAS mini-summit  held in thecapital of Nigeria. We also appeal to the internationalcommunity to provide the necessary support to countries ofthe subregion that have borne the burden of refugees Guinea-Bissau in particular  so that they may address thatproblem.Elsewhere  the perpetuation of armed conflicts  withtheir humanitarian consequences of all kinds  deeplyconcerns my delegation. In this respect  we welcome thesigning in Lusaka on 12 July of the Ceasefire Agreementbetween the main parties to the conflict in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo and ardently call for a strongercommitment of the Security Council to assist the SouthernAfrican Development Community countries.In Angola  we hope that the joint efforts of the UnitedNations and the Organization of African Unity will allowthe people of that country to achieve reconciliation andwill encourage the restoration of peace and stability inthat country. In any case  Togo is determined to apply thedecisions of our United Nations with respect to the stepstaken against the belligerent parties in Angola.As to the border dispute between Ethiopia andEritrea  my delegation sincerely hopes that these twobrotherly countries will truly embark on the path towardsa peaceful solution of their dispute.It is comforting to note that real progress has beenmade with regard to the crisis stemming from theLockerbie affair after many years of procrastination whichpenalized the fraternal people of the Libyan ArabJamahiriya. The Government of Togo believes that inplacing the two Lockerbie bombing suspects at thedisposal of the United Nations  Libya has met itsobligations under Security Council resolutions and thatthe Security Council must immediately lift the sanctionsimposed on that country. This will contribute to endingthe suffering of our Libyan brothers  which has lasted toolong.With regard to the Middle East  we reaffirm ourstrong conviction that an era of lasting peace  stability andsecurity for all can come about only through thecontinuation of the peace process and the most resolutepolitical will on all sides  based on Security Councilresolutions 242 (1967)  338 (1973) and 425 (1978) andthe principle of “land for peace”. In this context  theGovernment of Togo welcomes developments in thatregion  through steps recently taken by President YasserArafat and Prime Minister Ehud Barak. We urge theparties concerned to continue to work tirelessly to findways and means to allow the harmonious continuation ofthe peace process.One of the most important events that will havemost deeply marked this fading century is undeniably theend of the cold war. Among other things  it resulted inaverting the spectre of a nuclear holocaust; at least  wehope so.Deeply attached to the principle of general andcomplete disarmament under effective internationalcontrol  Togo is still concerned about nucleardisarmament and the elimination of other weapons ofmass destruction. This is why we appeal for continuedefforts to put an end to the proliferation of nuclear armsand the threats they entail.22The same applies to proliferation of and illicittrafficking in light weapons and small arms in Africa. Mycountry welcomes United Nations initiatives to curtail andcontain this phenomenon  and hopes that the internationalconference decided upon by the General Assembly inresolution 53/77 E of 4 December 1998  and scheduled totake place in Geneva in 2001  will make it possible to findeffective solutions to this problem.I would also like to stress the role played in thiscontext by the United Nations Regional Centre for Peaceand Disarmament in Africa  which organized in Lomé  from2 to 4 August 1999  a workshop on illicit trafficking inlight weapons. I am pleased to take this opportunity to paya well deserved tribute to the Secretary-General of ourOrganization  who has just provided this Centre with aDirector  whose main task it is to revitalize its activities andmobilize the necessary funds to finance its operationalexpenses. Because of its important role in implementing theProgramme for Coordination and Assistance for Securityand Development  as well as in the destruction of armscollected during the peace process in Liberia  we feel thatsupport for its work is urgently needed. In this connection we thank the Italian  Japanese  Norwegian and SwedishGovernments for their generous voluntary contributions andreiterate our appeal to the international community toprovide financial and logistical support.I turn to the functioning of our Organization. Here Istress the fundamental role of the Security Council inmaintaining international peace and security. My delegationreaffirms its support for all reforms to strengthen theeffectiveness of the Council and provide representation forAfrica  in the form of a permanent Member  in keepingwith the will of the heads of State and Government of theOrganization of African Unity.Throughout its long history  my country has neverstrayed from the purposes of our Organization. We haveoften expressed and shown our dedication to the ideals ofpeace and justice  as well as the principles of democracyand the protection of human rights. Going beyond the socialand political crises that we have known in recent years  thepeople of Togo are resolutely engaged in a new process ofnational understanding and harmony  something I wish toemphasize. On 19 July 1999  on the initiative of GeneralEyadema  President of the Republic  an internal dialoguebringing together all of the political actors of the countrywas organized following preliminary meetings held at Parisand Lomé between March and June 1999.The opportunity was given to representatives of thepresidential leadership and of the Togolese opposition tofreely express themselves on the major issues of politicallife in our country  under the arbitration of internationalfacilitators. In this regard  I would like to renew ourdeepest gratitude to France  the Federal Republic ofGermany  the European Union and the InternationalOrganization of La Francophonie for the important rolethey played during these negotiations  which led to thesigning of a framework agreement on 29 July 1999. Forthe implementation of the agreement  the Government hasshown itself ready to make all necessary concessions thatare in the national interest  it being understood thatnational reconciliation is vital to the continuation of theprocess of democratization and the consolidation of therule of law in Togo  as elsewhere.We are sure that reason and the national interest willprevail  so that the hopes of the people of Togo and theinternational community are not disappointed.The Government regards the signing of theagreement as an important step in our resolute marchtowards building a democratic society and bringing aboutdevelopment. We therefore solemnly appeal to theinternational community to resume effective cooperationwith Togo  in order to allow its population to enjoy thefruits of democratization. Poverty is the enemy ofdemocracy.The complexity of the issues and the manychallenges to be taken up at the dawn of the thirdmillennium call for a strengthening of internationalcooperation and  above all  greater solidarity with Africa.No nation  no country  whatever its resources andabilities  can tackle these challenges alone. Cooperationbetween the peoples of the United Nations is vital to us.We must therefore act together  consolidating oursolidarity within the framework of our Organization which  after half a century of existence  has proved thatit is an irreplaceable tool at the service of mankind.Togo  which once again proclaims its faith in theUnited Nations  would encourage it to relentlessly pursuein the century to come the achievement of its Charterpurposes.May this session strengthen us in our commonstruggle to consolidate peace  justice  freedom andprogress in the world and foster more understandingbetween nations. Togo is ready to contribute to this effort."
"161",6794,"THA",54,1999,"On behalf of theGovernment and people of Thailand  I extend my warmcongratulations to you  Sir  upon your unanimous electionto the presidency of the fifty-fourth session of the GeneralAssembly. I am confident that with your leadership andexperience this session will complete its work successfullyand set the stage for the Millennium Assembly and themillennium summit next year.I should also like to take this opportunity to paytribute to Mr. Didier Opertti  President of the Assembly atits fifty-third session. My delegation truly appreciates hisleadership and his tireless dedication to the heavyresponsibilities entrusted to him during the past year.May I on behalf of the Government and people ofThailand congratulate the Republic of Kiribati  the Republicof Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga on their admission asnew Members of the United Nations  which furtherreinforces the universal character of the Organization.As we gather on the threshold of the new millennium we find the United Nations and the international communityare still preoccupied with maintaining international peaceand security. Yet this is only one of the many purposes ofour Organization; to achieving international cooperation insolving international problems of an economic  social cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting andencouraging respect for human rights and fundamentalfreedoms for all is no less an important goal in our Charter.Invariably  the traditional security paradigmpredominates in the discussions and ensuing actionsregarding international peace and security. A decade afterthe end of the cold war  global and regional organizationstend to focus their efforts primarily on traditional securityconcepts and related tools for solving security problems. InSouth-East Asia  the Association of South-East AsianNations (ASEAN) Regional Forum (ARF)  which dealswith some aspects of security issues in this traditionalsense.But the traditional concepts of security are woefullyinadequate to meet the new challenges faced by mankind.The very narrow scope of its definition serves as anintellectual strait-jacket which limits our ability toconceptualize and respond to new threats of our time.This fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly isbeing conducted under the menacing shadows of theconflicts in Kosovo and East Timor. All of us arepreoccupied with the implications and consequences ofthe ways in which we choose to handle these conflicts.More and more  we in the international communityare being faced with conflicts within States  not betweenor among States  as in the past. Rather than State rights State interests  State sovereignty  we now have to grapplewith the defence of the common good  the protection ofrights beyond borders and intervention to promote andsafeguard humanitarian ideals and objectives.Our Organization is now being challenged to provideclear guidelines for the collective pursuit of these newlofty goals and this complex agenda. Unless and until we as the foremost Assembly of mankind  come up withcriteria  objective and consensual  the internationalcommunity will not be able to address the many lurkinginternal conflicts effectively. The period between now andthe millennium summit next September is an opportunetime for our collective deliberation on this issue. And Icommend the Secretary-General for his leadership role inlaunching the process of consultation at the beginning ofthe session. My delegation pledges its full cooperationwith him and with all representatives in the Assembly forthe successful outcome of this historic search.But let us not forget that before we can protect andpromote those common interests  save rights beyondborders and think about intervention on the ground ofhumanitarian concerns  we have to make sure that we arein agreement about what it is that we must  that we wantto  protect and promote.I propose that we should begin to change ourtraditional  exclusive preoccupation with the security andsovereignty of States to serious consideration on theemerging concept of human security. It is a conceptwhich attempts to take us beyond the traditional meaningof security  by addressing new issues. The scope of whatfalls within the realm of human security is still not yetwell defined  except to place people at the centre of ourdefinition of security. Security is now people-related morethan State-related.10One interpretation of human security in vogue includesupholding human dignity  protecting and promoting humanrights and use of humanitarian law  shielding women children and non-combatants from the effects of armedconflicts  and combating terrorism. We have also seenconcerted action to meet these objectives through jointefforts to eradicate anti-personnel landmines  prevent theproliferation of small arms and struggle against organizedcrime. This somewhat limited interpretation of humansecurity emphasizes physical protection of the humanperson  and strives to provide human beings with freedomfrom fear. This is a step in the right direction.But it is not sufficient. We think human securityshould be more comprehensive. Can we afford to continueto attach less importance to addressing the social andeconomic dimensions of human security? Can we honestlyenjoy genuine security amidst l.3 billion people who live onless than $1 a day  or another 840 million who remainmalnourished? Can we fully enjoy freedom from fearwithout having freedom from want  which emanates fromliving in an environment free from infectious disease illiteracy  poverty  natural disaster and social unrest? If weare to give importance to protecting children from harmfuleffects during times of war  should we not give equalimportance to providing children with basic benefits duringtimes of peace? We cannot turn a blind eye to the need tosecure for people their freedom from want. We believe thathuman beings will begin to enjoy genuine security only ifthey have a chance to make a living  to be able to stand ontheir own two feet  to have equal opportunities to developtheir livelihoods and to make their own decisions abouttheir own futures. This will not happen so long as peopleare threatened by socio-economic ills such as poverty disease  environmental degradation and social vices including drugs.The need to pursue human security in such a broaderand more comprehensive definition is made even moreurgent by the multifaceted challenges that we face fromunbridled globalization. Granted  globalization has createdmany important opportunities and benefits  such as thecreation of more competitive world markets  which has ledto greater efficiencies in production and faster economicgrowth. But I ask the question: has globalization helpederadicate poverty in the marginalized subregions of theworld  or eliminated social and economic inequities even inthe developed world? We cannot deny that uncontrolledmarket forces and unfettered short-term capital flows  totake but a few examples of globalization  have haddevastating consequences on our economies  socialcohesion  political stability and cultural identity — inmany cases for the worse rather than for the better.The events of the recent financial crisis in Asia havebrought us face-to-face with the worst consequences ofglobalization. Millions of adults were unemployed and alarge number of children were forced to leave school.But  if anything  the crisis has made us even moredetermined to meet this challenge  which  thoughprimarily financial in nature  has had immense socialconsequences. We have learned that the multifacetednature of the challenge of globalization requires amultifaceted response.In our case  besides the traditional economic reformsand adjustments undertaken  we also sought to focus ourefforts on addressing the short-term and long-term threatsto the viability and welfare both of individuals and of oursociety. We therefore give strong priority to promotingthe establishment of adequate social safety nets and thedevelopment of human resources. This strategy putspeople at the centre of our national efforts to bring aboutour economic revival. I can proudly say that our effortshave finally borne fruit. We have emerged from the crisismore competitive  more resilient and better prepared economically and socially.At the global level  I firmly believe that to meet thechallenges of globalization and take the most advantagesfrom its benefits  we must join hands to promoteglobalization with a human face. This is not a new idea.Secretary-General Kofi Annan has spoken of it. TheUnited Nations  particularly the United NationsDevelopment Programme  has long been a proponent ofthis concept. Unfortunately  when it was introduced someyears ago  it was still considered an idea far beyond itstime. If we still find such a concept revolutionary  we areindeed behind the times.We need to ensure that globalization leads us to among other things  greater equity among peoples andnations; the easing of social tensions and thestrengthening of communities; the inclusion of a greaternumber of economies as stakeholders and co-partners inthe building of the global economy; declining poverty andthe reduction of the income gap between the very richand the very poor; enhanced protection and preservationof our environment; greater protection and promotion ofhuman rights and fundamental freedoms; and  perhapsmost importantly and very simply  a better life for allpeoples.The holding of the tenth session of the United NationsConference on Trade and Development — UNCTAD X —in Thailand in February 2000 will be an important  definingmoment in our quest to promote globalization with a humanface. We will consider all these challenges together. Wehope to be able to tame the tsunami of globalization andturn it into a benevolent force of reconstruction andequitable distribution of wealth and opportunities  and notthe menacing force of destruction and destabilization it hasthus far been.I am pleased to report that our preparations forUNCTAD X are going well. I wish to take this opportunityto convey the Thai Government's assurance to all of you inthe Assembly that Bangkok will be fully prepared forUNCTAD X in February 2000. Thailand  as the hostcountry  strongly encourages all Member States to considersending to Bangkok delegations at the highest levelpossible.Joining hands to promote globalization with a humanface is a distinct contribution to promoting human security.The United Nations is already playing a leadership role inrealizing this goal at the global level. But the UnitedNations cannot do it alone. It needs to forge a partnershipwith the non-governmental sector  especially the privatesector and civil society  and with other internationalorganizations. In a sense  our endeavour to define and indeed  to promote human security has philosophical andpractical implications — both positive and negative — forus as sovereign States and for the United Nations as theleading global multilateral Organization. We are embarkingon an effort to define what the key role of the UnitedNations will be in the next millennium. I urge all of us tocontribute to this important mission together."
"162",6819,"TJK",54,1999,"First of all permit me to congratulate you  Sir  on your election to yourimportant post as President of the General Assembly. Weare convinced that thanks to your wisdom and experienceyou will successfully guide the deliberations of thisimportant forum.Over the past century mankind has madeunprecedented strides in its overall progress. It hasdemonstrated with unprecedented force the creative geniusand potential of the human mind. But at the same time unfortunately  it has highlighted inherent human failingsthat are the root causes of tremendous social and politicalupheavals  the further exacerbation of global problemsand the emergence of new challenges.One of the most significant achievements of thetwentieth century is the founding of the United Nations with its indispensable legal framework and mechanismsgiving it the tools to organize collective action on the partof States in order to counter current and future threats.Tajikistan would like to see the strengthening of theUnited Nations and of its Security Council  as the bodyresponsible for the maintenance of international peace andsecurity.It is extremely timely and useful  on the threshold ofthe twenty-first century  to rethink philosophically thelessons we have learned in order to define the principalparameters of a future world order and to develop aprogramme of action to put them into practice.We see many valuable and mutually enriching ideasin such initiatives as the convening in the year 2000  atthe fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly  and themillennium summit; the proposal by Russia to elaboratea concept of peace in the twenty-first century; the idea ofIran of a dialogue between civilizations; and the plans ofa number of States regarding a culture of peace and otherinitiatives.Tajikistan  for its part  intends to continuecontributing  insofar as it is able  to this intellectualendeavour aimed at encouraging all States to join theirefforts and concentrate on the main areas of internationalcooperation.Having won their independence eight years ago  thepeople of Tajikistan have made their choice in favour ofdemocracy. Although our movement towards the reform ofthe political system and market transformations in the socialand political sphere has been seriously tested  despite allodds we have risen to the challenge. Today we can statefirmly that we will not veer from the road we have chosenof building a democratic  law-abiding and secular society inTajikistan.The most recent proof of this are the results of apopular referendum on amendments to the Constitution ofthe Republic of Tajikistan  held on 26 September last which have demonstrated growing support for efforts of theGovernment to establish lasting peace and accord in ourcountry and  on that basis  to build up further civil societyand to form stable democratic institutions.Many States have needed hundreds of years to reachtoday’s level of democracy. Tajikistan  like other new orrestored democracies  will have to cover that distancewithin a shorter period of time while gradually tacklingdifficult and complex tasks in the civil  political  economic social and cultural areas. It is clear that this will requiretimely  adequate and coordinated support from the UnitedNations  and we look forward to such support.I wish to note with great satisfaction that thetransitional period provided for in the General Agreementon the Establishment of Peace and National Accord inTajikistan has entered its final stretch. Thus the waytowards further strengthening of the fundamentals ofpeaceful democratic development has now been opened up.In this context of critical importance  we are lookingforward in the next few months to presidential andparliamentary elections in Tajikistan  which we hope willbe successful with the necessary assistance from the UnitedNations and the Organization for Security and Cooperationin Europe.Now more than ever before  the peace process inTajikistan needs active support  particularly material andfinancial assistance from the international community. Wehope to see remedied very soon the situation wherein donorStates allocated only a small percentage of funds pledgedin response to the appeal made this year by the Secretary-General of the United Nations for humanitarian assistanceto Tajikistan. We would like also to express the hope thatat the fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly  as inprevious years  full support will be forthcoming for thedraft resolution on granting international assistance forpost-conflict projects in Tajikistan.The Government of Tajikistan  despite greatdifficulties  has consistently been implementing aprogramme of economic reforms in order to create aneffective market economy. Step by step  an appropriatelegal framework is being set up to provide a favourableenvironment for the development of small andmedium-sized businesses  for foreign investments and forthe promotion of market institutions  including in theareas of finance and banking.The efforts of our Government are being supportedby the International Monetary Fund  the World Bank anda number of other influential and authoritativeinternational financial and economic institutions andagencies. At this new stage of development resulting fromthe transformation in our economic and political systems we in Tajikistan are counting on the internationalcommunity to provide as much support and assistance asit can.The disparity in the value placed on human life andtragedy depending on whether one is in Europe orelsewhere is cause for profound regret. If a hotbed oftension flares up in Europe  it is contained and eliminatedon the double. And this is wonderful. However  it isparticularly hard for us to bear given the large-scaleconflicts that have been spilling blood in Asia fordecades. And is Afghanistan really not a Europeanproblem — Afghanistan  whose drugs are destroying thelives of hundreds of thousands of unfortunates  includingin Europe? Afghanistan is not just Asia’s pain andtragedy. It is Europe’s  too.We are extremely perturbed by the continuing intra-Afghan conflict. The international community must takeall necessary steps to restore peace in Afghanistan asquickly as possible. It is unthinkable that the 20-year civilwar that has already wreaked such irreparable losses onthe long-suffering Afghan people should turn into a new100-year war and continue into the third millennium.We are deeply convinced that the only way to put anend to the long-drawn-out bloodshed in Afghanistan isthrough a political settlement to the conflict which wouldhave as its cornerstone the formation of a broad-basedGovernment that reflects and protects the interests of allpolitical  ethnic and religious groups and strata of Afghansociety.We are sure that the main thrust in any settlement tothe conflict in Afghanistan should be towards strengtheningthe leading role of the United Nations as the key mediatorbetween the parties in restoring peace and achievingnational reconciliation: the efforts of other internationalorganizations  and of States  should complement andreinforce the work of the United Nations; they should notbe undertaken in isolation from it  much less run counter toit.In the context of strengthening the central role playedby the United Nations in coordinating international effortswith regard to Afghanistan  the “six plus two” group offriends and neighbours must redouble its efforts. Webelieve that the Security Council should once again veryseriously review the situation in and around Afghanistanand that it should take action  including imposing sanctionsagainst those who are violating Security Council andGeneral Assembly resolutions.Engulfed in the flames of conflict  Afghanistan is thesource of the many dangers  destabilizing the situation inTajikistan  the whole of Central Asia and far beyond. In thecountries of the Commonwealth of Independent States active bilateral and multilateral cooperation is under way oncountering the penetration from Afghanistan  and theproliferation in our region  of militant Taliban ideology weapons  crime  terrorism and various forms of extremism.I wish in particular to stress the seriousness of thedrug problem. Specifically  the protracted war inAfghanistan has turned that country into one of the world’smain drug centres. The Taliban movement has chosen anextremely dangerous course in turning the territory under itscontrol into a gigantic drug production and distributionfactory and warehouse. Also  despite appeals from theinternational community  this factory of death continues toincrease its output.In this context  I should like to remind the Assemblyof the proposal I put forward at the twentieth specialsession of the General Assembly in June 1998 (A/5-20/PV.2) to create a “cordon sanitaire” around Afghanistanthat would put a covering force along the drug routes outof that country. This idea was conceived because  given thecurrent social and economic conditions in our country  it isno simple matter for Tajikistan to guard its 1 500-kilometrefrontier with Afghanistan reliably. There is also a trendtowards using Tajikistan not only as a transit route fordrugs but also as a reprocessing station  and even towardsexpanding the market with Tajik consumers  all part ofthe plans of international criminal groups to destabilizethe situation in our country. Still  the bulk of the drugsfinding their way into our territory is still destined fortransshipment to other countries  primarily European onesthrough Russia and the Transcaucasus. In this sense  theTajik-Afghan border is the first line of defence for manyother States  and the joint efforts of Tajik and Russianborder guards to plug the leaks in it are serving theinterests of a substantial part of the internationalcommunity.We note with satisfaction that our appeal has notgone unheeded and that over the past year there has beena breakthrough in Tajikistan’s cooperation with therelevant United Nations agencies  in particular the UnitedNations International Drug Control Programme (UNDCP) whose leadership’s support for the measures taken by theGovernment of Tajikistan to combat drug trafficking isbecoming ever more active.Under the agreements and projects reached anddeveloped between the Government of Tajikistan andUNDCP  a number of specific activities are planned toincrease the anti-drug capabilities of law enforcementagencies and the military  in particular those operating inareas adjoining the Tajik-Afghan border. An anti-drugagency reporting directly to the President of the Republichas been established. Cooperation between Tajikistan andUNDCP is a shining example of how efforts can becombined in order to fight shoulder to shoulder againstone of the most terrible human evils. We are open to thiskind of cooperation with all interested States  internationalorganizations and institutions.The world has recently been witness to brazen actsby international terrorists who are increasingly operatingunder the banners of political extremism and religiousfanaticism. Tajikistan shares the view that the fightagainst terrorism is one of the most pressing problemsfacing mankind today. Suffice it to mention the situationin Afghanistan  which confirms that narco-dollars arehelping create an environment favourable to terrorism.We condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestationsand deem it necessary to coordinate the actions of theentire world community to eradicate this scourge at theglobal  regional and national levels. We think it would beuseful to convene  under United Nations auspices  a year-2000 conference to decide on joint organized world actionto combat terrorism; this will be discussed at the fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly.3Tajikistan has consistently supported United Nationsefforts in the sphere of environmental protection. Weappreciate the growing United Nations attention to theserious ecological problems facing our country and otherStates of Central Asia. We hope that the approach of theyear 2000  which the United Nations has declared theInternational Year of Mountains  will help mobilize theinternational community’s potential to help preservebiodiversity and natural mountain ecological systems. Thisis of particular importance to Tajikistan as a predominantlymountainous country.We note with satisfaction that the leadership of theSecretariat  in particular Under-Secretary-General SergioVieira de Mello  is showing increasing interest incooperation with our country to ward off the threat of amajor natural disaster in the Central Asian region related tothe problem of lake Sarez.In this context  we believe it is time to focus worldattention on the question of fresh water in all its aspects.Therefore  Tajikistan has proposed that 2003 be declaredthe International Year of Water. This initiative is promptedby the menacing deterioration of a situation in whichmillions of people lack access to clean water. It is wellknown that because of water pollution half of the world’spopulation lives in unsanitary conditions; more than 5million people a year die  and more than 3 billion becomeill. As the population increases  the likelihood of “waterwars” between States for sources of fresh water grows evergreater. Issues of water and other challenges of the new ageare thus directly linked to problems of security in thecontext of interdependence.In addition to its humanitarian aspects  the problem ofwater has other dimensions  in particular economic andecological ones. Water is our common heritage  and it isnecessary to ensure that all States share in the responsibilityto preserve it for the benefit of future generations.Constructive global cooperation could become a worthypolitical dimension of the twenty-first century  and couldguarantee that this will never acquire a military aspect.We hope that the international community will respondfavourably to our initiative on the resolution of waterproblems  which are of crucial importance not only forTajikistan  which is rich in water resources  but also for themajority of other States Members of the United Nations.It is vital to repair broken links and to create a newmodel for relations  particularly in the area of transport andcommunication. Addressing that key task will to a largeextent determine the development in the next millenniumof all Central Asian States that lack an outlet to the sea;these include Tajikistan.My people has drawn new strength from peace andstability. The construction of a railroad  industrialenterprises and social infrastructure is now under wayalong the ancient historic Great Silk Road  which runsthrough the territory of Tajikistan. This year we arecompleting construction of a transboundary route that willgive us access to the sea. That is our contribution torestoring direct communication among individuals andpeoples along an ancient route that in the Middle Agesserved as a bridge between East and West and that madepossible dialogue among civilizations.We expect that in the near future goods will flowalong this route in both directions. This will undoubtedlyfoster better mutual understanding among all peoples ofthe East and the West  and also will have a positive effecton strengthening regional security and cooperation amongneighbouring countries in Central Asia.Experience has shown that turning to one’s ownroots is always a powerful means of spiritual therapy especially for those who have overcome the tragedy of afratricidal war and are entering a period of active post-conflict reconstruction. Now we are at the stage ofrenewal and of building a new democratic society  and welook back once more at our long history. At a time when with active support from the United Nations  the processof national reconciliation is nearing its objective  ourcountry is celebrating the 1 100th anniversary of thefounding of the State of the Samanids  which marked thebirth of Tajik statehood. We express our appreciation tothe United Nations Educational  Scientific and CulturalOrganization and to all the States and internationalorganizations that responded to our appeal and havesupported efforts to undertake international activitiesdevoted to this momentous anniversary.The age of the Samanids was not only a time of anunprecedented flourishing of science  culture andphilosophy and of the emergence of Tajik statehood. Itwas also the time of the birth and blossoming of themediaeval humanism that so enriched world civilization.Allow me to express the hope that in the thirdmillennium  now so close  the humanistic ideals willilluminate for the world community the arduous road touniversal peace  sustainable development and peacefulconstruction."
"163",6842,"TKM",54,1999,"First of all permit me to congratulate the Minister for Foreign Affairsof Namibia  Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab on his election to thepresidency of the General Assembly. I would also like toexpress words of gratitude to Mr. Didier Opertti Badán forhis dynamic and competent work during the entire courseof the preceding session.For the United Nations  last year — if it weremeasured by the magnitude of military and politicalupheavals — would be equal to a calendar year that thrustupon mankind natural calamities that had catastrophiceffects on people. In many respects it was a year fromwhich we had to draw lessons. It made us ponder seriouslythe political survival of States and the physical protectionof people. It made us take a fresh look at the system ofinternational relations  which was helpless in the face of thenew challenges of the times. Nowadays we can no longerwrite everything off as costs of the cold war.That is why we have paid special attention to the partof the Secretary-General’s report in which he tried to givea analysis of present-day conflicts. Those conflicts  becauseof the nature of their origins and the dynamics of theirevolution  did not always yield to traditional forms andmethods for their successful resolution. There is a factdescribed in the report that requires special consideration namely  that over the past decade 90 per cent of armedconflicts took place inside States and not between them.This phenomenon shows how relevant the problem ofstatehood is  as well as defining the correct orientation  inchoosing the road to development in today’s world. Thepreservation of national unity  inter-ethnic harmony andsocial guarantees  coupled with a reasonable pace ofreform  can today be considered as the basic universalcriteria for ensuring the peaceful development of everynation. This statement is substantiated by the experienceof our newly independent State  which managed to avoidmany cataclysms in the difficult period of its emergingstatehood.This is the eighth time that Turkmenistan has takenpart in a session of the General Assembly as anindependent subject of international relations. Without theactive support of our friends  it would be hard to imaginethe state of Turkmenistan’s development today  whichallows us to look with optimism at the future and toestablish long-term programmes of social and economicdevelopment. In this regard  we are grateful to our closeneighbours — Iran  Russia  Turkey  Pakistan  China andIndia — and our partners in the Organization for Securityand Cooperation in Europe. From a conceptual point ofview  the system of Turkmenistan’s international relationsis based on sincerity and reciprocity of mutual interests neutrality and non-alignment  which form the two pillarsof our statehood.I would like to avail myself of this opportunity toexpress words of gratitude to the United NationsDevelopment Programme (UNDP) and to emphasize itslarge-scale activities  which merit all-round support. TheGovernment of Turkmenistan  together with UNDP  hasundertaken a number of major national projects that haveyielded concrete results in the reforms of the socialsphere  public health  the system of education and otherareas. Turkmenistan intends to continue to maintain closeties with that important agency of the United Nations with the aim of identifying and implementing newopportunities for cooperation. In view of the majordevelopment tasks lying ahead  UNDP personifies for usthe United Nations system as a whole.Purposeful cooperation between specialized agenciesof the United Nations and national Governments makes itpossible to identify the main parameters of the conflict-prevention strategy in each individual region. Ever-increasing flows of refugees and displaced persons to44neighbouring countries from conflict areas and zones ofnational disasters are fraught with a certain potential fortension. As regards this important matter  we attach greatimportance to the work of the Office of the United NationsHigh Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). TheGovernment of Turkmenistan  together with UNHCR  isimplementing an ad hoc programme of assistance torefugees that is based on a joint plan of action.In close relation to the above subject  I would like todraw attention to the situation in Afghanistan  whichcontinues to cause serious concern. Historically Turkmenistan had close fraternal ties with that long-suffering nation. Hence  we have a sincere interest in there-establishment of peace and the restoration ofAfghanistan. Since the first days of independence Turkmenistan built its relations with Afghanistan on thebasis of mutual trust and respect. Our position is absolutelytransparent and clear: neutrality with respect to the partiesto the conflict; a constructive attitude towards and a dueaccounting of the realities of today’s Afghanistan; a desireto engage conflicting parties in a dialogue; and creativeeconomic reconstruction programmes.It is precisely this desire that underpinned ourinitiative of holding two rounds of direct inter-Afghan talksin Ashgabat early this year  which were supported by thetwo key factions and bore fruit  giving hope for the future.However  in our opinion  this process did not receiveadequate support from the outside  from those who aremore prone to making declarations of good intentions andadvancing their own interests rather than taking practicalsteps to help the Afghan people. Turkmenistan has beenworking on the Afghan issue and will continue to work onit under any format of international cooperation  includingthe mechanism of the “six plus two” group under theauspices of the United Nations  as that mechanismpossesses an enormous untapped potential. We all havegrounds to raise this issue because we have actuallyencountered a situation that may not be the best one for theUnited Nations  which has financed a Special Mission inAfghanistan — a Mission that until now has failed toproduce any practical results. Smoothly written reportsshould not substitute for real political work in the field.We share a commonly held view that the UnitedNations system needs rational reform in the twenty-firstcentury. The Millennium Assembly  on the theme of theUnited Nations in the twenty-first century  will become amajor landmark in this process  and Turkmenistanwholeheartedly supports the idea of holding such a session.That Assembly could provide a unique opportunity toidentify the problems that we will face in the future andto undertake a creative process of strengthening andenhancing this unique institution.Statements by heads of delegations at the currentsession contain many ideas regarding the need to reformthe United Nations and the Security Council and tobalance the right of veto  among many others.Turkmenistan adheres to the view that while seeking toimprove the situation  the most important thing is to takea well-considered and balanced approach to the solutionof the issues concerning the destiny of the Organization rather than cause it harm by becoming hostage toemotions. It is our opinion that while encountering someglitches in the work of the mechanism  we should notrush into its complete replacement but should try toproperly diagnose the weakness in the available resources.It may be a case of the problem not being in the systemitself  but rather in those who are called to represent it atvarious levels.Turning once again to the problem of the elaborationand implementation of a system to prevent conflicts andensure safe development  I would like to emphasize thatthe foreign policy course of neutrality pursued from theoutset by Turkmenistan has always been aimed atprecisely this goal. It is explicitly mentioned in theSecretary-General’s report that the struggle for controlover economic resources is one of the main causes ofconflicts. Therefore the implementation of the foreignpolicy initiative concerning Turkmenistan’s permanentneutrality  in the form of a special resolution adopted bythe General Assembly on 12 December 1995  has a veryimportant meaning in this regard. The development of theextremely rich hydrocarbon resources of the Caspianbasin is tied to the interests not only of regional countriesbut also to those of major Powers and transnationalcompanies. Turkmenistan’s neutrality is aimed at asituation of combined rather than conflicting interests.We believe that in today’s world there can  andshould  exist zones of interest  but we resolutely opposethe concept of spheres of influence. The issue concerningthe status of the Caspian Sea is highly relevant in thisrespect. We have on numerous occasions stated ourposition on this issue: we would like to prevent the workon the status of the Caspian Sea from turning from aninternational law problem into a political problem. In anycase  we consider it appropriate at this forum to drawattention to this issue  so that we can avoid thepoliticization of issues concerning the legal definition anddevelopment of the energy resources of the sea and45underline Turkmenistan’s readiness for constructivepartnership and clearly defined reasonable compromises.The highly complex nature of the tasks facing StatesMembers of the United Nations is clear. The momentouschallenges confronting the Organization are commensuratewith the hopes of people around the globe  who believe thatreal change for the better will take place with the change ofepochs. This concerns both large and small nations  the richand the poor  newly independent and long-existing States.We all face challenges that can be overcome only by meansof collective efforts  recognizing at the same time individualresponsibilities. Such is the logic of Turkmenistan’spolitical behaviour and its readiness to be an active Memberof the Organization."
"164",6910,"TTO",54,1999,"﻿I wish tocongratulate you on your election to the presidency of theGeneral Assembly at its final session of the twentiethcentury and would like to assure you of the fullestcooperation of the delegation of Trinidad and Tobago asyou discharge the duties entrusted to you by the MemberStates of the United Nations. We would also like tocommend your predecessor  Mr. Didier Opertti of Uruguay for the very capable and distinguished manner in which heguided the Assembly’s work during its fifty-third session.There is only one real purpose to government. It isto serve the people  to protect them and to improve thequality of their lives. In their enlightened self-interest nations also come together to serve that end by trying tocreate a better world  one in which their own citizens caninteract with others and benefit from relationships in thepursuit of their fulfilment. At both the national and globallevels  the human being is supposed to be at the centre ofthe purpose  processes and policies of governance. It isthe foundation of democratic civilization to create theconditions that give the individual the opportunity forfulfilment.We need to assess our nations and our world in thelight of that original intention as we approach the twenty-first century.The present global picture proves that much wentwrong during this century. The economic models of thecentury have failed to create economic and social justice.The central planning of Communism was disastrous suffocating human development by stifling initiatives andfreedoms and creating oppressive authoritarian regimes.The Big Government of the centre-left era was bunglingand bureaucratic  killing entrepreneurial initiative andgenerating a dependency syndrome  and was imperfect inits delivery as the major social and economic actor. Nowwe are in the era of the market  of deregulation andborderlessness  and the question still is: what have weachieved?At the turn of the century  we have 1.3 billionpeople in the category of the poor  earning less than $1dollar per day. More than 880 million people lack accessto health services  2.6 billion people lack access to basicsanitation and 1.5 billion people are not expected tosurvive to age 60. The number of malnourished is 840million people  nearly 20 per cent of whom are children.One of the most tragic situations as we approach the endof the century is that 70 per cent of the world’s poor arewomen. From 1990 to 1997 the number of peopleinfected with HIV/AIDS more than doubled  with themajority of victims in the developing world.Ironically  in this much-heralded information age  75million people are estimated to be illiterate  with themajority also in the developing world. In addition to theproblem of illiteracy  the education system in mostdeveloping countries is producing unskilled andunemployable young people.6Five billion of the world's 6 billion people live in thedeveloping world  but most of the resources areconcentrated in the developed countries. Twenty per cent ofthe world's richest countries share 86 per cent of the world'sgross domestic product  82 per cent of exports of goods andservices and 68 per cent of foreign direct investment.If there is any demonstration of the inequality thatexists and how most human beings have been marginalizedas we approach the end of the twentieth century  thefollowing is a striking example: the assets of the threerichest people are more than the combined gross nationalproduct of all of the least developed countries; the assets ofthe 200 richest people are more than the combined incomeof 41 per cent of the world's people; and a yearlycontribution of 1 per cent of the wealth of the 200 richestpeople could provide universal access to primary educationfor all.There is an even darker side to the picture. As wespan the far reaches of history  and especially in thiscentury  we see that very often the individual in society hasbeen the victim of political and economic forces beyond hiscontrol. He has suffered the horrendous consequences ofethnic  cultural and religious intolerance. It is the individualand the family that have suffered the most from thedevastating effects of wars  genocide and ethnic cleansing.In our century alone  we have witnessed the tragedyof two world wars  which have resulted in the loss of acountless number of lives  the separation of families and theloss of hope for many. We have seen the untold humanmisery and pain of the Holocaust  the injustices andsuffering of apartheid and the callousness of regimes whichhave unleashed acts of unspeakable horror on their citizens.Throughout this century  we have been shocked by newsand television images of the harsh realities endured by thevictims of such horrors in Europe  Cambodia  Rwanda Bosnia and the former Yugoslavia  to name a few. And sadly  we have realized that the very scientific andtechnological advances which were intended for the serviceof humanity can be turned to evil ends in the service of thedestruction of humanity.Nevertheless  in the midst of one of the darkestchapters of the twentieth century  there is hope in the factthat such evils have stirred the conscience of theinternational community to strengthen the rule of law  toaddress situations such as these and to ensure respect forfundamental human rights.It is because of this recognition that we have todaythe most recent instrument  the Rome Statute of theInternational Criminal Court. This Statute is the result ofa call made in 1989 by Mr. Arthur N.R. Robinson President of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago  for theinternational community to renew its focus on thequestion of the establishment of an international criminaljurisdiction to deal with these atrocities  and also withcrimes associated with the illicit drug trade  all of whichhave such a heavy impact on a Government's ability toaddress the fundamental needs of its citizens.In addition to the establishment of the InternationalCriminal Court  there is hope in the fact that the UnitedNations has made advances in the area of human rights.We have seen the adoption of several instruments  suchas the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and theInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which guarantee fundamental human rights  theConvention on the Rights of the Child  the Convention onthe Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination againstWomen and the International Convention on theElimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. Thesereflect the commitments and obligations of theinternational community to improving the quality of lifeof the individual in the various sectors of society. But wemust not pay lip-service to the principles enshrined in theinternational instruments that we have adopted; there istoo much of a trend of paying lip-service. We need totake concrete action now.Albert Camus  one of the distinguished writers ofmodern times noted that “Probably every generation sees itself as chargedwith remaking the world. Mine  however  knows thatits task will not be merely to remake the world. Itstask is even greater: to keep the world fromdestroying itself.”There is no doubt that the task in the new century isto save the world from self-destruction  and the questionis  what type of economic arrangement will ensure thatsalvation? Surely it cannot be one in which the few feastat the table  leaving mere crumbs for the majority. No onecan be insulated from the catastrophe inherent in such asituation. Disease  terrorism  the drug trade  humanenslavement  child labour and ecological disaster willcontinue to be produced by a world bereft of economicand social justice. No fortress  whether economic ormilitary  will be strong enough to insulate any countryfrom the effects of such a situation. Some may not like it 7and some tend to forget it; but it is one world that we livein  one globe that we share. We should take a lesson fromnature itself  whose hot winds emanate from the Sahara inAfrica  become hurricanes in their journey across theAtlantic and eventually devastate and desolate countries asfar away as the Caribbean and North  Central and SouthAmerica.In this era of globalization  we have excellentopportunities to put in place new and innovative globalstructures that would make possible global solutions toensure the social  economic and cultural security of theindividual. The World Trade Organization (WTO) meetingin Seattle this year  the South Summit  the special sessionsof the General Assembly to follow up of the World Summitfor Social Development and the Fourth World Conferenceon Women and  indeed  the Millennium Assembly nextyear  provide ideal opportunities for the internationalcommunity to respond to this coming crisis of mankind.In the upcoming WTO Seattle meeting  it must berecognized that many of the measures which were supposedto be put in place in the new global trading system usheredin by the Uruguay Round have not been realized. Givingeffect to those matters must therefore be the priority in anynew round of WTO negotiations. In other words implementation of commitments already made must be theemphasis.In that process  we must recognize that a specialcategory of States face peculiar disadvantages arising fromthe policy actions of the international community. These arethe small and vulnerable States  of which the States of theCaribbean region make up a significant part. For thesecountries  the need to maintain the provisions for specialand differential treatment in the present WTO Agreementis fundamental.The liberalization of international trade under theWTO is a dynamic force for accelerating growth anddevelopment. The challenge for the next MinisterialConference is to ensure resolute progress towards an open free and fair international trading system in which benefitsare equitably distributed. Developed countries mustdemonstrate an unequivocal commitment to opening theirmarkets to exports of developing countries to enable themto achieve sustained levels of economic development. Thedisconnection between developments in the WTO and thedevelopment process at the national level in developingcountries must be arrested. The rules-based system of theWTO  which aims to promote free and fair trade  must dojust that. The idea of the level playing field  we mustremember  is a dangerous myth  and if it is allowed tohold sway it will further the pauperization of hundreds ofmillions of people all over the world.Policies developed and promoted by internationalfinancial and monetary institutions such as the WorldBank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) musthave as their ultimate goal the transformation of societiesaimed at achieving a higher degree of social equity andjustice within the global economy. The World Bank andthe IMF must apply a set of criteria broader than percapita income when considering finance and developmentassistance  in view of our susceptibility to externaleconomic shocks and natural disasters.We are heartened by the highly successfulCommonwealth ministerial mission on small island Statesundertaken by the Heads of Government in July 1998 from which an agreement has been secured for theestablishment of a Commonwealth/World Bank task force.The World Bank is now developing a strategy  which wehope will be approved by its board of ExecutiveDirectors  to reorient its assistance for small States on thebasis of a strategic assessment of their vulnerability constraints and needs. Other financial institutions anddevelopment institutions should adopt similar initiatives.The governance of the supranational global actorstherefore has to be reinvented with human developmentand equity as imperatives.A new global partnership of developing countriesmust be forged with the financial institutions and thedeveloped world to place financing for development on asound and predictable level. The economic foundation laidby the policy prescriptions of structural adjustmentremains questionable in terms of their potential togenerate and sustain long-term economic growth. Theinternational financial architecture must therefore becompatible with and complementary to real development.National Governments cannot be exonerated fromtheir responsibilities. There are too many countries in theworld whose major problem is the imperfections of theirown Governments. Many who speak aboutmarginalization are themselves alienating their ownpopulations  and some who lament global poverty arethemselves pauperizing their own citizens through theirown inadequacies. We cannot call for a reformationwithout reforming ourselves. Do we all place our peopleat the centre of governance? Are we using our resourceswell and for the benefit of our populations who elected usto serve? We have a responsibility to re-invent our8governance at home as part of the global transformationthat we demand.The key question that the Member States of the UnitedNations face in the twenty-first century is whether theUnited Nations will become an Organization that can dealeffectively with all forms of injustices to humankind. Werecall your words  Sir  in your opening statement to thecurrent session of the General Assembly:“The aspirations  hopes and expectations of theworld's peoples are high as they anticipate thefuture. They yearn for a world that is peaceful humane and prosperous for all. Without the UnitedNations  such an inclusive world  led by i n s p i r i n gleaders  cannot come about.” (A/54/PV.1)Trinidad and Tobago is committed to working withother countries of the world through the United Nations tofashion a global civilization that would  in the finalanalysis  be its own salvation and protection. We believethat the struggle for economic and social justice must startwith ourselves and that democracy in each country must bean ever-deepening process which eventually liberates everysingle individual from want and places him or her in aposition to pursue his or her own fulfilment whilerespecting the rights of others.For us in Trinidad and Tobago everyone matters;every life is precious. This is the approach with which wecome to the United Nations. All nations are important to usbecause every life in every country is precious. Trinidadand Tobago believes that the United Nations must come tounderstand again that it has been made for people — realpeople with flesh and blood and dreams; people who sufferpain and long for joy; people in cars on the street  inhouses and hovels  in the cold or in sweltering heat labouring in fields or offices  giving birth in hospitals andelsewhere; real people  Sir  who may never see you in thatchair or me standing here  and if they do see us through thedistance of television may be surprised and even disbelievethat we are doing this for them.Is it not amazing how ritual and ceremony oftenbecome ends in themselves and either replace or obscurethe real purpose? Trinidad and Tobago is heartened to sensethat the United Nations is on a path of rediscovery of itself.It remains for us the only Organization where everyindividual may be represented and every voice heard  andwhere every opinion or idea could contend. Trinidad andTobago pledges to work with others to take thisOrganization back to the people  to ensure that it worksamong them  in our collective efforts to save the world."
"165",6957,"TUN",54,1999,"Iwould like first of all to extend to you  Sir  my warmestcongratulations on your election as President of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-fourth session. I have nodoubt that your long diplomatic experience and your deepknowledge of international relations will enable you toguide the work of this session to a successful conclusion.Your election is a token of appreciation from theinternational community to you personally and to yourcountry  Namibia  which is noted for its prestige in Africaand in the world. Tunisia  which stood by the fraternal14Namibian people in their successful struggle againstcolonialism  is proud of its close ties with your country andlooks forward to strengthening and developing them furtherin the interests of our two countries and peoples.Allow me to take this opportunity to express oursincere gratitude to your predecessor  Mr. Didier Opertti for his valuable efforts during his presidency of the fifty-third Assembly and for the wise manner in which heconducted its work  which had a very positive impact onthe deliberations.I take this opportunity also to express to the Secretary-General our great appreciation for his relentless efforts inpromoting and strengthening the pacific  negotiatedsettlement of disputes and crises in various parts of theworld. We commend him for his dedication to enhancingthe effectiveness and efficiency of the Secretariat and tostrengthening the Organization's role in meetinghumankind's desire for progress  security and peace.I extend Tunisia's congratulations to the Republic ofNauru  the Republic of Kiribati and the Kingdom of Tongaon their admission to our Organization.What characterizes this session is that it is being heldat the close of a decade that began with the prospect of anend to the cold war  witnessed the emergence of newconcepts and future-oriented visions designed to avoid anyrepeat of past errors and crises  and aimed to establish anew world order based on security  peace  cooperation andstability. Although optimism marked the early stages of thisnew era  subsequent developments have compelled theinternational community to conduct a comprehensive reviewof the immediate past in order to solve the variousdifficulties and problems of our world today.As we meet during this session at the dawn of thetwenty-first century  we have a propitious opportunity todiscuss and exchange views about various possible methodsfor amending the approach that we have taken over the lastfew years and identifying its weaknesses and deficiencies.We must then devise a renewed approach that will providefuture generations with the capacity to adapt  overcomeobstacles  preserve international peace and security andensure well-being and prosperity for all humanity.For the framework of such a renewed approach tomaintaining international peace and security  we have inmind three main themes. First  the change that has takenplace in the approach to armaments and to their role in theworld. Secondly  the growing need for increased attentionto settling regional disputes. Thirdly  the transformationof economic and social development into one of thecornerstones of peace and security globally. Despite thegreat strides which the international community has madein these three areas  much remains to be done before weachieve the goal of a qualitative transition that wouldallow us to guarantee security and tranquillity for allpeople and for the generations to come.Our world possesses huge arsenals of weapons especially weapons of mass destruction  nuclear weaponsforemost among them. It is extremely important  in ourview  for the nuclear Powers to take rapid steps toeliminate these weapons  especially given the limits of thecurrent non-proliferation regime in the long term and theimpossibility of contemplating non-proliferation as asubstitute for completely dismantling and destroying allnuclear weapons and banning them in the future.We believe that as we move closer to the twenty-first century  the international community has a historicopportunity to achieve this noble goal or at least toconclude an agreement on nuclear disarmament. Inworking towards this goal  it is extremely important toensure that non-nuclear weapon States are not subject tothe use or threat of use of nuclear weapons in violation oftheir security and territorial integrity. Consideration mustbe given to the fact that non-nuclear-weapon Statesconstitute the overwhelming majority of Member Statesand have freely chosen not to possess nuclear weapons.We would like  in this regard  to address anotheraspect of disarmament: small arms. We all know howdestructive small arms can be. Tunisia supports allinternational efforts to curb small arms proliferation andtrafficking.Tunisia  which has abided by all disarmamenttreaties and conventions  reiterates its total commitmentto the disarmament objectives and its strong resolve tocontinue contributing towards the achievement of thesegoals in the various relevant fora  especially theConference on Disarmament in Geneva. Tunisia recentlyhad the honour of joining the Conference  following theConference's decision last August to expand itsmembership by admitting five new countries.In implementation of the Ottawa Convention on theProhibition of the Use  Stockpiling  Production andTransfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on TheirDestruction  Tunisia destroyed large quantities of minesduring an official ceremony on 29 June 1999 attended by15a representative of the United Nations in Tunis. We hopethat all States parties to the Convention will participate inthe Convention process without delay so that theConvention's objectives are achieved and transparency ispromoted pursuant to the Convention's article 7.The outbreak and persistence of conflicts in manyparts of the world compel our Organization to be constantlyready to assume its responsibilities and to play the role ithas been assigned in this regard by the Charter. We believethat the efforts aimed at consolidating preventivediplomacy  collective security  the peaceful settlement ofdisputes and adherence to international legality arefoundations of international peace and security and shouldbe further upheld.However  despite the numerous successes of ourOrganization in this field  there are still many hotbeds oftension and war that require more coordination andcooperation if they are to be curbed and prevented fromspreading. I should like in this regard to address thequestion of so-called “humanitarian intervention”. This is asensitive and delicate issue. It requires  in our view  athorough and profound analysis taking into account all itsaspects  especially those related  first  to the sovereignty ofStates and the need to preserve it as a natural rightenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations as afundamental element of international relations; and secondly  the necessity to save the lives of civilianpopulations in times of conflict  in accordance with theprinciple of international solidarity.All States Members of the Organization are calledupon to consider all the implications of these principles inorder to reach consensus on this issue and to contribute ina considered and balanced way to the debate on it. Such adebate should not be confined to the Security Council  butshould also involve the General Assembly.The issues related to the security problems confrontingthe African continent should remain at the top of ourpriorities. These issues need the strong material andfinancial support of the international community if they areto be resolved. Africa  in turn  has given top priority to thequestion of the settlement of internal disputes. TheOrganization of African Unity Mechanism for ConflictPrevention  Management and Resolution has played animportant role in this regard. Since its inception  theMechanism has achieved encouraging results that reflect thedetermination of African countries to rely  first andforemost  on their own capacity to solve the problems thatthreaten the security of the continent  in full coordinationwith the United Nations. Given its importance  theMechanism needs stronger financial and technical supportfrom the international community  which would help toenhance its capacities and to develop its effectiveness andefficiency.We must stress in this regard the extreme importanceof development  a basic guarantor of lasting security.Indeed  there can be no stability without sustainabledevelopment. Despite the relentless efforts of Africancountries in the political  economic and social fieldsaimed at improving the situation of their peoples  thereare still many difficulties that prevent many countriesfrom implementing their development programmes.It has become a matter of urgency that the Africancontinent receive strong and continuous support on thebasis of its national priorities. We note in this regard thatthe initiative of the Security Council and the GeneralAssembly to convene meetings to discuss and follow upthe situation in Africa bears testimony to a growing andconsolidated awareness of the need to address Africanproblems. While commending this approach  we mustemphasize the need to adopt practical plans whichAfrica's partners can translate into concrete realities in aneffective manner.We commend the various initiatives of the UnitedNations  its specialized agencies and the Bretton Woodsinstitutions to promote sustainable development in Africa.We believe  however  that it is important to ensurecoordination between United Nations initiatives and thoseundertaken by donor countries if such initiatives are tosucceed. In this framework  we look forward to theadoption of practical initiatives that respond to theproposals spelt out in the report of the Secretary-Generalon the causes of conflict and the promotion of sustainablepeace and development in Africa  particularly regardingthe debt problem.In Tunisia  we are aware of the important role thateconomic and geographical groupings play in today'sworld in addressing the challenges posed by globalizationand in adapting to constant important changes. Thisawareness prompts us to pursue our endeavours  alongwith our brothers in the Maghreb countries  to completethe establishment of the Arab Maghreb Union  whichremains a strategic and firm choice and which alsorepresents the aspirations of the people of our region to16prosperity  security and integration. This choice is evenmore pressing in the light of our country's endeavours to setup a Euro-Mediterranean space as a framework forcooperation between all Mediterranean countries  forsolidarity between its peoples and for a cultural and socialdialogue on the basis of the noble values and highprinciples in which we all believe.With respect to the Middle East  where the conflicthas lasted more than half a century  peace  which ischerished by the peoples of that region and indeed by thewhole world  still faces difficulties despite the efforts thathave been made by the international community particularly since the early 1970s. There is no doubt that acomprehensive  just and lasting peace is the only way toconsolidate the foundations of stability and security and toenable all parties to devote their resources and energies tothe development efforts of their countries and to ensuringthe well-being of their peoples.Tunisia has followed with satisfaction the newdevelopments brought about by the signing of the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum  which has created a new encouragingclimate for the reactivation of the peace process and thefaithful and full implementation of all agreements andcommitments. We hope that the final status negotiationswill lead to the resolution of the most important issues particularly the recognition of the inalienable rights of thePalestinian people  in particular its right to establish anindependent State on its land  with Jerusalem as its capital.On the basis of this firm position of principle insupport of the peace process  and eager as it is to see thepeace process succeed on all tracks  Tunisia insists on theimportance of reactivating negotiations on the Syrian andLebanese tracks from the point at which they stopped  aswell as on the necessity of the complete and unconditionalwithdrawal of Israel from South Lebanon and from theSyrian Golan Heights  in compliance with the relevantUnited Nations resolutions and on the basis of the principleof land for peace. Occupation and peace cannot co-exist.Regarding the Lockerbie issue  Tunisia expresses itssatisfaction at the recent positive developments  to which itand other parties of good will contributed. It also reiteratesits call for a speedy and final lifting of the embargoimposed on the brotherly Libyan people.With respect to the question of Iraq  Tunisia reiteratesits call for a peaceful solution in the context of internationalresolutions. It also calls upon the international communityto join efforts to put an end to the suffering of the Iraqipeople so that all the efforts of the peoples of that regioncan be directed towards development and the promotionof stability. Thus  Tunisia  which has called for respectfor international legality  expresses the hope that asolution will soon be found to all the humanitarian issuesresulting from this tragedy  particularly the question ofKuwaiti prisoners of war and missing persons  inconformity with the relevant Security Council resolutions.Regarding the question of the three islands ofGreater Tunb  Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa  Tunisiareiterates its support for the resolution of this disputebetween the United Arab Emirates and Iran throughpeaceful means  either through direct dialogue or  if thatshould prove impossible  by referring the question to theInternational Court of Justice.In another region of the world  the internationalcommunity has focused its attention in recent months onanother important question  that of East Timor. In thisregard  we welcome the adoption of Security Councilresolution 1264 (1999) and hope that its implementationwill enable the people of East Timor to achieve self-determination and will  at the same time  maintainsecurity in the region and preserve the sovereignty andintegrity of Indonesia. We commend Indonesia's couragein responding to the wishes of the people of East Timorand the international community. We believe that a finalsettlement of this issue can be achieved only in anatmosphere of conciliation that involves all partiesconcerned  and with the support and blessing of theinternational community.One of the most important phenomena characterizingthe end of this century is the growing globalization thatnow dominates various aspects of our social life.Although it has created new opportunities in the field ofeconomic development  it is likely  if not brought undercontrol  to lead to further disruption in internationalrelations and development plans. The internationalcommunity must seriously and firmly address thechallenges posed by globalization. This entails thedemonstration of stronger political will from all partiesand the implementation of all the commitments made particularly at the important conferences of the UnitedNations.Follow-up and implementation of therecommendations of international conferences is  in ouropinion  of great importance. In this regard  we wouldlike to express our satisfaction with the continuing workof the preparatory Committees for the two special17sessions of the General Assembly to review and appraiseimplementation of the Beijing Platform of Action dealingwith women's and family issues and of the CopenhagenWorld Summit for Social Development  which will be heldin June  in New York and Geneva respectively. However we note with concern that  despite the efforts made at theUnited Nations  which has placed the eradication of povertyhigh on its agenda  the agreed target set at the CopenhagenSummit for increasing the amount of official developmentassistance to 0.7 per cent of the gross national product ofdeveloped countries has not yet been met.This situation requires action at the international levelaimed at achieving solidarity  which we consider anessential link between peoples. In this context we place therecent call by His Excellency Mr. Zine El Abidine Ben Ali President of the Republic of Tunisia  to all world leadersand to various United Nations and other internationalinstitutions for the creation of a world solidarity fund. Theobjective of this fund would be to collect voluntarydonations and contributions to be used in the fight againstpoverty and in the development of the poorest regions invarious parts of the world  particularly in the leastdeveloped countries that undergo various tragedies andcrises. Our country will endeavour  through its contactswith brotherly and friendly countries and at the UnitedNations and other international organizations  to rally thenecessary support for this noble humanitarian project andfor the elaboration of modalities for its creation as soon aspossible. This will enable us to be more responsive to ouroptions and commitments  which have gained theacceptance of the international community and which havebeen set forth in the recommendations of variousinternational conferences.We also rely on United Nations institutions  such asthe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)  theWorld Health Organization (WHO)  the United NationsChildren's Fund (UNICEF)  the United Nations PopulationFund (UNFPA)  the Food and Agriculture Organization ofthe United Nations (FAO) and other institutions in view oftheir prestige and experience as well as their interest in thefight against poverty  to contribute efficiently to the speedycreation of this fund.The year 1999 represents a new landmark in theconsolidation of the democratic process in Tunisia. It willbe marked by pluralistic presidential and parliamentaryelections based on full transparency and freedom of choicefor citizens within the context of freedom and respect forlaw. Tunisia has undertaken a programme of substantialreforms over the past 12 years in different areas  havingamended the Constitution  allowing political pluralism anda multiparty system  eliminating special courts andenacting legislation in conformity with our obligations tointernational treaties in the field of human rights  whichTunisia has been among the first countries to ratify.In the same spirit  Tunisia has long undertaken topromote women's freedom and gender equality. Itpublishes a special journal on children's rights and a codeon the care and rights of the elderly  handicapped andother vulnerable categories. All these reforms embodyTunisia's global vision regarding all dimensions of humanrights and confirm our country's strong belief in theuniversality of such principles.The creation of many multilateral organizations particularly the United Nations  represents the mostimportant achievement of the international community inthis century. Thanks to the solid institutional edifice inwhich our Organization holds a privileged place  rulesregulating relations between States have been codified and common objectives  programmes and strategies havebeen elaborated in order to address the problemsconfronting the world.Despite the successes and achievements in thisregard  certain weaknesses still mark internationalrelations  and various new disruptions and dangers haveemerged. In the context of all the developments andchanges that have occurred  the United Nations remainsthe ideal forum and haven for the elaboration of collectivestrategies to overcome challenges.We believe that the millennium summit  to be heldduring the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly constitutes an ideal opportunity  which the internationalcommunity should fully utilize  evaluate itsaccomplishments and build a strategy based on them inorder to usher in the new millennium with diligence andconfidence. That summit will also be a historic occasionfor heads of State and Government to debate this matter.In this regard  we believe that the Organizationneeds to be provided with all the necessary means to playan effective role in international relations and affairs.Reforming the Organization and its various structures onthe basis of the developments and changes that haveoccurred will certainly ensure its vitality. Among theurgent tasks that the Member States need to address todayis to reform the Security Council in a way that wouldreflect the profound changes the international communityhas witnessed  ensure global representation in this vital18body and consolidate the principles of transparency anddemocracy in its working methods.We need to stress  in this context  that we expect thereform of the Security Council to lead to the fulfilment ofthe requests of developing countries  primarily Africancountries  to have permanent representation on the SecurityCouncil  which would allow them to contribute to the tasksand responsibilities assigned to this body in themaintenance of international peace and security.In conclusion  I would like to reiterate the fullcommitment of Tunisia to the purposes and principles ofthe United Nations as enshrined in the Charter  the samepurposes and principles it has adopted and implemented inits foreign policy. Tunisia is a peace-loving and justice-loving nation. It has endeavoured relentlessly since itsadmission to this body  and in all the forums to which itbelongs  to contribute with all the means at its disposal tostrengthen the foundations of international peace andsecurity. It makes every effort to encourage dialogue andnegotiations as the proper means for the settlement ofdisputes and crises. It has participated in United Nationspeacekeeping operations since the early 1960s and presentlycontributes to three of them. Last June Tunisia signed withthe United Nations an agreement that would place standbyforces at the disposal of the Organization.Tunisia spares no effort in contributing to allinitiatives aimed at promoting cooperation  solidarity andunderstanding between countries and peoples. That is thedirection we have freely chosen and that we intend topursue if and when my country is given the honour ofbeing elected to a non-permanent seat on the SecurityCouncil for the period 2000-2001 by the Member Statesand with the full support of the brotherly African Group other groups and friendly countries. We look forward to thesupport of all Member States so that my country cancontinue working with them towards fulfilling the task ofadvancing the purposes and principles of the Charter."
"166",7004,"TUR",54,1999,"Mr. President  the session of theGeneral Assembly over which you are presiding marks thelast to be held this century. We are about to turn a new leafin history. It is  therefore  a time for reflection  a time toreap our lessons and draw our conclusions. It is also a timeto reorganize our goals  priorities and our agenda for thenext century.Therefore  there is a recurrent theme throughout thissession. We all try to assess what we have achieved andwhere we have failed in the twentieth century. As we lookback on our performance  we observe that within everysuccess story  we also somehow had our failures.The twentieth century has witnessed unprecedentedscientific progress. These achievements  however  were notused solely to advance the human cause and to improve thequality of life. To a very large extent  these scientific andtechnological innovations were also used as instruments forthe destruction of life. Throughout the century  there was anenormous accumulation of wealth. But the vast majority ofthe world's population is deprived of this wealth. Poverty and sometimes even hunger  is still their fate.This century has produced great intellectualachievements and depth. But it has also been the stage ofdistorted ideologies which produced tyrannies andsometimes encouraged practices like ethnic cleansing. Inother words  while the twentieth century created technologyand generated material and intellectual wealth  it could notorganize the means to put them totally to the service ofhumanity as a whole. This is our failure. This is thechallenge we face. This is what we must overcome.The global issues we face  whether political economic  social or environmental  will from now onrequire further intensification of our concerted efforts. Asthe primary forum for international cooperation  theUnited Nations will continue to be the focal point of ourcollective endeavours.The wealth of experience accumulated by the UnitedNations  together with the plans of action devised toaddress the challenges we face  must now be put to moreeffective use. The millennium summit next year shouldprovide the guidance needed to place our assets to workmore efficiently in the twenty-first century.A little over a month ago  one of the deadliestearthquakes of the century struck the northwest ofTurkey. This is the most populous region of my country.The devastating quake claimed more than 15 000 lives and thrice as many were wounded. It left about half amillion people homeless. We have  undoubtedly  derivedgreat fortitude from the exemplary display of solidarityand the swift response of the international community.The best qualities of human nature were at work: sharingthe other's agony and lending a hand to help heal and toreconstruct.I would like to convey the gratitude of theGovernment and the people of Turkey to all Members the international community  the United Nations system along with the numerous volunteers and individuals whostood with us at our most trying hour.We express our deep feelings of sympathy for andsolidarity with those affected by the earthquake nearTaipei. In the face of the recent wave of earthquakes  webelieve this Organization can take a further step withregard to natural disasters. This would be in keeping withthe greater role of the United Nations in our lives. Thatis why my country  together with our neighbour Greece which also suffered a similar calamity recently  isintroducing a draft resolution to the General Assembly.This was eloquently announced by my Greek counterpart George Papandreou  yesterday in the General Assembly.We hope that it will receive Members' support.On the eve of the twenty-first century  Turkey looksforward to enhancing its contribution to internationalpeace and stability. At the epicentre of Eurasia  it aspiresto broaden the scope of cooperation and prosperity  whileit continues in its traditional role of connecting continentsand civilizations.37More specifically  Turkey is actively involved in theefforts to secure peace and stability in the Balkans  theMiddle East  the southern Caucasus region and CentralAsia. We also partake in their democratic and economicdevelopment efforts. Turkey enjoys the vast potential ofhistorical and cultural affinities with many of the countriesin the Caucasus region and Central Asia. We will work forthe resolution of the various conflicts in the region andcontinue to foster ever closer relations with all of them.Cooperation can rapidly lead the peoples of this regionto higher levels of wealth and prosperity. Central Asia willcertainly witness tremendous economic development  givenits rich human and natural resources. Turkey  lying at thehub  will become an energy terminal  connecting in moreways than one  the wealth and resources of Eurasia. We seethe mega-projects of the next century realized in ourcountry and our region.We are committed to the vision of a peaceful democratic  and prosperous future in south-eastern Europe.We will continue to bring forth our resources andcontributions to that end. The need for a large-scale andlong-term stabilization and reconstruction programme forthe entire region  and more urgently for Kosovo  is evident.We therefore welcome the stability pact for South-EasternEurope. In this context  it is important that the agreementsand arrangements on Kosovo are fully implemented  alongwith the continuation of support and assistance to Albaniaand Macedonia.As the wounds of the Bosnian tragedy are yet to behealed  the provisions of the Dayton Peace Agreement mustbe strictly observed and implemented.The tragedies in the Balkans have taught us to beabsolutely cautious and balanced in addressing conflict whether ethnic or otherwise. We do not have the luxury ofacting upon selective memory or one-sided preferences. Wecannot afford to impose solutions that do not correspond tothe realities and to the aspirations of the peoples concerned.A case in point is Cyprus. Until 1974 the TurkishCypriots suffered a great deal in protecting their legitimaterights and interests. There can be no return to those darkdays. A just and lasting compromise in Cyprus today canonly be based upon the existing realities. There are twoseparate peoples  two separate States in Cyprus. These twoStates should be able to solve their differences through theirown free will. In the meantime  there could be steps toimprove the atmosphere between the two sides by liftingthe unjust embargo on the Turkish Cypriots and by alsoadopting deconfrontational measures  as proposed by theUnited Nations Secretary-General.On our part  we believe that the confederationproposal provides the basis for a realistic and viablesettlement in Cyprus.We are encouraged by the recent developments inthe Middle East peace process. Once mutual tolerance andunderstanding start to fully reign over this region  webelieve all nations will display fully their historiceconomic capabilities and their wisdom. My country willcontinue to actively support the aim of reaching lastingpeace and security in the Middle East.Following an exchange of letters with my Greekcounterpart  George Papandreou  about three months ago our two countries  Turkey and Greece  initiated jointcommittees to work on specific issues. Since then high-ranking officials of the Foreign Ministries held tworounds of meetings and explored the possibilities ofpromoting cooperation. Committees were mandated in thefields of tourism  environment  trade  culture  regionalcooperation and the fight against organized crime  illegalimmigration  drug trafficking and terrorism.Both sides are agreed that there is scope for furthercooperation in these fields and identified specific projectsto this end. Turkey has the will to carry this process toother spheres of our relationship. Following theearthquakes that struck the two countries  the emotionsand solidarity displayed by the Turkish and Greek peoplesdemonstrate that the two peoples will not acceptconfrontation and tension as a way of life  and that theyprefer friendship. This powerful message of our peopleswill help our Governments to move forward with greaterconfidence.Turkey will this year host the last summit of thecentury. The Organization for Security and Cooperationin Europe (OSCE) summit to be held in Istanbul inNovember will set the stage for important decisions. Theoutcome will play a significant role in shaping the futuresecurity and cooperation architecture in the Eurasianlandscape.Our political resolve to promote peace and stabilityover such a wide horizon is on record. Given theopportunity  we are prepared to take upon ourselves evengreater responsibilities.38Turkey has presented its candidature for membershipon the United Nations Security Council for 2001-2002. Wewant to contribute to the making of the next millennium asa member of the Council. We ask for Members' support.The compelling lesson to be drawn from the twentiethcentury is that our highest priority should be the protectionof the dignity of humankind and the enhancement of thequality of life. Whether it is to halt aggression  to stopcrimes against humanity  to purge societies of racist andxenophobic tendencies  of cultural and religious intolerance to combat international terrorism  to provide humanitarianassistance  to bridge the gap between the rich and the pooror to secure sustainable economic and social development we should act as an international coalition — that is  as theUnited Nations.Let us make the twenty-first century the new age ofnations united for a more humane and prosperous era forall."
"167",7066,"TZA",54,1999,"Let me begin by congratulatingyou  Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  on your election as Presidentof the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session. This isan expression of delegations’ confidence in and high esteemfor your diplomatic skills  and reflects also thedistinguished role which your country has played infurthering the goals of this Assembly. I assure you of thefull support and cooperation of the Tanzanian delegation asyou guide the deliberations during this session.I wish also to commend your predecessor  Mr. DidierOpertti  for ably presiding over the Assembly at its fifty-third session. I congratulate very specially the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Kofi Annan  for theable and distinguished manner in which he has continuedto manage and guide the affairs of our Organization in theface of many daunting challenges.This last General Assembly session of the centuryand millennium  provides an opportunity to review thepast and draw lessons from it. We must build on thepositive  even as we mobilize the individual and collectivewill to avoid carrying the baggage of poverty  conflict andhuman rights violations into the next century. The role ofthe United Nations system must also be re-examined inaccordance with the new vision we have for the future.The twentieth century witnessed tremendousadvances in science and technology. But the benefits werenot shared widely  let alone equally. Unprecedentedeconomic development and prosperity has been attained with world consumption topping $24 trillion in 1998 twice the level of 1975 and six times that of 1950. But on a world scale  the 20 per cent of the world’s people inthe highest income countries consumed 86 per cent of theworld’s goods and services  producing a correspondingdegree of pollution and environmental damage. And awhole fifth of humanity has been left completely out ofthis prosperity.This century has also experienced major internationalconflicts  particularly the two world wars. The existenceof a bipolar system driven by ideological differences  andthe resultant arms race that led to the abuse of sciencewhich was the development of weapons of massdestruction  including nuclear weapons  exacerbated thesecurity situation in the world. To its credit  the UnitedNations Organization has laid the foundation andframework for the attainment of peace  security development and human rights. The United Nations activelysupported liberation struggles all over the world  and we areentering the new millennium having accomplished themission of political decolonization in most countries. Ofparticular gratification to Africa is the end of apartheid.We have also witnessed the end of the cold war  eventhough the peace dividend has yet to reach all corners ofthe globe and include the innocent victims of the cold war.For  as the African proverb has it  when two elephantsfight  it is the grass that suffers.Africa has unfortunately been left behind indevelopment. Despite the positive macroeconomicachievements in recent years  the average Africanhousehold today consumes 20 per cent less than it did 25years ago. Other new  critical challenges facing Africainclude conflicts and the urgent need to consolidate the ruleof law  human rights and democratic governance.The United Nations in the coming century will bemeasured  among other things  by the degree to which theseissues  particularly the development dimension  areaddressed. The United Nations  by virtue of its globalreach  its universal membership and its impartiality  has avital role to play to ensure there is equity between theresponse to the challenges facing Africa and those facingother parts of the world.The United Nations should also continue its role ofcoordinating the United Nations system  including theBretton Woods institutions  the World Trade Organizationand regional economic commissions. We reiterate the needfor broadening and strengthening the participation ofdeveloping countries in international decision-making.Democracy and good governance between nations is asimportant to humanity as democracy and good governancewithin nations.Processes of liberalization and globalization of theworld economy have profound implications for Africa andother least developed countries in terms of their position inthe world economy  their development prospects  the natureof their economic policies and their impact on economicsovereignty.The community of nations  at the dawn of a newmillennium  should rethink the mechanisms and policiesthat underpin the functioning of the global economy tocreate a conducive international environment that ensuresthe rapid economic development of the least developedcountries. We need a system whose pillars are growth stability and social equity  and which should facilitate theintegration of least developed countries into the worldeconomy in a beneficial way.These countries  particularly those in Africa  remainconstrained by weak supply capabilities  which  whencompounded by an unfavourable international economicenvironment  limit their ability to benefit fromglobalization. The trend of the last few years does notgive us much comfort. From 1990 to 1996  Africanexports of goods grew by only 2 per cent on average.The long-term objective of our development effortsis to improve production of quality goods and servicesthat can meet local needs and be exported. We see tradeas a dynamic force for accelerating growth anddevelopment. We are  however  aware of our limitationsin producing such products for the international market.Our economies still largely rely on the production ofcommodities  in respect of which terms of trade continueto worsen. The issue of commodities should thus continueto be central to the international development agenda. Inparticular  we urge the international community to provideresources and technical assistance to countries that dependon commodities to build the capacity for vertical andhorizontal diversification of commodities.Furthermore  developed countries and fundinginstitutions should increase their support to the CommonFund for Commodities  including fulfilment of theirpledges. The United Nations should also reconsider theproposal for the establishment of a special fund topromote commodity diversification in Africa.We hope that the Seattle ministerial meeting of theWorld Trade Organization (WTO) will give furtherimpetus to the implementation of measures to assist leastdeveloped countries to become integrated into theinternational trading system in a meaningful way. We callupon the donor community to extend financial andtechnical assistance towards the implementation ofintegration frameworks prepared by the least developedcountries.The burden of debt is one of the main obstacles tothe achievement of the economic and social developmentobjectives of African and other least developed countries.These countries devote a high proportion  in some cases2exceeding 30 per cent  of government revenue to debtservice payment  with the consequent risk of social andpolitical instability. We welcome the various debt reliefinitiatives undertaken by the donor community. Theyprovide some relief  but more far-reaching measures including debt forgiveness  need to be taken urgently tohave an impact on poverty.Tanzania welcomes the revisions made to the HeavilyIndebted Poor Countries Debt (HIPC) Initiative at theCologne summit of the Group of Seven. However  ifgrowth is to be sustained  adequate levels of externalfunding must complement our economic reform efforts. Norshould debt relief under the HIPC Initiative be a substitutefor increased bilateral non-debt-creating aid  and neithershould it be financed through reallocation of committed aid.Tanzania has established a multilateral-debt-relief fundto help it service multilateral debt so as to direct thesavings to poverty-reducing activities in the social sector such as education  health and water services. We haveshown that it is possible to link debt relief directly topoverty eradication initiatives in a transparent andaccountable manner that involves government  civil societyand donor countries. The debt relief we have receivedthrough the fund has gone straight to cushioning the socialsector budget. I want to thank the Governments ofDenmark  Finland  Ireland  the Netherlands  Norway Sweden and the United Kingdom  which have contributedto our war on poverty by contributing to our multilateral-debt-relief fund account.My delegation is deeply disturbed by the drasticdecline in official development assistance to less than onethird of the internationally agreed target of 0.7 per cent ofthe gross national product of donor countries. For five yearscontinuously  from 1992 to 1997  aid as a percentage ofgross national product in countries of the Organization forEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) fell  froma combined average of 0.33 per cent to an all-time low of0.22 per cent. This trend needs to be reversed as a matterof urgency.But what is needed is aid that increasingly enhancesour capacity for ownership of the development agenda andprocess  and our capacity to be self-developing. We do notwant the kind of aid that takes from us the initiative fordevelopment in dignity  and increases rather than reducesdependency on aid. Among other things  we need aid thatwill help us develop an attractive environment for private-sector investment  domestic and foreign.Technology is a key factor in the developmentprocess. The recent great strides in technology presenttremendous opportunities for human development.However  this technological revolution has largelybypassed African and other least developed countries. TheUnited Nations  and the international community at large should facilitate and finance access to and transfer oftechnology  including new and environmentally soundtechnologies  for developing countries on favourable including consessional  or grant terms.Tanzania is working closely with other countries tofind a peaceful resolution to conflicts in the Great Lakesregion  particularly in Burundi and in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo. The Burundi peace process  underthe facilitation of Mwalimu Julius K. Nyerere  is goingwell in Arusha. The main sticking point is securityarrangements that would instil confidence and trust forall  as well as a democratic process involving allstakeholders. We hope that these problems will beresolved in the coming rounds of talks  so that a peaceagreement can be reached as soon as possible. Theinternational community should therefore continue urgingfull participation by all the key players in the Arushapeace process. All attempts to wreck the negotiations under any pretext  should be discouraged.Concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo it is very encouraging that all the parties involved in theconflict have finally signed the Lusaka ceasefireAgreement. The challenge ahead is to not let themomentum ebb  but to move expeditiously to implementthe truce  including sending and empowering Organizationof African Unity (OAU) observers and a United Nationspeacekeeping force  as envisaged.Angola continues to experience a fratricidal warwaged by rebel UNITA forces against the legalGovernment of Angola. Clearly  Jonas Savimbi hasviolated the Lusaka Peace Agreement and has showncontempt for international opinion. It is counterproductivefor the United Nations to remove its observer team fromAngola  as this would send a negative signal that theinternational community is abandoning Angola in its hourof need.The most recent summit of the Southern AfricanDevelopment Community (SADC)  held in Maputo expressed solidarity with the Government of PresidentDos Santos and pledged to give him moral and materialsupport. The international community should likewise beforthright in its support for the Angolan Government and3in condemning Jonas Savimbi as the war criminal that heis. Action commensurate with the gravity of his insolenceand his human rights abuses should likewise be takenagainst him.On Western Sahara  Tanzania is following closely thepeace process under the United Nations Mission for theReferendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO). We hope thata solution to the crisis will be found through a referendumas provided for in the United-Nations-brokered peaceprocess without any further unnecessary delays.My delegation commends the truces and negotiatedsettlements reached in the conflicts in Guinea-Bissau  SierraLeone and Liberia  even as we urge practical commitmentto peace and reconciliation in the Ethiopia-Eritrea war.I wish also to commend and encourage the positivedevelopments unfolding in Middle East. I urge ChairmanArafat and Prime Minister Barak to remain committed tothe peace process and to move with courage and vision tothe next stages that will ensure the durable and sharedpeace and security that has eluded the Palestinian andIsraeli people for so long.From this podium  I denounce the merchants of warfuelling conflicts on the African continent. Arms dealersshould stop supplying weapons to conflict areas. Countriesshould adhere to the relevant international conventionsprohibiting the arms trade  especially between non-stateentities. It is immoral and unacceptable that naturalresources such as gold  diamonds  oil and timber  whichshould be exploited to build a better future for Africanchildren  are being used instead to buy weapons from richcountries and arms dealers  with which to kill and maimthose very children and their parents.Associated with conflicts in the Great Lakes region isthe problem of refugees. Tanzania has received refugees forover 40 years now. As I speak  we still host over 800 000refugees  some in refugee camps and many others insettlement camps and elsewhere in society. We have alwaysreceived refugees out of humanitarian concerns in theAfrican way and in fulfilment of our internationalobligations. We have never turned away those fleeing tosave their lives  and we have never negotiated refugeequotas with other countries. Yet even for us  the timecomes when we must appeal for more help to give us thecapacity to provide succour and refuge to these people. Ipay tribute to the United Nations High Commissioner forRefugees  Mrs. Ogata  and her colleagues for the effortsthey are making to draw international attention to Africanrefugees and displaced persons.The Office of the United Nations HighCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has done much but it can only do as much as the international communitygives it resources to do. I urge greater support to UNHCRand other relief agencies working in Tanzania  and greatersupport to my Government.A lasting solution to the refugee problem  however lies in resolving the root causes in the refugee-generatingcountries. This would enable UNHCR to begin therepatriation process  as was done successfully in the caseof Rwanda three years ago.Four years ago  the United Nations established theInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in Arusha.Apart from the Tribunal’s early teething problems  theGovernment of Tanzania lauds its many precedent-settingachievements in the emerging area of internationalcriminal justice. We commend the improvements in theefficiency of the Tribunal’s operations and managementunder its Registrar.As we pledge to continue fully supporting theTribunal in accordance with our obligations as the hostcountry  we call upon the United Nations and the entireinternational community to continue providing allnecessary support  including resources and manpower until the task of prosecuting all culprits in the Rwandagenocide episode is successfully accomplished. A strongand clear message must come out of this Assembly thatno war criminal will ever escape the long arm ofinternational law.Tanzania adds its voice to the denunciation of theviolent attempts to thwart the fulfilment of the desire ofthe people of East Timor to be free and sovereign  clearlyand preponderantly expressed in a free and fairreferendum. The results of the referendum must berespected and the Timorese people’s aspirations realized.The international community must assume itsresponsibility to see this process to a successfulconclusion. No effort and no sacrifice is too big to bemade in that regard. We commend and encourage thedecision of the Government of Indonesia to invite andcooperate with international efforts under the UnitedNations to stop the massacres and mayhem and to ensurethat the wishes of the majority of the people of EastTimor are unequivocally met.4We in Tanzania believe that no national or globalefforts to eradicate poverty can succeed unless and untilthey address the specific problems related to the poverty ofwomen. We urge the United Nations to continue promotinggender equality issues  including the provision of resourcesand technical assistance to enhance women’s education health and other projects aimed at their empowerment.My Government is striving to make sure that womenare given opportunity to fully participate in all levels ofdecision-making and that they get equal access to educationand access to credits on a preferential basis. We have alsotaken measures to protect women  girls and children fromsexual harassment and abuse. Tanzania has most stringentlegislation on sexual offences that provides for punishmentup to life imprisonment. There is also a new Land Lawproviding for complete gender equality in the ownership use and disposal of land and which supersedes customaryland law. There are also laws to protect the rights ofwomen in marriage  child custody and inheritance  whichare being reviewed to address all the concerns of women.Special efforts are also being made to increase theenrolment of girls and women at all levels of education.These are challenging times  especially for developingcountries. Yet  I believe there is a ray hope for building thefoundations of a more equitable and dynamic system ofinternational development cooperation through the smartpartnership approach of a “win-win” outcome for allplayers. As we enter the new millennium  I wish to reiterateour firm commitment to cooperating with others inachieving the goals of the United Nations Charter particularly those relating to the promotion of economicdevelopment and prosperity  peace and security and a betterworld for present and future generations.As we enter the century of globalization  let allGovernments ask the question: Are we globalizingprosperity or are we globalizing poverty? Are we strivingfor the kind of political correctness that eschews affluenceamid poverty or for that which manufactures euphemismsfor poverty  pretending it will go away? In a vivid cartoonin 1965  Jules Feiffer portrayed the plight of the poor inthese words:“I used to think I was poor. Then they told me Iwasn’t poor; I was needy. Then they told me it wasself-defeating to think of myself as needy; I wasdeprived. Then they told me that underprivileged wasoverused; I was disadvantaged. I still don’t have adime. But I have a great vocabulary.”That plight of the poor persists equally poignantly tothis day. We have spoken much; perhaps too much. Thearchives of this Organization are bursting with studies andideas and reviews. Let us strive to do more and talk lessin the new century."
"168",7109,"UGA",54,1999,"On behalf of the delegationof Uganda  I should like to congratulate His Excellency Mr.Theo-Ben Gurirab and all the Vice-Presidents on theirelection to guide the deliberations of the General Assemblyat its last session of this century. I also thank the Presidentof the General Assembly at its fifty-third session for theeffective manner in which he discharged his responsibilities.Allow me also to pay a well-deserved tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for his tireless efforts on behalfof the United Nations  especially in the area of themaintenance of international peace and security.Uganda is pleased to welcome to membership of theUnited Nation the Republic of Kiribati  the Republic ofNauru and the Kingdom of Tonga.At the end of this turbulent century and on the eve ofwhat my delegation hopes will be a more peaceful andprosperous new century  the United Nations stands out asthe best hope for the future of humankind  internationalcooperation and solidarity. Uganda believes that a strongand effective United Nations is the best guarantor ofworld peace and the most effective instrument to preventanother world war. My Government is thereforedetermined to play a constructive role in ensuring that theUnited Nations of the twenty-first century will beincreasingly dedicated to the noble principles andpurposes enshrined in the Charter. Those principles andpurposes  which have stood the test of time  mustcontinue to serve the peoples of the world and guide thisworld Organization.At the dawn of the twenty-first century  theeconomic situation in Africa and the living conditions ofthe vast majority of Africans are a cause of concern formy delegation. By virtually any standard  the Africancontinent remains marginalized. The statistics for thecontinent are dismal. With slightly over 10 per cent of theworld's population  sub-Saharan Africa accounts for ameagre 1.5 per cent of world trade. The region receivesless than 0.6 per cent of total foreign direct investment.Coupled with this is the fact that Africa's export earningshave been on the decline due to a significant decrease inthe demand for primary commodities; Africa's terms oftrade have not improved; a crushing debt burden and aserious lack of capacity to generate domestic savings haveworsened the economic situation. These negative trendshave increased the dependence of most sub-SaharanAfrican countries on official development assistance  butofficial development assistance itself has also been on thedecline  falling from 0.33 per cent of the combined grossnational product of donors members of the Organizationfor Economic Cooperation and Development in 1992 to0.22 per cent in 1998. This is a far cry from the 0.7 percent target agreed upon by the international community inthe early 1970s.The current state of economic globalization indicatesthat Africa remains the least integrated continent and themost marginalized economically. Africa has effectivelybeen locked out of the benefits accruing fromglobalization. The challenge before the internationalcommunity is to adopt and implement  as a matter ofurgency  concrete measures to mitigate the negativeconsequences of globalization on African economies. TheUnited Nations must take the lead in efforts to restructurethe international monetary system to make it moreresponsive to the plight of African and other developingcountries. Uganda believes that fundamental restructuringof the present international economic system is essentialto transform the world from a mere constellation ofwealthy cities surrounded by a galaxy of abject povertyinto a truly global village.33The pivotal role played by transnational corporationsin this inequitable economic system demands that theUnited Nations play a more active role in our collectiveefforts to regulate the activities of these powerful non-stateactors. My delegation would like to propose the revival ofthe United Nations Centre on Transnational Corporationsand the United Nations Commission on TransnationalCorporations for that purpose. The increasing control anddominance exercised by global corporations over the worldeconomy has serious consequences for many of us. It istime Governments  and not multinational corporations  setthe international agenda for economic cooperation anddevelopment.I would like to underscore Uganda's commitment touphold the tenets of human rights and fundamentalfreedoms. We believe in the Universal Declaration ofHuman Rights and all other international human rightsinstruments. At the national level  Uganda has incorporatedthe universal principles of human rights into the basic lawof the country  and we are committed to the principles ofgood governance  transparency and accountability.The world is aware of the great debate taking place inUganda about the process of our democratization. Inaccordance with our Constitution  the people of Ugandawill exercise a free choice to determine their system ofgovernance in a referendum next year. I take thisopportunity to invite observers and others who may wish towitness the referendum to do so when the time comes.With regard to internal conflicts  Uganda has granteda blanket amnesty to all who lay down their arms andbecome part of civil society. An amnesty Bill is before ourParliament  and in a very short time will be passed intolaw.I would be remiss if I did not emphasize Uganda'scommitment to the observance  in the region  of humanrights and fundamental freedoms. In 1994 the world waswitness to genocide in Rwanda in which an estimated 1million people were massacred. A similar act was about tobe perpetrated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo inthe course of 1997 and 1998. Apart from our legitimateconcerns about our national security and territorial integrity Uganda finds it unacceptable that gross violations of theright to life should again be carried out in itsneighbourhood or anywhere else in the world.It is vital for all of us to recognize the sanctity of theright to life. We are glad to note that the evolution ofinternational law on human rights no longer condonesgenocide under the guise of non-interference in acountry's internal affairs. The principle of non-interferencein the internal affairs of States has been so fundamentallyeroded that the international community should nowopenly adopt a definitive convention which will permitinstant intervention in cases of massive threats to the rightto life.In July 1998 the United Nations Conference ofPlenipotentiaries overwhelmingly adopted the Statute forthe establishment of an International Criminal Court.Uganda has consistently identified itself with the entireprocess which culminated in the adoption of the Court'sStatute. It was to many a triumphant moment for thosehitherto yearning for a world in which individual persons regardless of their socio-economic or political attributes would be held personally accountable for acts oromissions resulting in genocide  war crimes and crimesagainst humanity. At present work is under way in thePreparatory Commission for the Court to defineaggression as a core crime. Once the Statute comes intoforce  it holds humanity's best hope for a new world legalorder under which nobody  however high or low  canengage in horrendous crimes with impunity.We urge the international community to support ourefforts in the Great Lakes region focused on stopping averting and reversing progression towards further chaosand restoring peace. Such support must include realimprovement of the socioeconomic wellbeing of ourpeoples through debt cancellations  promotion ofdemocratic governance  adherence to sustainable humanrights standards and  above all  strengthening our regionalconflict- resolution mechanisms  peacemaking and peace-building initiatives.Throughout this year world attention has beenrepeatedly drawn to the fact that citizens of the world areabout to enter a new millennium. I would like to sharewith the Assembly Uganda's expectations for the newcentury and millennium with regard to the role of theUnited Nations.We in Uganda recognize that the United Nationsplayed a pivotal role in the decolonization of Africa andother parts of the world. The United Nations played anequally vital role in the eradication of institutionalizedracial discrimination in southern Africa. For all theseefforts we are grateful.The question arises as to what should be the visionand goals of the United Nations through the next century.34It is the view and expectation of the people of Uganda thatthe focus of the United Nations should be the eliminationof poverty in Africa and the rest of the underdevelopedworld. The factors underlying underdevelopment have beenmentioned several times. However  implementation ofsolutions has fallen short of expectations.We urge the United Nations to adopt concretemeasures to deal with problems of the external debt burden illiteracy  disease and famine. We expect the UnitedNations  through the World Trade Organization  to create amore favourable international trading regime which canpromote fair competition and permit the ascendancy ofprimary commodity producers from abject poverty toreasonable wealth.Uganda supports the heroic struggle of the Sahraouipeople for self-determination  and we look forward to theholding of a referendum by the United Nations to enablethe people of that territory to freely determine their destiny.My delegation would like to express deep appreciation tothe Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  and former UnitedStates Secretary of State  Mr. James Baker  for their tirelessefforts in this regard. We appeal to the Government of theKingdom of Morocco to respect the verdict of the Sahraouipeople and to facilitate the implementation of whateverdecision they make.The situation in the Great Lakes region  andparticularly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  hasbeen cause for serious concern  not only to the countries inthe region  but also to the international community. On itspart  Uganda continues to view issues of peace and stabilityin the region with the utmost seriousness  which theydeserve.Uganda's desire for peace and stability is born out ofits conviction that without regional peace and security therecan be no meaningful economic development and socialwell-being of its people. Uganda is hopeful that theconflicts that today beset many countries in the region willgive way to peace and eventual socio-economictransformation. We are also hopeful that  with the region'sresolve  we shall be able to surmount the challenges andexploit the opportunities of the new millennium. Indeed sustained efforts are being made to put an end to the crisisand contribute to the search for peaceful solutions to theproblems facing the region. And whereas efforts andcontributions towards peace in the region have traversed along and difficult road  there is optimism for the future.In the Democratic Republic of the Congo  thecountries in the region  with the support of theinternational community  have been working tirelesslytowards promoting a peaceful solution to the crisis. Weacknowledge the regional efforts  under the leadership ofPresident Frederick Chiluba of Zambia  which culminatedin the signing of the ceasefire Agreement. I pay tribute toall the parties concerned for this achievement and to allwell-wishers for their continued support for the peaceprocess. The Agreement was thoroughly negotiated to thesatisfaction of all the parties.Uganda appeals to the international community toassist in efforts to operationalize the Joint MilitaryCommission and the Political Committee  which areorgans of the Lusaka Agreement and the key to thesuccess of this Agreement and  therefore  to peace in thesubregion.Uganda is committed to the implementation of theLusaka Agreement and believes that all the signatories tothe Agreement are committed to its success. Against thisbackground  it was unnecessary for this matter to beincluded on the agenda of the current session of theGeneral Assembly. The Ceasefire Agreement essentiallycovers the two primary causes of the conflict in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  namely  the externaland internal dimensions. Regarding the externaldimension  a mechanism was established to handle thesecurity concerns of the Democratic Republic of theCongo and its neighbouring countries  including Uganda.In particular  the Security Council was requested  incollaboration with the Organization of African Unity  toconstitute  facilitate and deploy an appropriatepeacekeeping force in the Democratic Republic of theCongo to ensure implementation of the Agreement including the tracking down  disarming and documentingof all renegade forces in the Democratic Republic of theCongo.Regarding the internal dimension  the Congoleseparties agreed to undertake political negotiations as aresult of which the parties are expected to conclude anagreement leading to a new political dispensation in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  to the restructuringand rebuilding of a new national army in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo and to the establishment andstrengthening of State administration over the entireterritory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It isUganda's hope that the inter-Congolese negotiations willprovide an opportunity for the Congolese parties toaddress issues of good governance. Our desire for the35Congolese people to reach mutual understanding derivesfrom the fact that political instability in any neighbouringcountry directly impinges on our own security andeconomic development. We will look forward  therefore  tothe early beginning and success of the inter-Congolesenegotiations.Regarding the conflict in the Sudan  Uganda supportsthe ongoing peace initiative launched under the auspices ofthe Inter-governmental Authority on Development (IGAD)and with the facilitation of President Daniel arap Moi ofKenya. As a neighbour and a member of IGAD  Ugandahas been working closely with the other countries in theregion in efforts aimed at a peaceful resolution of theconflict. However  peace in that country remains elusive.Uganda is convinced that the fundamental issue in theSudanese crisis is the link between state and religion. In amultireligious and multicultural society such as the Sudan the only way to achieve good governance is to guaranteefreedom of worship  equality and respect for all.At the bilateral level  we are concerned at theincreasing hostility towards Uganda from the Sudan  asmanifested in the consistent violation of Uganda's territorialintegrity and in active support for rebel groups that aredestabilizing us. Uganda has embraced and will continue toembrace all initiatives aimed at reconciliation with theSudan  despite the fact that all previous initiatives havefailed. I would like to single out initiatives by formerPresident Rafsanjani of Iran  President Bakili Muluzi ofMalawi  President Qadhafi of Libya  former PresidentMandela of South Africa and others — all these effortshave come to naught.The three East African countries of Kenya  Tanzaniaand Uganda are very conscious of the fact that politicalstability is a prerequisite for economic development andhave taken the necessary measures to achieve this objective.The three countries  together with their partners in theregion  are engaged in regional peace efforts for Burundi the Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo through organizations such as IGAD and the SouthernAfrican Development Community. The three countries haveinvested in peace in order to ensure regional stabilitybecause of the recognition that peace and political stabilityare vital if the region is to attract investments.Today  our region has created a favourableenvironment for foreign investment. There exists a verystrong political will to move the region towards closercooperation. We have harmonized many of our economicpolicies  and a number of joint activities in support ofregional economic integration are being undertaken. Thethree countries are now in an advanced stage ofcementing the relationship by signing a treaty that wouldestablish the East African Community before the end ofthe year. We thank our development partners who havebeen supporting our efforts towards regional economicintegration and look forward to continued cooperation especially in the area of infrastructure development and inthe field of capacity-building for the private sector  whichhave been identified as the key areas.In conclusion  I would like to state that Ugandashares the vision of an African renaissance in whichAfrican peoples participate fully in their systems ofgovernance and in the process of determining theirdestiny. We believe that this is a recipe for rapideconomic development and therefore for the eradicationof poverty in Africa."
"169",7156,"UKR",54,1999,"Allow me first of all  Sir to extend my most sincere congratulations on yourelection to the presidency of the fifty-fourth session of theGeneral Assembly and to wish you every success indischarging this extremely responsible mission. Thiselection is a well-deserved tribute to the personal qualitiesof the dean of African Foreign Ministers  as well asevidence of the indisputable authority your country enjoysamong the members of the international community. Theactive and responsible position of Namibia as a memberof the Security Council serves as another confirmationthat the right choice was made by this General Assembly.I would also like to express our gratitude to yourpredecessor  Mr. Didier Opertti  for his effectiveorganization of the work of the fifty-third session of theGeneral Assembly. In addition  I have the pleasure togreet three new United Nations Members — Kiribati  theRepublic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga. Ukrainesincerely welcomes them into our family.The twentieth century will remain  in the history ofmankind  as one of unprecedented ideological clashes with subsequent divisions of the world. The last 10 years however  have been marked by an entente universelle tobuild this world on the basis of respect for cultural21diversity and universally recognized values. Thistumultuous period of transition from bloc rivalry torapprochement and cooperation obviously lacks stability andclear vision. That is why the role of the United Nations  afirm anchor in these troubled waters  takes on increasingand immense importance for all of its Member States.I would like to place special emphasis on onefundamental factor that determines the significance of theUnited Nations and makes it universally meaningful. On theeve of the twenty-first century  we have to admit thathumankind is still far from achieving the purposesproclaimed in the Charter of the United Nations. But at thesame time  we must recognize that this document  whichhas withstood the test of time  has remained the mostambitious yet most realistic code of world order for morethan half a century. There exists no alternative to the orderdefined by the rules and principles of the United Nations as no alternative exists to the Organization itself  which isdestined to be the centre for the coordinated actions ofnations in achieving and maintaining such an order.This vision of the Organization's significance tointernational life is what has prompted Ukraine to take anactive position in carrying out concerted efforts aimed atstrengthening the United Nations. Two years ago  we allwelcomed the programme of institutional reforms putforward by the Secretary-General  which were designed toadapt and update the Organization and to ensure its abilityto promptly respond to the challenges of our time. Thatpowerful start  however  dwindled to a slow pace  while ourinitial optimism and our readiness to go ahead with theprogramme of reforms of the United Nations remainedlargely unrealized.This sort of criticism is all the more pertinent when itcomes to the reform of the principal United Nations organentrusted with primary responsibility for the maintenance ofinternational peace and security. For years  all of us seemedto be in agreement on the need to modernize the SecurityCouncil and replenish it with new energy and fresh ideas.I am confident that a new impetus should be given to thework of the Working Group on Security Council reform toget the matter off the ground in the course of the currentsession.What could our response be to the challenges thathave haunted humankind for the last 55 years? First  themost important conclusion that we can draw from all of theUnited Nations deficiencies is this: for the Organization tomanage to unite nations around basic universal values  itmust have adequate tools to protect these values. Universalvalues must enjoy full support by means of legal political  economic and military enforcement.Secondly  the age of confrontation is giving way toan age of cooperation. We should create a world order inwhich it would be in no one's self-interest to wage wars oppress national minorities or exert economic pressure onother nations. A broad and ramified system of regionaland subregional cooperation would serve this purpose byupholding a universal code of conduct.In this context  I wish to refer to the recent summitheld in the Ukrainian city of Yalta  called “Baltic-BlackSea Cooperation: to the Integrated Europe of the 21stCentury Without Dividing Lines”. It would be noexaggeration to say that there is here an unavoidableparallel with Yalta 1945. That post-war summit was anexample of how three people decided the fate of theworld and divided Europe. Yalta 1999  on the contrary was evidence of how 22 neighbouring countries foundsufficient motivation to resolve their problems togetherand be unanimous in determining their future in a UnitedEurope.We are particularly encouraged by the increasedattention paid by the Security Council and the UnitedNations in general to humanitarian issues. A major lessonlearned from the eruption of numerous local and regionalconflicts is that there is an obvious and urgent need torespond to the challenges posed by humanitarian crisesand flagrant mass violations of human rights.The primary role of the Security Council inmaintaining and restoring international peace must bereiterated. This role is expressed in the clear and proudlanguage of the Charter. The past and continuingexperience of the Council underscores the importance ofthe adoption of a holistic approach that brings intoprominence both security and humanitarian issues. AsSecretary-General Kofi Annan imaginatively put ityesterday  a global era requires global engagement  andthe collective interest is the national interest.How can this ambitious goal be achieved? Animportant step forward towards the goal of protectinghuman life and dignity is  of course  the ongoing processof establishing the International Criminal Court. Today  ayear after the remarkable conclusion of the RomeDiplomatic Conference  we are pleased to observe that thesignificance of the adoption of the Court’s Statute iswidely and rightly recognized as it relates not only to thecodification and progressive development of international22law but also to the system of international security in thenext century.It is this perception of the nature and purposes of thefuture judicial institution that determines the position of theGovernment of Ukraine with regard to the signing of theRome Statute. I would like to take this opportunity toinform representatives that Ukraine intends to sign theStatute in the course of the current session of the GeneralAssembly.Guided by its belief that the United Nations andregional organizations should play a key role in conflictprevention  Ukraine was one of the first to come forwardwith peace proposals during the initial stage of the Kosovocrisis. The peace plan of President Kuchma of Ukraineproved to be realistic  since most of its provisions wereconsonant with the provisions of Security Councilresolution 1244 (1999).For years  Ukraine has been active in United Nationspeacekeeping operations. Last July  the President and theParliament of Ukraine decided to send an 800-strongcontingent from Ukraine to participate in KFOR. TheUkrainian military have gained a very positive profile merited by their earlier service in the United NationsProtection Force  the Implementation Force and theStabilization Force in Bosnia. Their expertise andcontributions outweighed by far the financial costs entailed.We fully recognize our share of responsibility in thecommon cause of restoring and strengthening peace in theBalkans.At the same time  recent events in Kosovo and EastTimor provide evidence that we should continue to increasethe level of security for peacekeepers. As a co-author of theConvention on the Safety of United Nations and AssociatedPersonnel  Ukraine appeals for the elaboration of furtherpractical measures to implement its provisions.The lesson of Kosovo proves that as long as humanrights or the rights of national minorities and internationallaw are ignored  the world will continue to be threatened byhumanitarian disasters. It is therefore necessary to payspecial attention to regions with so-called frozen conflicts:areas with the potential for new outbursts of violence refugee flows and economic recession. As a guarantor ofpeaceful settlement in Transdniestria  Moldova  and anactive supporter of the peace process in Abkhazia  Georgia and in Nagorny Karabakh  Azerbaijan  Ukraine is doing itsutmost to translate the relevant agreements into real peacesettlements.Joint efforts are also necessary in post-conflictrehabilitation. Ukraine therefore welcomes both the ideaand the adoption of the Stability Pact for South-EasternEurope and is actively proposing specific projects incooperation with its neighbours. The purpose of the Pactis not only to help reconstruct the Balkans but  mostimportantly  to give those countries a clear perspective onEuropean integration.Integration into European and Euro-Atlanticstructures remains the key priority of Ukraine’s foreignpolicy. Membership in the family of European nationsand sharing common values means economic growth stable democratic development and the consolidation ofthe European identity of Ukrainians. At the regional level Ukraine is an active participant in the Organization forBlack Sea Economic Cooperation  the Council of theBaltic Sea States  the Central European Initiative and theGUUAM forum  to which Georgia  Ukraine  Uzbekistan Azerbaijan and Moldova belong.I have already mentioned the Yalta Conference andthe summit of the leaders of Baltic and Black Sea States.In addition  last May Ukraine hosted a summit meeting ofeight Central European States. We are developingconfidence-building measures on a bilateral basis with ourneighbours and in a multilateral framework to reducenaval military activity in the Black Sea region. Pursuingthe line that intensive cooperation is the best remedy forconflicts  Ukraine is engaged in various trilateralcooperative agreements promoting free economic areasand transborder projects.As one of the founders of the United Nations Ukraine continues to make its contribution to UnitedNations efforts in strengthening international peace andsecurity  the non-proliferation regime  disarmament andarms control  crisis management  the promotion ofeconomic and social development  human rights andfreedoms and compliance with the fundamental principlesof international law. By fostering internal harmony insociety  creating an environment of stability and shapinga vast network of regional cooperation  Ukraine is strivingto make the fullest possible use of its rich experience andconstructive potential for the benefit of the wholeinternational community.Over three years ago  Ukraine voluntarily renouncedits nuclear stockpile — the third largest in the world —and it is strictly abiding by its commitments as anon-nuclear State. We should multiply our efforts toenhance the efficiency and universality of the Treaty on23the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). In thiscontext  it is of the utmost importance to break thestalemate in the preparatory process for the 2000 NPTReview Conference.Ukraine has signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) and is now successfully completinglegislative procedures to fulfil its international obligationsunder this Treaty. Last February  our country became aparty to the Ottawa Convention banning the use of anti-personnel landmines  while in March Ukraine’s Governmentdecided to prolong the moratorium on exports of all typesof anti-personnel landmines.My country is ready to participate in the developmentof collective measures to fight the proliferation of andillegal trafficking in small arms and light weapons. Wesupport the initiative of Canada and the Netherlands toestablish an international regime for the control of lightweapons and to start negotiations on working out aconvention on the prevention and combating of the illegaltransportation of firearms and light weapons.Aware of the danger of the uncontrolled circulationand accumulation of conventional weapons  Ukraine strictlyabides by Security Council and General Assemblyresolutions imposing restrictions on international armstrafficking. All of these factors explain Ukraine’s ambitionto be elected as a non-permanent member of the SecurityCouncil. Our ambition is particularly strong since it is ourfirst bid for this seat as an independent State.If elected  Ukraine would base its position in theSecurity Council on the following fundamental principles:paying adequate attention to conflicts and tense situationsin different parts of the world  judging them by the realrequirements of each particular case; using all political anddiplomatic means available to the Security Council toprevent or manage conflicts; increasing the importance ofthe humanitarian dimension among the Council’s priorities;and enhancing the ability of non-members of the SecurityCouncil to influence the decision-making process in thatbody. In addition  there is a need to analyse the presentmechanism of sanctions to ensure that their imposition isbalanced and well-grounded  in particular taking intoaccount eventual negative consequences for third countries.Ukraine remains deeply concerned at the problems ofAfrica. Our concerns are nurtured by the strong traditionalties of friendship that unite Ukraine with African nations.One could hardly disagree that Africa is a continent withunlimited potential for economic and social development.At the same time  it is absolutely imperative that theinternational community take very concrete and effectivesteps to assist African States in developing that potentialand in responding to the challenges facing their continent.Nowadays it is difficult to blame the United Nationsfor the lack of attention to Africa. For example  at thisvery moment  the members of the Security Council areresponding to a briefing on recent developments in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  given by the Presidentof the Republic of Zambia  His Excellency Mr. FrederickChiluba. In just a few days  the Security Council willhold another meeting to reaffirm its commitment to thecause of peace and prosperity in Africa. I intend topresent my delegation's contribution to the deliberationsof the Council  and will make more specific remarks onthis matter in the course of that meeting. At the sametime  Ukraine hopes that commitment to Africa on thepart of the Security Council and the United Nations as awhole will be reflected in concrete deeds that benefitAfrica.The situation in the Middle East requires closerattention by the Security Council. We believe that theSecurity Council should send strong encouragement to allthe parties to the Middle East peace process. It is time tocome back to the negotiating table to find a finalcompromise solution to the pending problems on the basisof the relevant Security Council resolutions. In thatcontext  Ukraine welcomes the recent signing of theSharm el-Sheikh Memorandum on 4 September  broughtabout thanks to the constructive approach of the newIsraeli Government and to the position taken by thePalestinian leadership.East Timor continues to be a hot spot. Ukrainewelcomed the success of the 30 August 1999 popularconsultation of the East Timorese people  which waspossible thanks to the constructive position taken by theGovernment of Indonesia and the active intermediarymission of the Secretary-General. Ukraine supported theSecurity Council's adoption of its resolution 1264 (1999) which authorized the establishment of a multinationalforce pursuant to the request of the Government ofIndonesia.The past year has been marked by an unprecedentedoutbreak of terrorist acts in various parts of the world.We are convinced that intensified international efforts tocombat terrorism need a more concentrated focus on theunderlying causes of this extremely acute internationalphenomenon  on its deep social roots and on relevant24historical conditions  as well as on situations that may giverise to international terrorism and endanger internationalpeace and security. At the same time  whatever actions areundertaken at the international  regional or national levels they must all be in full conformity with the basic principlesof international law and must not run counter to thefundamental provisions of the United Nations Charter.Underdevelopment and impoverishment  the threat ofmarginalization  the burden of external debt  a lack ofresources  and ecological disasters pose a real threat tointernational peace and sustainable development.Circumstances such as the global financial crisis and thewar in Kosovo have considerably impeded economicprogress in many parts of the world. Ukraine has managedto curb its losses and maintain macroeconomic stabilizationsince August 1998. On the other hand  the curtailment ofnavigation on the Danube has paralysed economic theactivities of Ukrainian shipping companies  ports andenterprises. The total accumulated losses of Ukraine amounttoday to more than $300 million. Together with Romania Bulgaria and other interested parties  we are ready to clearthe waterway for the soonest possible resumption ofnavigation as the best way to cope with the humanitarianhardships of Balkan peoples.Speaking about global issues requiring joint efforts ofthe international community  I must again emphasize theproblem of Chernobyl  which is so painful for Ukraine andfor its neighbours  Belarus and Russia. Our country ismeeting its commitments to decommission the Chernobylnuclear power plant as envisaged in the memorandum ofunderstanding between the Government of Ukraine andGovernments of the Group of Seven and the EuropeanUnion. It therefore has every ground to expect thefulfilment by its partners of their obligations. We welcomedthe statement issued by the Group of Seven in Cologne lastJune regarding the convening of a second pledgingconference for the mobilization of financial resources toimplement the working plan on the transformation of theShelter facility into an ecologically safe system. Weconsider this to be a confirmation by our partners of theircommitment to the memorandum of understanding.From this rostrum I call upon all potential donors totake part in that conference and to make pledges to theChernobyl Shelter fund  to enable it to reach the requiredamount of just $770 million. According to the HumanDevelopment Report published by the United NationsDevelopment Programme  expenditures for cigarettes inEurope amounted to $50 billion in 1998 alone. Comparedto this  the amount needed for Chernobyl looks like quitea small price to save the environment of that vast region.The present century gave the world so notable adocument as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Still  we have witnessed the most brutal and massiveviolations of those rights. Famine  genocide  ethniccleansing  torture and various forms of discriminationcontinue to haunt mankind. That is why the strengtheningof international mechanisms to monitor human rightsviolations is especially urgent today. The Office of theUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rightsshould play a leading role. Cases of the most massiveviolations of human rights should be considered by theSecurity Council with a view to taking preventive orcoercive measures.Hence  it is imperative to strengthen the role ofinternational law in international relations in order toensure strict observance of the main norms and principles first and foremost respect for sovereignty and territorialintegrity and the peaceful settlement of disputes. Ukrainecontinues to support the International Court of Justice asthe Organization's principal legal institution.The establishment of a world system that wouldguarantee peace and security  prosperity and sustainableeconomic development  and the preservation of theenvironment for future generations requires decisive jointaction by the international community. That processshould be led by a reformed and renewed United Nations an organization with great experience and opportunities tosolve problems of global dimensions. For that purpose the General Assembly has approved a comprehensiveprogramme for United Nations reform — by the way under the presidency of my predecessor Hennadiy Y.Udovenko  who is present in this Hall today. But whiledebating it  we did not notice that two years had passedand that we were approaching the brink of themillennium. The prominent Ukrainian philosopher of theeighteenth century  Grigory Skovoroda  said that a wasteof time is the heaviest of all losses. Let us bring to lifewhat we have conceived for the benefit of the UnitedNations."
"170",7203,"URY",54,1999,"﻿Allow mefirst  on behalf of my Government and myself  tocongratulate Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  Minister for ForeignAffairs of Namibia  on his well-deserved election asPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourthsession. We wish him every success and assure him of mydelegation's sincere cooperation in carrying out his work.I also wish to express a warm welcome to the newMembers: the Republics of Kiribati and Nauru and theKingdom of Tonga.A little more than a week ago  we had the opportunityto address this same body at the close the fifty-third sessionof the General Assembly. On that occasion  we expresseda general view of the Organization as a whole  as well asof some of the items or questions of greater relevance. Thatview cannot differ basically from the one I am nowexpressing as Minister for Foreign Affairs of Uruguay.In order to contribute to the debate of ideas  we didnot silence then  nor will we now  certain views on theinternational community  on the changes it is experiencingand on the response capability of the United Nations toface the new situations or expectations of the MemberStates  especially the demands of regions or areas of theworld experiencing diverse types of suffering.This suffering is at times basically economic inorigin — call it underdevelopment or more simply poverty and even extreme destitution — with all theattending consequences of marginalization and exclusion.In other cases  suffering stems from problems ofcivilization that tend to show alarming signs ofdeterioration. We must also emphasize that the turmoiland instability experienced by peoples are not in everycase due to one and the same cause  whether of a materialor economic nature or because of the lack of resources.We observe phenomena such as violence dramatically present at the individual or collective level;terrorism of all kinds  blind and relentless; and  of course the drug problem in its diverse stages  including theentrepreneurial business of its traffic and its perversedestabilizing effect  and drug consumption  which isdestructive to the individual and is also related to familydissolution. There is also the absence of or weakness ineducational standards that adequately prioritize the ethicaldimension and human values as a great pedagogical goal.Perhaps none of us yet possesses the key to explainthe real origin of these pathological phenomena  but whatis very clear is that we cannot affect ignorance aboutthem  as if they were foreign to us — Governments States  peoples and organizations.Without prejudice to what was just said  werecognize first the central role the Organization must playin terms of international peacekeeping and security. Onthe other hand  it is necessary to give special attention tothe dreadful consequences of nationalist excesses  toconfront the exclusive and unfair fundamentalism ofreligions  to fight discrimination  whatever the basicclaims or pretexts are  and to make tolerance a basicprinciple of relations among individuals and peoples. Allare unavoidable duties of the United Nations.We must now establish and reaffirm our position asa Member State on those main items — some of whichare planned  others under way and others still to come —regarding what is to be done.I refer first to the reform of the Organization and ofthe Charter  and in particular to the reform of the Security22Council. These are priorities that must continue at a paceimposed by the complexity of the matter  by the currentstate of international relations and  above all  by theexpectation of world public opinion that movesmomentarily from hope to anxiety. If it is true  as it is said that time takes revenge on things done without priorconsultation  it is just as true that medicine refined for along time  as the Italian master Carnelutti reminds us  couldarrive too late  when the patient is already dead.Reform requires a balance  a balance between suddenneed and efficiency  between rigidity and flexibility andbetween unavoidable principles and the just appreciation ofnew realities. In favour of this balance  the GeneralAssembly approved in November 1998 resolution 53/30 requiring at least a two-thirds majority for the approval ofany reform relating to the membership of the SecurityCouncil. This dispelled concern about a reform beingapproved by non-representative majorities  opening up anew phase. This is contained in the report of the Open-ended Working Group on reform of the Security Council established by consensus by the General Assembly byresolution 48/26  in the chapter entitled “Observations”.It will be your task  Mr. President  to give renewedmomentum to this process on the basis of its progress andof other steps which  however modest and far fromresolving the matter  advance in denoting certain basicpoints concerning which there is at least a commondiagnosis. Although distant from final solutions  thesepoints are always adjustable to the changes of theinternational community.The Government of Uruguay  my country — an activeMember State of this Organization and of other world andregional organizations  both political and integrationones — has observed and continues to see well-constitutedinternational institutions as the main guarantee for theobservance a more just  foreseeable and fair internationalorder. Therefore  when distinguishing the vital from thesuperficial and rhetorical speech from the true search foragreements  which can involve reciprocal concessions  thedelegation of Uruguay will be in favour of change andagainst stagnation — but not just any change. It will favourchange that restores to the United Nations a level ofinternational recognition which  without sacrificing efficacy would make the Member States and their regions feel thatthey are a tangible and active reality  that those subregionscannot be under-represented.There is no longer a place for an elitist internationalsociety that freezes obsolete historical periods in time typical of a dialectic of confrontation measured in termsof the cold war. We must propose new formulas to avoidthe effect of blockage that in many cases produces theconspicuous right to veto  granting the Security Councilthe procedural means to break it and even entrusting theGeneral Assembly  under certain conditions  as proposedby my delegation  with new competencies so that it couldbe formally informed and its decision be required insituations which demand it  particularly when it concernscases that could involve the legitimate use of force.The recent problem in Kosovo  which continues could serve as a typical example of the aforementionedparalysing effect of the veto in the Security Council without forgetting the disturbing consequences that effectwould have in producing the marginalization of theUnited Nations system of peace and security  with theresulting questioning of the Organization itself and its realpossibilities.This  naturally  requires the foresight of internationallaw as the sole source of legitimacy  without ignoring theauthentic and grave humanitarian situations that areimposed on us by the drama of the real facts at a timewhen they require a formal framework of timely legitimate and efficient international action.We also attach special meaning to the improvementof the rules of procedure and the working methods of theSecurity Council  and we therefore trust that the proposalselaborated by the Open-ended Working Group will beadopted.An optimistic initiative of the Organization encouraged by the Secretariat and the Member States  isundoubtedly the so-called millennium summit  which willtake place at the fifty-fifth session of the GeneralAssembly. Regarding its agenda  there will be a certaintendency in favour of approving a main topic of commoninterest  capable of stirring the attention and participationof heads of State and Government.As this is the most important point now under debatehere  and since I wished to contribute when I wasPresident of the General Assembly  I now say quitesimply that in our view the main theme should be “TheUnited Nations: its future viability”. This would generate like the organs of a single body  related fundamentalissues  perhaps formulated as important questions  suchas: Towards a new system of international security? Doesglobalization demand new strategies of the worldOrganization? What more concrete strategies can there be23for the elimination of poverty and underdevelopment? Howcan we review the system for the protection of humanrights  with a view to strengthening and improving them particularly in the fields of the family  children  educationand international cooperation?Naturally  we are aware that for the millenniumsummit to be successful and give hope for the next century its agenda must reflect the expectations of Member States which still show marked differences. My Government willcontinue to participate in the preparation of the summit withinterest and in a responsible manner.The initiative for dialogue between civilizations —2001 is to be the United Nations Year of Dialogue amongCivilizations — proposed by Iran and approved byconsensus by the General Assembly at its fifty-thirdsession — is the kind of topic that is at the heart of theUnited Nations role and should be studied in depth. We areconvinced of the great importance of examining withextreme care the cultural diversity of Member States inorder to know each other better  but at the same timeunderstand the profound reasons why  despite our diversity we are all Member States of a unique universalOrganization: the United Nations.Support and respect for the San Francisco Charter isundoubtedly the starting point of any responsible dialogue.The Government of Uruguay will contribute its ideas andinitiatives  joining in the efforts of all delegations toimprove the international habitat through understanding andtolerance of peoples and ideas.Without prejudice to the important progress madetowards the establishment of a normative system against theproliferation of nuclear  chemical and biological weapons Uruguay considers it essential to take new steps in thisdirection through the universalization of the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT)  whosenorms must be recognized and accepted by all States.The abusive use of light weapons or small arms — asubject of great debate — whose uncontrolled proliferationis reaching unacceptable levels  with devastating effects  insome cases worse than those caused by weapons of massivedestruction  is a field in which the United Nations mustplay a fundamental role  as already reflected in theconvening of an international conference to deal with theillicit traffic in small arms  a conference which Uruguayfirmly supports.My country strongly believes in the need to replacethe “culture of conflict” with a “culture of peace”  so that as wisely stated by the Under-Secretary-General forDisarmament Affairs  Mr. Jayantha Dhanapala  “As thetwentieth century witnessed the creation of nuclearweapons  the twenty-first century will see theirdestruction”. The entry into force last March of theConvention on the Prohibition of the Use  Stockpiling Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and onTheir Destruction is an auspicious sign.A most significant milestone in the endless searchfor effective international ways to protect human rightswas the signing of the Statute of the InternationalCriminal Court in Rome in July 1998  during the sameyear in which the fiftieth anniversary of the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights was celebrated. Uruguay isparticipating and will continue to participate seriously inthe elaboration of complementary rules and proceduralprovisions to give the Court the basic elements toguarantee that it can work properly. When that process iscompleted the matter will come before our legislativebodies for consideration  in accordance with ourConstitution.In conclusion  the topics that concern and willcontinue to concern the United Nations are multiple anddiverse. At this very moment  for example  an instrumentthat has shown its effectiveness on various occasions isbeing employed again: the peacekeeping operation. I referhere to the one taking place in East Timor  with the primegoal of ensuring that the mandate of the Timorese peopleis implemented  and of preserving the lives and physicalintegrity of that people.Naturally  the environment  which is under attack paradoxically as much by unregulated over-developmentas by poverty  will continue to be on the Organization'sagenda  as well as the topic of population anddevelopment.But perhaps the essential need is to make themaximum effort to make the United Nations the point ofreference for all States  the most powerful and theweakest — the former so that they yield to theinternational order and the latter so that they adjust to it and find in the Organization their best shield. For allStates it means access to a modernity that will developthem and make them part of the current technicalinnovation  which is supported by the informationrevolution through which all of us  in one way or another will be introduced to the coming century.24"
"171",7250,"USA",54,1999,"Today  we look ahead to thenew millennium. And at this last General Assembly of thetwentieth century  we look back on a century that taughtus much of what we need to know about the promise oftomorrow. We have learned a great deal over the last onehundred years: how to produce enough food for agrowing world population; how human activity affects theenvironment; the mysteries of the human gene. Aninformation revolution now holds the promise of universalaccess to knowledge. We have learned that open marketscreate more wealth  that open societies are more just. Wehave learned how to come together  through the UnitedNations and other institutions  to advance commoninterests and values.Yet for all our intellectual and material advances  thetwentieth century has been deeply scarred by enduringhuman failures: by greed and lust for power  byhot-blooded hatreds and stone-cold hearts. At century’send  modern developments magnify greatly the dangers ofthese timeless flaws. Powerful forces still resistreasonable efforts to put a human face on the globaleconomy  to lift the poor  or to heal the earth’senvironment. Primitive claims of racial  ethnic or religioussuperiority  when married to advanced weaponry and2terrorism  threaten to destroy the greatest potential forhuman development in history  even as they make awasteland of the soul.Therefore  we look to the future with hope  but withunanswered questions. In the new millennium  will nationsbe divided by ethnic and religious conflicts? Will thenation-state itself be imperiled by them  or by terrorism? Orwill we keep coming closer together instead  while enjoyingthe normal differences that make life more interesting? Inthe new century  how will patriotism be defined — as faithin a dream worth living  or as fear and loathing of otherpeople’s dreams? Will we be free of the fear of weapons ofmass destruction  or forced to teach our grandchildren howto survive a nuclear  chemical or biological attack? Willglobalism bring shared prosperity  or will it make thedesperate of the world even more desperate? Will we usescience and technology to grow the economy and protectthe environment  or put it all at risk in a world dominatedby a struggle over natural resources?The truth is that the twentieth century’s amazingprogress has not resolved these questions. But it has givenus the tools to make the answers come out right — theknowledge  the resources  the institutions. Now  we mustuse them. If we do  we can make the millennium not justa changing of the digits  but a true changing of the times —a gateway to greater peace  prosperity and freedom. Withthat in mind  I offer three resolutions for the newmillennium.First  let us resolve to wage an unrelenting battleagainst poverty and for shared prosperity so that no part ofhumanity is left behind in the global economy.Globalization is not inherently divisive. While infantmortality in developing countries has been cut nearly in halfsince 1970  life expectancy has increased by 10 years.According to the United Nations Human DevelopmentIndex  which measures a decent standard of living  a goodeducation  a long and healthy life  the gap between rich andpoor countries on this measure has actually declined.Open trade and new technologies have been enginesof this progress; they have helped hundreds of millions tosee their prospects rise by marketing the fruits of their laborand creativity abroad. With proper investments in education developing countries should be able to keep their best andbrightest talent at home and to gain access to globalmarkets for goods and services and capital.But this promising future is far from inevitable. Weare still squandering the potential of far too many. As manyas 1.3 billion people still live on less than a dollar a day.More than half the population of many countries has noaccess to safe water. A person in South Asia is 700 timesless likely to use the Internet than someone in the UnitedStates. Forty million people a year still die of hunger almost as many as the total number killed in WorldWar II. We must refuse to accept a future in which onepart of humanity lives on the cutting edge of a neweconomy  while the other lives at the knife edge ofsurvival.What must we do? We can start by rememberingthat open markets advance the blessings andbreakthroughs we want to spread. That is why we in theUnited States have worked to keep our markets openduring the recent global financial crisis  though it hasbrought us record trade deficits. It is why we want tolaunch a new global trade round when the World TradeOrganization meets in Seattle this fall. It is why we areworking to build a trading system that strengthens thewell-being of workers and consumers  protects theenvironment and makes competition a race to the top  notthe bottom. It is why I am proud we have come togetherat the International Labour Organization to ban abusivechild labour everywhere in the world.We do not face a choice between trade and aid  butinstead the challenge to make both work for people whoneed them. Aid should focus on what is known to work:credit for poor people starting businesses  keeping girls inschool  meeting the needs of mothers and children.Development aid should be used for development  not tobuy influence or finance donors’ exports. It should gowhere Governments invest in their people and answer totheir concerns.We should also come to the aid of countriesstruggling to rise but held down by the burden of debt.The G-7 nations have adopted a plan to reduce by up to70 per cent the outstanding debt of the world’s poorestcountries  freeing resources for education  health andgrowth.All of us  developed and developing countries alike should take action now to halt global climate change.What has that to do with fighting poverty? A great deal.The most vulnerable members of the human family willbe hurt first and hurt most if rising temperatures devastateagriculture  accelerate the spread of disease in tropicalcountries and flood island nations.3Does this mean developing countries must sacrificegrowth to protect the environment? Absolutely not.Throughout history  a key to human progress has beenwillingness to abandon big ideas that are no longer true.One big idea that is no longer true is that the only way tobuild a modern economy is to use energy as we did in theindustrial age. The challenge and opportunity fordeveloping countries today is to skip the costs of theindustrial age by using technologies that improve theeconomy and the environment at the same time.Finally  to win the fight against poverty  we mustimprove health care for all people. Over the next 10 yearsin Africa  AIDS is expected to kill more people and orphanmore children than all the wars of the twentieth centurycombined. Each year diseases such as malaria  tuberculosisand pneumonia leave millions of children without parentsand millions of parents without children. Yet for all thesediseases  vaccine research is advancing too slowly  in partbecause the potential customers are too poor. Only 2 percent of all global biomedical research is devoted to themajor killers in the developing world.No country can break poverty’s bonds if its people aredisabled by disease and its Government overwhelmed bythe needs of the ill. With United Nations leadership  wehave come close to eradicating polio  once the scourge ofchildren everywhere. We are down to 5 000 reported casesworldwide. I have asked our Congress to fund a majorincrease to finish the job  and I ask other nations to followsuit. We have begun a comprehensive battle against theglobal AIDS epidemic. This year I am seeking another$100 million for prevention  counselling and care in Africa.I want to do more to get to those who need them most newdrugs that prevent transmission from mothers to newborns.And today I commit the United States to a concerted effortto accelerate the development and delivery of vaccines formalaria  tuberculosis  AIDS and other diseases thatdisproportionately affect the developing world. Manyapproaches have been proposed  from tax credits to specialfunds for the purchase of these vaccines.To tackle these issues  I will ask public-health experts the chief executive officers of our pharmaceuticalcompanies  foundation representatives and members ofCongress to join me at a special White House meeting andto strengthen incentives for research and development working with  not against  the private sector to meet ourcommon goal.The second resolution I hope we will make today is tostrengthen the capacity of the international community toprevent and whenever possible to stop outbreaks of masskilling and displacement. This requires  as we all know shared responsibility  like the one West African nationsaccepted when they acted to restore peace in SierraLeone; the one 19 democracies in the North AtlanticTreaty Organization (NATO) embraced to stop ethniccleansing in Bosnia and in Kosovo; the one that Asianand Pacific nations have now assumed in East Timor with the strong support of the entire United Nations including the United States.Secretary-General Annan spoke for all of us duringthe Kosovo conflict  and more recently in regard to EastTimor  when he said that ethnic cleansers and massmurderers can find no refuge in the United Nations  nosource of comfort or justification in its Charter. We mustdo more to make these words real. Of course  we mustapproach this challenge with some considerable degree ofhumility. It is easy to say “never again”  but much harderto make it so. Promising too much can be as cruel ascaring too little.But difficulties  dangers and costs are not anargument for doing nothing. When we are faced withdeliberate  organized campaigns to murder whole peoplesor expel them from their land  the care of victims isimportant but not enough. We should work to end theviolence. Our response in every case cannot and shouldnot be the same. Sometimes collective military force isboth appropriate and feasible. Sometimes concertedeconomic and political pressure combined with diplomacyis a better answer  as it was in making possible theintroduction of forces to East Timor. Of course  the waythe international community responds will depend on thecapacity of countries to act and on their perception oftheir national interests. NATO acted in Kosovo  forexample  to stop a vicious campaign of ethnic cleansingin a place where we had important interests at stake andthe ability to act collectively.The same considerations brought Nigerian troops andtheir partners to Sierra Leone and Australians and othersto East Timor. That is proper — so long as we worktogether  support each other and do not abdicate ourcollective responsibility. I know that some are troubledthat the United States and others cannot respond to everyhumanitarian catastrophe in the world. We cannot doeverything  everywhere. But simply because we havedifferent interests in different parts of the world does notmean we can be indifferent to the destruction of innocentsin any part of the world. That is why we have supportedthe efforts of Africans to resolve the deadly conflicts that4have raged through parts of their continent. It is why weare working with friends in Africa to build the AfricanCrisis Response Initiative  which has trained more than4 000 peacekeepers from six countries. It is why we arehelping establish an international coalition against genocideto bring nations together to stop the flow of money andarms to those who commit crimes against humanity.There is also a critical need for countries emergingfrom conflict to build police institutions accountable topeople and the law  often with the help of civilian policefrom other nations. We need international forces with thetraining to fill the gap between local police and militarypeacekeepers  as French  Argentine  Italian and othermilitary police have done in Haiti and Bosnia. We willwork with our partners and the United Nations to continueto ensure that such forces can deploy when they are needed.What is the role of the United Nations of in preventingmass slaughter and dislocation? Very large. Even inKosovo  NATO’s actions followed a clear consensus expressed in several Security Council resolutions  that theatrocities committed by Serb forces were unacceptable andthat the international community had a compelling interestin seeing them end. Had we chosen to do nothing in theface of this brutality  I do not believe we would havestrengthened the United Nations. Instead we would haverisked discrediting everything it stands for.By acting as we did  we helped to vindicate theprinciples and purposes of the United Nations Charter togive the United Nations the opportunity it now has to playthe central role in shaping Kosovo’s future. In the realworld  principles often collide and tough choices must bemade. The outcome in Kosovo is hopeful.Finally  as we enter this new era  let our thirdresolution be to protect our children against the possibilitythat nuclear  chemical and biological weapons will ever beused again. The last millennium has seen constant advancesin the destructive power of weaponry. In the comingmillennium  this trend can continue or  if we choose  wecan reverse it with global standards universally respected.We have made more progress than many realize. Afterthe collapse of the Soviet Union  Belarus  Kazakhstan andUkraine courageously chose to give up their nuclearweapons. America and Russia have moved forward withsubstantial arms reductions. President Yeltsin and I agreedin June  even as we await Russian ratification of START II to begin talks on a START III treaty that will cut our cold-war arsenals by 80 per cent from their height. Brazil hasjoined the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons (NPT)  capping a process that has almost totallyeliminated the threat of nuclear proliferation in LatinAmerica. We have banned chemical weapons from theEarth  though we must implement that commitment fullyand gain universal coverage. One hundred and fifty-twonations have signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-BanTreaty and  while India and Pakistan did test nuclearweapons last year  the international reaction proved thatthe global consensus against proliferation is very strong.We need to bolster the standards to reinforce thatconsensus. We must reaffirm our commitment to theNPT  strengthen the Biological Weapons Convention andmake fast progress on a treaty to ban production of fissilematerials. To keep existing stocks from the wrong hands we should strengthen the Convention on PhysicalProtection of Nuclear Materials. And today  again I askour Congress to approve the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.We must stop the spread of nuclear weapons materials and expertise at the source. Since 1992  we haveworked with Russia and the other nations of the formerSoviet Union to do that. We are expanding that effortbecause challenges remain  but thus far we can say thatthe nightmare scenario of deadly weapons flowingunchecked across borders and of scientists selling theirservices en masse to the highest bidder has been avoided.Now  we must work to deny weapons of massdestruction to those who would use them. For almost adecade  nations have stood together to keep the Iraqiregime from threatening its people and the world withsuch weapons. Despite all the obstacles Saddam Husseinhas placed in our path  we must continue to ease thesuffering of the people of Iraq. At the same time  wecannot allow the Government of Iraq to flout 40 — andI say 40 — successive United Nations Security Councilresolutions and to rebuild his arsenal.Just as important is the challenge of keeping deadlyweapons away from terrorist groups. They may haveweaker capabilities than States  but they have fewercompunctions about using such weapons. The possibilitythat terrorists will threaten us with weapons of massdestruction can be met with neither panic norcomplacency. It requires serious  deliberate  disciplinedconcern and effective cooperation from all of us.There are many other challenges. Today I havespoken about just three: the need to do something about5the world’s poor and to put a human face on the globaleconomy; the need to do more to prevent killing anddislocation of innocents; the need to do more to ensure thatweapons of mass destruction will never be used on ourchildren. I believe they are the most important. In meetingthem  the United Nations is indispensable.It is precisely because we are committed to the UnitedNations that we have worked hard to support the effectivemanagement of this body. But the United States also has aresponsibility to equip the United Nations with theresources it needs to be effective. As I think most Membersknow  I have strongly supported the United States meetingall its financial obligations to the United Nations and I willcontinue to do so. We will do our very best to succeed thisyear.When the cold war ended  the United States couldhave chosen to turn away from the opportunities anddangers of the world. Instead  we have tried to be engaged involved and active. We know this moment of uniqueprosperity and power for the United States is a source ofconcern to many. I can only answer by saying this: In theseven years that I have been privileged to come here tospeak to this body  America has tried to be a force forpeace. We believe we are better off when nations resolvetheir differences by force of argument rather than force ofarms. We have sought to help former adversaries likeRussia and China become prosperous  stable members ofthe world community because we feel far more threatenedby the potential weakness of the world’s leading nationsthan by their strength. Instead of imposing our values onothers  we have sought to promote a system ofgovernment — democracy — that empowers people tochoose their own destinies according to their own valuesand aspirations. We have sought to keep our markets openbecause we believe a strong world economy benefits ourown workers and businesses  as well as the people of theworld who are selling to us. I hope that we have been andwill continue to be good partners with the rest in the newmillennium.Not long ago  I went to a refugee camp in Macedonia.The people I met there  children and adults alike  hadsuffered horrible  horrible abuses  but they had never givenup hope because they believed that there is an internationalcommunity that stands for their dignity and their freedom.I want to make sure that  20 or 50 or 100 years from now people everywhere will still believe that about our UnitedNations. So let us resolve  in the bright dawn of the newmillennium  to bring in an era in which our desire to createwill overwhelm our capacity to destroy. If we do that  then through the United Nations and far-sighted leaders humanity finally can live up to its name."
"172",7274,"UZB",54,1999,"In mystatement  I should like to dwell on those questions  which in our opinion  demand special attention. First among theseis the issue of security and the maintenance of regional andglobal stability.Today  we are forced to recognize that terrorism is oneof the principal challenges and threats to internationalsecurity and stability in the twentieth century. Should theUnited Nations react to this most daunting challenge? Yes.The coordination of the efforts of the internationalcommunity in the search for legal mechanisms to fightterrorism at the global level has become urgent. Thestruggle against terrorism transcends the problems of onecountry or even groups of countries. I take this opportunityto emphasize in particular the serious threat of terrorismfacing the States of Central Asia. In this respect  I wish tosay the following.First  terrorists  using Islam — one of the world’smost peaceful religions  founded on the greatest cultures ofcivilization — as a cover  are seeking to attain the broadestof political goals: the creation of a new regional andultimately global order. The terrorists’ methods ofassassinating peaceful civilians and creating diversionsradically contradict the principles and values of Islam.Secondly  terrorism is undergoing an intensiveprocess of internationalization. Extremists working inCentral Asia are consolidating their ranks with recruitsfrom throughout the world. Terrorism has neithernationality  borders nor any particular belief. Attempts togive terrorism  and international terrorism in particular  anational or ethnic character do not reflect reality and havetheir own dangerous consequences.Thirdly  the fight against terrorism requirescoordinated international efforts and wide recognition ofthe legitimate rights of States to protect their citizensfrom terrorist assaults. Terrorists casually and mostinsolently attack peaceful populations and deprive humanbeings of their fundamental right to life.Fourthly  the global danger of terrorism is obvioustoday. There is an understanding at the international levelof the need for coordinated action. At the same time  wedo not fully understand the rather subdued reaction of theinternational community and the major States to the mostdangerous spread of terrorism in Central Asia  posing thethreat of regional and global destabilization.Finally  the contemporary wellsprings of terrorism where it is born and nurtured  are the theatres of militaryconflict. In our region  that means Afghanistan.A working meeting of the “six plus two” group inthe special format  with the participation ofrepresentatives of the two main parties to the Afghanconflict  was held in Tashkent two month ago. Thediscussion resulted in the signing of the TashkentDeclaration  defining the fundamental principles for thepeaceful settlement of the conflict in Afghanistan.Uzbekistan supports increased international efforts tofurther assist the stabilization of the situation in Tajikistanand the rapid elimination of new hotbeds of tension insouthern Kyrgyzstan  which has become a new target forinvasion by international terrorists and extremist forces.In this regard  I would propose the adoption of aresolution by the General Assembly to consider theproblem of terrorism in the framework of the SecurityCouncil  as well as the establishment of an informalgroup to coordinate efforts aimed at fighting terrorism andextremist crimes. We also support the proposal toconvene an international conference on the fight againstterrorism. We believe that the international community  in29preparing for the Millennium Assembly in the year 2000 should show its determination by defining extremist crimesand drafting its explicit understanding of the threat ofterrorism.The Republic of Uzbekistan is recognized around theworld as an authoritative supporter of the non-proliferationof the nuclear weapons. Uzbekistan is party to the Treatyon the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)  theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) and theConvention on Physical Protection of Nuclear Material. TheRepublic was among first countries to sign an AdditionalProtocol to its agreement with the International AtomicEnergy Agency on the application of safeguards inconnection with the NPT. These actions revealed not onlya deep understanding of the importance of theseinternational documents  but also our desire to make a realcontribution to solving the problem of the non-proliferationof nuclear weapons  improving the planet’s ecology andstrengthening global security and regional stability.The issue of establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones isfirmly established on the disarmament agenda. It is alreadywidely recognized that the creation of such zones is aunique instrument in the process of nuclearnon-proliferation and disarmament  which undoubtedlystrengthens international and regional peace and security.Let me express the conviction that this topic will beconsidered as one of the major issues in the work of the2000 NPT Review Conference. The value of this step is ofspecial importance in the light of nuclear testing in SouthAsia and the clear tendency towards a global arms race.Substantial progress has been achieved towards therealization of the Central Asian initiative to establish anuclear-weapon-free zone. The Central Asian countries through their common efforts and with the support of theUnited Nations  have come considerably closer toconcluding a treaty on the establishment of a Central Asiannuclear-weapon-free zone. I hope that  at the meeting toprepare the draft treaty to be held in Japan in few days  theexperts of the Central Asian countries will be able tofinalize the draft.The Republic of Uzbekistan supports the measuresproposed by Secretary-General Kofi Annan to reform theUnited Nations. The implementation of the reformprogramme will go a long way towards adapting the UnitedNations to the demands of the modern world. TheSecretary-General’s proposal to convene the MillenniumAssembly and the Millennium Summit in the year 2000must be implemented. The year 2000 is a unique symbolicmoment to affirm the position of the United Nations andto strengthen its role as a leading force in the twenty-firstcentury.The Republic of Uzbekistan continues to considerSecurity Council reform to be a necessary and urgentprocess. Any delay in this process will prevent the UnitedNations from adapting efficiently to the dynamics of thecoming millennium. We are convinced that Germany andJapan can rightly claim permanent membership of theSecurity Council. We are also in favour of an increase inthe number of new non-permanent members of theSecurity Council.The deteriorating problem of the Aral Sea requiresme once again to call on the Assembly for support. Withthe help of international organizations  the opinion thatthe Aral Sea crisis can be resolved only throughhumanitarian intervention has gradually taken root in theperception of the international community. But this is notthe case.Measures of this kind have not given positive resultson any continent where mankind has been faced withecological catastrophes. In this connection  it is necessaryto develop and implement  with the assistance of theUnited Nations specialized agencies and donors  aspecific  long-term strategy and programme ofrevitalization for the Aral area  that would affirm theprinciples of sustainable development  prevent adeterioration of quality of life for people living in theregion and ensure a dignified standard of living for futuregenerations.We are hoping for the effective support of suchinternational financial and economic institutions as theWorld Bank  the United Nations Development Programme(UNDP) and others  as well as donor countries  in thenormalization of the ecological situation and in meetingthe pressing needs of the population living in the affectedarea. The problem of Aral Sea can be solved only withthe help of an adjusted financing mechanism and theconscientious work of experts.The Republic of Uzbekistan comprehensivelysupports efforts of the United Nations and theinternational community aimed at counteracting the illegalcultivation  transportation and consumption of narcoticsubstances. The problem of drugs should be considered adanger in that it gives rise to terrorism  internationalcrime and money-laundering.30The illegal sale of drugs is the most profitable shadyactivity in the modern world. The transnational structurescontrolling global trade in drugs appear in most cases to bemore mobile than the structures opposing them. Today  ashas been pointed out by previous speakers  more than 90per cent of the drugs in some European countries are ofAfghan origin.According to a 1998 annual report on internationaldrug control  starting in 1995 Uzbek customs employeeshalted the attempted illegal export from Europe toAfghanistan of 72 tons of raw chemical material used forheroin manufacturing. This reaffirms the conclusion aboutthe internationalization of the narcotic business and theemergence of international terrorism  which is no lessdangerous.During the twentieth special session of the GeneralAssembly  devoted to the fight against the illegalmanufacturing  sale  purchase  transport  trafficking andspread of narcotic substances  we advanced many concreteproposals  including the establishment of a regionalcoordination centre to fight drug-trafficking and the drugbusiness. Concrete forms of cooperation between CentralAsian countries and the European Union were defined.We call for more work by the United NationsInternational Drug Control Programme (UNDCP) in theregion of Central Asia. The conclusions of experts showthat the Central Asian region is considered by the criminalworld an important transit area for the transport of drugs toEurope and North America.Specific UNDCP projects aimed at the development oftechnical possibilities to control the transit of goods byproviding border services with up-to-date methods of drugdetection could contribute to this fight  which can hardly beregarded as the problem of one region alone. In this regard we welcome the establishment  on the initiative of theSecretary-General  of the United Nations Office on DrugControl and Crime Prevention’s regional office operating inUzbekistan.The process of democratization is long andcomplicated  especially if it runs parallel to large  extensiveeconomic reforms. However  the real threat to democracy security and stability in the region stems from the sphere oftransnational crime. In this respect  we state our firmsupport for the work of the Commission on CrimePrevention and Criminal Justice.For this reason  the Republic of Uzbekistan hasexpressed its intention to present its candidature formembership of the United Nations Commission on CrimePrevention and Criminal Justice for the period of2001-2004. We hope that the tenth United NationsCongress on the Prevention of Crime and Treatment ofOffenders  to be held from 10 to 17 April 2000  inVienna  will be devoted to the search for answers to thechallenges of the twenty-first century  as indicated in anumber of its main topics.We would like to focus on the work of UNDP inUzbekistan. As the largest United Nations programmerendering assistance to developing countries in theirprocess of development  UNDP  together with theGovernment of Uzbekistan  is carrying out a number ofuseful projects. We hope that such cooperation will becontinued in the future as well.Nevertheless  I would like to say a few words aboutone problem that has emerged in our cooperation withUNDP and that  in our view  must be explained. Theproposed regional UNDP Programme for development ofthe Fergana Valley has not received the support of ourGovernment. In our opinion  the substance of the projecthas not been sufficiently considered and could entailnegative consequences.Despite the exhaustive and comprehensivesubstantiation by our Government of the unacceptabilityof this project  which interferes with the security of theregion  attempts to involve our country in the participationof the programme by distributing erroneous informationthroughout the international community have beenundertaken during the last three years by UNDP and theOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.We sincerely hope that the new UNDPAdministrator  Mr. Brown  will take note of Uzbekistan’sassessments. At the same time  we note with satisfactionthe new style of work at the UNDP mission inUzbekistan  which was recently headed by Mr. Kral.In conclusion  I wish to refer to the book written bythe President of the Republic of Uzbekistan  HisExcellency Mr. Islam A. Karimov  Uzbekistan at theThreshold of the Twenty-first Century: Threats toSecurity  Conditions and Guarantees of Progress  whichsays “As we enter the new millennium  we extend toeveryone the hand of friendship and mutual31understanding  symbolizing this with the wordssecurity  stability and sustainability of growth anddevelopment. For we believe that the realities thesewords signify constitute the most solid foundation forglobal geopolitical balance  and for the peace prosperity and well-being of every individual country which will enable every human being to face thefuture with confidence”."
"173",7320,"VCT",54,1999,"I take this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Theo-BenGurirab on his election to the presidency of this session ofthe General Assembly. I am confident that his vision andenergy will guide this session to a successful conclusion.I also thank Mr. Didier Opertti  who led the fifty-thirdsession of the General Assembly with remarkabledistinction and efficiency. I commend Mr. Kofi Annan  theesteemed Secretary-General of this Organization  of whomthe people of the Caribbean are particularly proud for hisvision and managerial skills as he heads the United Nations in precarious financial circumstances  responding toincreased demands with diminishing resources. I wish toassure the Secretary-General of the continued support andcooperation of the Government of Saint Vincent and theGrenadines.I join previous speakers in welcoming the Republicof Kiribati  the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom ofTonga as new Members of the United Nations family.Their membership strengthens the universal character ofour Organization.I extend condolences to the families of the victimsof the earthquakes in Turkey  Greece and  more recently the Republic of China on Taiwan. I reiterate thesentiments of sympathy already transmitted to theGovernment and people of the Bahamas  a sister countryin the Caribbean Community  and to the United States ofAmerica in relation to the devastation wrought byHurricane Floyd.The fifty-fourth anniversary of the founding of theUnited Nations  coming at the end of a century that hasseen war and destruction on the one hand andunprecedented developments in science and technology onthe other  provides a timely opportunity to reflect on theOrganization's achievements  assess its continuedrelevance in a radically changed environment and chart anappropriate course of action for the future. Manypowerful forces believe that the United Nations hasperhaps outlived its usefulness and exists now only as theworld's most expensive debating club. Ministers ofFinance are presently convened in Washington  D.C.  atthe annual meeting of the International Monetary Fundand the World Bank Group. There  too  the opinion canno doubt be heard that circumstances have now overtakenthe Bretton Woods institutions.The big and powerful nations of the world canafford to argue thus  but for small  vulnerable  developingcountries such as Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  theseinstitutions are important buffers in the interplay betweenfinance and politics in the international arena. Theoperating budgets of many transnational corporations arefar greater than the national budgets of developingcountries such as mine  and we are painfully aware thatthe international development agenda is controlled bythese corporations.Despite the technological advances of the last decadeand the tremendous increase in worldwide commerce  thebenefits of globalization have not been evenly distributedand it is abundantly clear that developing countriescontinue to be marginalized. While we acknowledge and25respect the general thrust towards open markets competition and free trade  I must reiterate my country'sposition regarding our vital trade in bananas. Even as wemove to diversify  improve quality and pursue alternativestrategies and options for development in tourism  financialservices and informatics  our economic survival and socialstability remain closely linked to the banana trade and theincome it provides for our farmers. Indeed  there is a strongand persistent correlation between the rate of economicgrowth and the performance of the industry. This is furtherillustrated by the following facts: in Saint Vincent and theGrenadines  the contribution of the banana industry to directemployment is 40 per cent; in the Windward Islands as awhole  banana export earnings account for over 50 per centof the gross domestic product; and windward Islandsexports account for only 1 per cent of the world trade inbananas.The imminent collapse of our major banana marketdemonstrates just how powerless small developing Statescontinue to be against powerful countries and mega-corporations. The disregard for our interests and  indeed our survival  by the United States of America  which doesnot export a single hand of bananas  is truly inexplicable.The inevitable consequences of this stance will be economicand social dislocation  manifested in increasedunemployment  impoverishment for our farmers  crime andthe erosion of basic human rights and dignity.The iniquitous and restrictive immigration policies ofcertain developed countries have served only to exacerbatethe social disintegration of our societies  which are alreadyunder severe stress.If small developing economies are to be able to attractinvestment  expand production  improve product quality andmeet standards — in short  compete effectively and graspthe opportunities presented in the World Trade Organizationagreements — it is imperative that recognition should begiven to their need for support and for adequate transitionalperiods to fully liberalized world trade  which should applyalso to the banana trade.As a corollary to our overall economic developmentstrategy  the Government of Saint Vincent and theGrenadines continues to explore  with the assistance offriendly nations  options for enhanced airport developmenton mainland Saint Vincent. The requirements foragricultural and economic diversification make thisendeavour even more urgent.We are exceptionally grateful to the European Unionfor the support which it is continuing to give to ensureour survival  even in the face of threats to its owneconomic prosperity. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines isinvolved  with other members of the CaribbeanCommunity (CARICOM)  in a fundamental process ofdeepening regional integration through the establishmentof a single market and economy by 2001. We are takingimportant steps to facilitate the free movement of goods services  capital and people in the countries of theCommunity. We are doing this at a time when themomentum of trade liberalization and economicglobalization has never been greater.The region is also committed to the establishment ofthe Free Trade Area of the Americas by 2004.CARICOM has established regional negotiatingmachinery to coordinate the region's participation inexternal trade negotiations  including the Seattle Round ofmultinational trade negotiations.Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is resolute in itsopposition to the international trade in drugs. To this end my Government is moving bilaterally and with membercountries of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean Statesand CARICOM  to establish agreements with thirdcountries on mutual assistance in criminal matters. TheGovernment of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines recognizing its own limitations in confronting theenormous power and resources of drug traffickers  hassigned a “ship rider” agreement that gives authority topursue such criminals in the territorial waters of ourarchipelagic State.Governments in the small developing countries ofthe Caribbean pay a high political price for cooperatingwith the developed countries in the fight against drugs.There were loud protests from certain sections of thepopulation against the Government when the securityforces of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  incollaboration with the Regional Security Service andcontingents from other friendly countries  launched aneradication campaign in our mountainous interior: theyquestioned the Government's cooperation at a time whenaccess for bananas and other products from the Caribbeanto the European market was being challenged.My Government will continue to honour itscommitments under all international agreements to whichwe are signatory. We have enacted appropriate stringentmeasures in our financial regulations to ensure thatproceeds from the illicit drug trade are not laundered in26our financial system. The efforts of economically vulnerablecountries such as ours in combatting the scourge of drugsmust be recognized and supported by the internationalcommunity in general  and by traditionally friendlycountries in particular.Our countries do not wish to be forced out of theworld trade in legitimate products  causing our peoples toturn in desperation to trafficking in illegal products. InSaint Vincent and the Grenadines and in other countriesmembers of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)  webelieve in stability based on a solid foundation ofdemocracy  respect for human rights and the creation ofeconomic and other opportunities for the development ofour peoples. CARICOM has built an outstanding record inthis regard. The recent mission to Haiti headed by our ownPrime Minister  The Right Honourable Sir James Mitchell to examine that country's readiness to conduct generalelections  is another example of CARICOM's commitmentto those principles.Saint Vincent and the Grenadines places very highpriority on education  training and human-resourcedevelopment. These are a very important part of thedeclaration of principles adopted by the leaders of the 34countries of the western hemisphere at the second Summitof the Americas  held at Santiago  Chile  in 1998.I take this opportunity to reiterate the gratitude of theGovernment and the people of Saint Vincent and theGrenadines to the Government and the people of Cuba which despite their difficult economic circumstances caused by the continuing trade embargo against thatCaribbean country  have offered numerous scholarships tothe young people of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.Saint Vincent and the Grenadines places great value on thisunmistakable act of friendship and assistance.Small island developing States such as Saint Vincentand the Grenadines attach great importance to such issuesas the integrity of our coastal and marine resources  solid-waste management and natural-disaster preparedness because we are conscious of the negative repercussions thatcan result if effective measures are not put in place. We runthe risk of damaging our fragile ecosystems to thedetriment of development and tourism  and moreovercompromising their sustainable use and enjoyment by futuregenerations. It is for that reason that CARICOM condemnsin the strongest terms the shipment of hazardous materialthrough the territorial waters of the Caribbean countries.Without the benefit of scientific proof of the origins andreasons for the recent fish kill in our waters  there is causefor serious concern; investigation in this regard isongoing. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines shares theconcerns expressed by other small island developingStates and strongly supports the adoption of a draftresolution on small island developing States recognizingthe Caribbean Sea as a special area in the context ofsustainable development.The vulnerability of small States has been mademore acute because of lack of capacity  declining aidflows  graduation from concessionary financing  thedisappearance of trade preferences  and a lack ofcompetitiveness. The implementation of the BarbadosProgramme of Action for the Sustainable Development ofSmall Island Developing States is therefore imperative forour survival.My delegation fully supports the efforts of theinternational community in addressing the conflicts inKosovo and in East Timor. We look forward to lastingpeace and stability in those areas.Saint Vincent and the Grenadines also applauds theefforts and commitment of Prime Minister Barak of Israeland Chairman Arafat of the Palestine LiberationOrganization to bring peace and security to the people oftheir region.A draft resolution on the readmission to this body ofthe Republic of China on Taiwan was once againdefeated. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  however strongly supports the aspiration of those 21 million peopleto exercise their right to share and participate in theactivities of this community of nations.My country has consistently expressed its views inrelation to reform of the United Nations in general and ofthe Security Council in particular. I will not revisit themnow  but I wish to reiterate that Saint Vincent and theGrenadines strongly favours reform of the United Nationsto give more equitable consideration to the concerns ofthe majority of countries comprising the GeneralAssembly. Let us remodel it along more democratic linesto address the realities of the world today.As we approach the new millennium  my delegationwould like to urge all Member States to demonstrate theirunwavering support for the goals and ideals enshrined inthe Charter of the United Nations: peace  security  humanrights  fundamental freedoms  international cooperation and development for all mankind.27"
"174",7367,"VEN",54,1999,"First  Iwish to express my very great pleasure at speaking for thefirst time in this world forum as head of State and atgreeting its members on behalf of the people of Venezuelaand my Government  and particularly at speaking at thissession of the General Assembly  the last of this centuryand millennium  which  for us  adds special meaning tothe event.My presence here also affords me an opportunity toexpress some ideas on the times and circumstances inwhich we are now living  all of us worldwide but also and a little more specifically  about times andcircumstances in my own country. These are times andcircumstances  Mr. President and members  which ofcourse we share with you.A few years ago  when the Berlin Wall fell  I thinksomeone said that peace had broken out. I truly believethat that expression covers a series of phenomena whichbegan to surface at that time and subsequently evolvedand developed to become part of the global scenario. Inmy view  this rapid emergence of phenomena simultaneously all round the world  each of them with somany distinguishing characteristics  has made it moredifficult to understand  appreciate and realisticallyperceive what is actually happening in the world today.Many analysts of that time spoke of quantum leaps.I believe that a quantum leap is indeed under way; thereis an ongoing process of universal change  mutation even.I also believe that we must sharpen our ability to analyseand observe this phenomenon — open conflicts  resurgentnationalisms  racial and religious conflicts — which areoccurring in a world that is undergoing processes offusion while at the same time undergoing dangerous andalarming processes of fission. We are entering the newcentury with these signs around us which at one and thesame time are cause for concern and reason for optimismat the changes unfolding. Actually  there are manypraiseworthy things about the century that is closing  butthere are also many things worthy of condemnation andfrom which we should learn our lesson so that they do notrecur.Within that process of universal change  there is acountry small in size  a nearby country — Venezuela —that faces its own changes; a country that is undertaking itsown irrevocable and necessary changes; a country that isbeing reborn from its own ashes; a country that is onceagain raising the flag of true  authentic democracy. I shallspeak a few words here about that country  my country  ourcountry  your country: Venezuela. Venezuela  blessed bythe hand of God; Venezuela  in the very north with anoutstanding geographic location; Venezuela  full ofincalculable natural wealth; Venezuela  which has one ofthe world’s largest oil reserves and mineral resources of allkinds  such as gold  diamonds  bauxite and iron ore;Venezuela  which has water; Venezuela  which has fertilesoil; Venezuela  which has scarcely 20 million inhabitantsfor almost 1 million square kilometres. But 80 per cent ofthe inhabitants of this wealth-filled country are poor.For many years it was said of Venezuela that it was amodel of democracy in the world and in Latin America.However  today it is undergoing a process of profoundchange  a crisis unprecedented in our history — a moralcrisis  an economic crisis  a political crisis  a socialcrisis — which has brought it to dangerous extremes  withexplosive forces that have been building for decades.Even so  in Venezuela we have found a peaceful wayout of the morass  the tragedy. We have discovered a waythat is fully democratic. We have encouraged changes inVenezuela towards respect for human rights  as is right andproper  because  however tragic the situation  howeverurgent the need for change  never  in our view  shouldhuman rights  respect for freedom of expression  respect forthe intrinsic values of the individual  respect for freedom ofthe press and respect for freedom of thought be set aside.The Venezuelan people has arisen from its own ashes.I should also like to add — and you  Mr. President and members undoubtedly know this — that theVenezuelan people is a people with a great historicallegacy: it is the birthplace of Simón Bol'var  the Liberator one of the greats of the millennium. Venezuela carries in itsessence the seed of democracy  of fraternity and solidarity.We must therefore acknowledge the ability of Venezuelanpeople  which we represent here in this Assembly  to findpeaceful and democratic solutions to a profound crisiswhich in other places and other eras  would have givenrise to the violent and regrettable acts that havesubmerged many peoples in fratricidal conflict for yearsand even decades at a time.We know that the world has had a great deal ofnews about Venezuela in recent months  some of it a littledisturbing as a result of the confusion and speed of thechanges. I thank representatives for allowing me a fewminutes to take the opportunity to assure the entire worldthat in Venezuela there was respect  is respect and willcontinue to be respect for a democratic process whichemanates from the will of the people. For example  lastDecember there were elections in Venezuela  whichproduced a positive result for democracy. We won theelections with almost 60 per cent of the popular vote.Subsequently  on 2 February this year  the very daythat we arrived at the Government Palace  we didsomething which had never before happened in mycountry: we called for a national referendum. In thatreferendum  held on 25 April  the country voted for theelectoral path leading to a constituent assembly. Ninety-two per cent said “Yes”  and on 25 July there were openelections  in which all political and social sectorsparticipated  with absolute freedom of expression freedom of criticism and freedom of the press  the likesof which had never occurred in my country.The National Constituent Assembly that resultedfrom that electoral process consists of 131 Venezuelanmen and women  representing the broadest segments ofsociety  including indigenous peoples  because for the firsttime in Venezuela's history a group of aboriginesrepresent the indigenous peoples of Venezuela in the greatAssembly. The Assembly members have been workingtogether for a month and a half on a new nationalconstitution in a mechanism of cooperation. The entirecountry is promoting progress towards this newConstitution; for the sake of the democracy we aredefending and advocating  it will be approved only by thecountry. It will not enter into force until it is approved bythe Venezuelans in a new referendum  which we hopewill be held in November  or at the latest in December.In other words  when the new century dawns nextyear Venezuela will have a new political project  afundamental new charter as the foundation of the newRepublic and of truly legitimate executive powergoverning by democracy — as Abraham Lincoln said  for2the people and by the people. We will have a genuinejudicial power  which we had lost in the past few yearsowing to corruption. This judicial power will administerjustice. We rely on true legislative power to respond to thecalls and needs of the Venezuelan people.We also propose the establishment of a fourthpower — moral power — to combat corruption  the motherof all Venezuelan crises of recent years  and to fight foreducation  especially for children. We further propose anelectoral power to achieve a balance of power. There willbe a division of powers  particularly legitimate powers  withthe profound popular content of true democracy.We are also promoting a new economic model forVenezuela. For 20 years we experienced a terrible crisisthat produced the breakdown of a country  the breakdownof a model. We are now promoting a humanistic productive  competitive and diversified economic model based on the great potential of our country andincorporating the world currents of a new internationaleconomic order  with greater justice and a human face which will facilitate satisfying the needs of the humanbeing. This must be one of the fundamental goals of anyeconomic process.In just over six months we have been able to comehere to tell the world of our successes — small successes but they presage what is going to happen in Venezuela. Wehave undertaken an economic revitalization  respecting alleconomic freedoms. In a healthy coexistence between theState and the market  we have been gaining ground in themacroeconomic area. We have started to bring downinflation; maintained our international reserves; helped raisethe price of a barrel of oil  in cooperation with the otheroil-producing countries; and brought about an exchangebalance. We have also been revitalizing some productionsectors  and we are calling on global investors to invest invarious petrochemical  gas  touristic  industrial andagricultural projects and enterprises. We are thus buildinga new economic model.We are also building a new society based on publicmorality in respect of human rights. I shall give anexample  small  but one which says a lot about what ishappening in Venezuela in terms of the social order. Barelythree days ago the 1999-2000 school year began. This yearthe school matriculation — that is  the number of studentsin public schools — increased by 25 per cent. As a resultof a model of privatization of education  and of the povertythat has been invading the social strata  many children andyoung people did not go to school; they could not pay thefees  nor could they pay for school supplies. This year wehave opened up the schools and we have been repairingthem. Now we are very happy to tell the world that injust six months the number of children and young peoplestarting a new school year has increased by 25 per cent.Furthermore  attention to education has gone beyondbeing one of the principal national priorities; it is now amatter of States.The same can be said of health. We have activateda special plan which we call “Project Bolivar 2000”. Forsix months we have been dealing with Venezuelans'greatest needs  such as health  road repairs and openingways of penetration and activation of some sectors ofmicroenterprises. We have set up a people's bank toprovide microcredit especially to bring about the recoveryof the economy  the microeconomy. We have created aunique social fund to promote solutions basically forhealth and education.As can be seen  we are promoting a genuine processof transition: politically  socially  economically and  aboveall  ethically. A new Venezuela is being born  born topresent itself to the world free and sovereign  ready totake up firmly the flags of a new world  a fairer world.We are in solidarity with the struggles of the world. Theworld of the century to come must be much better thanthe world of the twentieth century which is ending. Wecall out for justice for the peoples of the third world  forequality and human development. We appeal for theintegration of peoples and for peace. Only a countryrevitalized from within can be incorporated by its ownstrength into the international relations of a modern world such as the world which is dawning.In this part of South America  Venezuela is beingreborn and offering the world its heart  its arms ofintegration. I give a special salute to all the peoples of theLatin American continent and the Caribbean  CentralAmerica  North America  Asia  Africa  Europe andOceania. We must continue together  with a new sense ofbrotherhood  to struggle for a better world.In this my first statement to the General Assembly in the last session of the century  when we are preparingfor the Millennium Assembly  I should like tocongratulate you  Mr. President  the Secretary-Generaland all the world representatives gathered here at theUnited Nations  because we are aware of the great effortbeing made to reform and perfect the machinery toachieve peace  brotherhood and solidarity in a world that3is  as I said at the beginning  undergoing profound change.These words come from my heart and go out to theentire world in the name of a people who are themselvesbeing reborn — the Venezuelan people — with our bestwishes that each day we may find greater strength andcome closer to attaining — as I said before — the path topeace  brotherhood  development  justice and self-determination. Let us not say as someone else has said thatpeace has broken out. Rather  let us say that in the next fewyears we may all be able to proclaim loudly that peace democracy and development have triumphed.I send a warm embrace to you all on behalf of thepeople of Simon Bolivar  the people of Venezuela."
"175",7406,"VNM",54,1999,"On behalf of the delegation of the SocialistRepublic of Viet Nam and on my own behalf  I shouldlike to warmly congratulate you  Sir  on your election tothe presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourthsession. I am convinced that  thanks to your experienceand wisdom  this session will have a successful outcome.I should like also to express my thanks and greatappreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Didier Opertti  forhis important contribution and the effectiveness of hispresidency during the fifty-third session.I should also like to congratulate and warmlywelcome the three new States Members of theOrganization: the Republic of Kiribati  the Republic ofNauru and the Kingdom of Tonga. The Government andthe people of Viet Nam are pleased to greet those threePacific countries and to assure them of our willingness toestablish and develop fruitful and close cooperation.The current session of the General Assembly is ofspecial significance. As a bridge between the twentiethand twenty-first centuries  it will prepare us for enteringa new century and a new millennium. This is therefore animportant moment  as it affords us the opportunity to takestock of the advent and evolution and the highs and lowsof this greatest international Organization over more thanhalf a century. Such an assessment will help us drawlessons and provide us with the necessary valuableexperience from which we can identify what needs to bedone so as to allow the United Nations to continue toplay its role and exercise its influence in the world todayand in the future.The twentieth century  which is drawing to a close has been marked by great achievements for humankind atevery level of its development  but it also requires us toreflect deeply about problems unforeseen in previouscenturies. Two world wars and hundreds of protractedconflicts  civil wars and situations of local tension invarious regions of the world have claimed the lives ofmore than 150 million people and left permanent scars both spiritual and physical  on hundreds of millions ofothers. They have destroyed the creative achievements ofmany generations  some of which was irreplaceable. Thathas given human beings a deeper  more burning desire tolive in peace  security  freedom and happiness  and toachieve stable and sustainable development for the benefit16of humankind and our beautiful planet. The creation of theUnited Nations more than 50 years ago  with its clearlydefined statutes and objectives  contributed to therealization of those aspirations. Indeed  during the twenty-first century humankind has witnessed extraordinaryprogress in the decolonization process  the collapse of thecolonial system and the successful promotion of the sacredright of peoples to national self-determination  resulting inthe birth of many independent States and  therefore  infundamental changes in international relations. Theachievements of the United Nations over the past 54 yearsare due in large part to the contribution of those young independent countries.In spite of the important progress made towards thedevelopment of nation States during the twentieth century we must acknowledge that humanity is confronted withmany unresolved problems. Over the past few decades ofthis century  the explosion in science and technology especially in the field of information technology  haschanged the structure of many economies and profoundlyaffected the cultural and social life of every State. Ourworld has become a global village  geographic distance isless of a factor than it used to be  and interdependence interaction and cooperation among States  regions andcontinents have continued to increase. It is unfortunate however  that many of these achievements have not beenused purely for the benefit humankind  but have beenmisused or even used abusively against humankind. Thearms race  especially the development of nuclear weaponsand other new weapons that are more and moresophisticated  dangerous and deadly weapons  is not onlydraining significant resources but also threatening to destroypeople's lives and the environment.In the past year  the situation in certain regions hasfaced the international community with the challenge of thepolitics of diktat practised by a group of countries andregional organizations. The unilateral military attacksagainst the territorial integrity of sovereign States in theBalkans and the Gulf have set a dangerous precedent ininternational relations  running counter to the purposes andprinciples of the United Nations and in violation of thefundamental principles of international law  especially thoseof respect for the independence  sovereignty and territorialintegrity of Member States. This presented a seriouschallenge to the role and effectiveness of the UnitedNations  as well as to its legal foundations.The first lesson to be learned from those events is thatit is not possible for the United Nations to build orguarantee peace and security in the world at large or at theregional level unless international law and the UnitedNations Charter are fully respected and strictlyimplemented. Secondly  the United Nations can play therole and exert the influence that is commensurate with itsmagnitude only if  now as well as in the future  itsteadfastly upholds the purposes and principles defined atSan Francisco 54 years ago and carries out a thoroughand in-depth reform of its organizational structure andoperation  in order to imbue our Organization with innerstrength.By so doing  the United Nations will be able toprevent any country or regional organization from usinga pretext  or a cause such as human rights  for example to trample on the independence  sovereignty or territorialintegrity of another country or to interfere in its internalaffairs. By so doing  the United Nations will be able topreserve its important role and to meet the expectations ofMember States with respect to preventing policies ofdiktat and the use or threat of use of force in internationalrelations. And by so doing  the United Nations will beable to help create and foster the climate of lasting peaceand security that is needed for the solid  sustainabledevelopment that all Member countries need today andwill need in the coming century.Today  peace and security have a dialectical andconsistent link with development. Development hasbecome an important element in the broadly acceptedconcept of security. This has made every country moreglobally relevant while making all States less isolated. Itshould be no surprise that socio-economic developmenthas become the main focus of the policy of the majorityof States and an area in which the United Nations willcontinue to have an important role to play.It is undeniable that over the past decade the processof regionalization and globalization has transformed theworld and benefitted many countries. But the side-effectsand adverse consequences of this trend have also beenincreasingly evident. Obvious examples have indicatedover the past two years that those consequences coulddestroy the achievements of long years of developmentand could lead to instability  locally and on a broaderscale. The first victims are none other than the leastdeveloped countries: those that face the greatestdifficulties in their process of socio-economicdevelopment and that should have enjoyed greaterattention and more favourable conditions in the process ofregional and global integration. Those countries can andshould count on United Nation support as they engage inthis process.17The role of the United Nations is to promoteinteraction among peace  security and development in orderto ensure that globalization and regionalization will notevolve in a way that is incompatible with the needs  levelsof development and specific conditions of each State andeach region. Only then will nations be able to contribute tothat process and enjoy the legitimate and rightful benefitsderived from it. Only then can equality be secured and thepainful side-effect of this process  namely the widening gapbetween the rich and the poor  be addressed.Despite the striking progress we have made on thelong road of civilization  the end of the twentieth centuryis still marked by poverty and hunger  which are among thegravest tragedies and the greatest challenges facingmankind. Poverty and hunger not only lower livingstandards in certain countries; they have become a globalproblem  a factor for socio-political instability in manyregions  and a problem that at present many countriescannot resolve by themselves. This problem will grow moreserious if early efforts are not made to adequately addressthe adverse consequences of globalization andregionalization. Over the past half century  the UnitedNations and its specialized agencies have made an activeand effective contribution to the fight against hunger andpoverty; they have gained a great deal of valuableexperience  of which the Organization should now makegreater use. The eradication of hunger and the alleviation ofpoverty have become a primary  pressing task for theUnited Nations. They also form part of the Organization'sresponsibility towards Member countries that are nowsuffering under these twin scourges.The United Nations has set as a target the halvingworld hunger and poverty by 2015. To this end  it is crucialthat every country's internal resources be mobilized  butexternal cooperation to create an enabling environment fordevelopment is equally important; it is  indeed indispensable. We are convinced that the United Nationscould play an important role in promoting North-Southcooperation by encouraging developed countries to expanddirect investment  provide and secure long-term financing open their own markets and grant preferential terms oftrade to developing and least developed countries  fulfiltheir commitment of allocating 0.7 per cent of grossnational product for official development assistance promote technology transfer  support human-resourcedevelopment  vocational education and training and joinother countries in implementing the 20/20 initiative onsocial development  especially the commitments embodiedin the October 1998 Hanoi declaration on the 20/20initiative. Such support by the United Nations will facilitateevery nation's efforts and will gradually and effectivelytackle the issue of poverty and hunger.The problems facing the United Nations at the turnof the century are large  complex and difficult. But  withthe benefit of the experience of 54 years  the support ofMember countries and the opportunities that mankind hasgenerated  the Organization will be able to tackle them ifUnited Nations reform is accelerated and implemented atan early date. In this regard  we welcome the efforts ofthe Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  to make theadministrative structure more effective and to cutunnecessary spending.We consider that United Nations reform involvesenhancement of the role of the General Assembly  theprincipal organ in which the vast majority of members ofthe international community are represented  to reflectfully the principles of democracy and equality amongMember States. Reform of the Security Council is themost important part of the process. Viet Nam's consistentview is that the Security Council needs to be made morerepresentative by increasing the number of bothpermanent and non-permanent members and by bringingabout greater democratization  transparency andaccountability. Viet Nam is of the view that anindispensable element of reform is that a representative ofthe developing countries must be a permanent member ofthe Security Council.With regard to the expansion of the SecurityCouncil  we support those candidates  such as India Japan and Germany  that have the capacity to make amajor contribution to the work of that important organ. Atthe same time  it should be stressed that the veto powershould be used only in accordance with the letter and thespirit of Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter.Viet Nam welcomes the encouraging prospects of apeaceful settlement of conflicts and tensions in certainregions of the world  such as the Great Lakes region ofAfrica  and the resumption of the peace and reconciliationprocess in the Middle East. We follow with interest thedevelopments in East Timor and hope that there will beno further complications  so that the situation there can bestabilized soon  thus contributing to peace and stability inthe region. Viet Nam calls for an early and complete endto the policy of embargo and blockade against Cuba andother countries. Such policies are not only outdated  butrun counter to current trends towards democratization andequality in international relations  causing damage and18suffering to the populations of the countries concerned especially women  the elderly and children.In South-East Asia and the Asia-Pacific region theeconomic recovery in many countries over the past year hasrestored confidence in the future. The countries of theregion have learned lessons  found effective solutions andtaken full advantage of assistance from the internationalcommunity. As a result  the growth rate has graduallyrecovered; exports  cooperation and investment have step bystep been revitalized. However  full economic recovery andovercoming the adverse impact of the crisis to ensuresustainable development is a continuing  long-term process a challenge that the countries of the region must take up.The Association of South-East Asian Nations(ASEAN) has taken new steps forward. The success of itssixth summit  held in Hanoi in December 1998  and theadmission of Cambodia  which means that all 10 countriesof the region are now members  have demonstrated a highlevel of unanimity and the determination and capacity ofthe ASEAN countries to promote solidarity  expandcooperation and overcome difficulties to give the group itsappropriate role  status and strength. ASEAN with 10members is now better placed to make its voice heard ininternational and regional forums  such as the ASEANRegional Forum (ARF)  the Asia-Pacific EconomicCooperation (APEC) and the Non-Aligned Movement  onregional and global problems pertaining to peace  security development and the survival of humankind.Maintaining peace and security in Asia in general  andin South-East Asia in particular  remains a shared concernof all member States. We hope that countries outside theregion  especially the nuclear-weapon States  will cooperatewith the South-East Asian countries for the implementationof the South-East Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone(SEANWFZ) Treaty. This Treaty  which came into effectin 1997  reflects the keen desire of the South-East Asiancountries for peace and security in the region  and theirserious commitment to the disarmament goal of a nuclear-weapon-free world. We are pleased to note  and greatlyappreciate  the support for the Treaty expressed by Chinaand Russia.When referring to the situation in the region  onecannot fail to mention the situation in the Eastern Sea —the South China Sea — where there are still incidents thatcause concern to the countries of the region. Viet Nambelieves that disputes in that sea should be settled bypeaceful means  through bilateral and multilateralnegotiations between the parties directly concerned  withrespect for international law  especially the 1982 UnitedNations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the 1992Declaration of ASEAN Foreign Ministers on the SouthChina Sea. While seeking a lasting solution  all the partiesconcerned should exercise self-restraint  refrain from anyact that may further complicate the situation and takeconfidence-building measures to ensure regional peaceand stability  thus facilitating the search for fundamental permanent solutions. In this regard  ASEAN's currentefforts to draw up a code of conduct in the South ChinaSea  in accordance with the spirit of the sixth ASEANsummit  held in Hanoi  are a step in the right directionand a constructive measure  contributing to confidence-building and the peaceful settlement of disagreements inthe region.As a Member of the United Nations and theinternational community  Viet Nam has done its utmost and will continue to do so  to contribute to the commonwork of humankind. Viet Nam's consistent position is topursue an independent  sovereign foreign policy  seekingthe multilateralization and diversification of externalrelations  with regional and global integration. It wishesto be the friend of all the members of the internationalcommunity struggling for peace  independence anddevelopment. Viet Nam is an active member of ASEANand APEC and is preparing to join the World TradeOrganization (WTO) as soon as possible.Viet Nam's diplomatic activities have been foundedon the achievements recorded over the past 12 years inour work of national reconstruction  the industrializationand modernization of the country to achieve our goal ofa wealthy people  a strong State and a just and advancedsociety. We have maintained a high rate of economicgrowth  reduced the poverty rate from 30 per cent in 1992to 15.7 per cent at the end of 1998  and created more thana million jobs each year. These are tangible proofs of oureconomic and social development. The United Nationsand its specialized agencies have greatly contributed tothis achievement  as was acknowledged at the conferenceto review cooperation between Viet Nam and the UnitedNations development bodies  held in Hanoi two years ago.Furthermore  Viet Nam has  as a member of theEconomic and Social Council and of the United NationsDevelopment Programme/United Nations Population FundExecutive Board  played an active part in the jointundertakings of the international community.Viet Nam highly appreciates the role played by theUnited Nations in international life  both today and fortomorrow. It will make its contribution to the19Organization's activities and will join other Members inrebuilding and renewing the United Nations so that it canlive up to the expectations of Member States and theirpeoples  and meet the demands of our time.During its more than five decades of existence as theworld's largest international body the United Nations hasmade fundamental contributions to humankind'sdevelopment in all areas and has created a legal frameworkfor international relations. What the United Nations hasachieved to date will come with us into the new century along with the conviction that it will contribute to newachievements  to further progress and the resolution ofoutstanding differences between nations. While placing agreat deal of hope in the United Nations  the MemberStates also understand that its effectiveness depends on theactive participation of all of them.Looking back over the path we have travelled  we nowappreciate more than ever the role of the United Nationsand its capability  as well as the complexity and tenacity ofthe problems before it. We can reaffirm that the UnitedNations — when it has been reformed on both theorganizational and institutional levels and its objectiveshave been adjusted — will remain an irreplaceableorganization. The fifty-fourth session of the GeneralAssembly is entrusted with a great mandate: to completethe necessary preparations so that the United Nations canenter a new stage in its development.Allow me to express from this rostrum our greatconfidence in the capability and crucial role of the UnitedNations to promote peace  security  cooperation anddevelopment for a better future for mankind. In this regard Viet Nam pledges to work closely with other MemberStates to contribute actively to this noble cause  the UnitedNations."
"176",7437,"VUT",54,1999,"On behalf of the people and theGovernment of the Republic of Vanuatu  I wish to joinprevious speakers in congratulating you  Mr. President  onyour election to this high and important post. Yourunanimous election as President of the fifty-fourth sessionof General Assembly shows the esteem in which theinternational community holds both you  personally  andyour country  Namibia. The Republic of Vanuatu’sdelegation is confident that you will guide the session to asuccessful conclusion.May I take this opportunity  through you  to expressmy delegation’s sincere appreciation on your predecessor His Excellency Mr. Didier Opertti of Uruguay  for hisoutstanding stewardship in facilitating the work of the fifty-third session.I wish to commend our Secretary-General  Mr. KofiAnnan  for his wise leadership and dedication to the reformand restructuring of our Organization. Through you Mr. President  we would like to assure him of our support.Four years ago  we gathered here to celebrate thefiftieth anniversary of our Organization — in particular  torenew our commitment to the fundamental principles whichcreated it in 1945.We have also made strong a commitment to furtherstrengthen our collaborative and genuine efforts in ensuringthat this Organization continues to promote global peace justice  healthy environment  human rights  law and order and support the process of sustainable development of itsMember nations — in particular  the least developedcountries (LDCs) such as those in the Pacific region including the Republic of Vanuatu.The current international political and economicsituation has grown ever more complex and demanding onour very limited and scarce resources as well as on thesupport available from our development partners.We are deeply concerned by the continuing escalationof international crimes of all sorts — drug trafficking money laundering  human rights violations  terrorism organized crime and other similar activities which have thepotential of placing the sovereignty and territorialintegrity of small island States at great risk. Theinternational community must be seen to genuinelycollaborate in combating these criminal phenomena if thenew philosophy of globalization is to positively progressand if we are to advance into the new millennium withfresh and renewed hope to build a better future for ourchildren.We do not believe that the world is doing us justiceand the fundamental principles of peace and economicprosperity as enshrined in the Charter if we do notobserve our joint call for disarmament of nuclear weaponsand other weapons of mass destruction. Internationalsecurity cannot be guaranteed if we fail to accord priorityattention and resources to education  protection of theenvironment and good Heath of humankind and itssurvival into the next millennium.As a small island developing State where the oceanprovides one of the most important parts of our foodchain  we would like to join others in voicing our mainconcern regarding the management of our oceans andseas. Our participation at the Second London OceansWorkshop last December demonstrated this. We wouldtherefore join other nations in calling for a collectiveaffirmation by all respective Member States at this sessionof the General Assembly for a resolution to establish aconsultative process to improve coordination andmanagement of programmes that are associated with theprotection of the oceans and the seas which are very dearto our very survival. This year my Government accededto and ratified three International Maritime OrganizationConventions which again reflects our concern for theprotection of our oceans and seas.The momentum of the fiftieth anniversary of ourOrganization  and the lessons we have learned from pastmistakes and our renewed commitment must guide us inour pursuit for a better world where  through thisOrganization  a renewed sense of mutual trust andgenuine dialogue can he resurrected to ease the politicaltensions and economic crisis in all the regions andsub-regions of the planet.For our part of the world  these new developmentsconstitute a real threat to the already vulnerableenvironment of our small island economies and ourpopulation. Confronted with these challenges  many13countries in the Pacific Region  including Vanuatu  do nothave much choice at the end of the century but to embarkon difficult programmes of reform  both within theirrespective Governments and societies.Last year  The Honourable Donald Kalpokas MasikeVanua  Prime Minister of Vanuatu  informed the Assemblythat Vanuatu had initiated a Comprehensive ReformProgramme with the support of both multilateral andbilateral donor agencies and countries. As we are still in theimplementation stage of our reform  it is our genuine hopethat it will not only be beneficial to our people but alsoresponsive to their needs  in particular those of the 80 percent who live in the rural areas on subsistence farming.Therefore Vanuatu would continue to need the specialsupport being accorded to it as a least developed country.The role of Mr. Gurirab’s predecessor and of theSecretary-General in subsequently facilitating a constructivedialogue and comprehensive appreciation of the economichardships of Vanuatu must be commended  and it is ourhope that this will continue as we enter the newmillennium.In this regard  the Government and the people ofVanuatu warmly welcome the recent decision of theEconomic and Social Council  at its recent meeting inGeneva this year  to defer consideration of Vanuatu’sgraduation from least developed country status  pending fullassessment of the usefulness of the vulnerability index andecological fragility as criteria for least developed countrydesignation.In this connection  I am pleased to inform theAssembly that with the assistance of the United NationsConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)  myGovernment will be carrying out a review of our situationin Vanuatu which we hope will assist the Committee forDevelopment Planning in its endeavour to come up withcriteria that will hopefully be accepted and adopted todetermine the status of most least developed countries. Wewould like to register our most sincere appreciation andrecognition to each and every country and group ofcountries for their continuous support.One of the commitments we all made during thefiftieth anniversary celebrations in 1995 was that ourOrganization ought to be reformed and restructured in amanner that reflects reality and the problems we arecurrently experiencing  so that it could be effective inaddressing the issues and needs of its Member States  bothindividually and as a group. On this note  we want toassociate ourselves with earlier statements in reference toreform and restructuring  in particular on the issue ofgeographical location. Here we are referring specificallyto our close neighbours  Australia and New Zealand which are considered as part of the Asia-Pacific region.From our perspective — shared  we have no doubt by others — the United Nations must include in itsreform agenda a full assessment and recognition of theinherent particularities of small island States like theRepublic of Vanuatu and the impact of the internationaleconomic crisis  in particular that of globalization  ontheir economic performance and on the sustainability oftheir political stability.The pursuit and promotion of a free and responsiblepress  the protection of individual rights and genderequality  as noted in Mr. Gurirab’s opening remarks  arematters which are receiving more attention under thereform programme. These are real challenges to Vanuatutoday  but they are challenges which we are confident wewill successfully address over time  with the necessarysupport of the international community.The right of self-determination must also continue tooccupy our agenda. As the United Nations InternationalDecade for the Eradication of Colonialism ends next year it is my Government’s hope that all administering Powersof the countries concerned will take appropriate steps  incooperation with the territories  to work out some time-frame for those countries to exercise their inalienableright self-determination  self-government or independence.The United Nations  as mandated by its Charter  must beseen to encourage and support dialogue at the appropriatepolitical levels in the regions and countries where humansuffering and social disorder continue as a direct result ofconflicts of opinion on the issue of self-determination.In the Pacific region  while we warmly welcomedthe signing last year of the Nouméa Accord between theFrench Government and the major political parties in NewCaledonia  we urge all parties concerned to uphold theircommitment in relation to the rights and wishes of theindigenous population of New Caledonia. We welcomethe decision by the French Government to allowrepresentatives from the South Pacific Forum andrepresentatives of the United Nations Special Political andDecolonization Committee to visit the Territory in Augustof this year  as outlined in resolution 53/65. We believethis new agreement and the latest developments will helpto foster a stronger sense of commitment in all parties towork together to support an irreversible trend for the14future political status of New Caledonia — that is  itsself-determination.Still in our region  while the East Timorese peoplehave finally realized their right to self-determination  myGovernment notes with grave concern the deterioratingsituation in East Timor following the results of the ballot atthe end of August in which many human rights violationshave been noted and many innocent people have lost theirlives. However  my Government is pleased to note theinitiatives taken by the Government of Indonesia to allowthe deployment of a Security Council peacekeeping force inthe troubled area and to assist in restoring normalcy andallowing the democratic process to take its course.As I said earlier on  the world and our Organizationwill be going through very challenging times as we prepareto turn the page of this century and start a new one. Thecredibility of the United Nations in the next millenniumwill be measured in terms of its effectiveness in respondingto the real situations prevailing in its Member States especially in small island States. The recent admission ofour Pacific Island neighbours  namely the Republic ofKiribati  the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga to this body is a manifestation of this  and we hope thattheir admission not only increases the membership of theUnited Nations but also that they will bring with them newideas to contribute to this important Organization. As smallisland States  we feel that our problems will be addressedadequately and be heard in an international Organizationlike the United Nations  and we join others in welcomingthem to our family of nations.To conclude  let me say that it is therefore vital thatwe all support and supplement the process of reformspearheaded by our Secretary-General  which is aimed notonly at streamlining our Organization but also atstrengthening it. As we approach the dawn of the newmillennium  with its unforeseen challenges  cooperation willno doubt be required between all Members in order that wemay discuss and debate our common issues in this veryvenue."
"177",7470,"WSM",54,1999,"Mr. President  you assumethe presidency at a historic moment and during the mostchallenging of times. Most warmly do we congratulate you.Samoa welcomes your leadership and pledges to you and toNamibia our fullest support.This Assembly is an especially happy one for thePacific: we now have in our midst three more South PacificForum States  the Republic of Kiribati  the Republic ofNauru and the Kingdom of Tonga. Ancient in tradition andlong in the business of political independence  eachrepresents the variety and uniqueness of our region. Theymake more real the goal of universality  as I know theircontribution will enrich the work of the Organization. Inthe name of my country  I extend to the Governments ofKiribati  Nauru and Tonga the warmest of greetings.Let me  at the outset  pay a tribute to thestewardship of our Secretary-General and acknowledgethe remarkable work of the United Nations — remarkablein terms of what is being done and achieved  at timesagainst extreme and appalling odds.The twentieth century has been marked by violenceand tragedy throughout. Millions have died in countlessconflicts worldwide. Millions more continue to perishfrom poverty and disease.The Secretary-General’s report on the work of theOrganization (A/54/1) is thoughtful and challenging. Ourworld is one of trouble and insecurity. The range andcomplexity of the issues are worrying  in some respectsseemingly overwhelming. Ordinary aspirations are notbeing matched by effective action. Far too many areembroiled in the brutalities of war. Fundamental humanneeds and rights are being denied.I believe we should all pay much more attention tothe reports of the Secretary-General. There is much thereto confirm  and much to test our own perception of eventsand trends: directly  and in my view rightly  theSecretary-General has drawn attention to the place ofsovereignty in the context of our contemporary commoninterest and asks how and by what means we are to defendthat common interest. These questions go to the heart of thematter; the answers to them will define the role of theUnited Nations in the next millennium. There will  ofcourse  be variance in perspectives. The experience of theUnited Nations itself in recent times does not yieldsatisfactory answers.Yet there are challenges that need to be met  seriouslyand urgently. I would agree with the Secretary-General thatit is critical to set clear criteria for international action andintervention. It is the United Nations  with its multilateralsetting  that is best placed to determine such criteria; it isthe United Nations that has been invested with the globalideals to deal with interventions  but  alas  there have beenfailures and there has been inability.We should now look more deeply into the causes ofthose failures and lack of ability and in so doing we mustbalance competing rights and values. The very essence ofthe Organization is thus brought into focus: we need toensure that the United Nations is able to functioneffectively in the new century  that we have a UnitedNations strengthened by commitment and reform. Aboveall  we need to bear in mind the essential connectionbetween peace  development and human rights. We ignoreany one to the fundamental detriment of all  although peaceis the ultimate measure of our common interest  indeed  ofour common future.We think it is time to move to a more definitive phasein the current efforts to reform the Security Council. Theissues are clear  and have been clear for some time: pointsof argument are now being repeated  or repackaged.Substantive changes are required: the current structure doesnot reflect the facts and realities of today; suffers fromimbalance and inequities. Membership of the SecurityCouncil should be enlarged: we have said before that Japandeserves to be a permanent member. Provision for thisshould be made.We appreciate the procedural changes made to theworking of the Council  and we would encourage more ofthem: it would not be desirable to seek to resolve theunfairness of representation in one category without properattention to the other. We share the view that SecurityCouncil reforms must necessarily be comprehensive andmust address all aspects as a whole  including the power ofveto. The veto is a central issue which must be resolved inthe context of the current reforms. We think there is aproven case for the power of veto to be curtailed  andrestricted to Chapter VII matters.Samoa fully supports the ongoing efforts tomodernize and strengthen the Organization. Reformmeasures must provide for the serious and early review ofthe regional groupings. The current arrangements aremore representative of the past than the present. There isa need for reconfiguration to reflect natural geographiesand to ensure equitable representation of subregions.The anomaly of Australia and New Zealand beingcounted outside their geographical area should becorrected. They form a natural part of the South Pacificsubregion of the Asian Group. Samoa adds its voice tothe call made by Fiji and Papua New Guinea during thissession for such regional reconfiguration. The mattershould figure in the reform of the Organization andshould be taken into account in reforming the structureand membership of the Security Council.In the coming year  as we move towards an agreedapproach to the Millennium Assembly  my Governmentbelieves that the world community should focus on majorglobal challenges likely to confront humankind in the nextcentury. We agree with the Secretary-General that alongside war and conflicts  natural disasters are a majorand priority global challenge. Natural disasters remain amost serious threat to human lives and nationaleconomies. As we have seen in recent times  naturaldisasters occur widely and indiscriminately  not stoppingat any border. At this moment  we think especially ofcommunities whose lives and property have been affectedin Greece  Turkey  Taiwan  the United States and theBahamas.The world has experienced three times as many greatnatural disasters in the 1990s as in the 1960s  the year1998 being the hottest year on record and the worst forweather-related natural disasters. Yet we learn withdismay from the Secretary-General’s report thatemergency aid funds have declined by 40 per cent in thepast five years alone. For small island States such as theBahamas  these “once-in-a-century” events are occurringwith alarming frequency and severity. They are trulycalamitous in effect. Hurricane Floyd was the fourth-strongest hurricane measured this century.My own country has not been spared. We can onlybe thankful that our neighbours and traditional friendscome so readily to our assistance at moments of disaster.Our Pacific neighbours  Australia  Japan and NewZealand  continue to be at the forefront of emergency andrehabilitation efforts in disasters affecting our Pacificregion. Countries far from the Pacific  such as those ofthe European Union  have also been generous. Even2developing nations have not been hesitant in coming to ourhelp. In the major disasters that have devastated ourcountry  the People’s Republic of China in particular despite the severe and regular natural disasters it itselfsuffers  has been unstinting in helping our country in thosedifficult times.China last week commemorated the fiftieth anniversaryof the establishment of the Republic. Samoa joins othernations in congratulating the People’s Republic of China inreaching this important milestone in its history.The immediate practical needs are to determine whatpreventive action might be available  especially to the smalland vulnerable. Advanced early-warning systems usingsatellite-derived data and Internet dissemination would beessential  as would be the need to train and improvecapacities. Greater efforts to establish contingency planningand other preparedness measures for disaster-pronecountries are required. In all these  active cooperation at alllevels — national  regional and international — would bevital. Above all  we agree that we should maximize thelessons learned from the experience of the InternationalDecade for Natural Disaster Reduction. It is critical for allcountries  especially the most vulnerable  that this work becontinued.Samoa adds its voice to the expression of outrage atthe violations in East Timor. These are violations ofprinciples and of Government responsibilities  violationsagainst the innocent and defenceless. The real lesson ofEast Timor is that a people’s aspirations for freedom willtriumph in the end. They cannot be suppressed for ever.Indeed  their balloted choice is abundantly clear. It is alsothe lesson of East Timor that the United Nations is bestplaced to safeguard rights and freedoms while ensuringorder and security.We are relieved that the multinational force is now inposition and we appreciate the ready and effective responseof key States  including our South Pacific neighbours Australia and New Zealand. Samoa is especially grateful forthe clear and committed leadership taken by Australia.The violations to which I have referred reinforce theneed for the world community to move as expeditiously aspossible to complete the establishment of the InternationalCriminal Court. Those responsible for these unacceptableacts of violence and crime must be brought to account.Samoa was able to contribute to the making of the RomeStatute. We are firmly committed to the early establishmentof the Court  and we will continue to play a role in thework of the Preparatory Commission. We believe veryfirmly that the Court will provide an essential step in thename of human rights and the rule of law. To this end weshould ensure prompt and widespread ratification of theCourt’s Statute.Speaking now in Samoa's role as Chairman of theAlliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) and on behalf ofthe forty-three members of our Alliance  allow me  MrPresident  to thank you most sincerely for the time andeffort you have devoted to the special session to ensureits success.I also wish to express to all Member States  to theUnited Nations agencies and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations  our very deep appreciationfor their participation in the twenty-second special sessionin the past two days. The AOSIS countries are especiallygrateful for the expressions of commitment  understandingand support.What we have heard provides additional motivationfor us to make the Barbados Programme of Action one ofreal and sustained implementation. There are criticalchallenges that require attention. We are determined toturn those challenges into opportunities. With yoursupport  we believe there is every prospect forachievement."

On behalf of theGovernment of the Republic of Yemen  I congratulateyou on your assumption of this high office. We arecertain that under your distinguished and capable21leadership the work of the General Assembly will becrowned with success.The democratic process in our world today isundergoing real expansion and is receiving the attention ofall nations  whatever their creeds  races or regimes. It isfurther consolidated by being increasingly linked to humanrights  in particular the rights to sustainable development global knowledge  equality  justice  peace and stability.The Republic of Yemen has linked itself in completeunity to the democratic process and has made it acontinuous process towards comprehensive development.Both State and society are tirelessly struggling to makedemocracy in our country a firm and established system evolving daily in order to ultimately form an integralsystem for the conduct of political  social and economiclife.On 23 September 1999  the Republic of Yemen  forthe first time in its history  held free and direct elections forthe presidency of the Republic  reflecting the credibility ofthe country’s political regime and its constitutionalcommitments requiring the holding of direct elections forthe presidency for five-year terms. This is proof thatdemocracy in Yemen has become established as a firmlyrooted principle and a unique and unrestricted option forachieving a peaceful change of government respect forhuman rights  and for enhancing people’s role andparticipation in sustainable development and culturalprogress.Democracy in Yemen appeared in its highest form inthe direct presidential elections  which reflected the freewill of the people and the need for development andstability. The results of the direct secret ballot showedparticipation in all parts of the country by 66 per cent of allregistered voters. The President-elect of the Republic ofYemen for the forthcoming term  Ali Abdullah Saleh obtained 96 per cent of the votes. A new term and a newera will begin on 3 October this year  when the directlyelected President will take the constitutional oath before theYemeni Chamber of Deputies.The wish of the people to achieve democratic progressreflects their need for stability and for an end to states ofemergency in their lives. This goes hand in hand with theirdesire for a future that embodies radical change in theeconomic  social and cultural fields. It also requires seriouspractical action on the part of Governments andinternational and regional organizations to supportdevelopment in emerging democracies  and to supplythem with means of growth and the transfer ofknow-how. Sustainable development would thenaccompany and safeguard democracy  and the linkagebetween development and democracy would be acondition for progress and a motivating force forcooperation and human integration among all nations ofthe world.Sixteen States convened the Forum on EmergingDemocracies in Sana’a  the capital of Yemen  and issuedan important instrument called the Sana’a Declaration with a view to intensifying the concepts  framework andapplications of the democratic process in real life  and toachieving broad popular participation and the affirmationof human rights in those countries.I wish to reaffirm here the announcement ofPresident Ali Abdullah Saleh that the Republic of Yemenwould like to host the International Conference of New orRestored Democracies to be held in Asia in 2003.Our world today is witnessing profound changes thatessentially represent the remnants of the cold war and thatare  at the same time  new harbingers of hope thatforthcoming changes will be in the interest of peace economic progress and development  and that the people political leaders and intellectuals have absorbed thelessons to be derived from ideological and racial conflicts power politics and their tragic clashes. The only way toprepare the way for peace and stability is through thelanguage of dialogue  the rule of law  stable relationshipsand the absence of fear  doubt and uncertainty. Dialoguewill for ever remain the only way to extinguish fires spread the spirit of tolerance and coexistence and promotethe values of cooperation  solidarity and integrationamong all active forces and actors in the cause of peace.The position of the Republic of Yemen regardingworld events consists of our commitment to the principlesof peaceful coexistence  non-interference in the internalaffairs of other States  non-use or threat of force in thesettlement of disputes and peaceful negotiations anddialogue in the settlement of all issues  including borderissues between States on a no-fault basis.As a member of the international family and anactive participant in regional organizations  Yemenunequivocally affirms its sincere desire to contribute tothe maintenance of security and stability in the Arabian22Peninsula  the Gulf  the Red Sea  the Horn of Africa andthe Indian Ocean. The Republic of Yemen calls upon allStates and peoples to continue their sincere and diligentefforts to achieve tangible progress in the ongoing dialoguebetween all parties concerned in these regions. The desiredgoal is to arrive at mutual understanding  balancedrelationships and firm bases for the achievement ofcoexistence and harmony among States and peoples  theconsolidation of peace and the securing of the necessaryconditions for development and cooperation.The Republic of Yemen demonstrated in practice thecredibility of its positions of principle  its respect forinternational law  its wholehearted desire for stability andpeace in the region and its awareness of the importance ofsuch peace for international economic  commercial andmaritime relations. Yemen proved that when it acceptedunconditionally the decision of the arbitration tribunalregarding the sovereignty dispute over the Yemeni island ofGreater Hanish  which lies in the Red Sea between Yemenand the neighbouring State of Eritrea  thereby furnishing aprime example of how peaceful solutions to differences anddisputes between States can be achieved by internationalarbitration.We hope that the island-related dispute between theUnited Arab Emirates and the Islamic Republic of Iran willbe settled peacefully in accordance with internationallyrecognized principles and rules relating to the settlement ofsuch disputes  and in keeping with the desire to achievepeace  stability  development and cooperation in our region.In accordance with these firm premises and guidelines the Republic of Yemen will remain faithful to the principleof the rejection of violence and the combating of terrorismin all its forms  whatever its motives and sources  andregardless of whether it involves individuals  groups orStates. Our country is combating this phenomenon with allits might. It believes that terrorism has become a worldwidephenomenon meriting investigation at the international leveland the creation of integrated mechanisms and rules tocontain it and to counter its effects  with a view toultimately eliminating it.The Assembly might agree with me that there is nowan urgent need to review the policy of imposinginternational embargoes and sanctions. Experience hasdemonstrated their ineffectiveness in achieving the goalsand purposes for which they were adopted and thetremendous harm they have visited upon people  notpolitical regimes  especially the middle and lower strata ofthe population and vulnerable social sectors such aschildren  women and the elderly.The situation in Iraq attests to this. The need for atotal and final lifting of the sanctions imposed on theLibyan Arab Jamahiriya has also become self-evident after recent developments and the Libyan leadership’scompliance with the Security Council resolutionsconcerning the Lockerbie affair. We also call for thelifting of the sanctions imposed on the Sudan  which iscurrently holding an internal democratic dialogue for theachievement of unity and national concord.Wars and clashes result only in human tragedies  inthe form of displacement  imprisonment  forcibledetention and flight from war zones in search of refugeand safe havens. In this context  my country emphasizesthe need to deal in a humane and civilized manner withthe question of prisoners  the missing and those who areforced into hiding as a result of wars  conflicts andclashes of all kinds.In this regard  we have great hope that the issue ofKuwaiti and other prisoners will meet with a humane andobjective solution that will help to create an atmosphereconducive to reconciliation and to the achievement ofharmony  peace and stability in the region.It is known that societies that host refugees fleeingfrom areas of war and oppression bear heavy burdens andsustain tragic consequences  and that their peoples faceserious environmental and health hazards. Those societiesalso face considerable economic and financial hardshipsas a result of hosting refugees. It is indeed regrettable thatthe humanitarian work done for refugees by certaincountries should have disastrous  tragic results for thosecountries. This is what is happening today in the Republicof Yemen as a result of the steadily increasing dailyinflux of refugees from the Horn of Africa  which isablaze with regional and civil wars and local dissension.The Republic of Yemen calls upon the internationalcommunity to assume its responsibility with regard to thishumanitarian issue  which weighs heavily on the YemeniState and society  by increased efforts on the part of theOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner forRefugees and a more concerted international allianceamong all donor countries able to provide emergency andlong-term assistance. Allowing the persistence of suchinhumane phenomena and conditions reflects a tragicdeterioration in human rights and an alarming regressionin the values of civilized nations. We undoubtedly need23to develop mechanisms and devise the necessary means forcoping with such situations. This is the very essence andsubstance of the work of the United Nations.At the same time  we wish to emphasize that the timehas come for renewed solidarity and efforts on the part ofthe United Nations  the international community and allparties concerned with a view to finding practical solutionsto the situation in Somalia that will help restore the unityand territorial integrity of Somalia and bring security andstability to the region.The peoples of the world seek a peace that is based onjustice  equality  respect for human rights and the absenceof tyranny  abuse and double standards. Accordingly  theRepublic of Yemen  which has supported and given itsblessing to the efforts towards a peaceful settlement in theMiddle East  believes that a comprehensive  just and lastingpeace must be based on the restoration of all legitimaterights to the Palestinian people  first and foremost of whichis its right to establish its independent State on its nationalsoil  with Jerusalem as its capital  and likewise therestoration of Israeli-occupied territories to the Syrian andthe Lebanese peoples.At a time when we are positively and with renewedoptimism discussing the peace process in the region  Israelmust realize that a just  comprehensive and lasting peaceis a genuine goal for the people of the area. Furthermore it is a regional  international humanitarian goal that willhelp open a new page in the life and relations betweenpeoples and help end the tragedies of the past. It willhopefully assist in overcoming all rancour and grudges andin providing opportunities for tolerance between creeds cultures and races. All this would constitute a genuinestarting point for stability  trust and mutual understandingamong the States and peoples of the region.As we approach the end of the second millennium  weare confronted with a reality exemplified in the increasedspeed and movement of political  economic and socialvariables  whose ramifications and relationship with othercontrasting factors are becoming increasingly morecomplex  in terms of time and space.We are all therefore called upon to cooperate and torespond responsibly for the creation of a healthy climate forthe building of a new world order based on justice  freedomof choice  tolerance and genuine partnership in allgovernmental and non-governmental activities at theregional and international levels. The ultimate goal is topermanently ensure a balance of interests and a sense ofinvolvement in all that is humane and noble and  inconcrete terms  in a productive and useful life for allmankind.Since one of our primary goals is the reform of theUnited Nations and  in particular  the Security Counciland the international institutions  we are giving this goalour full attention and support. At the same time  wecommend the Secretary-General for the initiatives andmeasures he has taken towards the goal of reforming theUnited Nations  its mechanisms and its methods of work which would broaden democratic practices and achievetransparency of work and effectiveness of participation.In this context  we reaffirm our welcome andsupport for the Open-ended Working Group establishedfor this purpose. We call for the continuation and earlycompletion of its work  taking into full account theimportance of a full understanding of the essentialvariables in international relations in recent years.I reiterate my esteem for the President of theAssembly  and I thank all those participating in thecurrent session. May peace and God’s mercy and blessingbe upon you."
"179",7581,"ZAF",54,1999,"On behalf of our Government andin my capacity as Chair of the Non-Aligned Movement  Iwish to extend our sincere congratulations to you Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab  on your election as President of theGeneral Assembly. I would also like to thank you for thekind remarks you made about my country as you assumedyour high position.We have worked together for many decades. Thanksin good measure to your statespersonship  as neighbours welive together in peace and have joined hands as equals toensure the all-round fulfilment of both our peoples. Theseexperiences convince us that you will discharge yourresponsibilities as President of the General Assembly in amanner that will help humanity make our common world abetter place for all. We are pleased that you will beworking with the Secretary-General  Kofi Annan  who hasdemonstrated unquestionable commitment to the realizationof the attainment of the goals of the Organization.The Charter of this Organization and the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights provide all of us with thevision towards which we should strive. At the time thesedocuments were adopted  they reflected the internationaldetermination to ensure that the catastrophe occasioned bythe rise of fascism and Nazism should never recur. Werecall them today because we believe that the time hascome for determined measures to be taken to ensure thatthey inform what happens in the common world we allshare. The central message they contain is expressed in thewords of the preamble to the Declaration:“the peoples of the United Nations have in the Charterreaffirmed their faith in fundamental human rights  inthe dignity and worth of the human person and in theequal rights of men and women and have determinedto promote social progress and better standards oflife in larger freedom”.We believe that the time has come for all of us toensure that we work together to reconstruct human societyin a manner consistent with this perspective. We furtherbelieve that what we have said constitutes a particular andhistoric challenge to those who occupy positions ofpolitical leadership in the modern era  those who  like us will have the privilege of addressing this GeneralAssembly. Only time will tell whether we have the moraland intellectual courage to rise to this challenge.But this we feel we can say: that conditions exist inthe world today for us successfully to pursue the visioncontained in the United Nations documents to which Ihave referred. What may be in short supply is the courageof the politicians  as opposed to an abundance of good-sounding rhetoric. What are these conditions of which wespeak? The cold war has come to an end. There is nosign anywhere of an ideology-driven contest amongsuper-Powers which dictates that each should seek todestroy the other in order to protect itself. It is true thata number of countries still possess weapons of massdestruction  especially nuclear weapons  which constitutea threat. The only logical way to address this isvigorously to sue for universal disarmament and thedestruction of such weapons.Secondly  I believe it would be correct to say thatthe overwhelming majority of countries in the world haveopted for democratic forms of government. Havinglearned from their own experiences  the nations haveturned their backs on dictatorship. Of course  we cannotsay that such dictatorships do not exist or that no attemptwill be made in the future to establish them. But we canmake bold to say that these exceptions prove the rule rather than disprove the proposition we are trying toadvance.The combination of these two factors should lead tothree conclusions  at least. The first is that there should beno need on the part of any country to seek to establishspheres of influence as a supposed necessary condition forthe advancement of its national interests.Secondly  the very sustenance of democracy acrossthe globe requires that in every democratic country theordinary people should feel that they actually do enjoy theright to determine their destiny. In other words  nocountry should be required to restrict its exercise of this8right simply because some other more powerful countrydictates that this should be so.Thirdly  these circumstances create the possibility fora more democratic system of international governance  aswould be reflected by a correct restructuring of this veryOrganization. In any case  the process of globalizationnecessarily redefines the concept and the practice ofnational sovereignty. The frontiers of that sovereignty arebeing pushed back  especially as regards the smallercountries of the world  such as our own. As this happens inevitably  so does it become necessary that a compensatorymovement take place towards the reinforcement of theimpact of these countries on the system of globalgovernance through the democratization of the system ofinternational relations.The developments we have spoken of also suggest thatperhaps  and depending on what we all do  humanity hasnever had as bright a prospect for durable world peace andsecurity as it does today. The mere spread of democracythroughout the world speaks of a greater commitmentamong the nations to the resolution of national andinternational conflicts by peaceful means.I am certain that when President Abdelaziz Bouteflika the current Chairperson of the Organization of AfricanUnity (OAU)  addresses the Assembly  he will report on theimportant decision recently taken at the Algiers summit ofthe OAU to exclude from its ranks  with effect from thenext summit  all military regimes that may still exist on theAfrican continent. A further decision was taken to assistsuch countries resolutely to move towards a democraticsystem of government.The developments on which we have commentedwould suggest that the Organization has a responsibility tofocus especially on the objective contained in Article I paragraph 1  of its Charter  which says “to take effective collective measures for theprevention and removal of threats to the peace ... andto bring about by peaceful means  and in conformitywith the principles of justice and international law adjustment or settlement of international disputes orsituations which might lead to a breach of the peace”.This  we believe  imposes a solemn and supremeresponsibility on the United Nations to work for theprevention of conflicts and to endeavour to resolve them sothat a durable peace can be established. Sometimes  ourresponse to conflicts has been to wait for them to developinto violence  and even wars  and subsequently tointervene through costly peacekeeping operations. These at times  serve to freeze those conflicts  perpetuatepolarization and make their timely resolution moredifficult.Moreover  the requirement on the United Nations tomake such interventions to prevent the outbreak ofhostilities imposes an obligation on the United Nationsthat it should be seen by Governments and peoples as atruly even-handed interlocutor and peacemaker. It canattain this only if it works genuinely to“develop friendly relations among nations based onrespect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples” as stated in Article I  paragraph 2  of its Charter.If indeed we are seriously committed to these criticalobjectives of peace and democracy in the world  then wehave no excuse to permit the further postponement of themeaningful restructuring of the United Nations. If wewere honest with ourselves  we would admit that what isblocking progress is the desire to accommodate what areperceived as new power relations  to reinstitutionalizerelations of inequality within the United Nations in anamended form. This is based on the thesis that theinstitutionalization of such relations has precedence overthe Organization’s founding principle of respect for theprinciple of equal rights among the nations.In the situation of the cold war and the prevalenceof dictatorship in many countries  the politics of powermight have been seen as the only path to survival. Themanagement of the world today through the exercise ofsuch power  however modified  will itself subvert theobjectives of democracy and peace  spawning pretendersto the throne at global  continental and regional levels.Simultaneously as the United Nations focuses on thecritical question of the prevention of conflict  so must itattend to such issues as the elimination of weapons ofmass destruction  the implementation of the ban on anti-personnel mines  the removal of mines in those countrieswhich face this problem and the control of theproliferation of small arms. Of course  none of theseproposals gainsay the need for the United Nations to actwith all necessary vigour to help end all existing conflictsof which it is seized  including those in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo  Angola  Western Sahara  EastTimor  Eritrea and Ethiopia  Kosovo and others.9We started off with a quotation from the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights  which speaks of affirmingthe dignity and worth of the human person  the promotionof social progress and securing a better life for all. Weargued that conditions exist for movement towards therealization of the objectives spelt out in the Declaration. Itis a matter of common cause among all of us that the levelsof poverty  ignorance and disease that continue to afflictbillions around the globe constitute a direct denial of thedignity and worth of the human person to which we havecommitted ourselves. I am certain that we would also agreethat the process of globalization has also been accompaniedby growing inequality within and among countries. Wehave also seen how movements of short-term capital haveproduced disastrous economic consequences in somecountries.As with the challenges of peace and democracy  it isour firm belief that sufficient resources exist within theworld economy actually to address the social progress andthe better life for all for which the Universal Declaration ofHuman Rights calls. Further to this  science and technologycontinue to develop in such a way that it is difficult tobelieve that  taken together with the large concentrations ofcapital that characterize the world economy  the means donot exist within human society to make the required impacton poverty  ignorance and disease. Indeed  it can be arguedquite rationally that international peace  democracy andprosperity are a necessary condition for the further rapidgrowth of the world economy  and with it the furtherexpansion of the corporations  both small and big  whichrequire global markets.Similarly  the revolution in information andcommunication technology  a critical driver of the processof globalization  both enables and calls for higher levels ofeducation and standards of living among the billions whoconstitute the human population. However  it is clear thatthere is no automatic or inherent mechanism within theoperation of the markets to enable both capital andtechnology to make the sort of impact we are talking abouton all countries of the globe. When we say this we shouldnot be taken to mean that we are contemptuous of all thathas been said about what each country needs to do to createthe conditions conducive to investment and technologytransfers. Nor should it be taken to mean that we arereopening the debate about the role of markets in theallocation of resources. What we are saying is that thefunctioning of the markets does not and cannot excludeconscious interventions being made  both to increaseeconomic opportunities and to raise the standards of livingand the life possibilities of many in the world denied theirhuman dignity by the scourge of poverty.In his interesting book Living on Thin Air  theBritish author Charles Leadbeater  writes:“The new (knowledge driven) economy needs amobilizing vision and institutions fashioned to makeit real. Bit by bit  our institutions are changingthrough reform  reorganisation and restructuring —but the process is much too slow  haphazard andpiecemeal — it must become more conscious imaginative and radical.”Once more  the matter turns on the will of thepolitical leaders actually to discover among themselvesthe moral and intellectual courage to do what is correctand necessary. What is correct and necessary also requiresthat in this field as well  which affects socio-economicmatters  we should review the functioning of allmultilateral institutions  including those that belong withinthe United Nations family. This should be done to ensurethat these too reflect the very necessary imperative of thedemocratization of the international system of governance.The United Nations documents to which we referredearlier give us a starting point. Accordingly  we believethat there is no need for anyone among us to rediscovera new vision that would inform our actions to build a newworld which affirms the dignity and worth of the humanperson. What is necessary is that we match the beliefs weprofess with the necessary action.We speak of action that will practically address therelated issues of peace  democracy and development.I am certain that such a practical programme ofaction would meet the aspirations not only of themembers of the Organization of African Unity and theNon-Aligned Movement  of which we are a member. Itwould also respond to the most deep-seated feelings ofthe peoples of the developed North  who can have nointerest in conflict  oppression and poverty  even if theseoccur beyond the borders of their own countries.It also goes without saying that the democraticsystems in which we operate would also require that through committed advocacy  we should secure thesupport of the electors for what should be a programmeof action of the United Nations for the twenty-firstcentury.10The evolution of human society has presented theworld leaders who will stand at this rostrum with newpossibilities to move our globe a giant step forward towardsa new actuality  of which the poor and the powerless dreamevery day. We will be betraying those millions if we do notact to turn their dream into reality. Let future generationsnot say that because of the force of inertia we failed to act."
"180",7624,"ZMB",54,1999,"I join other speakers who havealready addressed the Assembly  Sir  in congratulatingyou on your well-deserved election as President of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-fourth session. Yourunanimous election is a clear demonstration of theconfidence this Assembly has in you and in your country Namibia  with which my country enjoys very friendly andwarm relations. It is especially significant that you comefrom Namibia  a country whose independence stands asa crowning moment in our Organization’s support for theright of peoples under colonial and foreign domination toself-determination and independence. I am confident that given your experience and diplomatic skills  you willguide the work of this session successfully.I wish to take this opportunity to commend yourpredecessor  His Excellency Mr. Didier Opertti ofUruguay  for the able manner in which he presided overthe fifty-third session.In the same vein  I would like to place on record mycountry’s deepest appreciation of the work of theSecretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan whose leadership is well respected and has given newimpetus to the implementation of the United Nationsreform programme.19As you rightly observed in your statement to thisAssembly  Sir  the fifty-fourth session is the last to beconvened in the twentieth century  a century that saw thecreation of the United Nations from the ashes and ravagesof the Second World War. Indeed  the world cannot butthank the founding fathers of our Organization for theirforesight and wisdom. The relevance of this Organizationhas continued to grow since its inception  and is todayexemplified by the universality of its membership  whichhas grown from the original 51 States in 1945 to thepresent 188 States.It goes without saying that since the membership ofthe United Nations has been growing  there should havebeen a continuous and corresponding process of reform ofthe decision-making structures and processes of theOrganization in order to make the world body asrepresentative as possible. It is a matter of considerabledisappointment  however  that while reform of theadministrative structures has  to a large degree  beenaccomplished  reform of the Security Council has notmoved in tandem.As members are all aware  the creation of the UnitedNations was intended to strengthen international peace andsecurity. Regrettably  a number of States continue to bethreatened in our time by the dangerous proliferation ofsmall arms and light weapons acquired by non-state entities.The continued proliferation and illegal transfer of smallarms  among other factors  are responsible for the supply ofthe weapons being used in conflict situations across theAfrican continent. I would therefore like to appeal to allMember States to support and strengthen the UnitedNations monitoring mechanisms on the transfer of thesearms  particularly to non-state entities  in order to forestallthis problem.Related to the problem of small arms is the questionof landmines planted in large tracts of land in manycountries  rendering unusable what otherwise is productiveland. The impact of landmines has also had a telling toll onthe provision of social services in the affected countries. Iequally appeal to Member States  parties to the UnitedNations Convention on the Prohibition of the Use Stockpiling  Production and Transfer of Anti-personnelMines and on Their Destruction  to implement the MaputoDeclaration and programme of action  adopted in May thisyear. Only a strong and viable United Nations canconstitute the much-needed viable vehicle to achieve thisgoal.My delegation is therefore deeply concerned aboutthe continued deterioration of the financial situation of theUnited Nations. This situation is well known to all of usin this Assembly  as it has been the focus of ourdiscussions for the past five years. Reform of the UnitedNations will not be implemented effectively if thefinancial situation is not seriously addressed. It is theinescapable duty of all of us to honour our obligations byensuring that we pay our assessed contributions in full  ontime and without conditions. This will enable theOrganization to function smoothly and more effectively toexecute the mandate we have entrusted to it.That among many other reasons is why we want tobuild strong economies in Africa to enable us shoulderour obligations. But external debt remains both a burdenand a major impediment to the development process ofmany developing countries  including my country Zambia. While we welcome the recent outcome of theGroup of Eight meeting held in Cologne  Germany  onthe Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt (HIPC)Initiative  the measures for faster  broader and deeper debtrelief  in our view  will not be sufficient to resolve theexternal debt problem of developing countries  especiallythe poorest among them  unless they are translated intoreal tangible  practical economic developmentprogrammes.It is the view of my Government that the Group ofEight target for debt relief of about $100 billion for thepoorest countries in the world  the majority of which arein Africa  will have little effect on the problem unless theterms of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries DebtInitiative are further revised in such a way as to makethem more flexible and better tailored to suit the specificconditions of the targeted countries.Many of us in the developing countries understandthat  in order to survive and contribute positively in theglobal markets  we need to make our economies morecompetitive. In this regard  many of our countries haveembarked on the implementation of structural adjustmentprogrammes. Our efforts are  however  hampered by thehuge debt burden which takes away large amounts ofresources from our countries through debt servicing. Thedeclining levels of official development assistance andforeign direct investment to our countries  combined withthe debt burden  have made economic reforms difficultand have slowed down the pace of economic growth anddevelopment.20The solution to this is for all concerned to approachthe question of debt with open minds  with a view tofinding a lasting solution to the problem.Added to that problem is the spread of HIV/AIDS.This is a matter of grave concern to my country and toAfrica as a whole. This disease has continued to overwhelmthe continent and to rob it of its meagre material andfinancial resources through devastation of its youthful andactive population. It is therefore necessary for all humanityto rise to regard HIV/AIDS as a global problem and to actin unison. I therefore call upon the international communityto redouble its efforts in fighting this scourge. Let me takethis opportunity to report to this body that last week  from12 to 16 September 1999  Zambia hosted the eleventhInternational Conference on AIDS and SexuallyTransmitted Diseases in Africa. The holding of thatConference  which adopted a programme of action to fightthe spread of this deadly disease in Africa in the twenty-first century  is among other things a demonstration of theAfrican continent’s commitment to fight against this deadlydisease. It is my hope that the United Nations will thereforeembrace the outcome of the Conference and provide thenecessary leadership in the fight against this pandemic which threatens the very survival of humankind. The AIDSproblem deserves our collective moral and political will tocombat it successfully.Let me now turn to the phenomenon of the conflictswhich have continued to bedevil Africa. In our ownSouthern African subregion  the conflicts in Angola and theDemocratic Republic of the Congo are not only a threat topeace and security but have also been a major impedimentto the economic development of the region.The resumption of hostilities in Angola in December1998  after four years of relative peace following thesigning of the Lusaka Protocol  is regrettable. As theAssembly is aware  this unfortunate state of affairs wasoccasioned by the intransigence of UNITA with regard tothe implementation of the remaining tasks under the LusakaProtocol. Every effort should therefore be made to bring anend to the hostilities.With regard to the Democratic Republic of Congo  theAssembly will recall that on 2 August 1998 a conflicterupted in that country. In response to this seriousdevelopment  a series of efforts by regional heads of Stateand the Organization of African Unity (OAU) wereimmediately undertaken in search of a peaceful solution tothe conflict. At the summit held at Victoria Falls Zimbabwe  from 7 to 8 September 1998  the regional headsof State mandated me to chair the regional mediationeffort  with the assistance of OAU.For a period of almost a year  I have  on behalf ofour region  carried out exhaustive consultations inside andoutside Zambia  and convened a number of meetings atthe level of experts and Foreign Affairs and DefenceMinisters.Let me state here that  right from the outset  regionalleaders acknowledged the need to involve the Congoleserebel movement in the mediation process to ensure thatthe outcome would be respected by and acceptable to all.The process initially engaged the rebel movement througha proximity mechanism. Later  however  the rebels  whonow included the Movement for the Liberation of theCongo (MLC)  were invited to participate directly in thepeace talks with all the other parties to the conflict.On 10 July 1999  our perseverance on the regionaland Pan-African levels finally paid off when heads ofState of all the six States parties to the conflict signed theCeasefire Agreement in Lusaka. Unfortunately  a split inthe Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD) the previousMay led to differences over who should sign theAgreement on behalf of the movement  which preventedthem from appending their signature on that occasion.The other non-State party to the conflict  the MLC  alsochose not to sign the Agreement until the differenceswithin the RCD were resolved.In order to secure the signatures of the RCD and theMLC  I was mandated by the regional heads of State tocarry out further consultations with the two movements.I am pleased to inform the Assembly that these effortsculminated in the signing of the Ceasefire Agreement bythe MLC and the RCD on 1 August and 31 August 1999respectively.Allow me at this juncture to place on record mysincere appreciation for the cooperation and assistance Ireceived from all my colleagues in the region and otherAfrican leaders  the United Nations  OAU and theSouthern African Development Community (SADC) inthe execution of my mandate. The Ceasefire Agreementis an all-embracing document which addresses all aspectsof the conflict  including the security concerns of all thecountries neighbouring the Democratic Republic of theCongo.I wish to inform the Assembly that theimplementation process of the Agreement has already21begun in earnest. Both the Political Committee and theJoint Military Commission met on 2 and 3 September 1999in Lusaka with the participation of all members except theMLC  whose representatives were not able to travel toLusaka because of logistical constraints.Among the issues considered by the meetings were:first  the formal installation of the Chairman of theCommission  Brigadier-General Rachid Lallali  fromAlgeria; the budget of the Joint Military Commission; itsstructures; and its programme of work.The representative of OAU briefed the meetings onOAU activities in support of the peace process in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  and the United Nationsrepresentative briefed them on the relationship that isexpected to prevail between the United Nations and theJoint Military Commission. The Commission is scheduledto meet again on 10 October 1999.For peace to prevail in the Democratic Republic ofCongo  United Nations support for the successful andcomprehensive implementation of the Ceasefire Agreementis of paramount importance. For this reason  I wish tocommend the Secretary-General for his timely and positiveresponse in sending a team of military liaison personnel tothe region. The United Nations must move moreexpeditiously than it has in the past if the job it does is tobe commensurate with the tasks facing it in the field.To this end  I make an earnest appeal to the UnitedNations that the Organization  first  should authorize andsupport the deployment of a United Nations peacekeepingforce in the Democratic Republic of the Congo with anappropriate mandate and  on an appropriate scale  based onthe assessed needs on the ground; second  it should quicklydispatch the technical survey team to the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo in addition to the team of militaryliaison personnel which has already been sent to thatcountry and some of its neighbours; third  it should makeavailable adequate resources for the peacekeeping mission;fourth  it should extend necessary and adequate support tofacilitate the process of internal dialogue within theDemocratic Republic of the Congo; fifth  it should help inthe mobilization of humanitarian assistance for theCongolese refugees and internally displaced persons andfacilitate their return and resettlement; and sixth  it shouldassist with resources for the economic reconstruction of theDemocratic Republic of the Congo.I need not remind the Assembly of the solemn andimportant responsibility that the United Nations bears onbehalf of us all in the maintenance of international peaceand security. It is  therefore  incumbent upon it to ensurethat peace prevails in the Democratic Republic of theCongo. To this end  it should learn from the lessons ofthe past and avoid costly mistakes.Time is of the essence. What is equally of theessence is the need to address the root causes of thepoverty confronting third world countries. The worldcommunity must tackle those root causes with speed andurgency.This session of the General Assembly is meetingagainst a backdrop of growing tensions and armedconflicts  especially in the third world. Thesedevelopments  coming towards the close of the twentiethcentury  are an indictment of the world’s globalstructures  which pose today  more than at any other timein history  a challenge to the very articles of faith uponwhich this organization was founded. The challengescannot be wished away  nor can they be remedied byempty words. Global poverty can be eradicated only witha concerted global programme. Solving the issue ofpoverty would solve the problem of conflict andinstability in the developing countries  and unless theworld addresses these underlying causes of conflict  theywill continue to be major sources of friction that willthreaten and undermine international peace and security.Events in the Democratic Republic of Congo  inKosovo and now in East Timor cannot but exert morepressure on the time and resources of the internationalcommunity in general and particularly on the SecurityCouncil. But this is the mission of that world body: toattend to just such areas of conflict. Admittedly  these arethe most perilous times Africa has ever faced. Themultiple dangers of armed conflict and general politicalinstability and the ever-growing danger posed by theHIV/AIDS pandemic can only call for concerted jointworld efforts to help reduce the dangers that face Africaand the world in general.There are various ways the world can come to theaid of Africa  the most important of which are throughaid and by creating conditions to make it possible forAfrica to trade with the international community on termsacceptable to all. Africa is not asking for charity. No Africa is asking for genuine trade. Africa is not asking forarms. No  Africa is asking for fair and equitablerecompense for its labour and resources. Africa is notasking for pity  but genuine partnership based on mutualinterests.22The relationship between poverty and politicalinstability can no longer be in any way doubted. It is notgood enough for the developed world to demand goodgovernance — an indefinable term — while creatingconditions of poverty by bad governance in the economicarea. Justice must prevail in our economic relations in orderto lay the foundation for political and social justice.A start should now be made by reviewing theinequitable conditions imposed by the World TradeOrganization  which  if maintained  will only ensurecontinued marginalization of third world countries condemning them to poverty and further instability.I am quite aware that this forum may not be theappropriate one for addressing these issues  but it definitelyhas the right people to address the issues I have raised.Therefore  my fervent prayer and hope is that we enter thenew millennium with a renewed sense of unity of purposeto eradicate manifest global injustices and create a moreequitable world where want will not create chaos andinstability."
"181",7659,"ZWE",54,1999,"Mr. President  I wish to expressmy warm congratulations to you upon your election to thepresidency of this fifty-fourth session of the UnitedNations General Assembly. Your unanimous election tothe presidency is not only an attestation to the confidencewe in Africa have in your leadership ability  but is alsoan affirmation of the faith the international communityhas in you to steer this organ successfully into the twenty-first century. You take up the helm of this body at acritical juncture  when we are here taking stock of wherewe stand on the eve of the new millennium.Let me avail myself of this opportunity to expressour sincere gratitude to your predecessor  His ExcellencyMinister Didier Opertti of Uruguay  who presided overthe affairs of this Assembly in a diligent and exemplarymanner. We thank him for his conscientious efforts andsterling contribution.May I also express our great appreciation of theSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  who  havingrecognized the great opportunities and challenges aheadof us  has worked tirelessly to help us map a noble visionfor the future of our Organization.6We are also witnessing another historic moment forour Organization  as we admit into our midst three newmembers: Nauru  Kiribati and Tonga. We welcome them toour brotherhood of nations and wish them all the best asthey chart their own destinies and make their contributionwithin our community of nations.On our African continent  the holding of free and fairelections in Nigeria has ushered in a democraticdispensation worthy of our attention. This transformationserves as a monument erected to inform the internationalcommunity that Africa has said ""No"" to theinstitutionalization of the route map from barracks to theState House  which hitherto the military has traversed withimpunity. Further  the return to peace and democracy inLiberia and Sierra Leone bears ample testimony to Africa’srenewed quest for democracy  peace and stability. It is therefore  our fervent hope that the implementation of thesepeace agreements will lead to the restoration of normalityin the region.In the same spirit  the Southern African DevelopmentCommunity (SADC) alliance intervened in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo to uphold one of the mostfundamental tenets of the United Nations Charter: respectfor the principle of sovereignty and territorial integrity.Aggression  under whatever pretext  should be condemnedand opposed by the United Nations. We are  therefore encouraged by the eventual participation of the rebels in thepeace process.We wish to register our most sincere gratitude to HisExcellency President Chiluba of Zambia for his untiringefforts that succeeded in bringing the rebels on board thispeace process. It must be emphasized  though  that thesuccess or failure of a peacekeeping mission to theDemocratic Republic of the Congo will be determined bythe availability of both human and material resources. Weare  however  worried that an inadequately fundedDemocratic Republic of the Congo peacekeeping operationwould be a clear manifestation of Africa’s increasingmarginalization in the new world order. We trust  therefore that the United Nations will now render the requisitesupport to sustain this achievement.We find this an opportune moment to call upon theinternational community not only to put its full weightbehind African peace initiatives  but also to assess andbuttress the institutional and operational capacity of theOrganization of African Unity (OAU) in the prevention management and resolution of conflicts in Africa. In thisvein  we hail the European Union’s declaration that itsfuture engagement with the belligerents involved in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo conflict would dependon the latter’s fulfilment of their obligations as spelt outin the Lusaka ceasefire agreement.Sadly  the gains that we registered in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo peace process are being negatedby the renewed bloodbath in Angola  where  for thesecond time this decade  UNITA has resumed war disregarding the 1994 Lusaka Peace Agreement. Wetherefore call upon the international community to put inplace effective mechanisms that tighten the embargoagainst UNITA  particularly in the light of the recentlyconcluded mission of Ambassador Robert Fowler Chairman of the Security Council sanctions committee onUNITA.Zimbabwe hails the acceptance by Eritrea andEthiopia of the OAU Framework Agreement to end thewar in the Horn of Africa. Zimbabwe  as a member of thehigh-level committee that coordinated the effort to end thewar between the two African States  calls upon the UnitedNations to undergird this successful regional peaceinitiative with the necessary technical and other resourcesto make the process irreversible and permanent.Since its inception the United Nations has had on itsagenda a concern for economic and social development.The follow-up to the implementation of the goals of theWorld Summit for Social Development is currently beingassessed  and it has become evident that a potentiallyexplosive social situation confronts the world today. Thesoaring levels of unemployment  the deterioratingstandards of living  the abject poverty in mostdeveloping countries  especially on our continent  Africa are cause for serious concern.We note that Africa’s fortunes have continued toworsen despite the continent’s best efforts. Growthslowed in the majority of African countries and  at 2.6 percent in 1998  average gross domestic product for all ofAfrica fell far short of the eight per cent annual growthrate envisioned by the World Bank as the level capable ofsignificantly reducing poverty levels on the continent.Adverse factors that contribute to this decline includeslower growth of the world economy  decliningcommodity prices  the contagious effects of the Asianfinancial crisis  the El Niño weather pattern  civil strifeand political turmoil in several spots.At a time when greater challenges and opportunitiesare emerging within the context of globalization  it is7crucial that Africa’s nagging vulnerabilities are highlightedand addressed. Total African export revenues fell by nearly$14 billion in 1998  to just $112 billion  an 11 per centdrop from the 1997 level  mainly due to price declines.That negative trend has continued in 1999.We are concerned that at a time when prospects foraid effectiveness in Africa are improving significantly official development assistance to Africa has fallen to itslowest level. Between 1993 and 1997  total aid receipts inAfrica fell by nearly 13 per cent  from $21 billion to $18.7billion. At this rate  official development assistance flowshave fallen far short of the $30 billion a year thateconomists estimate is needed to reduce poverty in Africa.The net rate of return on investment in Africancountries remains higher than in other developing countries.It was estimated at 20 to 30 per cent during 1990 to 1994 on average  as opposed to 16 to 18 per cent for alldeveloping countries. Yet in contrast to this great potential Africa has not been a significant beneficiary of the dramaticincrease in global foreign direct investment flows.Africa’s debt is essentially non-payable and certainlyunsustainable under any sensible growth-orientedmacroeconomic scenario. There is an urgent need to releasemore resources from debt servicing to financingdevelopment and creating conditions that encourage inflowsof private foreign investment. Although the HeavilyIndebted Poor Countries Debt (HIPC) Initiative constitutesan important mechanism for debt relief  its eligibilitycriteria are rather restrictive. While the need for better debtmanagement by Africa in the future is acknowledged  anycredible solution to Africa’s debt problem must indeedentail substantial debt cancellation.We in Africa are therefore fully persuaded that it istime the international community deliberates on thesubstance and prospects for new aid modalities whichemphasize a holistic and comprehensive approach. There isneed for us to share views on how best to foster a newdonor-beneficiary relationship in which multi-donorprogrammes focus on supporting an African-driven agenda.In our own region of southern Africa  we are at anadvanced stage of setting up a trade protocol meant tomaximize our earnings from trade. With a majority of ourmembers having ratified this protocol  only a couple moreremain before it is operational.We are also keenly aware of the critical role oftelecommunications as an effective vehicle for successfulinternational trade. Accordingly  my country only recentlyagreed to be a subregional host for the AFRITEL  anAfrican regional telecommunications centre. We trust thatinternational investors will see this as positivepreparedness on the part of our continent not only toattract them and their investments  but indeed toconcretely ensure that they also prosper in theirendeavours on our continent.The United Nations decade for the progressivedevelopment and codification of international law iscoming to a close on an important note  with theestablishment of the International Criminal Court.However  the Court can be successful only if it isuniversally accepted. We must  therefore  lend ourunwavering support to this process so that we cancomplete this important milestone in the history of ourOrganization.As we look into the new millennium  let us aspire tohave an international order that espouses the twinobjectives of universal peace and security on the onehand  and an improved quality of life for all the earth’sinhabitants on the other. It must be an order characterizedby justice and respect for international law. Suchinternational law must surely have the effect of restrainingboth regional and international belligerent countries. Weshould join enthusiastically in the promotion of theachievements of the decade for the development ofinternational law.Zimbabwe is greatly disturbed at the cataclysmicturn of events in East Timor following the self-determination referendum there. The crisis chronicled inthe report of the Security Council Mission to Jakarta andDili was most disquieting. Zimbabwe therefore welcomesthe deployment of the multinational force to restore peaceand security in East Timor and to facilitate the delivery ofhumanitarian assistance. We sincerely hope that theSecurity Council will soon authorize the deployment of aUnited Nations peacekeeping force whose financial andother resource requirements are vouched for by the entiremembership of this Organization.It would be remiss of me not to mention howinequitable it is that the membership of the SecurityCouncil should remain unreflective of the vastly alteredinternational circumstances. The need for the reform ofthe Security Council is no longer just a lofty ideal westrive to achieve  but a prerequisite for the very existenceof this Organization. The Security Council  as a principalorgan of the United Nations  is entrusted to act on behalf8of the entire membership  which to date has risen to 188countries. The stark realities of the situation in the worldmust be reflected not only in the sheer increase in numbers but also in consideration of the democratic principle ofequitable geographical representation and participation.It is grossly unjust that we  the developing countries should remain totally unrepresented in the permanentmembership of a body entrusted with such power andauthority. The powers and privileges that the currentmembers of the Security Council enjoy should be extendedto all new members if the Council is to be effective.And so  as we hold the last session of the GeneralAssembly in the current millennium  it behooves us tomake one giant leap into the future  not only in terms ofwise and bold decisions  but also in terms of thecommitment to implement them and see them bear fruit forus and for posterity."
